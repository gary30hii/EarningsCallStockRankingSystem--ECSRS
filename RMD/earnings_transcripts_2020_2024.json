At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Cheryl. Good afternoon, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to ResMed's fourth quarter fiscal year 2020 earnings call. Thanks for joining us. The call is being webcast live and the replay along with a copy of the earnings press release and our updated investor presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate Web site later today. Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results are CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett Sandercock. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. During today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please review the notes to today's earnings press release and earnings presentation. As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. With that, I'd like to go ahead and now turn the call over to Mick.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our stakeholders for joining us today. During this global pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus, and COVID-19, the disease state that leads to, I hope that you, your family, and your friends remain safe and healthy during these times. Way back in early January, a ResMed employee, a ResMedian in Hubei Province, China, put on a hazmat suit and help set up ventilators to provide the gift of breath to many thousands of people turned out in that city, while their immune systems fought against the first global cases of COVID-19 that ResMed saw in Wuhan. Since that time, seven months ago, our global team has provided vital support globally to combat this coronavirus. Not just across China, but across Asia, then across Europe, across North America, and now we're just starting to prepare and to -- actually we're in the midst of continuing that battle in Latin America, in Sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of the Middle East and Asia that still have that what we call the peak impact ahead of them in terms of hospitalizations and ventilator needs. So, I noted in our call, 90 days ago, our Q3 call that we would do more to support the global community and local healthcare systems with ventilators and ventilation mask systems across the 140 countries that we serve. During Q4, during this June quarter, we produced around 100,000 invasive and non-invasive ventilators, including bi-level positive pressure ventilators. That brings our cumulative total to over 150,000 ventilators that we produced since the beginning of calendar year 2020. So, we've delivered on our promise to triple our production, and in fact, if you take the period from January 1 to June 30 for 2020, that is a 3.5x increase over the period for 2019, so 3.5x. For our flagship ventilator, which is the Astral life-support ventilator, we reached a peak of over five times our weekly production rates during the period, and we're still running at full capacity for the Astral to ensure that ResMed is there for what we call preservation of life as the coronavirus continues to move around the globe. I'm particularly proud of the role that our supply chain, our manufacturing, our distribution, and our tech services teams have played during this coronavirus crisis, making sure that ResMed device and a complete ventilation system was there at the bedside when someone needed help breathing as their immune system fights against COVID-19. So, looking forward, we have built a sophisticated set of analytic capabilities including an epidemiology patient model that has helped us model the impacts of both the headwinds and the tailwinds that are part of this COVID-19 crisis, and we have detailed scenarios of the impacts by city, by region, by country, and by ResMed business line. Through that analysis, I'm happy to say that we're confident in our ResMed ability to execute across the full range of potential scenarios for all of our customers and for all of our global businesses. The tailwinds for ventilation in the March quarter and the June quarter from both the ventilator devices and the ventilation mask systems are starting to recede, and while we are still working on current and future contracts with hospitals, as well as city and national health authorities for these ventilators, the volumes will be significantly lower in the September quarter for these ventilators. At the same time, the headwinds we experienced especially in the June quarter for our sleep apnea and COPD patient flow and patient diagnosis are also receding. So, people are starting to return for their primary care physician visits, they're starting to return for their specialist physician visits, and we see the system today growing from its nadir during the last period as we now see city-by-city and country-by-country the markets are coming back online. So, over the portfolio of 140 countries that we serve, we expect a gradual sequential quarter-to-quarter U-shaped recovery of patient flow to primary care physician, sleep physicians, as well as pulmonary physicians that are treating COPD and asthma throughout fiscal year 2021. We expect the expansion of home sleep apnea testing to continue as it did during the crisis, we think it will continue post the crisis, and we also expect a steady sort of sequential increase in sleep lab activity and visits to the pulmonary specialists both in person and through Telehealth, which has been expanding rapidly under COVID. Additionally, some very early research into the post-COVID clinical world shows that select patients who have recovered from COVID-19 may have lung damage, and some of them may require long-term ventilator support. This is an additional area of focus for us, but I have to say, it's very early days in that area. In my prepared remarks today, I will provide some insights into our Q4 and our full fiscal year 2020 business performance. I'll also recap our long-term strategy, our ResMed 2025 strategy, and some execution highlights against some of our key operating priorities as part of that strategy. Finally, I'll discuss how we're advancing and learning in a post-COVID peak world, including how this pandemic has accelerated three important trends; one, the importance of respiratory medicine; two, the importance of digital health; and three, the importance of outside hospital healthcare. These are three key elements of our ResMed 2025 strategies that were in play well before the global pandemic, but these are three trends that have accelerated during this pandemic, and we think the momentum will continue in a post-COVID world. So, for our business performance, we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth for the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year 2020. We had year-on-year annual 15% top line revenue growth to $3 billion in annual revenue for ResMed. Our results reflect strong growth and positive momentum across our innovative MedTech portfolio and our market-leading digital health software solutions. We have grown our global market footprint finding new patients in the midst of a global pandemic, and we have driven growth with recurring revenue from our installed base of sleep apnea patients. While our financial results in March and June have benefited from high demand for ventilation devices and lower operating costs, our underlying core business of sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma remains strong and well-positioned for long-term growth. During fiscal year 2020, we generated $802 million of cash that allowed us to return $225 million of cash dividends to you, our shareholders, while also investing in our future with a double-digit increase in R&D, including clinical research, both digital and in-person, as well as design and digital innovation across our sleep apnea, COPD, asthma, and our software-as-a-service businesses. We have a full pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium and long-term growth opportunities with an industry-leading intellectual property portfolio of over 6,000 patents and designs. Importantly, we have also seen significant growth in our digital health ecosystem. We now have over 6.5 billion nights of sleep and respiratory medical data in the Air Solutions platform. We have grown connectivity to our digital health ecosystem by over 26% this fiscal year, and we now have over 12 million, 100% Cloud connectable medical devices in the market, and we have around 14 million patients enrolled in the AirView software solution. Our digital health ecosystem is a competitive advantage for ResMed that offers innovative solutions, as well as integrated care to drive superior outcomes, better patient experiences, and lower healthcare system costs. Our acquisition and continued investment and development of the Propeller platform, has been a digital health accelerant for ResMed. Our recently-announced commercial partnership with Novartis, which I will describe in more detail later during the call, is a great example of this progress with Propeller. During the last 12 months, we have improved 16 million lives by providing a person with a device or complete mask system to help them breathe. Importantly, the ability to help these patients on their individual journey to better sleep and better breathing is powered by over 6.5 billion nights of medical data in our ecosystem. These data form a significant competitive advantage as they enable us to perform sophisticated analytics, and drive actionable insights to benefit all their customer groups, including the patients, most importantly, but also in improving workflows for physicians, for providers, for payers, and for full healthcare systems. Fundamentally, we believe the future of healthcare delivery is outside the hospital. That's where ResMed competes today, and that's where we win today. Globally, there are 936 million people with sleep apnea. There are over 380 million people, who suffer from COPD, and there are over 340 million people living with asthma, they all need our help. And they all want that help at home, definitely not in a hospital. Our SaaS business is 100% focused on out-of-hospital care le2veraging the global trend for seniors to age in place, we think this trend will accelerate in a post-COVID world. ResMed can provide seamless care for our portfolio of out of hospital care settings, including home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, senior living, life plan communities, home health, hospice, as well as home care services. COVID-19 has accelerated the rapid adoption of digital health technologies, the recognition of the value of remote monitoring, virtual diagnosis and the evolution of global reimbursement models in the field of digital health. This acceleration of digital health adoption represents a significant medium to long-term tailwind for our business. These three trends, the increased importance of respiratory medicine, the increased importance of digital health, and the increased importance of out of hospital health care, will help ResMed achieve our goal to improve 250 million lives by 2025. So, on to our operating priorities, we have three operating priorities that guide our daily focus here at ResMed, number one is to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses across global markets. With over 1.6 billion people across these three chronic disease states, we know that delivering our innovative solutions to these under penetrated markets is actually a number one priority; and number two priority is to design, develop and deliver world leading medical devices as well as digital health technology solutions to better engage physicians, providers and payers as well as patients, so that we can improve clinical outcomes so we can reduce costs, and we can enhance the patient experience; and number three priority is to innovate and grow the world's best seamless software solutions for care that is delivered outside the hospital. We think ResMed is uniquely positioned to deliver on these three priorities. So, I'll quickly walk through some examples of innovation in each of these priorities, and then will hand over to Brett and go to Q&A. In our core market of sleep apnea, we launched what we call the ResMed MaskSelector into our U.S. geography. The ResMed MaskSelector is a digital health technology to make remote patient mask selection and sizing both easier and more effective, helping the patient themselves receive the care they need from home. We think that this is the digital solution to help our HME medical equipment or HME customers in their challenge to find the right mask for each patient when they can't physically touch them due to physical distancing during COVID-19. We are providing this solution at no charge during the coronavirus public health emergency. However, we think this technology's efficiency and benefits for both providers and patients will last well beyond the pandemic. Digital tools like this as well as capabilities including video support for doctors and their patients, as well as remote mask patient fittings have seen good application during COVID-19 combined without mask resupply solutions, including SnapWorx, [Oracle], [ph] and Brightree ReSupply. We have delivered solid mass growth. In terms of new patient flow, the COVID lockdowns have had a significant impact on our business. We saw double-digit declines in new sleep apnea patient flow across all markets that experienced lockdowns, individual cities, regions and countries had unique approaches to any lockdown and reopening processes. For instance, today in Germany, we stand at more than 85% of pre-COVID sleep lab capacity already up and running, whereas in China, the other end of the spectrum, we stand at 50% of pre-COVID diagnostic capacity in that geography; most of the other 140 countries that we sell into around the world fall somewhere between those two extremes. In big countries like the U.S., it's a story of 50 states with unique models, again as a spectrum between these boundary conditions. The average in the United States is probably somewhere in that 70% of diagnostic capability, but some states will be closer to the 60% range, and some will be closer to the 75% range. As I stated earlier, we expect a steady sequential quarter-by-quarter sort of U-shaped recovery of the sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma patient flow throughout fiscal 2021. Clearly, a highly effective vaccine or a highly efficacious treatment for COVID-19 could of course turn that U-shaped into a dramatic V-shaped recovery. However, we're not counting on that and an event like that remains upside from what we call our expected or likely case scenario. In terms of execution in our second key disease, state of COPD and our ventilation solutions for COPD, and other lung conditions, we launched our cloud-based remote monitoring software called AirView for our ventilator solution in Europe, including the Astral product, the Stellar ventilator, and the Lumis ventilator. Through AirView, clinicians and care providers can now remotely monitor their patient's respiratory rate, as well as their blood oxygen saturation. These are two critical indicators for a respiratory patient's condition. We accelerate the delivery of this technology for clear and urgent needs during the pandemic. However, this enhanced AirView capability providing insights across European ventilation patient populations will provide differentiation for ResMed through the clinical value for positions and better outcome for patients in perpetuity. In terms of execution in our third key disease state of asthma ResMed has partnered with Novartis to co-package the Propeller solution and digital platform with the new triple action asthma medication in a brand called Enerzair Breezhaler. This novel combination has been cleared by the European Commission for launch. The Propeller sensor attaches to the new inhaler from Novartis, and its new medication, where it can collect medication usage data. The app works both as an adherence measure that gives the patient reminders to take the medication, but also as a means of collecting information about the patient's medical condition to help their physician provide even better care to the patient. This is a breakthrough innovation as it is the first time a respiratory medicine has been co-packaged with a digital health platform and co-prescribed. The benefits of this combination are tremendous for the patient. It's a simple and convenient way to have a fully integrated experience to allow them to better live with their chronic disease to better live with asthma, with no incremental cost to the patient. This brand-new approval is a new to the world technology that will accelerate the adoption of digital health in the respiratory medicine space, and will help us identify other innovative opportunities to combine our Propeller tech with medicine delivery. This new Novartis partnership follows our announcement in May that the Propeller sensor and an apps gained 510(k) U.S. 510(k) clearance for use with the Symbicort inhaler for both asthma and COPD patients from AstraZeneca. This sensor is built to fit various inhalers and the generic equivalents. Propeller's cloud-based system tracks medication usage of the Symbicort from these inhalers through a smartphone app, which patients can use to paint a clearer picture of their disease control for their clinicians. These new partnerships with both Novartis and AstraZeneca, and previously-announced collaborations with Ryan, as well as Boehringer Ingelheim expand the potential reach of Propeller's technology to around 90% of inhaled medicines for both asthma and COPD in the United States. We believe that this represents a significant upside opportunity for the expansion of the Propeller platform in the U.S. market, but also around the world as the benefits of digital health grow and move around the world. So, before I transition to details of our software-as-a-service business, I'd like to recap briefly why the SAAS business is integral to ResMed's long-term strategy to provide seamless transitions between hospital care and post acute care, or as we call it here at ResMed out-of-hospital care, because we don't think you have to go to hospital to get good care outside the hospital. Our vision is to enable a system where a patient's health data moves with him as they transition care settings, giving providers the information they need to deliver personalized care and saving the person and the caregiver both time and money. We are focused on leveraging our competitive advantage as the only long-term strategic player with solutions that span across these seven important out-of-hospital, healthcare verticals. Home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, senior living, life plan communities, home health, hospice, as well as home care services. During the quarter, our software-as-a-service business grew 7% compared to the year ago period. We are integrating and optimizing the out-of-hospital SAAS portfolio to support long-term growth. We continue to believe that the long-term weighted average growth of these SAAS verticals that we're in is in the high single digits. The COVID-19 market impact has particularly affected the skilled nursing facility census levels and that vertical that we serve. We believe this impact will continue over the next several quarters, moving the weighted average market growth of these verticals to the mid single digit range for our SAAS businesses for that period with return to high single digits as we start to see other analogous things such as elective surgeries and hospital discharges return to their normal rates at which time we believe that that market's weighted average market growth rate will return to the high single digits. Our goal here at ResMed is always to not just meet, but to beat that market growth through delivery of superior market leading solutions. Turning to more details of our SAAS business performance during the quarter, we've been pleased with the early impact of SnapWorx Technology, which we acquired in February. As we discussed on our last earnings call, SnapWorx provides patient contact management and workflow optimization for sleep apnea resupply for our HME customers. The timing of this acquisition couldn't have been better with COVID-19. Our HME customers have been increasingly focused on resupply and better tech to interact with patients in a no touch non-contact world. The combination of SnapWorx as well as Oracle, and Brightree ReSupply, and all of these three technologies are under our Brightree brand, they provide the strongest suite of resupply solutions available in the market period. This technology is important to our customers to their patients as well as to our internal SAAS business and our core sleep apnea business, driving both patient engagement and better outcomes as well as revenue growth. In October 2019, we announced that ResMed entered into an agreement with Cerner Corporation to help clinicians make more informed treatment decisions, control costs, and deliver seamless care across healthcare systems. We have now integrated our Brightree branded home health and hospice platform with the Cerner Electronic Health Record, or EHR. This partnership is performing above our expectations for both Cerner and for ResMed and we anticipate opportunities to deepen and expand this collaboration as we continue to work together. In summary, the SaaS portfolio is performing well and reminds an important driver of our digital transformation of healthcare in settings outside the hospital. The COVID headwinds in the near-term will recede, and we will continue to invest now and in the future in research and development, to make sure ResMed has the best solutions for long-term growth and market leadership. The future healthcare delivery is outside the hospital. COVID-19 has accelerated that, and we here at ResMed are well positioned to capitalize on. Our diversified solution portfolio and capabilities are related against the compelling and expanding market opportunity in sleep apnea, COPD, asthma, and out-of-hospital SaaS. Through the first seven months of this COVID-19 crisis and this calendar year, we've maintained strong growth through our effective execution, our right to innovation, our recurring revenue businesses, as well as margin expansion driven by our global operating excellence programs. While we look forward to moving COVID-19 into the rearview mirror, there are beneficial trends, it has accelerated, which are now passing more over their actually persistent and we believe impactful. The importance of respiratory medicine, the importance of digital health and the importance of healthcare delivered outside the hospital. Those three trends just go accelerated and they're here to stay. While these macro trends have increased Telehealth and increased remote patient monitoring represent short, medium, and long-term benefits the ResMed's business. More importantly, they represent tailwinds for significant improvement on the most critical patient metrics, improving clinical outcomes for the patient's chronic disease and enhancing levels of patient satisfaction for that ultimate customer. The person who just wants to sleep better, breath better, and live with a better quality of life. So before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to express my personal gratitude to the 7,500, ResMedians around the world. In an unprecedented fiscal year, you have remained focused on creating value in our core markets and honoring commitments to patients through COVID-19, you helped us pivot and produce 150,000 lifesaving ventilators to help people breathe in 140 countries worldwide. Without our team, our current and future success would not be possible. So thank you to you to all of you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we'll open up for Q&A. Brett, over to you.\nBrett Sandercock: All right. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, we will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, and some remarks on our Q1 FY '21, outlook. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the June quarter was $770 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 10%, compared to the prior year quarter. Revenues for the fourth quarter were favorably impacted by significant sales of ventilated devices and accessories, partially offset by declines in our sleep business. We estimated the incremental net revenue benefit from COVID-19 related impacts within the order of $20 million. Reflecting estimated incremental ventilator and related accessory revenue of $125 million partially offset by an estimated $105 million impact on our sleep revenue, relative to our pre-COVID forecasts. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business. Our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries were $401 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia, and other markets, total $278 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter and an increase of 22% in constant currency terms. Byproduct segment U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $206 million, an increase of 1% over the prior quarter. Mask and other sales were $195 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter. In Europe, Asia, and other markets device sales total $206 million, an increase of 32% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, a 35% increase. Mask and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $73 million, a decrease of 8% over the prior quarter or in constant currency terms, a 6% decrease. Globally in currency terms device sale increased by 16% while mask and other sales increased by 3% over prior year quarter. Software as a Service revenue for the fourth quarter was $91 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis SaaS revenue increased by 6%. During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjusted impacted amortization of acquired intangibles the purchase accounting, fair value adjustments and matrixcare deferred revenue, restructuring expenses and litigation settlement expenses. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings, press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin increased by 60 basis points to 59.9% in the June quarter, compared to 59.3% in the same quarter last year, the increase is predominantly attributable to favorable product mix partially offset by increased costs in logistics, component parts and manufacturing. These cost increases largely reflect the impact of COVID-19 in our rapid ramp up and ventilator production. In particular, we incurred significantly higher inbound and outbound air freight costs during the quarter, reflecting both higher volumes and significantly higher rates. We are rebalancing air freight and sea freight volumes, but in the meantime, we expect to see elevated freight costs continue into Q1 FY '21. Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter were $165 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter. We're in constant currency terms SG&A expenses were consistent with the prior year. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 21.5%, compared to the 24.3%, we reported in the prior quarter benefiting from cost management and reduce travel as we work through the uncertain COVID-19 environment. Looking forward, we expect SG&A expenses to increase in the low single digits relative to the year ago period. R&D expenses for the quarter were $53 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 4%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue with 6.8%, compared to 7.3% in the prior year. We continue to prioritize investments in innovation, because we believe our long-term commitment to technology and product development will deliver sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses to continue to grow in the high single-digits to low double-digits, reflecting, our commitment to innovation through the economic cycles. Total amortization of acquired intangibles is $20 million for the quarter, a decrease of 14% over the prior quarter, reflecting historical intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the quarter. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $16 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $243 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong top line growth, expansion of gross margin, and well managed operating expenses. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 16.2%, while on a non-GAAP basis our effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.8%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 will be in the range of 17% to 19%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $193 million, an increase of 40% over the prior quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.33, an increase of 40% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.22. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $330 million reflecting robust underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $18 million. Depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $39 million. During the quarter, WE also paid dividends of $56 million. We recorded equity losses of $6 million in our income statement in the June quarter associated with a fairly joint venture. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $15 million for the full fiscal year 2021 associated with the joint venture operations. We ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $463 million, having generated $330 million in operating cash flow during the fourth quarter and $802 million during our fiscal year 2020. At June 30, we had $1.2 billion in gross debt and $717 million in net debt. Our debt levels remain modest in the June 30, we had just under $1.1 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remained strong. However, I also want to highlight that in these times of uncertainty, we are maintaining a disciplined approach, and we are currently managing expenses cash flow, and liquidity. Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, reflecting the board's confidence and our strong liquidity position and operating performance. Finally, to recap on Q4 results, our earnings this quarter were very strong reflecting significant demand for ventilators, underpinning revenue growth and expansion in our gross margin and lower operating expenses. Turning now to our first quarter of FY 2021 outlook, at a high level, we expect to see continued demand for ventilators but at a significantly lower level compared to Q4 FY 2020. Additionally, we expect to see continued headwinds for sleep device sales in Q1 in response to the temporary reduction in the diagnosis of new patients. Mask and accessories have continued to demonstrate resilience over the past three months which reflects the insulating value of the large patient installed base. Consistent with these remarks for the first month of Q1 FY 2021, we recorded group revenue growth in the low single digits. However, like many other companies, we're experiencing pervasive uncertainty in the current environment. As a result, our forecast and possible future revenue outcomes remain dynamic. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to the Q&A portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone to please limit yourself to one question and if you have follow-ups or additional questions, please feel free to return to the call queue. Cheryl, we're now ready to start the Q&A portion.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Saul Hadassin of UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSaul Hadassin: Thank you. Good morning, Mick. Good morning, Brett. Just a question for me; Mick, just some color around the rest of the world growth rate, the disparity between device sales at a very strong 35% benchmark at negative 6%, can you just talk to ventilation and how that impacted there and whether there was anything else to read into that mask growth rate, please?\nMick Farrell: Yes. So, thanks for the question, and yes, clearly now Europe -- you know, that is Europe, Asia, and rest of world, so it's the whole world apart from the U.S., Canada, and Latin America, clearly incredibly strong year-on-year growth in the devices side primarily driven on the upside by the ventilator sales, and so, these were, you know, we've had talked about contracts with national governments in the U.K., France, Germany for ventilator sales that were delivered during that June quarter and others around Asia and rest of world. So, that's been the sort of this tailwind if you like from COVID-19, and the headwinds, there were pretty dramatic shutdowns that we saw certainly in Western Europe and most parts of Southeast Asia, including China, which is still at 50% of its fleet capacity today, and that severely slowed down first time set up of patients, but in those geographies, the sort of resupply technology that I talked about in the prepared remarks like SnapWorx, [Oracle] [ph], and Brightree ReSupply, those are all U.S. based technologies, and we really haven't put those technology into play in those European markets. There's an opportunity to do that in the future, but they are not there and they don't have the same resiliency around those mask sales. So, that sort of it's almost like a tale of two markets, if you like, on the devices versus masks during that Q4 for Europe, Asia, and rest of world.\nSaul Hadassin: All right, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Andrew Goodsall of MST Marquee. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrew Goodsall: Thanks very much for taking my question. Just trying to understand the sequencing, I guess across the next few quarters, just as you sort of see the decline in vents and your regular CPAP business returning. I know you've talked to us, but just any sort of metrics, I know where you -- anything around production or anything like that, that might give us a bit of a sense of sort of how that's going to sequence over the next few quarters?\nMick Farrell: Yes, Andrew, this is a question that macroeconomics around the world are working on in every industry, when are we going to see as these lockdowns turn to openings and every city, every country, that we're operating in has different metrics on how fast they're opening and where they're opening. Some never closed, like Sweden. Some are opening really well like Germany, and some are going to second size shutdowns like China. And so, the best we can see as we model it, and we've got a lot of scenarios for the next fiscal year, but the best we can see is across that portfolio of 140 countries we see a sequential sort of U-shaped recovery where we start with Q1, and then we build up to Q2, Q3, Q4 through the fiscal year, as we start to see these reopening happen. We're going to expect second waves and third waves and fourth waves and the sort of W's within a particular city or particular state, but across the country level and certainly at the 140 country portfolio level, we expect that to be a U-shaped recovery, in our likely case throughout the fiscal year, and so, it all sort of turn to a world where we look at sequential growth from Q1 to Q2, and then from Q2 to Q3, and Q3 to Q4, and that's how we're sort of modeling the recovery of our sleep apnea, our COPD, and our asthma patient flow, and therefore that part of our business. There will be resiliency in the mask resupply, particularly in the U.S. geography and some other buffers that we have around our SaaS business, but that's sort of how we're looking at it on a macro basis.\nAndrew Goodsall: Would you expect to return to normal by FY'22 or close to normal?\nMick Farrell: Again, Andrew, I would be a great macro economist working for a large multinational bank to make a prediction like this, and they're often wrong when they make those predictions. I think it's very difficult to say when exactly we will be back to the pre-COVID times. I did see a presentation from a global bank economist, who talked about 12 months, 24 months return to normal type period; very difficult to know. Health care, we're more resilient, people as opposed to going to retail to get a new automobile, or a new sound system, or a new home repair, they are going to their primary care physicians and their elective surgeries much quicker, and you can look on those two metrics which are pretty well-published in the major geographies, so PCP visits, GP visits, and for elective surgeries and hospital visits, and we're starting to see those metrics tick-up on a week-to-week basis. And so, the other types of analogs that we're watching and looking at, and then all the other parts come into play. Obviously, there's the upside as I talked about in the prep remarks, if there's an effective vaccine or an effective treatments to COVID-19, all bets are off, this goes to the V-shaped recovery in the markets as they get vaccinal treatment, but we've got a likely expected case of a U throughout the fiscal year, and then get back to that normal in that sort of 12 to 24-month time period.\nAndrew Goodsall: Fantastic. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question is from Malgorzata Kaczor of William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. This is actually Brandon on for Margaret. I just wanted to go back to the vents really quick. You'd mentioned that you manufactured another 100,000 vents that can be used within the hospital. Have you sold most of these, or any of these, and is this kind of a similar situation with the prior 50,000 that they are maybe lined up for contracts already that could be recognized in the next quarter? And I'm just -- part of that is just trying to understand where vent demand is going to end-up especially since you had mentioned that Astral is still being made at full capacity, but you're expecting a steep drop-off in the next quarter. Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Yes, Brandon, thanks for the question. Yes, certainly we're very proud of the 150,000 ventilators that we made during the first-half of the calendar year; the second-half of our fiscal year. As you know that's a very small percentage of compared to the sleep apnea devices, which are more in the sort of 2, 2.5 million on an annualized basis devices that we make across the CPAPs, IPAPs and the sleep apnea bi-levels, but look, we did obviously sell as we talked about, and Brett talked about in his remarks, we had an extra $35 million of sales in the March quarter at Q3 from ventilator, ventilator masks, and we had an extra $125 million in ventilator and ventilator mask sales in the fourth quarter, and we're not going to predict exactly what that will be here in the September quarter. We're working on hospitals, state and national bidding processes but I can tell you that the volume of bidding and the volume of processes in the sort of expected likely case of that is significantly lower here in the September quarter for that, so that that demand has gone down a lot. I mean, it's ironic in some ways, because the populations of the regions that are now impacted Brazil, India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia, you add up these countries and you start to get to the billions of people, I would like to see demand significantly higher, because I think humanitarian wise, we're going to need more ventilators. We have the production ready, and we are working on contracts where they're there, but we can't sell to someone who won't buy, and so as best we can see, there's going to be a pretty significant drop-off here in the September quarter on the ventilators, but at the same time, that means that the economies are opening up on the other side for our fleet business and we start to get that sequential growth back along those lines. Brett, maybe you want to add some more color on that?\nBrett Sandercock: Yes, the only thing I would add, Mick is there would be consistent with last quarter, there is a portion of that production that remains in inventory at June 30. So that's certainly the case. Well, as Mick said, Astral is still producing still fairly tight, and I think we will continue to do that next little while.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Deakin-Bell of Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJohn Deakin-Bell: Good morning. Thank you. My question was just trying to understand again, just the shape of recovery perhaps look at Europe and the macro wise it looks like some of the European countries have started to recover a little earlier than the U.S. Have you seen anything that could guide you to have the U.S. come out of this in Germany or France or any other countries you have been doing business?\nMick Farrell: Yes, John, it's a great question, and actually, we are looking at Germany as sort of a model of not only how to have dealt with the crisis, that country did a really good job of preparing early, they got their ventilator orders in early and they had, they never reached peak capacity in any of the major regions, cities or hospitals, and now as I recover, as I said in the prepared remarks, they north of 85% of the sleep lab capacity, they were behind the COVID Germany on home sleep apnea testing, but it really, they sort of had a leap forward on that, and I think that will move from, it was maybe 5% or 10% of diagnoses in Germany pre-COVID. I think that'll move to a solid double-digit number post-COVID, but Germany is a great model for the recovery, and it's a country right next door there in France had excellent home sleep apnea testing pre-COVID and so I think the recovery will be quite swift in France as well. You can almost look, you're asking for the analogy to the United States. Take those two countries as different regions within the U.S., Germany could be analogous to some of the states in the U.S. like mostly in the Midwest, where there's a lot of sleep apnea tests done in a sleep apnea lab and I think that will take a longer time to get to capacity just because of all the restrictions around COVID the deep cleaning and just people's psychology about turning up to a sleep lab and staying overnight versus some states, maybe like California or Massachusetts or Florida where home sleep apnea testing was more prevalent. Those not only had less of a dip during the crisis because they're able to move their patient flow to home sleep apnea test, we think they may recover faster in the patient volumes in those areas, and so, we certainly are looking at those analogs, and certainly we're sharing a learning internally here at ResMed from our Germany team, the CEO of Germany, Katrin Pucknat, she's a member of my Global CEO Operations team. So her best practices of what they're doing there brought to the global team and Jim Hollingshead and the team on the sleep and respiratory care side, and then driving that through our U.S. market with our great commercial team we have here in the U.S. and beyond, and so I'm quite confident that we're going to see a sequential quarter-to-quarter recovery throughout the fiscal year. I think we've reached the idea here in Q4 of a flow of patients globally and within our major geographies. And we're going to pick those up every quarter as we go through, I do think there's going to be second, or first waves impacting Latin America and Africa and so on. And I do hope that we're able to secure some good ventilator sales into there for now, because that will need them on a humanitarian basis, but then they will recover a little later in those geographies, but I'm pretty comfortable of our plan, likely case scenario of a steady sequential recovery, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 throughout the fiscal year, assuming no vaccine, no treatment, if those happen, it could be a significant one where you start talking about year-on-year numbers again, versus quarter-on-quarter numbers.\nJohn Deakin-Bell: Great color. Thanks, Mick.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Bailey of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDavid Bailey: Great, thanks very much. Good morning, Mick. Good morning, Brett. Just had a question in relation to the U.S. in particular on that commentary around sleep lab capacity, sort of talking to about 70% at the moment, I'm just interested in where you think that might have got to on an average basis over the year, over the June quarter, and then, perhaps any commentary might be I'll provide over that the staging over the quarter in that, you know, it was April the trough, and then improving towards June, just any commentary you can provide there would be would be appreciated?\nMick Farrell: Yes, David, it's a really good question, and we actually have some good information around that because we have both, you know the sort of digital end-to-end play on the sleep apnea market where we have apnea link air, which is cloud connected, honestly, that we are testing, all the way through to the obviously the air solutions platform with the air sense devices that are 100% cloud connectable as well, so we see activation rights on that weekly basis, and you picked it, we have seen during the quarter sort of that idea in that sort of late April, early May timeframe, and that we've started to see weekly increases from that idea. You see to the public data around primary care physician visits, and elective surgeries are picking up, and we also see, and without quantifying because that's sort of pretty proprietary data for ResMed, I can certainly say qualitatively to question that offer that idea in, you know, late April, early May, we have seen week-to-week increases on enhanced sleep apnea tests, but also in the activation really importantly as the market leader in market share for sleep apnea devices we're seeing activations increased from that idea point on a weekly basis and so, and we have our geography and you can see all these effects like did this or that city did that, you can see, little W shapes in some of those that have the aggregate, we're seeing that sort of steady U-shaped recovery, even in down to that granular level during the quarter and that's what gives us the confidence as we project forward into a lot of uncertainty in COVID times, 52 weeks seems like a lot of uncertainty that we think there will be that steady across the portfolio steady U-shaped recovery, but I think that's the most color I can provide you there, David.\nDavid Bailey: Thanks, Mick.\nOperator: Your next question is from David Low of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDavid Low: Thanks very much, Mick, if I could keep on the same topic. I mean, you're talking about a U-shaped recovery, just to be really clear and simple here. We're at the bottom of that U, so effectively the first couple of quarters you'd expect, pretty low growth, not so dissimilar to what Brett talked about in terms of the low single-digit growth you're saying in July. Is that what you're saying?\nMick Farrell: Yes, exactly, David, that's exactly how I interpret the sort of classic U. So, thank you for clarifying that.\nDavid Low: Great, thanks.\nMick Farrell: You can have a question as well if you like.\nDavid Low: Thanks, Mick. I never want to ask you. I get in so much trouble, but I will pick you up on that. The decline that you saw in CPAP or in devices you talked about a double-digit decline. I think we had that yesterday talk about a 30% drop in new patient setup, so just wondering if I could get you or draw you little bit on sort of what level of decline you think.\nMick Farrell: Yes. So, look at that company you mentioned is particularly a U.S. focused company and so that's a pretty good analog for the double-digit decline that happened in stocks for the U.S. geography that sort of 30%, so 70% before and then picking up from that nadir as an average across the country, it would have been lower in some states that have tighter lockdowns and more sleep lab focused and less than that in some of the more liberally in terms of opening states and, but then when you look across 140 countries, you really got to say, okay, well every country treated this differently, but Germany already being up to 85% of pre-COVID, that dip wasn't that low. I don't think they got below 75%, because they were able to pivot to sleep apnea testing pretty quickly and as you know we've got a grind in that market and have great visibility. China had a very steep drop, the government there was very strict in their lockdown and that went down, very high double-digits, and has now got back up to 50% all pre-COVID towards the end of June. And so, it's almost like and we have, you could model every over 140 countries by region, by city, and then, look at a sort of computational basis of this, but it gives us confidence with that detail the last 180 days of how this has gone to project for the next 360. But yes, look for the U.S., that sort of an idea in the high 60s and maybe an average around the 70% for the quarter, but leaving at rates higher than that is sort of where we're at for that geography.\nDavid Low: Great, thanks very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Hashan De Silva of CLSA. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nHashan De Silva: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to get some color on ventilator pricing over 4Q. How much of a benefit with ventilator pricing over 4Q, and what do you expect the price to do coming into the first quarter?\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Hashan, great question. I'll hand that to Rob Douglas, our COO.\nRob Douglas: Yes, Hashan. We previously told, we actually had a policy of not trying to lift prices around this, mainly because of the whole ethics around it and making sure we were getting the ventilators in the right people's hands at the right prices. And so, we actually kept our pricing very steady through it and did slow some increased logistics cost and things like that that Brett was talking about, and we also make sure we were selling ventilators to people, who needed them immediately and were going to be using them. So we weren't selling it to stockpiles. So you can see we've had a pretty moderate approach to it, and we think it's absolutely the right approach. Obviously, the ventilators are higher price item compared to our fleet devices, and so, there was some sort of mix shift effect in our overall results, but we were very steady and our team was totally committed to making sure that we were looking after patients as a priority.\nHashan De Silva: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Gretel Janu of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nGretel Janu: Thanks. Good morning. Just on the gross margin, just -- I was wondering if you could give a bit more color on the outlook for that going forward. You'll have a lower proportion of ventilators, the negative mix shift, and then with the increased kind of [technical difficulty] actually expect to wake gross margin into the first quarter of '21, just any color you can give on that? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Brett, do you want to take that?\nBrett Sandercock: Sure, Mick. Hi, Gretel. Yes, I mean, you've covered a few of those moving parts in the gross margin and it's probably heightened on certainly at the moment with COVID-19 and where those impacts will end. We are seeing some elevated costs rolling through, and then some of those, I think, on freight will continue for a little while. We are actively trying to mitigate that, but I think -- I mean we would get drawn in specific guidance, but I think you'd have to say -- you'd have to say there's probably not likely that we had, we'd say gross margin expansion in the short-term.\nGretel Janu: Okay, thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question is from Suraj Kalia of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSuraj Kalia: Good afternoon, Mick, Brett. Can you hear me all right?\nMick Farrell: Yes, I've got you loud and clear, Suraj.\nSuraj Kalia: Perfect. So, Mick, I heard the $125 million contribution from ventilator sales in the quarter, forgive me, I was just hopping in between the calls. Can you give us the growth between North America and rest of the world in devices when you split out ventilators? Thank you for taking my question.\nMick Farrell: Suraj, that's a great question, but it gets into a level of detail that we don't want to share for competitive reasons, but look, I can give some color around it, the $125 million in ventilator sales were to the countries that during that last 90 days you [technical difficulty] have seen through the media and other contexts had the biggest impacts from COVID-19. So I think publicly, we've talked about a contract with the U.S. government and FEMA, a $32 million public contract for 2,500 or so Astral devices, and then we had some public contracts with other countries, the U.K. the National Health Service, Germany, France, Japan and Australia. I thought some that I think we've talked about in various media areas, but just given the nature of sort of the competitive dynamics, but then also some of the hospital systems and nations like to choose to publicize to their own populations, those numbers at their own rate. I don't want to go into any further detail on that, but appreciate the question Suraj, and just know that -- one thing that really made us proud is that $125 million of ventilator sales save lives, and there are tens of thousands of people, who wouldn't have been breathing with COVID-19 that were, and if their immune system was able to beat this little protein virus, when it gets in the body, they lived, and we think that was a great benefit for those countries and for those individual people and their families.\nOperator: Your next question is from Steve Wheen of Evans & Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSteve Wheen: Hi, good morning. I just had one clarification, and then my question. The clarification was just with regards to the one month sales figure that Brett mentioned, being in the low single digits. Can you just give us an indication as to how much -- whether that's just pure sleep or whether it includes ventilators? And then my question really -- I wanted to add to this was with regards to competitive bidding, there's been a regard reaction I guess to try and delay the implementation, I just wonder if you had any thoughts or likelihood of that actually happening. Thank you.\nMick Farrell: Great questions, Steve. Brett, if you address the first part on the clarification and then we'll have Dave to talk to competitive bidding.\nBrett Sandercock: Yes, to clarify that that July group -- that's group revenue, Steve, on that. So that -- that's -- that's everything. That's the entire company.\nSteve Wheen: Okay.\nMick Farrell: And with regard to your question on competitive bidding, Steve, I mean, we certainly support a delay. We were very pleased to see that just earlier this week. I believe a letter went over from over 100 members of the House and Senate urging the administration and CMS to delay competitive bidding. We've been working with other industry participants to try to advance that perspective. Obviously, there's a lot going on, and we don't get feedback from them as to whether it's likely or not, so we just have to wait and see with everyone else, but we certainly would support that. Having said that, we'll do what we can to support our customers, whenever competitive bidding does come out, so fingers crossed on that.\nOperator: Your next question is from Anthony Petrone of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAnthony Petrone: Great. Thanks. Maybe just one question as it relates to core sleep between resupply and vents. I'm assuming, the comments are mostly on new patient starts, but maybe just a quick update on resupply. And as we move into an extended first wave, do you expect that there is sort of benefit as we saw early on in the pandemic? And then a quick follow-up on comping would just be the world rule. I know there's a push to delay that as well H.R.2771. So, just an update on where the role in of world rates for comp that exists. Thanks again.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Anthony. I'll have a go at the first part of your question, and then Dave can have a go at the second part. In terms of the numbers I was talking about -- so the double digit declines and then coming up from those nadirs during April, May, June, and then what we expect during the year that was about patient flow, sleep apnea diagnosis, COPD patient diagnosis, and coming through the channel. So directly proportional to if you like, first time setup of a sleep device and first time setup of a mask system. As you know, Anthony, you followed us for a number of years, we've got a very resilient group of patients, who loves their great sleep and loves their great breathing and they are on resupply programs either directly through retail in Australia, Singapore, U.K., or through home care programs in Europe or direct HME programs in the U.S. We saw a very good resupply rates in the March quarter, and as we just talked about, saw a very good resupply rates in the June quarter. We expect those strong resupply rates to continue through September, December and onwards. This is a -- an ongoing resupply rate that that really will be there. Obviously, first time our setups are impacted by those numbers I was talking about in the modeling, but resupply numbers have been not only equal to the year before, but sometimes a little better, and we think the some secular change, they're around the importance of respiratory medicine, the importance of respiratory health, and people just wanting clean masks, clean tubing and clean humidifiers that they -- their insurance will pay for and then they could pay the copay for or out of pocket for themselves people are paying for those. And so, we think that sort of secular change they will be there giving us a pretty resilient resupply throughout fiscal 2021 and beyond. Dave, do you want to have a go at the second part of the question about sleeping?\nDavid Pendarvis: Sure. Thanks, Mick. Thanks for the question, Anthony. So with regard to the bill itself 2771, it remains introduced in the House. It hasn't seen a companion legislation get introduced to the Senate. Obviously, the U.S. government is preoccupied with a lot of other things that are -- they're working on now particularly trying to extend the aid. There probably will be some Medicare relief packages down the road, but we think it's an important shell of the will of Congress and sort of the sense of Congress that there ought to be relief in the rural areas. We were pleased to see that CMS has put a rule forward to advance telemedicine and telehealth reimbursement beyond the pandemic, and so, they're certainly listening to patients and providers and to Congress. We'd hope that they would listen to this and that CMS would be able to enact some relief, and it's always hazardous to predict the U.S. legislation. So, we certainly continue to support it. Many of the same congressional offices that supported 2771 were writing letters that I mentioned earlier about delaying competitive bidding. So, we think that's a strong vote, and we'd certainly continue to support it. We can't really predict what form, if any, relief will ultimately be granted. Thanks.\nAnthony Petrone: Thanks, again.\nOperator: Your next question is from Matthew Mishan of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMatthew Mishan: Hey, thank you for taking the questions. Hey, Mick, congratulations on moving to the next stages for Propeller Health. Can you give us a sense of the commercial model that you settled on, and how should we think about the revenue ramp from here?\nMick Farrell: Yes, Matt, it's a great question, and look, what I'll give is the generic revenue model of how we at Propeller -- through David Van Sickle, who's the CEO of Propeller and his commercial team globally, sort of the revenue models that they follow without giving any obviously details of any particular customer or partner. So, the general revenue models for Propeller are: number one, a development fee, there's often a development fee that we charge partners for the software engineers, who create the codes for the app that works specifically for that customer, that's a relatively monopod of the life cycle revenue, but it's there; and then secondly, we charge for the sense of the hardware that's provided each time that's sort of Propeller Sensor that has the cloud connectivity and then collects the data locally on usage adherence and other parameters; and then thirdly, which is the major part is the per activated user per month part of the revenue that is associated with that account. So then, that's really an alignment of Propeller ResMed's revenue with the pharmaceutical company, but also really importantly with the patient and their actual usage of it, and most importantly for their outcomes that they stay out of hospital longer it reduces total system costs, and so on. So, there's sort of three parts to that revenue, and all of them are in play for all of those customers that we talked about in the prepared remarks, and look, it's early days, this isn't yet material revenue for ResMed in this quarter or next quarter, but as we look over FY '21, FY '22, and certainly as we look to our long-term strategy, our ResMed 2025 strategy, I think this digital health component and this recurring revenue component of medical adherence to COPD and asthma medications is going to be not only material part of our business, but a really exciting one for transforming care across the industry.\nMatthew Mishan: Great. Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Your last question is from Lyanne Harrison of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nLyanne Harrison: Hi, Mick and team. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to get a better understanding of resupply through the June quarter. Can you share what you saw through April, May and June? I guess I'm trying to understand if there was any sort of residual panic buying at the start of the quarter, and what are you experiencing as unemployment rates increase in the United States?\nMick Farrell: Yes, Lyanne, thanks. It's a good question. Resupply was actually pretty steady through the April, May, June rates. We didn't -- year-on-year based on the cycles of where they are in the copay cycle and so on, obviously, there are double-digit unemployment numbers in the U.S. between 10% or 15% depending on the state, but in general, we have seen pretty steady resupply all of masks and accessories for customers, but Rob, do you want to provide any further color for Lyanne around the kinetics there?\nRob Douglas: Yes, sure, Mick. Lyanne, we never really saw a big panic buy issue, or we couldn't triangulate into panic buying very much at all, but there were some other things going on with the resupply programs, the people operating them, and as we saw this as well, the callouts were more likely to find people at home because they're at home, and the response to the existing programs was better, and so, we did see some solid improvement, and that sort of continued, but there's no major sort of up and down dynamic. We think it's just steady, solid progress with patients on long-term treatment need good masks, and we've got the best masks, and the best systems to keep them in treatment, and we expect that to continue through notwithstanding what else happens, given the uncertainties of COVID.\nLyanne Harrison: Great, thank you very much.\nOperator: We are now at the one-hour mark. So, I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Cheryl, and thanks to all of our shareholders for joining us on the call. I'd also like to once again take the opportunity to thank all 7,500 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders, for their dedication and hard work, not just this quarter and this year, but over the years, helping people sleep better, breathe better, and live better lives outside the hospital in 140 countries worldwide. Thanks for all that you do every day. Thanks especially to our ResMed heroes on the frontline, production, distribution, tech service, and those who help in the set-up of our ventilators and ventilation masks during this global crisis. You helped over 150,000 people potentially through those products, and I look forward to thinking you in person when this is all possible post-COVID, and we'll talk to everyone on this call in about 90 days. Thanks a lot.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Mick. Thank you all again for joining us today. If you do have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly or to our general Investor Relations line. As previously mentioned, all the documents along with a transcript and a replay of today's call will be available on our Web site later today. Cheryl, you may now go ahead and close the call.\nOperator: This concludes ResMed's fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "All right. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, we will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, and some remarks on our Q1 FY '21, outlook. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the June quarter was $770 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 10%, compared to the prior year quarter. Revenues for the fourth quarter were favorably impacted by significant sales of ventilated devices and accessories, partially offset by declines in our sleep business. We estimated the incremental net revenue benefit from COVID-19 related impacts within the order of $20 million. Reflecting estimated incremental ventilator and related accessory revenue of $125 million partially offset by an estimated $105 million impact on our sleep revenue, relative to our pre-COVID forecasts. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business. Our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries were $401 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia, and other markets, total $278 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter and an increase of 22% in constant currency terms. Byproduct segment U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $206 million, an increase of 1% over the prior quarter. Mask and other sales were $195 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter. In Europe, Asia, and other markets device sales total $206 million, an increase of 32% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, a 35% increase. Mask and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $73 million, a decrease of 8% over the prior quarter or in constant currency terms, a 6% decrease. Globally in currency terms device sale increased by 16% while mask and other sales increased by 3% over prior year quarter. Software as a Service revenue for the fourth quarter was $91 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis SaaS revenue increased by 6%. During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjusted impacted amortization of acquired intangibles the purchase accounting, fair value adjustments and matrixcare deferred revenue, restructuring expenses and litigation settlement expenses. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings, press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin increased by 60 basis points to 59.9% in the June quarter, compared to 59.3% in the same quarter last year, the increase is predominantly attributable to favorable product mix partially offset by increased costs in logistics, component parts and manufacturing. These cost increases largely reflect the impact of COVID-19 in our rapid ramp up and ventilator production. In particular, we incurred significantly higher inbound and outbound air freight costs during the quarter, reflecting both higher volumes and significantly higher rates. We are rebalancing air freight and sea freight volumes, but in the meantime, we expect to see elevated freight costs continue into Q1 FY '21. Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter were $165 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter. We're in constant currency terms SG&A expenses were consistent with the prior year. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 21.5%, compared to the 24.3%, we reported in the prior quarter benefiting from cost management and reduce travel as we work through the uncertain COVID-19 environment. Looking forward, we expect SG&A expenses to increase in the low single digits relative to the year ago period. R&D expenses for the quarter were $53 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 4%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue with 6.8%, compared to 7.3% in the prior year. We continue to prioritize investments in innovation, because we believe our long-term commitment to technology and product development will deliver sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses to continue to grow in the high single-digits to low double-digits, reflecting, our commitment to innovation through the economic cycles. Total amortization of acquired intangibles is $20 million for the quarter, a decrease of 14% over the prior quarter, reflecting historical intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the quarter. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $16 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $243 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong top line growth, expansion of gross margin, and well managed operating expenses. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 16.2%, while on a non-GAAP basis our effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.8%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 will be in the range of 17% to 19%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $193 million, an increase of 40% over the prior quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.33, an increase of 40% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.22. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $330 million reflecting robust underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $18 million. Depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $39 million. During the quarter, WE also paid dividends of $56 million. We recorded equity losses of $6 million in our income statement in the June quarter associated with a fairly joint venture. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $15 million for the full fiscal year 2021 associated with the joint venture operations. We ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $463 million, having generated $330 million in operating cash flow during the fourth quarter and $802 million during our fiscal year 2020. At June 30, we had $1.2 billion in gross debt and $717 million in net debt. Our debt levels remain modest in the June 30, we had just under $1.1 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remained strong. However, I also want to highlight that in these times of uncertainty, we are maintaining a disciplined approach, and we are currently managing expenses cash flow, and liquidity. Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, reflecting the board's confidence and our strong liquidity position and operating performance. Finally, to recap on Q4 results, our earnings this quarter were very strong reflecting significant demand for ventilators, underpinning revenue growth and expansion in our gross margin and lower operating expenses. Turning now to our first quarter of FY 2021 outlook, at a high level, we expect to see continued demand for ventilators but at a significantly lower level compared to Q4 FY 2020. Additionally, we expect to see continued headwinds for sleep device sales in Q1 in response to the temporary reduction in the diagnosis of new patients. Mask and accessories have continued to demonstrate resilience over the past three months which reflects the insulating value of the large patient installed base. Consistent with these remarks for the first month of Q1 FY 2021, we recorded group revenue growth in the low single digits. However, like many other companies, we're experiencing pervasive uncertainty in the current environment. As a result, our forecast and possible future revenue outcomes remain dynamic. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. Yes, the only thing I would add, Mick is there would be consistent with last quarter, there is a portion of that production that remains in inventory at June 30. So that's certainly the case. Well, as Mick said, Astral is still producing still fairly tight, and I think we will continue to do that next little while. Sure, Mick. Hi, Gretel. Yes, I mean, you've covered a few of those moving parts in the gross margin and it's probably heightened on certainly at the moment with COVID-19 and where those impacts will end. We are seeing some elevated costs rolling through, and then some of those, I think, on freight will continue for a little while. We are actively trying to mitigate that, but I think -- I mean we would get drawn in specific guidance, but I think you'd have to say -- you'd have to say there's probably not likely that we had, we'd say gross margin expansion in the short-term. Yes, to clarify that that July group -- that's group revenue, Steve, on that. So that -- that's -- that's everything. That's the entire company."

            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Mick. Thanks for the question, Anthony. So with regard to the bill itself 2771, it remains introduced in the House. It hasn't seen a companion legislation get introduced to the Senate. Obviously, the U.S. government is preoccupied with a lot of other things that are -- they're working on now particularly trying to extend the aid. There probably will be some Medicare relief packages down the road, but we think it's an important shell of the will of Congress and sort of the sense of Congress that there ought to be relief in the rural areas. We were pleased to see that CMS has put a rule forward to advance telemedicine and telehealth reimbursement beyond the pandemic, and so, they're certainly listening to patients and providers and to Congress. We'd hope that they would listen to this and that CMS would be able to enact some relief, and it's always hazardous to predict the U.S. legislation. So, we certainly continue to support it. Many of the same congressional offices that supported 2771 were writing letters that I mentioned earlier about delaying competitive bidding. So, we think that's a strong vote, and we'd certainly continue to support it. We can't really predict what form, if any, relief will ultimately be granted. Thanks."

            "name": "Mick Farrell",
            "content": "Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our stakeholders for joining us today. During this global pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus, and COVID-19, the disease state that leads to, I hope that you, your family, and your friends remain safe and healthy during these times. Way back in early January, a ResMed employee, a ResMedian in Hubei Province, China, put on a hazmat suit and help set up ventilators to provide the gift of breath to many thousands of people turned out in that city, while their immune systems fought against the first global cases of COVID-19 that ResMed saw in Wuhan. Since that time, seven months ago, our global team has provided vital support globally to combat this coronavirus. Not just across China, but across Asia, then across Europe, across North America, and now we're just starting to prepare and to -- actually we're in the midst of continuing that battle in Latin America, in Sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of the Middle East and Asia that still have that what we call the peak impact ahead of them in terms of hospitalizations and ventilator needs. So, I noted in our call, 90 days ago, our Q3 call that we would do more to support the global community and local healthcare systems with ventilators and ventilation mask systems across the 140 countries that we serve. During Q4, during this June quarter, we produced around 100,000 invasive and non-invasive ventilators, including bi-level positive pressure ventilators. That brings our cumulative total to over 150,000 ventilators that we produced since the beginning of calendar year 2020. So, we've delivered on our promise to triple our production, and in fact, if you take the period from January 1 to June 30 for 2020, that is a 3.5x increase over the period for 2019, so 3.5x. For our flagship ventilator, which is the Astral life-support ventilator, we reached a peak of over five times our weekly production rates during the period, and we're still running at full capacity for the Astral to ensure that ResMed is there for what we call preservation of life as the coronavirus continues to move around the globe. I'm particularly proud of the role that our supply chain, our manufacturing, our distribution, and our tech services teams have played during this coronavirus crisis, making sure that ResMed device and a complete ventilation system was there at the bedside when someone needed help breathing as their immune system fights against COVID-19. So, looking forward, we have built a sophisticated set of analytic capabilities including an epidemiology patient model that has helped us model the impacts of both the headwinds and the tailwinds that are part of this COVID-19 crisis, and we have detailed scenarios of the impacts by city, by region, by country, and by ResMed business line. Through that analysis, I'm happy to say that we're confident in our ResMed ability to execute across the full range of potential scenarios for all of our customers and for all of our global businesses. The tailwinds for ventilation in the March quarter and the June quarter from both the ventilator devices and the ventilation mask systems are starting to recede, and while we are still working on current and future contracts with hospitals, as well as city and national health authorities for these ventilators, the volumes will be significantly lower in the September quarter for these ventilators. At the same time, the headwinds we experienced especially in the June quarter for our sleep apnea and COPD patient flow and patient diagnosis are also receding. So, people are starting to return for their primary care physician visits, they're starting to return for their specialist physician visits, and we see the system today growing from its nadir during the last period as we now see city-by-city and country-by-country the markets are coming back online. So, over the portfolio of 140 countries that we serve, we expect a gradual sequential quarter-to-quarter U-shaped recovery of patient flow to primary care physician, sleep physicians, as well as pulmonary physicians that are treating COPD and asthma throughout fiscal year 2021. We expect the expansion of home sleep apnea testing to continue as it did during the crisis, we think it will continue post the crisis, and we also expect a steady sort of sequential increase in sleep lab activity and visits to the pulmonary specialists both in person and through Telehealth, which has been expanding rapidly under COVID. Additionally, some very early research into the post-COVID clinical world shows that select patients who have recovered from COVID-19 may have lung damage, and some of them may require long-term ventilator support. This is an additional area of focus for us, but I have to say, it's very early days in that area. In my prepared remarks today, I will provide some insights into our Q4 and our full fiscal year 2020 business performance. I'll also recap our long-term strategy, our ResMed 2025 strategy, and some execution highlights against some of our key operating priorities as part of that strategy. Finally, I'll discuss how we're advancing and learning in a post-COVID peak world, including how this pandemic has accelerated three important trends; one, the importance of respiratory medicine; two, the importance of digital health; and three, the importance of outside hospital healthcare. These are three key elements of our ResMed 2025 strategies that were in play well before the global pandemic, but these are three trends that have accelerated during this pandemic, and we think the momentum will continue in a post-COVID world. So, for our business performance, we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth for the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year 2020. We had year-on-year annual 15% top line revenue growth to $3 billion in annual revenue for ResMed. Our results reflect strong growth and positive momentum across our innovative MedTech portfolio and our market-leading digital health software solutions. We have grown our global market footprint finding new patients in the midst of a global pandemic, and we have driven growth with recurring revenue from our installed base of sleep apnea patients. While our financial results in March and June have benefited from high demand for ventilation devices and lower operating costs, our underlying core business of sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma remains strong and well-positioned for long-term growth. During fiscal year 2020, we generated $802 million of cash that allowed us to return $225 million of cash dividends to you, our shareholders, while also investing in our future with a double-digit increase in R&D, including clinical research, both digital and in-person, as well as design and digital innovation across our sleep apnea, COPD, asthma, and our software-as-a-service businesses. We have a full pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium and long-term growth opportunities with an industry-leading intellectual property portfolio of over 6,000 patents and designs. Importantly, we have also seen significant growth in our digital health ecosystem. We now have over 6.5 billion nights of sleep and respiratory medical data in the Air Solutions platform. We have grown connectivity to our digital health ecosystem by over 26% this fiscal year, and we now have over 12 million, 100% Cloud connectable medical devices in the market, and we have around 14 million patients enrolled in the AirView software solution. Our digital health ecosystem is a competitive advantage for ResMed that offers innovative solutions, as well as integrated care to drive superior outcomes, better patient experiences, and lower healthcare system costs. Our acquisition and continued investment and development of the Propeller platform, has been a digital health accelerant for ResMed. Our recently-announced commercial partnership with Novartis, which I will describe in more detail later during the call, is a great example of this progress with Propeller. During the last 12 months, we have improved 16 million lives by providing a person with a device or complete mask system to help them breathe. Importantly, the ability to help these patients on their individual journey to better sleep and better breathing is powered by over 6.5 billion nights of medical data in our ecosystem. These data form a significant competitive advantage as they enable us to perform sophisticated analytics, and drive actionable insights to benefit all their customer groups, including the patients, most importantly, but also in improving workflows for physicians, for providers, for payers, and for full healthcare systems. Fundamentally, we believe the future of healthcare delivery is outside the hospital. That's where ResMed competes today, and that's where we win today. Globally, there are 936 million people with sleep apnea. There are over 380 million people, who suffer from COPD, and there are over 340 million people living with asthma, they all need our help. And they all want that help at home, definitely not in a hospital. Our SaaS business is 100% focused on out-of-hospital care le2veraging the global trend for seniors to age in place, we think this trend will accelerate in a post-COVID world. ResMed can provide seamless care for our portfolio of out of hospital care settings, including home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, senior living, life plan communities, home health, hospice, as well as home care services. COVID-19 has accelerated the rapid adoption of digital health technologies, the recognition of the value of remote monitoring, virtual diagnosis and the evolution of global reimbursement models in the field of digital health. This acceleration of digital health adoption represents a significant medium to long-term tailwind for our business. These three trends, the increased importance of respiratory medicine, the increased importance of digital health, and the increased importance of out of hospital health care, will help ResMed achieve our goal to improve 250 million lives by 2025. So, on to our operating priorities, we have three operating priorities that guide our daily focus here at ResMed, number one is to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses across global markets. With over 1.6 billion people across these three chronic disease states, we know that delivering our innovative solutions to these under penetrated markets is actually a number one priority; and number two priority is to design, develop and deliver world leading medical devices as well as digital health technology solutions to better engage physicians, providers and payers as well as patients, so that we can improve clinical outcomes so we can reduce costs, and we can enhance the patient experience; and number three priority is to innovate and grow the world's best seamless software solutions for care that is delivered outside the hospital. We think ResMed is uniquely positioned to deliver on these three priorities. So, I'll quickly walk through some examples of innovation in each of these priorities, and then will hand over to Brett and go to Q&A. In our core market of sleep apnea, we launched what we call the ResMed MaskSelector into our U.S. geography. The ResMed MaskSelector is a digital health technology to make remote patient mask selection and sizing both easier and more effective, helping the patient themselves receive the care they need from home. We think that this is the digital solution to help our HME medical equipment or HME customers in their challenge to find the right mask for each patient when they can't physically touch them due to physical distancing during COVID-19. We are providing this solution at no charge during the coronavirus public health emergency. However, we think this technology's efficiency and benefits for both providers and patients will last well beyond the pandemic. Digital tools like this as well as capabilities including video support for doctors and their patients, as well as remote mask patient fittings have seen good application during COVID-19 combined without mask resupply solutions, including SnapWorx, [Oracle], [ph] and Brightree ReSupply. We have delivered solid mass growth. In terms of new patient flow, the COVID lockdowns have had a significant impact on our business. We saw double-digit declines in new sleep apnea patient flow across all markets that experienced lockdowns, individual cities, regions and countries had unique approaches to any lockdown and reopening processes. For instance, today in Germany, we stand at more than 85% of pre-COVID sleep lab capacity already up and running, whereas in China, the other end of the spectrum, we stand at 50% of pre-COVID diagnostic capacity in that geography; most of the other 140 countries that we sell into around the world fall somewhere between those two extremes. In big countries like the U.S., it's a story of 50 states with unique models, again as a spectrum between these boundary conditions. The average in the United States is probably somewhere in that 70% of diagnostic capability, but some states will be closer to the 60% range, and some will be closer to the 75% range. As I stated earlier, we expect a steady sequential quarter-by-quarter sort of U-shaped recovery of the sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma patient flow throughout fiscal 2021. Clearly, a highly effective vaccine or a highly efficacious treatment for COVID-19 could of course turn that U-shaped into a dramatic V-shaped recovery. However, we're not counting on that and an event like that remains upside from what we call our expected or likely case scenario. In terms of execution in our second key disease, state of COPD and our ventilation solutions for COPD, and other lung conditions, we launched our cloud-based remote monitoring software called AirView for our ventilator solution in Europe, including the Astral product, the Stellar ventilator, and the Lumis ventilator. Through AirView, clinicians and care providers can now remotely monitor their patient's respiratory rate, as well as their blood oxygen saturation. These are two critical indicators for a respiratory patient's condition. We accelerate the delivery of this technology for clear and urgent needs during the pandemic. However, this enhanced AirView capability providing insights across European ventilation patient populations will provide differentiation for ResMed through the clinical value for positions and better outcome for patients in perpetuity. In terms of execution in our third key disease state of asthma ResMed has partnered with Novartis to co-package the Propeller solution and digital platform with the new triple action asthma medication in a brand called Enerzair Breezhaler. This novel combination has been cleared by the European Commission for launch. The Propeller sensor attaches to the new inhaler from Novartis, and its new medication, where it can collect medication usage data. The app works both as an adherence measure that gives the patient reminders to take the medication, but also as a means of collecting information about the patient's medical condition to help their physician provide even better care to the patient. This is a breakthrough innovation as it is the first time a respiratory medicine has been co-packaged with a digital health platform and co-prescribed. The benefits of this combination are tremendous for the patient. It's a simple and convenient way to have a fully integrated experience to allow them to better live with their chronic disease to better live with asthma, with no incremental cost to the patient. This brand-new approval is a new to the world technology that will accelerate the adoption of digital health in the respiratory medicine space, and will help us identify other innovative opportunities to combine our Propeller tech with medicine delivery. This new Novartis partnership follows our announcement in May that the Propeller sensor and an apps gained 510(k) U.S. 510(k) clearance for use with the Symbicort inhaler for both asthma and COPD patients from AstraZeneca. This sensor is built to fit various inhalers and the generic equivalents. Propeller's cloud-based system tracks medication usage of the Symbicort from these inhalers through a smartphone app, which patients can use to paint a clearer picture of their disease control for their clinicians. These new partnerships with both Novartis and AstraZeneca, and previously-announced collaborations with Ryan, as well as Boehringer Ingelheim expand the potential reach of Propeller's technology to around 90% of inhaled medicines for both asthma and COPD in the United States. We believe that this represents a significant upside opportunity for the expansion of the Propeller platform in the U.S. market, but also around the world as the benefits of digital health grow and move around the world. So, before I transition to details of our software-as-a-service business, I'd like to recap briefly why the SAAS business is integral to ResMed's long-term strategy to provide seamless transitions between hospital care and post acute care, or as we call it here at ResMed out-of-hospital care, because we don't think you have to go to hospital to get good care outside the hospital. Our vision is to enable a system where a patient's health data moves with him as they transition care settings, giving providers the information they need to deliver personalized care and saving the person and the caregiver both time and money. We are focused on leveraging our competitive advantage as the only long-term strategic player with solutions that span across these seven important out-of-hospital, healthcare verticals. Home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, senior living, life plan communities, home health, hospice, as well as home care services. During the quarter, our software-as-a-service business grew 7% compared to the year ago period. We are integrating and optimizing the out-of-hospital SAAS portfolio to support long-term growth. We continue to believe that the long-term weighted average growth of these SAAS verticals that we're in is in the high single digits. The COVID-19 market impact has particularly affected the skilled nursing facility census levels and that vertical that we serve. We believe this impact will continue over the next several quarters, moving the weighted average market growth of these verticals to the mid single digit range for our SAAS businesses for that period with return to high single digits as we start to see other analogous things such as elective surgeries and hospital discharges return to their normal rates at which time we believe that that market's weighted average market growth rate will return to the high single digits. Our goal here at ResMed is always to not just meet, but to beat that market growth through delivery of superior market leading solutions. Turning to more details of our SAAS business performance during the quarter, we've been pleased with the early impact of SnapWorx Technology, which we acquired in February. As we discussed on our last earnings call, SnapWorx provides patient contact management and workflow optimization for sleep apnea resupply for our HME customers. The timing of this acquisition couldn't have been better with COVID-19. Our HME customers have been increasingly focused on resupply and better tech to interact with patients in a no touch non-contact world. The combination of SnapWorx as well as Oracle, and Brightree ReSupply, and all of these three technologies are under our Brightree brand, they provide the strongest suite of resupply solutions available in the market period. This technology is important to our customers to their patients as well as to our internal SAAS business and our core sleep apnea business, driving both patient engagement and better outcomes as well as revenue growth. In October 2019, we announced that ResMed entered into an agreement with Cerner Corporation to help clinicians make more informed treatment decisions, control costs, and deliver seamless care across healthcare systems. We have now integrated our Brightree branded home health and hospice platform with the Cerner Electronic Health Record, or EHR. This partnership is performing above our expectations for both Cerner and for ResMed and we anticipate opportunities to deepen and expand this collaboration as we continue to work together. In summary, the SaaS portfolio is performing well and reminds an important driver of our digital transformation of healthcare in settings outside the hospital. The COVID headwinds in the near-term will recede, and we will continue to invest now and in the future in research and development, to make sure ResMed has the best solutions for long-term growth and market leadership. The future healthcare delivery is outside the hospital. COVID-19 has accelerated that, and we here at ResMed are well positioned to capitalize on. Our diversified solution portfolio and capabilities are related against the compelling and expanding market opportunity in sleep apnea, COPD, asthma, and out-of-hospital SaaS. Through the first seven months of this COVID-19 crisis and this calendar year, we've maintained strong growth through our effective execution, our right to innovation, our recurring revenue businesses, as well as margin expansion driven by our global operating excellence programs. While we look forward to moving COVID-19 into the rearview mirror, there are beneficial trends, it has accelerated, which are now passing more over their actually persistent and we believe impactful. The importance of respiratory medicine, the importance of digital health and the importance of healthcare delivered outside the hospital. Those three trends just go accelerated and they're here to stay. While these macro trends have increased Telehealth and increased remote patient monitoring represent short, medium, and long-term benefits the ResMed's business. More importantly, they represent tailwinds for significant improvement on the most critical patient metrics, improving clinical outcomes for the patient's chronic disease and enhancing levels of patient satisfaction for that ultimate customer. The person who just wants to sleep better, breath better, and live with a better quality of life. So before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to express my personal gratitude to the 7,500, ResMedians around the world. In an unprecedented fiscal year, you have remained focused on creating value in our core markets and honoring commitments to patients through COVID-19, you helped us pivot and produce 150,000 lifesaving ventilators to help people breathe in 140 countries worldwide. Without our team, our current and future success would not be possible. So thank you to you to all of you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we'll open up for Q&A. Brett, over to you. Yes. So, thanks for the question, and yes, clearly now Europe -- you know, that is Europe, Asia, and rest of world, so it's the whole world apart from the U.S., Canada, and Latin America, clearly incredibly strong year-on-year growth in the devices side primarily driven on the upside by the ventilator sales, and so, these were, you know, we've had talked about contracts with national governments in the U.K., France, Germany for ventilator sales that were delivered during that June quarter and others around Asia and rest of world. So, that's been the sort of this tailwind if you like from COVID-19, and the headwinds, there were pretty dramatic shutdowns that we saw certainly in Western Europe and most parts of Southeast Asia, including China, which is still at 50% of its fleet capacity today, and that severely slowed down first time set up of patients, but in those geographies, the sort of resupply technology that I talked about in the prepared remarks like SnapWorx, [Oracle] [ph], and Brightree ReSupply, those are all U.S. based technologies, and we really haven't put those technology into play in those European markets. There's an opportunity to do that in the future, but they are not there and they don't have the same resiliency around those mask sales. So, that sort of it's almost like a tale of two markets, if you like, on the devices versus masks during that Q4 for Europe, Asia, and rest of world. Yes, Andrew, this is a question that macroeconomics around the world are working on in every industry, when are we going to see as these lockdowns turn to openings and every city, every country, that we're operating in has different metrics on how fast they're opening and where they're opening. Some never closed, like Sweden. Some are opening really well like Germany, and some are going to second size shutdowns like China. And so, the best we can see as we model it, and we've got a lot of scenarios for the next fiscal year, but the best we can see is across that portfolio of 140 countries we see a sequential sort of U-shaped recovery where we start with Q1, and then we build up to Q2, Q3, Q4 through the fiscal year, as we start to see these reopening happen. We're going to expect second waves and third waves and fourth waves and the sort of W's within a particular city or particular state, but across the country level and certainly at the 140 country portfolio level, we expect that to be a U-shaped recovery, in our likely case throughout the fiscal year, and so, it all sort of turn to a world where we look at sequential growth from Q1 to Q2, and then from Q2 to Q3, and Q3 to Q4, and that's how we're sort of modeling the recovery of our sleep apnea, our COPD, and our asthma patient flow, and therefore that part of our business. There will be resiliency in the mask resupply, particularly in the U.S. geography and some other buffers that we have around our SaaS business, but that's sort of how we're looking at it on a macro basis. Again, Andrew, I would be a great macro economist working for a large multinational bank to make a prediction like this, and they're often wrong when they make those predictions. I think it's very difficult to say when exactly we will be back to the pre-COVID times. I did see a presentation from a global bank economist, who talked about 12 months, 24 months return to normal type period; very difficult to know. Health care, we're more resilient, people as opposed to going to retail to get a new automobile, or a new sound system, or a new home repair, they are going to their primary care physicians and their elective surgeries much quicker, and you can look on those two metrics which are pretty well-published in the major geographies, so PCP visits, GP visits, and for elective surgeries and hospital visits, and we're starting to see those metrics tick-up on a week-to-week basis. And so, the other types of analogs that we're watching and looking at, and then all the other parts come into play. Obviously, there's the upside as I talked about in the prep remarks, if there's an effective vaccine or an effective treatments to COVID-19, all bets are off, this goes to the V-shaped recovery in the markets as they get vaccinal treatment, but we've got a likely expected case of a U throughout the fiscal year, and then get back to that normal in that sort of 12 to 24-month time period. Yes, Brandon, thanks for the question. Yes, certainly we're very proud of the 150,000 ventilators that we made during the first-half of the calendar year; the second-half of our fiscal year. As you know that's a very small percentage of compared to the sleep apnea devices, which are more in the sort of 2, 2.5 million on an annualized basis devices that we make across the CPAPs, IPAPs and the sleep apnea bi-levels, but look, we did obviously sell as we talked about, and Brett talked about in his remarks, we had an extra $35 million of sales in the March quarter at Q3 from ventilator, ventilator masks, and we had an extra $125 million in ventilator and ventilator mask sales in the fourth quarter, and we're not going to predict exactly what that will be here in the September quarter. We're working on hospitals, state and national bidding processes but I can tell you that the volume of bidding and the volume of processes in the sort of expected likely case of that is significantly lower here in the September quarter for that, so that that demand has gone down a lot. I mean, it's ironic in some ways, because the populations of the regions that are now impacted Brazil, India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia, you add up these countries and you start to get to the billions of people, I would like to see demand significantly higher, because I think humanitarian wise, we're going to need more ventilators. We have the production ready, and we are working on contracts where they're there, but we can't sell to someone who won't buy, and so as best we can see, there's going to be a pretty significant drop-off here in the September quarter on the ventilators, but at the same time, that means that the economies are opening up on the other side for our fleet business and we start to get that sequential growth back along those lines. Brett, maybe you want to add some more color on that? Yes, John, it's a great question, and actually, we are looking at Germany as sort of a model of not only how to have dealt with the crisis, that country did a really good job of preparing early, they got their ventilator orders in early and they had, they never reached peak capacity in any of the major regions, cities or hospitals, and now as I recover, as I said in the prepared remarks, they north of 85% of the sleep lab capacity, they were behind the COVID Germany on home sleep apnea testing, but it really, they sort of had a leap forward on that, and I think that will move from, it was maybe 5% or 10% of diagnoses in Germany pre-COVID. I think that'll move to a solid double-digit number post-COVID, but Germany is a great model for the recovery, and it's a country right next door there in France had excellent home sleep apnea testing pre-COVID and so I think the recovery will be quite swift in France as well. You can almost look, you're asking for the analogy to the United States. Take those two countries as different regions within the U.S., Germany could be analogous to some of the states in the U.S. like mostly in the Midwest, where there's a lot of sleep apnea tests done in a sleep apnea lab and I think that will take a longer time to get to capacity just because of all the restrictions around COVID the deep cleaning and just people's psychology about turning up to a sleep lab and staying overnight versus some states, maybe like California or Massachusetts or Florida where home sleep apnea testing was more prevalent. Those not only had less of a dip during the crisis because they're able to move their patient flow to home sleep apnea test, we think they may recover faster in the patient volumes in those areas, and so, we certainly are looking at those analogs, and certainly we're sharing a learning internally here at ResMed from our Germany team, the CEO of Germany, Katrin Pucknat, she's a member of my Global CEO Operations team. So her best practices of what they're doing there brought to the global team and Jim Hollingshead and the team on the sleep and respiratory care side, and then driving that through our U.S. market with our great commercial team we have here in the U.S. and beyond, and so I'm quite confident that we're going to see a sequential quarter-to-quarter recovery throughout the fiscal year. I think we've reached the idea here in Q4 of a flow of patients globally and within our major geographies. And we're going to pick those up every quarter as we go through, I do think there's going to be second, or first waves impacting Latin America and Africa and so on. And I do hope that we're able to secure some good ventilator sales into there for now, because that will need them on a humanitarian basis, but then they will recover a little later in those geographies, but I'm pretty comfortable of our plan, likely case scenario of a steady sequential recovery, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 throughout the fiscal year, assuming no vaccine, no treatment, if those happen, it could be a significant one where you start talking about year-on-year numbers again, versus quarter-on-quarter numbers. Yes, David, it's a really good question, and we actually have some good information around that because we have both, you know the sort of digital end-to-end play on the sleep apnea market where we have apnea link air, which is cloud connected, honestly, that we are testing, all the way through to the obviously the air solutions platform with the air sense devices that are 100% cloud connectable as well, so we see activation rights on that weekly basis, and you picked it, we have seen during the quarter sort of that idea in that sort of late April, early May timeframe, and that we've started to see weekly increases from that idea. You see to the public data around primary care physician visits, and elective surgeries are picking up, and we also see, and without quantifying because that's sort of pretty proprietary data for ResMed, I can certainly say qualitatively to question that offer that idea in, you know, late April, early May, we have seen week-to-week increases on enhanced sleep apnea tests, but also in the activation really importantly as the market leader in market share for sleep apnea devices we're seeing activations increased from that idea point on a weekly basis and so, and we have our geography and you can see all these effects like did this or that city did that, you can see, little W shapes in some of those that have the aggregate, we're seeing that sort of steady U-shaped recovery, even in down to that granular level during the quarter and that's what gives us the confidence as we project forward into a lot of uncertainty in COVID times, 52 weeks seems like a lot of uncertainty that we think there will be that steady across the portfolio steady U-shaped recovery, but I think that's the most color I can provide you there, David. Yes, exactly, David, that's exactly how I interpret the sort of classic U. So, thank you for clarifying that. You can have a question as well if you like. Yes. So, look at that company you mentioned is particularly a U.S. focused company and so that's a pretty good analog for the double-digit decline that happened in stocks for the U.S. geography that sort of 30%, so 70% before and then picking up from that nadir as an average across the country, it would have been lower in some states that have tighter lockdowns and more sleep lab focused and less than that in some of the more liberally in terms of opening states and, but then when you look across 140 countries, you really got to say, okay, well every country treated this differently, but Germany already being up to 85% of pre-COVID, that dip wasn't that low. I don't think they got below 75%, because they were able to pivot to sleep apnea testing pretty quickly and as you know we've got a grind in that market and have great visibility. China had a very steep drop, the government there was very strict in their lockdown and that went down, very high double-digits, and has now got back up to 50% all pre-COVID towards the end of June. And so, it's almost like and we have, you could model every over 140 countries by region, by city, and then, look at a sort of computational basis of this, but it gives us confidence with that detail the last 180 days of how this has gone to project for the next 360. But yes, look for the U.S., that sort of an idea in the high 60s and maybe an average around the 70% for the quarter, but leaving at rates higher than that is sort of where we're at for that geography. Thanks, Hashan, great question. I'll hand that to Rob Douglas, our COO. Brett, do you want to take that? Yes, I've got you loud and clear, Suraj. Suraj, that's a great question, but it gets into a level of detail that we don't want to share for competitive reasons, but look, I can give some color around it, the $125 million in ventilator sales were to the countries that during that last 90 days you [technical difficulty] have seen through the media and other contexts had the biggest impacts from COVID-19. So I think publicly, we've talked about a contract with the U.S. government and FEMA, a $32 million public contract for 2,500 or so Astral devices, and then we had some public contracts with other countries, the U.K. the National Health Service, Germany, France, Japan and Australia. I thought some that I think we've talked about in various media areas, but just given the nature of sort of the competitive dynamics, but then also some of the hospital systems and nations like to choose to publicize to their own populations, those numbers at their own rate. I don't want to go into any further detail on that, but appreciate the question Suraj, and just know that -- one thing that really made us proud is that $125 million of ventilator sales save lives, and there are tens of thousands of people, who wouldn't have been breathing with COVID-19 that were, and if their immune system was able to beat this little protein virus, when it gets in the body, they lived, and we think that was a great benefit for those countries and for those individual people and their families. Great questions, Steve. Brett, if you address the first part on the clarification and then we'll have Dave to talk to competitive bidding. And with regard to your question on competitive bidding, Steve, I mean, we certainly support a delay. We were very pleased to see that just earlier this week. I believe a letter went over from over 100 members of the House and Senate urging the administration and CMS to delay competitive bidding. We've been working with other industry participants to try to advance that perspective. Obviously, there's a lot going on, and we don't get feedback from them as to whether it's likely or not, so we just have to wait and see with everyone else, but we certainly would support that. Having said that, we'll do what we can to support our customers, whenever competitive bidding does come out, so fingers crossed on that. Thanks, Anthony. I'll have a go at the first part of your question, and then Dave can have a go at the second part. In terms of the numbers I was talking about -- so the double digit declines and then coming up from those nadirs during April, May, June, and then what we expect during the year that was about patient flow, sleep apnea diagnosis, COPD patient diagnosis, and coming through the channel. So directly proportional to if you like, first time setup of a sleep device and first time setup of a mask system. As you know, Anthony, you followed us for a number of years, we've got a very resilient group of patients, who loves their great sleep and loves their great breathing and they are on resupply programs either directly through retail in Australia, Singapore, U.K., or through home care programs in Europe or direct HME programs in the U.S. We saw a very good resupply rates in the March quarter, and as we just talked about, saw a very good resupply rates in the June quarter. We expect those strong resupply rates to continue through September, December and onwards. This is a -- an ongoing resupply rate that that really will be there. Obviously, first time our setups are impacted by those numbers I was talking about in the modeling, but resupply numbers have been not only equal to the year before, but sometimes a little better, and we think the some secular change, they're around the importance of respiratory medicine, the importance of respiratory health, and people just wanting clean masks, clean tubing and clean humidifiers that they -- their insurance will pay for and then they could pay the copay for or out of pocket for themselves people are paying for those. And so, we think that sort of secular change they will be there giving us a pretty resilient resupply throughout fiscal 2021 and beyond. Dave, do you want to have a go at the second part of the question about sleeping? Yes, Matt, it's a great question, and look, what I'll give is the generic revenue model of how we at Propeller -- through David Van Sickle, who's the CEO of Propeller and his commercial team globally, sort of the revenue models that they follow without giving any obviously details of any particular customer or partner. So, the general revenue models for Propeller are: number one, a development fee, there's often a development fee that we charge partners for the software engineers, who create the codes for the app that works specifically for that customer, that's a relatively monopod of the life cycle revenue, but it's there; and then secondly, we charge for the sense of the hardware that's provided each time that's sort of Propeller Sensor that has the cloud connectivity and then collects the data locally on usage adherence and other parameters; and then thirdly, which is the major part is the per activated user per month part of the revenue that is associated with that account. So then, that's really an alignment of Propeller ResMed's revenue with the pharmaceutical company, but also really importantly with the patient and their actual usage of it, and most importantly for their outcomes that they stay out of hospital longer it reduces total system costs, and so on. So, there's sort of three parts to that revenue, and all of them are in play for all of those customers that we talked about in the prepared remarks, and look, it's early days, this isn't yet material revenue for ResMed in this quarter or next quarter, but as we look over FY '21, FY '22, and certainly as we look to our long-term strategy, our ResMed 2025 strategy, I think this digital health component and this recurring revenue component of medical adherence to COPD and asthma medications is going to be not only material part of our business, but a really exciting one for transforming care across the industry. Yes, Lyanne, thanks. It's a good question. Resupply was actually pretty steady through the April, May, June rates. We didn't -- year-on-year based on the cycles of where they are in the copay cycle and so on, obviously, there are double-digit unemployment numbers in the U.S. between 10% or 15% depending on the state, but in general, we have seen pretty steady resupply all of masks and accessories for customers, but Rob, do you want to provide any further color for Lyanne around the kinetics there? Thanks, Cheryl, and thanks to all of our shareholders for joining us on the call. I'd also like to once again take the opportunity to thank all 7,500 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders, for their dedication and hard work, not just this quarter and this year, but over the years, helping people sleep better, breathe better, and live better lives outside the hospital in 140 countries worldwide. Thanks for all that you do every day. Thanks especially to our ResMed heroes on the frontline, production, distribution, tech service, and those who help in the set-up of our ventilators and ventilation masks during this global crisis. You helped over 150,000 people potentially through those products, and I look forward to thinking you in person when this is all possible post-COVID, and we'll talk to everyone on this call in about 90 days. Thanks a lot."

Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Thank you, Amy, you may begin.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Diego. Good afternoon, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to ResMed's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Call. We appreciate you joining us, and I hope you all remain healthy and safe during these times.  This call is being webcast live and the replay, along with a copy of the earnings press release and our updated investor presentation, will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today.  Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results from various remote locations across San Diego and Sydney are CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett Sandercock; as well as other members of management who will be available during the Q&A portion of our call. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of these measures, please review the notes to today's earnings press release.  And as a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ, particularly in light of the highly uncertain global environment we are currently operating in and the effects of the COVID-19 coronavirus on our business. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today.  With that, I'd like to go ahead and now turn the call over to Mick.\nMichael Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you all for joining us today. These are unprecedented times, as Amy just noted. We are in the midst of a global pandemic, which is having profound effects on public health, particularly the most vulnerable among us. During this time, our top 3 goals here at ResMed are simple. Goal one is the preservation of life, helping people breathe with world-class ResMed ventilators and ventilation masks, while their own immune system fights against this novel coronavirus and the disease it causes, COVID-19.  Goal two is the safety and health of our amazing team of 7,500 ResMedians, providing solutions in 140 countries worldwide, because without our people, we can't help anyone breathe better. And goal three is the ongoing delivery of world-leading products and services to treat sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma as well as the ongoing production of market-leading software to take care of over 110 million people with care delivered by home medical equipment providers, skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes, hospice, and importantly, in the place where people prefer to be, their home.  I've never been more proud to call myself a ResMedian than I am today. Every one of our global team is fully engaged in the COVID-19 crisis. They are demonstrating impressive feats of ingenuity, compassion and drive to support patients, clinicians, providers, health systems and beyond. My e-mail inbox is overflowing daily with stories of ResMed heroes, including frontline workers, such as our own respiratory therapists and clinicians as well as ResMedians, who are showing up every day, using all of our updated safety procedures to source ventilator components from around the world, to produce ventilators and masks and tubing and software and deliver these life-changing solutions worldwide.  To share just one example from many is the story of a ResMed hero from our China team, actually in Wuhan, in Hubei province, who donned a full hazmat suit every day for the first 10 weeks of the corona outbreak in that region. He was setting up thousands of people on ResMed ventilators and ResMed masks, including a ventilator that we call the guardian angel or GA ventilator produced right there in China. We don't know how many lives this gentleman saved there in Hubei province, but I have the good fortune of calling him, my ResMed teammate. So to all those ResMed heroes, I say thank you and that I'm inspired by you and how you stepped up to help patients at the start of this crisis there in January and for the duration now through April and beyond. As a global company providing solutions in over 140 countries, we have mobilized our efforts and resources to address COVID-19 as this deadly disease moves from region to region. We have accelerated production and distribution of invasive ventilators, noninvasive ventilators, including bilevel devices as well as ventilation masks for the patients who need them most, no matter where they live.  We produced over 52,000 noninvasive ventilators, including bilevels and invasive ventilators during the quarter. This is a threefold increase on our production from the same quarter in 2019, living up to the expectations that we set publicly. We have also driven a tenfold increase in our ventilation mask production, actually more than tenfold. We are aligning distribution of these ventilation products worldwide using a global ethical epidemiology-based model of ventilation needs based on our models of the surge of COVID-19 patients around the world. And our key guiding principle is the preservation of life.  We can and will do more over the coming days, weeks, months and quarters to support health care systems as COVID-19 continues to impact countries across Asia, Europe and North America and with future patient surges just starting to begin in South America, Africa, Middle East and beyond.  We have been able to achieve these outcomes while ensuring that we always place the health, safety and wellbeing of our ResMed team at the top of our priority list. Without our people, as I said earlier, we can do nothing. Our actions have included work-from-home policies for all whose job function allows for that. We have instituted noncontact temperature screening, mask wearing policies and physical distancing protocols for all of our supply chain, production, distribution and technical service teams worldwide. While we have around 65% of our global team now working from home, these important jobs such as production, distribution and tech service just can't be done from home. We have established world-class safety and quality procedures in all of our manufacturing plants, distribution centers and offices, and we're ready to get back to work as cities and countries plan to do that. Safety and quality are part of our DNA at all times. And today, more than ever, these capabilities enable us here at ResMed to support our customers with a sustainable supply of products, services and solutions throughout this COVID-19 crisis and beyond. I also want to express my gratitude and appreciation for the extraordinary efforts of people beyond the boundary of ResMed, especially the frontline health care workers in hospitals worldwide. Respiratory therapists, critical care nurses, critical care doctors and many others have demonstrated extraordinary leadership and personal sacrifice at this time. These clinicians are triaging people with symptoms into various therapeutic pathways depending on the changing acuity of each individual with this novel coronavirus from CPAP therapy to bilevel therapy, to more advanced noninvasive ventilation as well as to full endotracheal intubation with invasive ventilation for the patients who need that.  These clinicians are using ResMed ventilators and ResMed ventilation masks with direct person-to-person engagement, which even with full personal protective equipment still includes significant risk for that clinician. We are working with customers worldwide to drive digital pathways to try to minimize unneeded person-to-person interaction. Examples of this include remote monitoring of ventilation devices, telehealth solutions and virtual patient population management. We have over 11 million devices with available connectivity to our cloud-based solutions, including myAir and AirView. We have over 13 million patients as well as over 6 billion nights, 6 billion nights of respiratory medical data in the cloud.  We had a running start in the field of digital health well before this COVID-19 crisis. One of the few positive benefits out of this awful crisis is that it has brought to the forefront the importance of digital health for the health and safety of respiratory therapists, respiratory nurses and critical care physicians. Digital health also brings benefits of more scalability, more cost efficiency and better outcomes for patients. Throughout the quarter, despite all the changes brought by this coronavirus, we have continued to execute on our long-term ResMed 2025 strategy, including digital health, expanding end-to-end pathways for sleep apnea, for COPD and for asthma as well as building the world's best out-of-hospital health care software network. Fundamentally, we believe and continue to believe, through this crisis even more so, that the future of health care is outside the hospital. That's where ResMed competes today, and that's where ResMed wins today.  The COVID-19 pandemic has proved an interesting point. The more we can establish noncontact digital health pathways at scale, the better the health of therapists, nurses and physicians and the better the efficacy, the efficiency, the scale and the quality of care for patients. We have accelerated our ability to improve over 250 million lives in outside-the-hospital health care by 2025. The fundamentals of our ResMed business is strong, even as we see uncertainty in the changing kinetics and dynamics of the COVID-19 disease as it continues to move across geographies, from Asia to Europe, to now North America and on to South America, Africa and regions worldwide. We are seeing tailwinds in our business from increased demand of our ventilators such as Astral, Stellar, Lumis as well as our noninvasive ventilators, AirCurve, Flexo and the GA. We are also seeing increased demand for ventilation mask solutions.  We do not know exactly how long the surge of demand will last for each hospital, for each city, for each country and for each region as this COVID-19 virus moves. But as patient flow surges, peaks and then flattens, we are there. And we are getting pretty good at modeling these demand curves using our global COVID-19 epidemiology model of patient flow and the learning from each city that we serve. Currently, a lot of short-term impact also depends on our ability to keep ventilator production at its maximum capacity. And as I mentioned earlier, we are already at 3x last year's production capacity. And we are doing our best to meet the surge and peak flow in multiple geographies worldwide. A key element is -- in our ability to deliver is our ability to source critical components and ship product in response to the incredible demand as this COVID-19 virus moves around the world.  I want to be clear on this point, though. Even as we face increased demand for our products, we are doing everything that we can to keep efficiency high and to keep our costs down. Our primary humanitarian goal is 100% locked. At ResMed, we are committed to enabling access to ventilators for COVID-19 patients in order to preserve life. We are keeping pricing steady, and we will not opportunistically increase prices or per unit profit in our response to COVID-19.  We believe that there will be lessons learned during the crisis that will enhance our ability here at ResMed to drive innovation in the coming quarters, coming years through our research and development pipeline, particularly in the fields of digital health technology as well as our product and software innovation. We are very competitively positioned in these fields today, but we think we will be even more so tomorrow.  While balancing our response to the global public health crisis, we have also been executing well in our core business. We have delivered strong growth in our sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses across geographies, with solid contributions from our software-as-a-service business during the quarter. In a few minutes, our CFO, Brett Sandercock, will provide the details of our third quarter financial performance, along with our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2020. But first, I'll provide just a few financial highlights and briefly discuss execution towards our ResMed 2025 strategy along with some milestones for the quarter. So for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, we delivered just around $770 million in quarterly revenue, which is up 17% year-over-year, reflecting growth and positive momentum across our product portfolio, software solutions and global markets. As part of our global COVID-19 response, we have seen tailwinds for the increased demand for invasive ventilators and noninvasive ventilators, including bilevel devices, masks and accessories, as I mentioned earlier. We estimate the incremental impact to be approximately $35 million of COVID-19-related revenue during the quarter. So from this $770 million in quarterly revenue, we generated a strong $240 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter, enabling us to return cash dividends to shareholders, as declared by our Board today.  We continue to invest in the future growth of our enterprise with double-digit increases in our research and development investments during the quarter. This R&D investment includes shifting resources to ventilators and ventilation masks and clinical research and technical help people to help clinicians, physicians, inventors and people worldwide during the COVID-19 crisis as well as keeping the ongoing innovation work going for our core sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and software-as-a-service businesses.  We have set a clear path for ResMed to maintain our position as the global leader in digital health technology, transforming the way health care is delivered for those suffering from sleep apnea, COPD and asthma as well as enabling people to live healthier lives in a portfolio of settings away from the hospital. The execution of our long-term strategy drives progress against our triple aim of: first, slowing chronic disease progression; second, reducing overall health care system costs; and third, improving the quality of life for our ultimate customer, the person who uses our products, to help them sleep better, breathe better and deliver higher quality of life away from the hospital.  We believe that when we help a person sleep better, breathe better and live a better quality of life away from acute care, this positions ResMed to help those people achieve their best health outcome in other chronic disease conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health and beyond. We are forming multiple partnerships to drive these long-term health benefits, including our joint venture with Verily and many other private partnerships beyond. Watch this space. We have three priorities that guide our daily focus. Number one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses across global markets. That's just our clear #1 priority. Number two, to deliver world-leading medical devices and digital health technology to engage physicians, providers and patients so that together, we can improve clinical outcomes, reduce costs and enhance patient experiences. That's our triple aim. And our third priority is to build the world's best software solutions network for health care that is delivered outside the hospital, and we're well on track to do that.  We have advanced on all 3 of these priorities during the quarter, and I'll briefly touch on a few recent highlights to demonstrate areas where we have momentum and are driving innovation. We had an exceptionally strong growth this quarter on a geographic and product basis, including 17% growth globally. Our team delivered strong and distributed geographic growth, including a 12% increase in the combined United States, Canada and Latin America regions as well as an incredibly strong constant currency increase of 27% across the combined Europe, Asia and other regions. As discussed earlier, there was an impact from the COVID-19 surge in demand of ventilation in the quarter of around $35 million in revenue, so that's around 4.5% of the $770 million in revenues for the quarter. In short, our core underlying business remained robust, over and above that of the ongoing surge of demand. On a product basis, during the last 12 months, we improved over 16 million lives by providing a person with a ResMed device or a ResMed complete mask system to help them breathe better and live a better life. Including our digital health solutions for out-of-hospital software in this number, we impacted together over 110 million lives during these last 12 months. The ability to improve these lives is supported by over 6 billion nights of respiratory medical data in the cloud. These data allow us to perform sophisticated data analytics and to drive actionable insights for the benefit of customers, including patients, physicians, providers and health care systems. This makes ResMed the global leader in digital health for our field and the partner of choice for our customers, helping them increase efficiency, reduce costs and improve outcomes. So shifting to a discussion of our core sleep apnea business. We are seeing significant impact from the COVID-19-related lockdowns on new patient diagnoses in sleep. We have seen double-digit declines in diagnosis rates in affected markets. Many sleep clinics, especially hospital clinics are temporarily closed. And many pulmonary and critical care physicians that often work in sleep clinics are shifting their focus to treat COVID-19 patients as the surge comes to their city, their region, their state, their hospital. It is important to note that we have seen the mask and accessories resupply dimension of our business not only maintained, but actually increased during the quarter.  As we look forward, there is uncertainty and it's not clear to what extent the upsurge in ventilation device and ventilation mask revenue will offset the decline in sleep device revenue and whether sleep mask revenue will maintain its growth or decelerate somewhat. But we know these facts, number one, the sleep apnea prevalence remains incredibly high, over 936 million people worldwide. And we know, fact two, that there is a backlog of diagnostic activity for sleep apnea and COPD that many clinics and physicians are preparing to ramp up their home sleep apnea testing, both now during the crisis and in the future as lockdowns are lifted around the world.  For the on-premise or in-laboratory tests for sleep apnea, we are modeling how those will scale back up again customer-by-customer, city-by-city and country-by-country as the economy opens up and primary care physician visits and elective medical procedures come back online through telehealth and beyond. Physicians and therapists will then have to work through the backlog of undiagnosed patients that has been built through the COVID-19 lockdown in their region, with a portfolio of both home sleep apnea testing and in-lab tests.  The velocity of the diagnostic pathway return rate will depend on local regulations and behaviors and what we're calling a new normal for patient care. We have real-time experience of the opening back up in some cities in Asia and throughout Europe, and we're starting to see them open up in the U.S. And we have modeled these open-ups carefully to ensure that we can best support customers as they start their home sleep apnea test scale and their in-lab test scale over time to meet the backlog of demand. Even today, around the world, we're working closely with our customers to accelerate these home sleep apnea testing models and remote patient setup on sleep apnea therapy where customers are pursuing those pathways as well as our ongoing remote sleep apnea patient monitoring. And I mentioned earlier, we have over 11 million, 100% cloud connectable medical devices out there in the field and more that are distributed every day.  It's important to note that these types of partnerships aren't new due to COVID-19. These are things we've been working on for years and decades in some states. And we believe these types of digital health and telehealth and remote monitoring models will only increase due to COVID-19 and as we move into a post-COVID-19 world.  In terms of digital health innovation, we have recently rolled out a new pilot telehealth over video chat so that the physician can not only access information on Air Solutions and AirView, but it can also interact directly with the patient. And we think that will reduce the need for a recovered COVID-19 patient to return to the emergency room or a physician outpatient setting. We view this as a trend that will be accelerated by a combination of changes in reimbursement methodologies and overall focus on safety and the preventative and health benefits for both the patient and the health care worker.  Solutions like this can provide incredible scale when leveraged across a digital health network, including over 110 million patient lives. As I noted earlier, our investments in research and development grew by double digits in the quarter, and we put these R&D monies to work to expedite the tripling of ventilator production in the quarter and tenfold capacity increase in our ventilation mask production. We have also formed partnerships with clinicians around the world to help with the COVID-19 crisis, to help create and share clinical white paper, best practice solutions in clinical practice to help with COVID-19 ventilation management, including triage between CPAP, oxygen, bilevel therapy, noninvasive ventilation therapy and invasive ventilation therapy. At the same time, though, we have continued to invest in our core businesses for future growth in sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and software-as-a-service.  As an example of this innovation in our core sleep apnea business, we introduced during the quarter the AirFit F30i. This is the first CPAP mask with a tube-up design in the full face category. This product now gives ResMed the most complete full face mask portfolio versus all our competition on the planet. So what does this tube-up design of the AirFit F30i do for customers? In essence, it gives the freedom of movement back to that ultimate customer, the patient, so they can sleep naturally in any position. The best lumber architecture follows during the night. The F30i also has an innovative cushion that prevents irritation on the nasal bridge, and it has a quick release elbow that allows users to quickly disconnect and reattach the mask from its tubing, making it very simple to start therapy at the start of the night and to stop therapy in the morning.  All this technology built into the AirFit F30i supports the third tenet of our triple aim, to improve the quality of life for the patient. If they have freedom of movement and don't wake up, that improves their sleep, it improves their day, it improves their life. Clearly, it is very early in the product life cycle for the F30i, and this product was launched amid a pretty unique global environment. However, despite some of the noise in the signal, we've been able to see good early acceptance as physicians, respiratory therapists and that ultimate customer, the patient, recognize the benefit and functionality of the innovation in the F30i.  Additionally, during the quarter, we invested $100,000 in partnership with the not-for-profit American Thoracic Society Foundation through a research grant. The goal of the research and the study is to look at how remote monitoring can help improve the management of patients with COPD. The study aims to detect early changes in lung function from daily recordings and to notify patients and/or physicians when to commence more intensive treatment or to seek high-level medical attention.  Nearly 400 million people suffer from COPD worldwide, and we do not believe these people are well served currently by global health care systems. Our vision of better management for COPD patients through the use of digital health technologies will be accelerated from the findings of this study. It's great to partner with the nonprofit ATS Foundation to help this move forward.  As we discussed earlier, COVID-19 has accelerated the movement to fully remote care in our core sleep apnea and ventilation businesses. Looking at our growing digital health solutions for COPD and asthma, the Propeller platform continues to play an important role in keeping patients outside the hospital, out of acute care locations, leveraging the Propeller's world-leading pharmaceutical adherence technology for these diseases.  Active use of Propeller technology has actually increased during the COVID-19 crisis. We think this is due to the rising awareness of the importance of respiratory health and the fact that people just don't want to go to acute care settings, and so they're using preventative medicines more to do so. While it's not yet material to ResMed's overall revenue, we are seeing increased interest in Propeller's technology to support health systems with population health. We'll keep you updated on any significant milestones with our pharmaceutical partners as well as our work with global health care system partners throughout calendar year 2020 and 2021 as they adopt the Propeller platform for COPD, asthma and beyond.  Before I transition to a discussion of our out-of-hospital software-as-a-service business, I'd like to recap briefly why we believe that the SaaS business is critical to ResMed's long-term success and how it fits into our broader portfolio. Our consistent view of the evolution of the health care system is that care will be delivered outside the hospital. The contamination of hospitals with COVID-19 is just one of the latest examples of the types of contagions that are present in many hospital locations worldwide. Our vision is to enable a system where a patient can seamlessly transfer across a portfolio of outside hospital care settings, from home care providers to skilled nursing facilities, to home health, to independent living, assisted senior living and beyond. These settings have reduced costs versus the hospital as well as increased efficiency and better health outcomes than the hospital. People are simply happier and healthier in the residential setting of their choice, and the ultimate residence of choice is their home.  The SaaS business clearly leverages the global trend for seniors to want to age in place and supports ResMed's continued execution against the triple aim. Our SaaS businesses enable us to participate more deeply in broader chronic disease across a patient's life cycle, creating additional strategic growth options. During the quarter, our software-as-a-service business grew at 12% from the period a year ago. We are integrating and optimizing this out-of-hospital SaaS portfolio to support long-term growth. We continue to believe that the long-term weighted average growth of the SaaS markets that we serve is in the high single digits. We clearly beat that growth this quarter, and we plan to exceed that rate in the long run as we execute to our SaaS strategy. During the COVID-19 crisis, many out-of-hospital health care settings have switched their use to support overflow from hospitals. And there has also been a reduction in patient flow to these out-of-hospital facilities due to a reduction in elective surgeries at hospitals. Skilled nursing facilities and nursing home volumes have been extremely hard hit by COVID-19, and this will impact our MatrixCare business growth in the coming quarters. We expect market growth in our current portfolio of SaaS businesses that we serve to be in the mid single-digit range for the next few quarters, before its recovery to high single-digit growth in the medium to long term as the COVID-19 surge passes and people return to their primary care physicians and return to their elective surgeries and patient volume returns. In support of the increased growth of the SaaS portfolio, during the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of a company called SnapWorx. SnapWorx provides patient contact management and workflow optimization for sleep apnea resupply for our HME customers. The combination of Brightree's technology and live call services with this new SnapWorx tech creates the largest resupply base in the industry with end-to-end workflow automation for HME customers. Resupply is an area of the HME business that has been a strong ballast in the boat during the COVID-19 lockdowns. And these types of programs, including Brightree and SnapWorx together, set up our customers for ongoing success and better patient engagement through the crisis and beyond. In summary, the SaaS portfolio is an important driver of our long-term success and a critical enabler of our ability to impact our triple aim. We are investing for long-term growth in SaaS and leadership in this space.  Our performance across the entire ResMed portfolio during the quarter demonstrates the resiliency of our business during, what I would call, extremely challenging global times. And it highlights the dedications of ResMedians all over the world and the dedication of our customers, the clinicians, providers and health systems to deliver for the people who need our help. Looking forward, we are modeling impacts of headwinds and tailwinds from the COVID-19 crisis, with detailed scenarios of impacts by customer, by city, by region and by business line. While we face temporary headwinds in sleep apnea diagnosis and SaaS patient business flows I just talked about, we are also seeing tailwinds from increased demand for our ventilation devices, our ventilation masks around the world. The fundamentals of our overall business is strong, but these are uncertain times and the crisis continues to unfold across geographies, and we don't know exactly how long the related headwinds and the related tailwinds will last. We don't know specifically by each city, country and region how fast they will open up, but we know they will open up. And as we have seen in Asia and Europe, as these economies open up over the coming days, weeks and months, ResMed will be there to serve them. And we know one thing that as they start to open up, there has been and will be a backlog of patients who need the channel's help for sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and out-of-hospital health care needs. We're investing now to be ready for those realities of the open-up so that we can be there to support our customers with the best digital health solutions and the most scalable solutions to help them grow now. We are leading from the front.  The nature of the COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the importance of our digital health strategies I mentioned earlier. Our ability to improve over 250 million lives by 2025 in out-of-hospital health care is not only on track, we think it's accelerated these last 3 months. This is the one welcome benefit in what has been incredibly challenging 90 days for every company, not just ResMed in every nation, every government dealing with this crisis. We're glad that we have made extensive investments in remote monitoring, remote patient setup, digital health, population health management over the last 5, 10-plus years that we can now offer and bring to the market to help them when they need it.  The combination of accelerated digital health technology and the recognition of the value of remote monitoring and the projected changes that are already happening in global reimbursement models for digital health, combined with the growing acceptance of virtual diagnosis and virtual setup, represents a new and significant medium to long-term tailwind for the ResMed business. This combined with our strong pipeline of new products and digital health solutions, including sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and the out-of-hospital SaaS gives us strong confidence in our future. We think this is a unique positioning that solidifies our leadership role in global digital health in med tech, but will also support ResMed's growth over the medium to long term. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I'd like to commit that while we have already played a significant role providing tens of thousands of ventilators, many, many more ventilation masks and clinical support to clinicians worldwide to fight the COVID-19 crisis, we are not done. We will do even more in the coming quarter and the coming quarters to deliver more ventilators, more ventilation masks for countries as they go through the patient surge. And we will be there to support health care systems around the world in respiratory medicine and digital health not only during this COVID-19 crisis, but in what we call the new normal post-COVID-19 world that will be more digitally enabled and more digitally connected than ever before.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett in Sydney. Brett?\nBrett Sandercock: Right. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 and some remarks for our Q4 outlook. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the March quarter was $769 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 17% compared to the prior year quarter. Revenues for the third quarter were favorably impacted by significant sales of ventilator devices and accessories. We estimate that the incremental revenue benefit from COVID-19-related sales was in the order of $35 million. Excluding this incremental impact, our group revenue increased by 12% in constant currency terms. Taking a closer look at geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our software-as-a-service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries were $394 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $286 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year quarter or, in constant currency terms, a 27% increase.  By product segment, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $196 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $197 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year quarter. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales totaled $195 million, an increase of 26% over the prior year quarter or, in constant currency terms, a 29% increase. Mask and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $91 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year quarter or, in constant currency terms, a 22% increase. Globally, in constant currency terms, both device sales and masks and other sales increased by 18% over the prior year quarter.  Software-as-a-service revenue for the third quarter was $90 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, SaaS revenue increased by 9%.  During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, the purchase accounting fair value adjustment to MatrixCare deferred revenue and an impairment of minority interest investments. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release.  Our non-GAAP gross margin improved by 70 basis points to 60% in the March quarter compared to 59.3% in the same quarter last year. The increase is predominantly attributable to favorable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by typical declines in average selling prices. Moving to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the third quarter were $172 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 7% compared to the prior year period. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 22.4% compared to 24.8% reported in the prior year quarter. Given the volatility in potential future revenue outcomes, I will not provide our normal guidance with respect to SG&A as a percentage of revenue. However, looking forward, we expect SG&A expenses to increase in the low single digits compared to the year ago period. R&D expenses for the quarter were $51 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 11%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.7% compared to 7.2% in the prior year. We continue to invest in our business, particularly targeted at innovation. This is evidenced by the double-digit growth in R&D expenses in Q3. We believe our long-term commitment to innovation will deliver a sustained competitive advantage.  Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses to continue to grow in the high single digits to low double digits, reflecting our commitment to innovation through the economic cycles. Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $20 million of the quarter, a decrease of 10% over the prior year quarter, reflecting historical intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the quarter. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $14 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $238 million, an increase of 31% over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong top line growth, expansion of gross margin and well-managed operating expenses. Excluding the benefit from COVID-19 impacts, we still continue to experience solid operating leverage. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $188 million, an increase of 47% over the prior year quarter. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 14.9%, while on a non-GAAP basis our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.1%.  Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 will be in the range of 18% to 20%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.29, an increase of 45% over the prior year quarter. Excluding the benefit from COVID-19 impacts, we estimate our diluted earnings per share were $1.16, an increase of 30% over the prior year quarter. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.12. Additionally, during the quarter, we recognized write-downs of $9 million associated with minority equity investments. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $240 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $30 million. Depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $46 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $56 million. During the quarter, we also completed the acquisition of our previously announced tuck-in acquisition of SnapWorx. The acquisition will be non-GAAP EPS neutral in year 1 and is expected to be accretive to non-GAAP EPS in year 2. However, overall, the impact will not be material to group earnings. We recorded equity losses of $5 million in our income statement in the March quarter associated with the Verily joint venture. We expect to record an underlying run rate of approximately $5 million of equity losses each quarter through fiscal year 2021, associated with the joint venture operations.  Given the unprecedented nature of current events, I would like to make some comments on our financial health. Strong balance sheet has always been a hallmark of ResMed and is most valued by investors in times of economic uncertainty. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $353 million, having generated $240 million in operating cash flow during the third quarter and $472 million in the first 9 months of our fiscal year 2020. As of March 31, we have $1.4 billion in gross debt and $1 billion in net debt. We had total assets of $4.5 billion. Our debt levels remain modest. And at March 31, we had a further $895 million available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility.  In summary, our liquidity position is strong. However, I also want to highlight that in these times of uncertainty, we are maintaining a disciplined approach, and we are tightly managing expenses, cash flow and liquidity. Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share. Dividends are important to many of our shareholders, and the declaration of our dividend reflects the Board's confidence in our strong liquidity position and operating performance.  Turning to our fourth quarter outlook. At a high level, we expect to see continued strong growth in our respiratory care business and expect incremental respiratory care revenue to significantly exceed in Q3. However, we expect to see a headwind in sleep device sales in Q4 in response to a temporary reduction in the diagnosis of new patients. Masks and accessories have shown resiliency over the past 3 months, which reflects the insulating value of the large patient installed base. Like many other companies, we are experiencing high uncertainty in the current environment with circumstances and information changing almost on a daily basis. And as a result, our forecast and possible future revenue outcomes remain dynamic.  And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Brett. Thanks, Mick. [Operator Instructions]. Diego, we're now ready for the Q&A portion.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. \nLyanne Harrison: Congratulations on a great result. I'm very interested in, I guess, the uplift that you did on ventilators, and you maybe mentioned you got $35 million tailwind for this quarter due to the threefold increase in the devices production [indiscernible] in ventilators by far. Can you tell me whether or not you are able to increase your volume of production of ventilators as you go through quarter 4 and to meet any increased demand in other countries.\nMichael Farrell: Thanks, Lyanne. Thanks for the question. And yes, you're right. We had 2 separate metrics that we sort of laid out there. One that we sold an extra $35 million worth of ventilator in the quarter. Those were from our inventory and stuff that we produced in Q2 and some in Q3 and so that was a $35 million tailwind for our business, and we expect some of that certainly to continue as the surge continues worldwide into Q4. And then in addition to that, we tripled our production from a year ago, and we made over 52,000 noninvasive ventilators, bilevel devices and invasive ventilators.  So your question of, can we continue and/or increase the production capacity? And the answer is absolutely yes. We are constrained on some key components for the invasive ventilators. So the Astral and Stellar have some significant constraints in the components that go into those invasive ventilators of the Astral and Stellar type products. Well, Astral is an invasive ventilator and Stellar is actually noninvasive ventilator. But we really don't have significant constraints to the Lumis STA other than some components around the alarms module and the extra components and the AirCurve ST. So those noninvasive ventilators can scale to 5x or 10x, and we can really scale to whatever the demand is. And so then it comes down to our ability to predict hospital-by-hospital, customer-by-customer, what those surges in demand are going to be as the virus moves around the world and to make sure that ResMed is there, getting an order and making sure we can deliver those invasive ventilators, but really importantly, those noninvasive ventilators and alternative therapies that are also used in the different levels of acuity for a patient with COVID-19. So the answer in short is, absolutely. We did all we could, and we tripled production in the quarter, and we are looking to do that and more in Q4 to deliver for the needs that continue worldwide.\nLyanne Harrison: Okay. So just to clarify, [indiscernible]. How much can you increase production on the ventilators [indiscernible].\nMichael Farrell: I am going to say, Lyanne, the audio wasn't fantastic during that, but I think I heard you say that how would we or how fast would we move from the sort of 3x increases to a 5x or 10x on AirCurve ST, that's going to be dependent upon our modeling of the different surges that happen city-by-city and country-by-country. And clearly, the masks are used far more rapidly because they are changed over pretty regularly certainly patient-to-patient, but often day-to-day with these non-vented ventilation masks. And so we expect the surge to continue and us to continue to be able to produce throughout Q4 and beyond for the needs as this goes -- as this virus goes around the world and continues to expand.\nLyanne Harrison: So my question was, how much can we increase the ventilator masks [indiscernible]\nMichael Farrell: Yes, I've got to say, I can't -- I think I heard you say, can we increase the ventilation mask production? We've increased it tenfold, and we'll continue to do so. I think we should go to the next question. Sorry, Lyanne.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Suraj Kalia with Northland Securities.\nSuraj Kalia: I hope everyone is safe and healthy. Mick, just one from my side. And forgive me if you all mentioned this. Can you help characterize your investment in Nyxoah. You all are thinking about the neuromod market specifically for sleep apnea? What is the construct of ResMed's investment? That will be greatly appreciated.\nMichael Farrell: Thanks, Suraj. It's a great question. And as you know, you followed our stock for a long time. We look at a portfolio of investments to treat sleep apnea. And around 10 years ago, we actually invested in the 3D printing of a sleep apnea dental device called Narval, and that's now a great part of our portfolio and treats a great number of patients in France and across Northern Europe. The neurostimulation market is an interesting one and Nyxoah, we think, is a leader in that space, and we decided to make a minority equity investment in them. I'll actually hand over to Jim Hollingshead, who's the President of our Global Sleep business, to talk about how neurostim, dental, CPAP and how it all fits together.\nJames Hollingshead: Thanks, Mick. Just very briefly, since I know we're probably short on time now. The gold standard therapy for sleep apnea continues to be CPAP therapy. And that -- we think that will continue for the foreseeable future. We get a chance to see a wide range of technologies as they emerge. And we always look very carefully at anything we think is an alternative. And as Mick mentioned, we obviously have a fantastic oral device, which we sell in Europe very successfully. The Narval device, high-tech, 3D printed, very low volume of the mouth, very comfortable. We've looked at the neurostim space for quite a long time. There have been a number of companies that have tried to succeed in the neurostim space. We think Nyxoah has a novel offer and is potentially disruptive, but it's very early days. It's a minority investment in what's effectively a start-up company. So we like the technology. We like to play, but we'll have to see how it plays out.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Cooper with Goldman Sachs.\nChris Cooper: Mick, can you just remind us of the approximate payer mix in the sleep apnea business, please? And I appreciate this is a highly dynamic situation, but can you just share your thoughts on how you expect the higher rates of unemployment we're seeing in the U.S. to impact that business, please?\nMichael Farrell: Yes, Chris, thanks for the question. And yes, certainly, every country around the world is different. I presume you're asking about the U.S. payer mix, Chris? Maybe you're on mute, but I'll start with the U.S.\nChris Cooper: Okay, primarily, year-on-year.\nMichael Farrell: Okay. So obviously, we sell in 140 countries outside the U.S. and on the reimbursed part of our business, the non-SaaS part, it's close to that 60-40 range, 60% being within the U.S. and 40% being beyond that. And if you include SaaS businesses, it's more like 65% of our global business in the U.S. So I'll start with that. So we don't have contracts directly with payers, but our portfolio of home medical equipment customers do. And there's around 5,000 customers in the U.S home medical equipment providers, and their payer mix for the field of sleep apnea and COPD that we serve is around 20%, maybe 25% for some regions, Medicare; and around 75%, 80%, private pay.  And as we've seen through the COVID-19 crisis, we have seen ongoing payments from the -- both the government and private payers through to ResMed. We are carefully watching our accounts receivable. And as Brett said, we're carefully watching our cash flow to make sure that payers pay on time and with time, but we haven't seen any issues as yet. Clearly, unemployment has increased in the country from single digits to double digits through this crisis, and it's something that all companies are looking at very carefully. But we haven't seen any issues as yet, but we are watching the cash flow very carefully to make sure that we have continuing flow of capital and cash through our business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Matson with Needham and Company.\nMichael Matson: So I guess first, I just wanted to ask about the resupply business. Wondering why you think that, that's been so strong? Is there any kind of demand pull forward happening there? Do you think that can be sustained as long as the pandemic continues?\nMichael Farrell: Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. And certainly, there's -- it's quite interesting. As you know, you've followed us for a long time, too, Mike. Our installed base of CPAP patients, sleep apnea patients is a very strong part of our mask business. We're talking north of 80-plus percent of our masks sales across the U.S. are to that installed base, the diagnosed patient who loves their therapies, changed their life and they're going to go and reorder every time. I think the focus of COVID-19, and that it's a respiratory medical issue and that has raised the importance of making sure that your lungs are well taken care of and that you breathe well and your overall health is well, has increased people to make sure they get their prescriptions for everything, including heart attack. Post heart attack patients are getting more prescription pills. As I noted earlier, the Propeller side, COPD medicines and asthma medicines, we're seeing increased use of those in respiratory medical health.  And we've seen a similar thing, I think, in the CPAP mask side, where when you are capable of getting a mask, you are more likely to click, yes, I would like that. And we haven't seen any reduction in people saying, \"Oh the co-pay is too high or I don't want to go there.\" We've seen actually the reverse where people are saying, \"wow, it's been 90 days, I'm due for a therapy, for a CPAP mask, tubing, et cetera.\" And they're clicking yes, and they're getting those devices delivered to them. So very strong ballast in the boat for our HME customers. And the HME customers themselves are really focusing on this part of their business because it's a good opportunity for them. We think -- look, there will be some deceleration if there is some sort of that surge of the sort of the toilet paper model where I'm going to over inventory, you all going to make sure I've got enough masks. That might decelerate somewhat, but we don't think -- we think there's a lot of ballast in that. And people who are on CPAP therapy and loving the CPAP therapy are going to want to get new masks. And through COVID and beyond, the importance of respiratory medicine will only be increased because of this. So we think that part of that business is very steady through the crisis and even stronger beyond. I think it will change behaviors that will last well beyond COVID-19 surge.\nMichael Matson: Okay. And then just with regard to sleep diagnostic testing. Can you provide any more detail around the declines that you're seeing kind of late in the March quarter? And then to what degree could increased use of home testing kind of some sort of remote telemedicine model offset that? And are you doing anything to try to enable the CPAPs to implement -- to ramp up, I guess, their home sleep testing?\nMichael Farrell: Yes. Great follow-up question, Mike. And we're doing a lot in that space. I'm focused a lot with Rob Douglas on our global task force on COVID-19 and ventilators. Jim Hollingshead, at the same time, has been running our sleep business strongly. Jim, do you want to follow up on the -- follow-up there on home sleep apnea testing and scale?\nJames Hollingshead: Sure. Thanks, Mick. I think it's very difficult to quantify the effects and the balances of decline in in-lab testing and increase of home sleep testing in general. And it's very different country by country, both because of the timing of the pandemic and then how different health care systems are structured and so on. So trying to get a quantification, I think, is quite difficult. What we do know is we have seen some decline in in-lab testing. That's not a surprise. Health care systems around the world have shifted their focus to COVID-19. Many countries have gone in lockdown. Much of the U.S. has gone in lockdown. So we know that in-lab testing has declined and dipped.  We have some evidence to suggest it stabilized at a lower level. It's hard to know exactly what that level is, but we think it's potentially stabilized at this point. But in parallel, we also know there's been an increase in home sleep testing and remote testing. A number of the labs around the U.S. have increased their use of home sleep testing devices and routines. And where that's done in Europe and can be down in Europe, it continues to be done, and we think it will turn on faster in Europe. And then the final point of your question is what are we doing? We're actually working very hard to enable home sleep testing to figure out how to help our lab customers and our physician customers virtualize their model, not just to our device offerings, but through workflows, through webinars and trainings, and we're working hard to see if we can virtualize some of that with software, which will take a little bit more time. And we do think that a shift to home sleep testing is, which has been going on worldwide for years, will be accelerated by this.  And just as Mick said in his prepared comments, one of the things that we think will come out of the crisis generally for the sleep business is increased adoption of our already very broad offerings, virtualized care offerings. And so we think that will accelerate through the crisis and then have a new normal coming out of the crisis.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair.\nMalgorzata Kaczor: Just wanted to follow up on the comment you guys have on production of NIVs and LSVs. I think I heard you guys say you've produced 52,000 of those devices in the quarter, which I know you guys don't give ASPs, but it seems like it could be $200 million or $300 million worth of products in the device side versus the $35 million benefit you saw in the quarter. So I guess, long and short, but the question is, were those made-to-order or in advance of demand? And how should we think about that product entering the field?\nMichael Farrell: Margaret, that's a great question. And yes, certainly, we did -- you heard correctly. We made 52,000 noninvasive ventilators and invasive ventilators. So that includes everything across the Astral, Stellar, Lumis, Flexo, GA and AirCurve, all those devices. So we included across all that group, 52,000, and they have very different pricing. But clearly, it's a lot more than just the $35 million of sales in that quarter. So we are prepared for demand ahead. The only thing I'm really willing to say on a public call like this is that we have a public capability with the U.S. government through HHS and FEMA of over $30 million contract. And so that's a fixed contract that we will fulfill, mostly in Astrals.  And -- but we have many other contracts with hospitals, states, governments, nations around the world. I'm not going to go in and quantify any of those. They're usually one to one directly to those countries and directly to those hospitals. But what I can tell you is all the demand that they have and all the supply that we have, our supplies just cannot keep up with the demand as it moves around the world. And so what we're doing is maximizing production in advance and then making sure we get through the peak and through the surge, but not have an over amount of inventory at the other side. And so we're carefully managing the peak, the surge, the flattening and then making sure we get back to normal COPD, neuromuscular disease, ALS and other sales with those ventilators because those patients will be there beyond. And that's how we're looking at it, Margaret. But yes, clearly, we are preparing for more sales in the future of those ventilators and ventilation masks. That -- those tailwinds will last through Q4 and likely beyond.\nJames Hollingshead: Yes. I'll just add quickly, Mick. Margaret, yes, there's a lot -- there's a meaningful amount that's in transit mode so to speak, as we're trying to get those into our DCs and then ultimately to customers. So there's that -- that impacts it as well. So -- but we'll continue to produce. And as Mick said, the demand is there. It's just a matter of getting it through the logistics.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steve Wheen with Evans & Partners.\nSteven Wheen: I just had a question on the FDA in terms of its response to COVID-19. It was alluding to the use of CPAP as being something that could be utilized. Just wondered what the experience was there? And then the other item that the FDA had done was to remove ventilators from the competitive bidding process. I just -- and there has -- appears to be some pressure to delay competitive bidding in the latest round. Just any comments on any of those 3 things would be very useful.\nMichael Farrell: Yes, Steve, those are great questions. And I've had actually quite a lot of conference calls with the FDA commissioner, Hahn; and HHS secretary, Azar, during this crisis. ResMed was part of a Defense Production Act that was put in place by the White House to secure component supply for our ventilator so that we could supply HHS, FEMA and beyond. And so I had a lot of interaction there. Look, the FDA have really been a great partner through this process. They helped us get Emergency Use Authorization, EUA, for a number of our products to be used in different context. So for instance, our noninvasive ventilators, which were very scalable. And as we talked about, we made tens of thousands this quarter. We had doctors wanting to use them in various ways, invasive ways and others. And so the doctors needed an EUA to be able to do that, and they have got that. And the FDA were very quick to us and other manufacturers in providing those Emergency Use Authorizations.  Simultaneously, Secretary, Azar, over at Health and Human Services and CMS, they did take noninvasive ventilators out of competitive bidding around 2021, and that was a very good change for our HME customers. It really took a load off for them knowing that these NIV and ventilation businesses will be good ongoing concerns for them. So we saw a good partnership from both the FDA and HHS as part of this crisis. And HHS also worked with FEMA to make sure that we got the demand, and that was the $30-plus million contract I talked about to us, and there were 5 other manufacturers who got contracts as well. I think the government, not just in the U.S., but in all 100-plus countries that we're working with through this crisis, have done a great job in contacting us, working with us, helping us with supply chains and helping us with delivery of ventilators to people in the need for this crisis.\nSteven Wheen: And sorry, the final part was just the pressure that's being or the attempt to delay competitive bidding, the likelihood of that?\nMichael Farrell: Yes. I'll hand that over to Dave. He's got more insight on that, David Pendarvis?\nDavid Pendarvis: Yes. So thanks, Steve. We, along with the rest of the industry, have been suggesting to CMS that they either delay for a year the introduction of the 2021 round entirely or at least the respiratory offerings, respiratory product codes within that offering of the 2021 round of competitive bidding. We have had a dialogue with CMS on that topic, so they are listening. But I can't really handicap the likelihood that it will happen or not. I would echo what Mick said earlier, that CMS has been very responsive, and I think it has highlighted the importance of DME and home-based care in ensuring that as few people are in the hospital is not. And that's a real positive. And we hope that, that cooperative working relationship will continue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Low with JPMorgan.\nDavid Low: Mick, can I just follow-up on the use of bilevel device to treat COVID-19 patients. I mean there's clearly the aerosol issue and the safety issue there. I have seen some efforts to overcome that. Do you think that's going to be on -- I mean -- and I heard your comments, excuse me, about the amount of manufacturing capacity you have. Is your expectation that there will be continued strong demand for that utilization model?\nMichael Farrell: Yes. Look, it's a great question, David. And certainly, through this crisis, one of the leading countries early on this was the U.K. and the National Institute -- the National Health Service there, the NHS. And they created a protocol, which looked at the various acuity levels of COVID-19 patient because the disease -- the coronavirus gets into the lungs and then causes the COVID-19 disease, which is where mucus builds up as the alveoli react and try to fight off the virus, and it creates mucus in the lungs and builds it up. And so at different levels of buildup, different levels of acuity, different therapies are needed. And so the NHS created a very strong protocol of using both CPAP with some supplemental oxygen from the wall as well as bilevel therapy and then upgrading to more aggressive noninvasive ventilation therapy because bilevel is noninvasive positive pressure ventilation therapy. But then upgrading to higher levels of noninvasive ventilation therapy and even upgrading all the way to the full intubation through the trachea of invasive mechanical ventilation. And all those different modes can be moved up and down by the doctor as they move through the process.  Your question about -- and it was a big question and concern early on that, oh, gosh, what if we have some contagion that some of the COVID-19 will come out? Well, before you put on an invasive mechanical ventilator, if a patient coughs or sneezes, the room is already contaminated. So even with invasive inhalation, there are some contamination protocols. And so what you need is a COVID-19 ward, you need PPE for everybody and you need to establish this floor of the hospital is for COVID-19 with negative pressure and take care of it that way. And that's what they've done in the U.K.. And actually, that moved to different parts of New York, New Jersey. And as we see this go around the world, people are learning to do that. What you have is a non-vented mask, so a ventilation mask with an inlet and outlet and then a filter on the outlet of the device. And so our Chief Medical Officer, Carlos -- Dr. Carlos Nunez, has been working with key opinion leaders worldwide, and we have a clinical white paper with best practice from Wuhan, from Milan, from London, from Munich, but they're doing it really well in Germany and from New York and around the world. And that protocol does include CPAP, it does include bilevel, it does include noninvasive ventilation with positive pressure, all with specific masks and specific circuit set up all the way up to invasive mechanical ventilation.  Now the second part of your question, after the crisis will people continue to use more noninvasive ventilation? I think the answer is yes. I think it's going to be similar to digital health, where we've had to use home sleep apnea testing, you've had to use remote patient monitoring during this crisis. And you don't want to go to a patient's home. You don't want them to have to come to a hospital. And so that's driven digital health. I think people, doctors in critical care units have seen how noninvasive ventilation, including bilevel has very well treated patients with COVID-19, why can't it very well treat COPD patients? Well, guess what? It can. So I think the adoption of NIV will increase post COVID-19 because of the learnings during COVID-19. I can't quantify that exactly. It's more a medium, long-term thing. But anyway, I hope that answers your question, David. It's a very good one. It deserves a longer answer. And I know we're 10 minutes over, we might just take two more questions and let everyone get back to their work day, 3 more questions. Okay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc.\nMatthew Mishan: And also it's really remarkable, the efforts of you and the employees of your company to support this crisis. So thank you for that as well. I'll just leave it to 1 because most of my questions have been asked. I've heard that there's potentially long-term respiratory implications from COVID-19 exposure. How do you see that patient transition to post-acute?\nMichael Farrell: Yes, it's a great question, Matthew. I'll hand that to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Rob, to talk about post COVID-19 discharge. What are the next steps, Rob?\nRobert Douglas: Yes. Thanks, Matthew. That's a good question. It's still an uncertain world in terms of what these post protocols are going to be across the board. We're seeing different trials and tests being carried out. In some areas, we are seeing patients get discharged with oxygen, and we are noticing an uptick in demand for oxygen around the place. And in other areas, we are seeing some discharges with more CPAP. But I think it's still way too early to say, probably the earliest data we've got is in China where things are normalizing a little bit. The sleep labs aren't yet open, but we're seeing continued ongoing demand for longer-term ventilation. So it's probably leading off the dynamic, that Mick mentioned earlier, that ventilation is noninvasive ventilation and chronic ventilation is recognized as a more relevant treatment than what it had been before.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley.\nSean Laaman: Well done, Mick, clearly doing a great job navigating. Sorry if I've missed it, but my question is, the $35 million of COVID revenue, was there any geographic sort of breakup of that? And just to clarify, what's that all vent revenue?\nMichael Farrell: Sean, that's a great question. Not comfortable going into details of where the $35 million came from. That's sort of our global number. And it's truly an estimate. It's -- the vast majority of it is ventilation. And so it's Astrals, Stellars, Lumis, AirCurve ST types of products. I'll hand over to Brett Sandercock, our CFO, to see if he wants to provide any further detail on that $35 million.\nBrett Sandercock: Yes. Thanks, Mick. I mean the only -- there is some -- there will be some mask and accessories things in that as well. You'd estimate making -- maybe that accounts for kind of 10% of that number and the rest would be devices.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Gretel Janu with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nGretel Janu: So you mentioned the double-digit declines in the diagnosis rates in the quarter due to lockdowns. I'm just wondering whether you saw any slowdown in the actual fleet new patient setups in the third quarter? Or will most of that impact from the slower sleep diagnosis impact the fourth quarter?\nMichael Farrell: Yes, Gretel, thanks a lot. Look, as you can understand, there's a lot of moving pieces going on right at the moment, and we're watching it through the quarter. And in different countries, and even in some countries in the world, we've seen that decline. Like in China, we saw that decline in January, February, and we're actually starting to pick up on the rates as we started to exit the quarter, and some regions of China starting to open up and then diagnosis is starting to open up again. But -- and similarly in South Korea and some other areas that have COVID-19 under control now. But I'll hand over to Jim Hollingshead to see if he wants to provide any further details the sort of kinetics of the double-digit reduction in diagnostics and any impact on sort of that headwind, I guess, of sleep device sales, while we have the neutral element of sleep masks continuing through. Jim?\nJames Hollingshead: Yes. Thanks, Mick. Thanks, Gretel. With a little bit of a lag, you can also see bit of a drop-off in new patient starts, which we have the ability through our connected solutions to see -- as I said before, I think we're seeing diagnosis stabilize a bit, and I expect some countries to start to turn back on in the near term. And we're seeing new patient starts also stabilize a bit. So hopefully, we'll -- hopefully, we get a bounce off of the floor here. It's very difficult to predict what that will look like. It will be different country-by-country and even metro area by metro area.\nMichael Farrell: Great. Well, thanks for all the questions, and thanks to everyone for continuing the 15 minutes over here. I think we'll all agree this was a very unique quarter for not just ResMed, but for all companies worldwide. Look, I'll go with the close now, I think, here and close on up. I'd like to thank again to all our shareholders who've joined us for this call. I'd also like to shout out again to the 7,500 Resmedians helping people in 140 countries. You guys are also shareholders in the most part, and I want to thank you for your dedication and hard work, helping people breathe better, sleep better and live better lives outside the hospital. Thanks for all that you do all day, every day. Thanks, especially to those frontline heroes, the people making the products, distributing the products and getting those vents to those 140 countries to somebody who's suffocating and needs our help. I look forward to talking to all of our stakeholders again here in 90 days. And with that, we'll close it up. Thank you, Diego.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Mick. Thank you all again for joining us today. And just a reminder, if you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or to Investor Relations. And as previously mentioned, all the documents, along with the transcript and a replay will be available on our website later today. Thanks, Diego. You can now close the call.\nOperator: Thank you.

            "name": "Brett Sandercock",
            "content": "Right. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 and some remarks for our Q4 outlook. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the March quarter was $769 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 17% compared to the prior year quarter. Revenues for the third quarter were favorably impacted by significant sales of ventilator devices and accessories. We estimate that the incremental revenue benefit from COVID-19-related sales was in the order of $35 million. Excluding this incremental impact, our group revenue increased by 12% in constant currency terms. Taking a closer look at geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our software-as-a-service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries were $394 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $286 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year quarter or, in constant currency terms, a 27% increase.  By product segment, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $196 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $197 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year quarter. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales totaled $195 million, an increase of 26% over the prior year quarter or, in constant currency terms, a 29% increase. Mask and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $91 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year quarter or, in constant currency terms, a 22% increase. Globally, in constant currency terms, both device sales and masks and other sales increased by 18% over the prior year quarter.  Software-as-a-service revenue for the third quarter was $90 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, SaaS revenue increased by 9%.  During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, the purchase accounting fair value adjustment to MatrixCare deferred revenue and an impairment of minority interest investments. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release.  Our non-GAAP gross margin improved by 70 basis points to 60% in the March quarter compared to 59.3% in the same quarter last year. The increase is predominantly attributable to favorable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by typical declines in average selling prices. Moving to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the third quarter were $172 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 7% compared to the prior year period. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 22.4% compared to 24.8% reported in the prior year quarter. Given the volatility in potential future revenue outcomes, I will not provide our normal guidance with respect to SG&A as a percentage of revenue. However, looking forward, we expect SG&A expenses to increase in the low single digits compared to the year ago period. R&D expenses for the quarter were $51 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 11%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.7% compared to 7.2% in the prior year. We continue to invest in our business, particularly targeted at innovation. This is evidenced by the double-digit growth in R&D expenses in Q3. We believe our long-term commitment to innovation will deliver a sustained competitive advantage.  Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses to continue to grow in the high single digits to low double digits, reflecting our commitment to innovation through the economic cycles. Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $20 million of the quarter, a decrease of 10% over the prior year quarter, reflecting historical intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the quarter. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $14 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $238 million, an increase of 31% over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong top line growth, expansion of gross margin and well-managed operating expenses. Excluding the benefit from COVID-19 impacts, we still continue to experience solid operating leverage. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $188 million, an increase of 47% over the prior year quarter. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 14.9%, while on a non-GAAP basis our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.1%.  Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 will be in the range of 18% to 20%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.29, an increase of 45% over the prior year quarter. Excluding the benefit from COVID-19 impacts, we estimate our diluted earnings per share were $1.16, an increase of 30% over the prior year quarter. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.12. Additionally, during the quarter, we recognized write-downs of $9 million associated with minority equity investments. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $240 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $30 million. Depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $46 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $56 million. During the quarter, we also completed the acquisition of our previously announced tuck-in acquisition of SnapWorx. The acquisition will be non-GAAP EPS neutral in year 1 and is expected to be accretive to non-GAAP EPS in year 2. However, overall, the impact will not be material to group earnings. We recorded equity losses of $5 million in our income statement in the March quarter associated with the Verily joint venture. We expect to record an underlying run rate of approximately $5 million of equity losses each quarter through fiscal year 2021, associated with the joint venture operations.  Given the unprecedented nature of current events, I would like to make some comments on our financial health. Strong balance sheet has always been a hallmark of ResMed and is most valued by investors in times of economic uncertainty. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $353 million, having generated $240 million in operating cash flow during the third quarter and $472 million in the first 9 months of our fiscal year 2020. As of March 31, we have $1.4 billion in gross debt and $1 billion in net debt. We had total assets of $4.5 billion. Our debt levels remain modest. And at March 31, we had a further $895 million available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility.  In summary, our liquidity position is strong. However, I also want to highlight that in these times of uncertainty, we are maintaining a disciplined approach, and we are tightly managing expenses, cash flow and liquidity. Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share. Dividends are important to many of our shareholders, and the declaration of our dividend reflects the Board's confidence in our strong liquidity position and operating performance.  Turning to our fourth quarter outlook. At a high level, we expect to see continued strong growth in our respiratory care business and expect incremental respiratory care revenue to significantly exceed in Q3. However, we expect to see a headwind in sleep device sales in Q4 in response to a temporary reduction in the diagnosis of new patients. Masks and accessories have shown resiliency over the past 3 months, which reflects the insulating value of the large patient installed base. Like many other companies, we are experiencing high uncertainty in the current environment with circumstances and information changing almost on a daily basis. And as a result, our forecast and possible future revenue outcomes remain dynamic.  And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. Yes. Thanks, Mick. I mean the only -- there is some -- there will be some mask and accessories things in that as well. You'd estimate making -- maybe that accounts for kind of 10% of that number and the rest would be devices."

            "name": "James Hollingshead",
            "content": "Thanks, Mick. Just very briefly, since I know we're probably short on time now. The gold standard therapy for sleep apnea continues to be CPAP therapy. And that -- we think that will continue for the foreseeable future. We get a chance to see a wide range of technologies as they emerge. And we always look very carefully at anything we think is an alternative. And as Mick mentioned, we obviously have a fantastic oral device, which we sell in Europe very successfully. The Narval device, high-tech, 3D printed, very low volume of the mouth, very comfortable. We've looked at the neurostim space for quite a long time. There have been a number of companies that have tried to succeed in the neurostim space. We think Nyxoah has a novel offer and is potentially disruptive, but it's very early days. It's a minority investment in what's effectively a start-up company. So we like the technology. We like to play, but we'll have to see how it plays out. Sure. Thanks, Mick. I think it's very difficult to quantify the effects and the balances of decline in in-lab testing and increase of home sleep testing in general. And it's very different country by country, both because of the timing of the pandemic and then how different health care systems are structured and so on. So trying to get a quantification, I think, is quite difficult. What we do know is we have seen some decline in in-lab testing. That's not a surprise. Health care systems around the world have shifted their focus to COVID-19. Many countries have gone in lockdown. Much of the U.S. has gone in lockdown. So we know that in-lab testing has declined and dipped.  We have some evidence to suggest it stabilized at a lower level. It's hard to know exactly what that level is, but we think it's potentially stabilized at this point. But in parallel, we also know there's been an increase in home sleep testing and remote testing. A number of the labs around the U.S. have increased their use of home sleep testing devices and routines. And where that's done in Europe and can be down in Europe, it continues to be done, and we think it will turn on faster in Europe. And then the final point of your question is what are we doing? We're actually working very hard to enable home sleep testing to figure out how to help our lab customers and our physician customers virtualize their model, not just to our device offerings, but through workflows, through webinars and trainings, and we're working hard to see if we can virtualize some of that with software, which will take a little bit more time. And we do think that a shift to home sleep testing is, which has been going on worldwide for years, will be accelerated by this.  And just as Mick said in his prepared comments, one of the things that we think will come out of the crisis generally for the sleep business is increased adoption of our already very broad offerings, virtualized care offerings. And so we think that will accelerate through the crisis and then have a new normal coming out of the crisis. Yes. I'll just add quickly, Mick. Margaret, yes, there's a lot -- there's a meaningful amount that's in transit mode so to speak, as we're trying to get those into our DCs and then ultimately to customers. So there's that -- that impacts it as well. So -- but we'll continue to produce. And as Mick said, the demand is there. It's just a matter of getting it through the logistics. Yes. Thanks, Mick. Thanks, Gretel. With a little bit of a lag, you can also see bit of a drop-off in new patient starts, which we have the ability through our connected solutions to see -- as I said before, I think we're seeing diagnosis stabilize a bit, and I expect some countries to start to turn back on in the near term. And we're seeing new patient starts also stabilize a bit. So hopefully, we'll -- hopefully, we get a bounce off of the floor here. It's very difficult to predict what that will look like. It will be different country-by-country and even metro area by metro area."

            "name": "Michael Farrell",
            "content": "Thanks, Amy, and thank you all for joining us today. These are unprecedented times, as Amy just noted. We are in the midst of a global pandemic, which is having profound effects on public health, particularly the most vulnerable among us. During this time, our top 3 goals here at ResMed are simple. Goal one is the preservation of life, helping people breathe with world-class ResMed ventilators and ventilation masks, while their own immune system fights against this novel coronavirus and the disease it causes, COVID-19.  Goal two is the safety and health of our amazing team of 7,500 ResMedians, providing solutions in 140 countries worldwide, because without our people, we can't help anyone breathe better. And goal three is the ongoing delivery of world-leading products and services to treat sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma as well as the ongoing production of market-leading software to take care of over 110 million people with care delivered by home medical equipment providers, skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes, hospice, and importantly, in the place where people prefer to be, their home.  I've never been more proud to call myself a ResMedian than I am today. Every one of our global team is fully engaged in the COVID-19 crisis. They are demonstrating impressive feats of ingenuity, compassion and drive to support patients, clinicians, providers, health systems and beyond. My e-mail inbox is overflowing daily with stories of ResMed heroes, including frontline workers, such as our own respiratory therapists and clinicians as well as ResMedians, who are showing up every day, using all of our updated safety procedures to source ventilator components from around the world, to produce ventilators and masks and tubing and software and deliver these life-changing solutions worldwide.  To share just one example from many is the story of a ResMed hero from our China team, actually in Wuhan, in Hubei province, who donned a full hazmat suit every day for the first 10 weeks of the corona outbreak in that region. He was setting up thousands of people on ResMed ventilators and ResMed masks, including a ventilator that we call the guardian angel or GA ventilator produced right there in China. We don't know how many lives this gentleman saved there in Hubei province, but I have the good fortune of calling him, my ResMed teammate. So to all those ResMed heroes, I say thank you and that I'm inspired by you and how you stepped up to help patients at the start of this crisis there in January and for the duration now through April and beyond. As a global company providing solutions in over 140 countries, we have mobilized our efforts and resources to address COVID-19 as this deadly disease moves from region to region. We have accelerated production and distribution of invasive ventilators, noninvasive ventilators, including bilevel devices as well as ventilation masks for the patients who need them most, no matter where they live.  We produced over 52,000 noninvasive ventilators, including bilevels and invasive ventilators during the quarter. This is a threefold increase on our production from the same quarter in 2019, living up to the expectations that we set publicly. We have also driven a tenfold increase in our ventilation mask production, actually more than tenfold. We are aligning distribution of these ventilation products worldwide using a global ethical epidemiology-based model of ventilation needs based on our models of the surge of COVID-19 patients around the world. And our key guiding principle is the preservation of life.  We can and will do more over the coming days, weeks, months and quarters to support health care systems as COVID-19 continues to impact countries across Asia, Europe and North America and with future patient surges just starting to begin in South America, Africa, Middle East and beyond.  We have been able to achieve these outcomes while ensuring that we always place the health, safety and wellbeing of our ResMed team at the top of our priority list. Without our people, as I said earlier, we can do nothing. Our actions have included work-from-home policies for all whose job function allows for that. We have instituted noncontact temperature screening, mask wearing policies and physical distancing protocols for all of our supply chain, production, distribution and technical service teams worldwide. While we have around 65% of our global team now working from home, these important jobs such as production, distribution and tech service just can't be done from home. We have established world-class safety and quality procedures in all of our manufacturing plants, distribution centers and offices, and we're ready to get back to work as cities and countries plan to do that. Safety and quality are part of our DNA at all times. And today, more than ever, these capabilities enable us here at ResMed to support our customers with a sustainable supply of products, services and solutions throughout this COVID-19 crisis and beyond. I also want to express my gratitude and appreciation for the extraordinary efforts of people beyond the boundary of ResMed, especially the frontline health care workers in hospitals worldwide. Respiratory therapists, critical care nurses, critical care doctors and many others have demonstrated extraordinary leadership and personal sacrifice at this time. These clinicians are triaging people with symptoms into various therapeutic pathways depending on the changing acuity of each individual with this novel coronavirus from CPAP therapy to bilevel therapy, to more advanced noninvasive ventilation as well as to full endotracheal intubation with invasive ventilation for the patients who need that.  These clinicians are using ResMed ventilators and ResMed ventilation masks with direct person-to-person engagement, which even with full personal protective equipment still includes significant risk for that clinician. We are working with customers worldwide to drive digital pathways to try to minimize unneeded person-to-person interaction. Examples of this include remote monitoring of ventilation devices, telehealth solutions and virtual patient population management. We have over 11 million devices with available connectivity to our cloud-based solutions, including myAir and AirView. We have over 13 million patients as well as over 6 billion nights, 6 billion nights of respiratory medical data in the cloud.  We had a running start in the field of digital health well before this COVID-19 crisis. One of the few positive benefits out of this awful crisis is that it has brought to the forefront the importance of digital health for the health and safety of respiratory therapists, respiratory nurses and critical care physicians. Digital health also brings benefits of more scalability, more cost efficiency and better outcomes for patients. Throughout the quarter, despite all the changes brought by this coronavirus, we have continued to execute on our long-term ResMed 2025 strategy, including digital health, expanding end-to-end pathways for sleep apnea, for COPD and for asthma as well as building the world's best out-of-hospital health care software network. Fundamentally, we believe and continue to believe, through this crisis even more so, that the future of health care is outside the hospital. That's where ResMed competes today, and that's where ResMed wins today.  The COVID-19 pandemic has proved an interesting point. The more we can establish noncontact digital health pathways at scale, the better the health of therapists, nurses and physicians and the better the efficacy, the efficiency, the scale and the quality of care for patients. We have accelerated our ability to improve over 250 million lives in outside-the-hospital health care by 2025. The fundamentals of our ResMed business is strong, even as we see uncertainty in the changing kinetics and dynamics of the COVID-19 disease as it continues to move across geographies, from Asia to Europe, to now North America and on to South America, Africa and regions worldwide. We are seeing tailwinds in our business from increased demand of our ventilators such as Astral, Stellar, Lumis as well as our noninvasive ventilators, AirCurve, Flexo and the GA. We are also seeing increased demand for ventilation mask solutions.  We do not know exactly how long the surge of demand will last for each hospital, for each city, for each country and for each region as this COVID-19 virus moves. But as patient flow surges, peaks and then flattens, we are there. And we are getting pretty good at modeling these demand curves using our global COVID-19 epidemiology model of patient flow and the learning from each city that we serve. Currently, a lot of short-term impact also depends on our ability to keep ventilator production at its maximum capacity. And as I mentioned earlier, we are already at 3x last year's production capacity. And we are doing our best to meet the surge and peak flow in multiple geographies worldwide. A key element is -- in our ability to deliver is our ability to source critical components and ship product in response to the incredible demand as this COVID-19 virus moves around the world.  I want to be clear on this point, though. Even as we face increased demand for our products, we are doing everything that we can to keep efficiency high and to keep our costs down. Our primary humanitarian goal is 100% locked. At ResMed, we are committed to enabling access to ventilators for COVID-19 patients in order to preserve life. We are keeping pricing steady, and we will not opportunistically increase prices or per unit profit in our response to COVID-19.  We believe that there will be lessons learned during the crisis that will enhance our ability here at ResMed to drive innovation in the coming quarters, coming years through our research and development pipeline, particularly in the fields of digital health technology as well as our product and software innovation. We are very competitively positioned in these fields today, but we think we will be even more so tomorrow.  While balancing our response to the global public health crisis, we have also been executing well in our core business. We have delivered strong growth in our sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses across geographies, with solid contributions from our software-as-a-service business during the quarter. In a few minutes, our CFO, Brett Sandercock, will provide the details of our third quarter financial performance, along with our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2020. But first, I'll provide just a few financial highlights and briefly discuss execution towards our ResMed 2025 strategy along with some milestones for the quarter. So for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, we delivered just around $770 million in quarterly revenue, which is up 17% year-over-year, reflecting growth and positive momentum across our product portfolio, software solutions and global markets. As part of our global COVID-19 response, we have seen tailwinds for the increased demand for invasive ventilators and noninvasive ventilators, including bilevel devices, masks and accessories, as I mentioned earlier. We estimate the incremental impact to be approximately $35 million of COVID-19-related revenue during the quarter. So from this $770 million in quarterly revenue, we generated a strong $240 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter, enabling us to return cash dividends to shareholders, as declared by our Board today.  We continue to invest in the future growth of our enterprise with double-digit increases in our research and development investments during the quarter. This R&D investment includes shifting resources to ventilators and ventilation masks and clinical research and technical help people to help clinicians, physicians, inventors and people worldwide during the COVID-19 crisis as well as keeping the ongoing innovation work going for our core sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and software-as-a-service businesses.  We have set a clear path for ResMed to maintain our position as the global leader in digital health technology, transforming the way health care is delivered for those suffering from sleep apnea, COPD and asthma as well as enabling people to live healthier lives in a portfolio of settings away from the hospital. The execution of our long-term strategy drives progress against our triple aim of: first, slowing chronic disease progression; second, reducing overall health care system costs; and third, improving the quality of life for our ultimate customer, the person who uses our products, to help them sleep better, breathe better and deliver higher quality of life away from the hospital.  We believe that when we help a person sleep better, breathe better and live a better quality of life away from acute care, this positions ResMed to help those people achieve their best health outcome in other chronic disease conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health and beyond. We are forming multiple partnerships to drive these long-term health benefits, including our joint venture with Verily and many other private partnerships beyond. Watch this space. We have three priorities that guide our daily focus. Number one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses across global markets. That's just our clear #1 priority. Number two, to deliver world-leading medical devices and digital health technology to engage physicians, providers and patients so that together, we can improve clinical outcomes, reduce costs and enhance patient experiences. That's our triple aim. And our third priority is to build the world's best software solutions network for health care that is delivered outside the hospital, and we're well on track to do that.  We have advanced on all 3 of these priorities during the quarter, and I'll briefly touch on a few recent highlights to demonstrate areas where we have momentum and are driving innovation. We had an exceptionally strong growth this quarter on a geographic and product basis, including 17% growth globally. Our team delivered strong and distributed geographic growth, including a 12% increase in the combined United States, Canada and Latin America regions as well as an incredibly strong constant currency increase of 27% across the combined Europe, Asia and other regions. As discussed earlier, there was an impact from the COVID-19 surge in demand of ventilation in the quarter of around $35 million in revenue, so that's around 4.5% of the $770 million in revenues for the quarter. In short, our core underlying business remained robust, over and above that of the ongoing surge of demand. On a product basis, during the last 12 months, we improved over 16 million lives by providing a person with a ResMed device or a ResMed complete mask system to help them breathe better and live a better life. Including our digital health solutions for out-of-hospital software in this number, we impacted together over 110 million lives during these last 12 months. The ability to improve these lives is supported by over 6 billion nights of respiratory medical data in the cloud. These data allow us to perform sophisticated data analytics and to drive actionable insights for the benefit of customers, including patients, physicians, providers and health care systems. This makes ResMed the global leader in digital health for our field and the partner of choice for our customers, helping them increase efficiency, reduce costs and improve outcomes. So shifting to a discussion of our core sleep apnea business. We are seeing significant impact from the COVID-19-related lockdowns on new patient diagnoses in sleep. We have seen double-digit declines in diagnosis rates in affected markets. Many sleep clinics, especially hospital clinics are temporarily closed. And many pulmonary and critical care physicians that often work in sleep clinics are shifting their focus to treat COVID-19 patients as the surge comes to their city, their region, their state, their hospital. It is important to note that we have seen the mask and accessories resupply dimension of our business not only maintained, but actually increased during the quarter.  As we look forward, there is uncertainty and it's not clear to what extent the upsurge in ventilation device and ventilation mask revenue will offset the decline in sleep device revenue and whether sleep mask revenue will maintain its growth or decelerate somewhat. But we know these facts, number one, the sleep apnea prevalence remains incredibly high, over 936 million people worldwide. And we know, fact two, that there is a backlog of diagnostic activity for sleep apnea and COPD that many clinics and physicians are preparing to ramp up their home sleep apnea testing, both now during the crisis and in the future as lockdowns are lifted around the world.  For the on-premise or in-laboratory tests for sleep apnea, we are modeling how those will scale back up again customer-by-customer, city-by-city and country-by-country as the economy opens up and primary care physician visits and elective medical procedures come back online through telehealth and beyond. Physicians and therapists will then have to work through the backlog of undiagnosed patients that has been built through the COVID-19 lockdown in their region, with a portfolio of both home sleep apnea testing and in-lab tests.  The velocity of the diagnostic pathway return rate will depend on local regulations and behaviors and what we're calling a new normal for patient care. We have real-time experience of the opening back up in some cities in Asia and throughout Europe, and we're starting to see them open up in the U.S. And we have modeled these open-ups carefully to ensure that we can best support customers as they start their home sleep apnea test scale and their in-lab test scale over time to meet the backlog of demand. Even today, around the world, we're working closely with our customers to accelerate these home sleep apnea testing models and remote patient setup on sleep apnea therapy where customers are pursuing those pathways as well as our ongoing remote sleep apnea patient monitoring. And I mentioned earlier, we have over 11 million, 100% cloud connectable medical devices out there in the field and more that are distributed every day.  It's important to note that these types of partnerships aren't new due to COVID-19. These are things we've been working on for years and decades in some states. And we believe these types of digital health and telehealth and remote monitoring models will only increase due to COVID-19 and as we move into a post-COVID-19 world.  In terms of digital health innovation, we have recently rolled out a new pilot telehealth over video chat so that the physician can not only access information on Air Solutions and AirView, but it can also interact directly with the patient. And we think that will reduce the need for a recovered COVID-19 patient to return to the emergency room or a physician outpatient setting. We view this as a trend that will be accelerated by a combination of changes in reimbursement methodologies and overall focus on safety and the preventative and health benefits for both the patient and the health care worker.  Solutions like this can provide incredible scale when leveraged across a digital health network, including over 110 million patient lives. As I noted earlier, our investments in research and development grew by double digits in the quarter, and we put these R&D monies to work to expedite the tripling of ventilator production in the quarter and tenfold capacity increase in our ventilation mask production. We have also formed partnerships with clinicians around the world to help with the COVID-19 crisis, to help create and share clinical white paper, best practice solutions in clinical practice to help with COVID-19 ventilation management, including triage between CPAP, oxygen, bilevel therapy, noninvasive ventilation therapy and invasive ventilation therapy. At the same time, though, we have continued to invest in our core businesses for future growth in sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and software-as-a-service.  As an example of this innovation in our core sleep apnea business, we introduced during the quarter the AirFit F30i. This is the first CPAP mask with a tube-up design in the full face category. This product now gives ResMed the most complete full face mask portfolio versus all our competition on the planet. So what does this tube-up design of the AirFit F30i do for customers? In essence, it gives the freedom of movement back to that ultimate customer, the patient, so they can sleep naturally in any position. The best lumber architecture follows during the night. The F30i also has an innovative cushion that prevents irritation on the nasal bridge, and it has a quick release elbow that allows users to quickly disconnect and reattach the mask from its tubing, making it very simple to start therapy at the start of the night and to stop therapy in the morning.  All this technology built into the AirFit F30i supports the third tenet of our triple aim, to improve the quality of life for the patient. If they have freedom of movement and don't wake up, that improves their sleep, it improves their day, it improves their life. Clearly, it is very early in the product life cycle for the F30i, and this product was launched amid a pretty unique global environment. However, despite some of the noise in the signal, we've been able to see good early acceptance as physicians, respiratory therapists and that ultimate customer, the patient, recognize the benefit and functionality of the innovation in the F30i.  Additionally, during the quarter, we invested $100,000 in partnership with the not-for-profit American Thoracic Society Foundation through a research grant. The goal of the research and the study is to look at how remote monitoring can help improve the management of patients with COPD. The study aims to detect early changes in lung function from daily recordings and to notify patients and/or physicians when to commence more intensive treatment or to seek high-level medical attention.  Nearly 400 million people suffer from COPD worldwide, and we do not believe these people are well served currently by global health care systems. Our vision of better management for COPD patients through the use of digital health technologies will be accelerated from the findings of this study. It's great to partner with the nonprofit ATS Foundation to help this move forward.  As we discussed earlier, COVID-19 has accelerated the movement to fully remote care in our core sleep apnea and ventilation businesses. Looking at our growing digital health solutions for COPD and asthma, the Propeller platform continues to play an important role in keeping patients outside the hospital, out of acute care locations, leveraging the Propeller's world-leading pharmaceutical adherence technology for these diseases.  Active use of Propeller technology has actually increased during the COVID-19 crisis. We think this is due to the rising awareness of the importance of respiratory health and the fact that people just don't want to go to acute care settings, and so they're using preventative medicines more to do so. While it's not yet material to ResMed's overall revenue, we are seeing increased interest in Propeller's technology to support health systems with population health. We'll keep you updated on any significant milestones with our pharmaceutical partners as well as our work with global health care system partners throughout calendar year 2020 and 2021 as they adopt the Propeller platform for COPD, asthma and beyond.  Before I transition to a discussion of our out-of-hospital software-as-a-service business, I'd like to recap briefly why we believe that the SaaS business is critical to ResMed's long-term success and how it fits into our broader portfolio. Our consistent view of the evolution of the health care system is that care will be delivered outside the hospital. The contamination of hospitals with COVID-19 is just one of the latest examples of the types of contagions that are present in many hospital locations worldwide. Our vision is to enable a system where a patient can seamlessly transfer across a portfolio of outside hospital care settings, from home care providers to skilled nursing facilities, to home health, to independent living, assisted senior living and beyond. These settings have reduced costs versus the hospital as well as increased efficiency and better health outcomes than the hospital. People are simply happier and healthier in the residential setting of their choice, and the ultimate residence of choice is their home.  The SaaS business clearly leverages the global trend for seniors to want to age in place and supports ResMed's continued execution against the triple aim. Our SaaS businesses enable us to participate more deeply in broader chronic disease across a patient's life cycle, creating additional strategic growth options. During the quarter, our software-as-a-service business grew at 12% from the period a year ago. We are integrating and optimizing this out-of-hospital SaaS portfolio to support long-term growth. We continue to believe that the long-term weighted average growth of the SaaS markets that we serve is in the high single digits. We clearly beat that growth this quarter, and we plan to exceed that rate in the long run as we execute to our SaaS strategy. During the COVID-19 crisis, many out-of-hospital health care settings have switched their use to support overflow from hospitals. And there has also been a reduction in patient flow to these out-of-hospital facilities due to a reduction in elective surgeries at hospitals. Skilled nursing facilities and nursing home volumes have been extremely hard hit by COVID-19, and this will impact our MatrixCare business growth in the coming quarters. We expect market growth in our current portfolio of SaaS businesses that we serve to be in the mid single-digit range for the next few quarters, before its recovery to high single-digit growth in the medium to long term as the COVID-19 surge passes and people return to their primary care physicians and return to their elective surgeries and patient volume returns. In support of the increased growth of the SaaS portfolio, during the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of a company called SnapWorx. SnapWorx provides patient contact management and workflow optimization for sleep apnea resupply for our HME customers. The combination of Brightree's technology and live call services with this new SnapWorx tech creates the largest resupply base in the industry with end-to-end workflow automation for HME customers. Resupply is an area of the HME business that has been a strong ballast in the boat during the COVID-19 lockdowns. And these types of programs, including Brightree and SnapWorx together, set up our customers for ongoing success and better patient engagement through the crisis and beyond. In summary, the SaaS portfolio is an important driver of our long-term success and a critical enabler of our ability to impact our triple aim. We are investing for long-term growth in SaaS and leadership in this space.  Our performance across the entire ResMed portfolio during the quarter demonstrates the resiliency of our business during, what I would call, extremely challenging global times. And it highlights the dedications of ResMedians all over the world and the dedication of our customers, the clinicians, providers and health systems to deliver for the people who need our help. Looking forward, we are modeling impacts of headwinds and tailwinds from the COVID-19 crisis, with detailed scenarios of impacts by customer, by city, by region and by business line. While we face temporary headwinds in sleep apnea diagnosis and SaaS patient business flows I just talked about, we are also seeing tailwinds from increased demand for our ventilation devices, our ventilation masks around the world. The fundamentals of our overall business is strong, but these are uncertain times and the crisis continues to unfold across geographies, and we don't know exactly how long the related headwinds and the related tailwinds will last. We don't know specifically by each city, country and region how fast they will open up, but we know they will open up. And as we have seen in Asia and Europe, as these economies open up over the coming days, weeks and months, ResMed will be there to serve them. And we know one thing that as they start to open up, there has been and will be a backlog of patients who need the channel's help for sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and out-of-hospital health care needs. We're investing now to be ready for those realities of the open-up so that we can be there to support our customers with the best digital health solutions and the most scalable solutions to help them grow now. We are leading from the front.  The nature of the COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the importance of our digital health strategies I mentioned earlier. Our ability to improve over 250 million lives by 2025 in out-of-hospital health care is not only on track, we think it's accelerated these last 3 months. This is the one welcome benefit in what has been incredibly challenging 90 days for every company, not just ResMed in every nation, every government dealing with this crisis. We're glad that we have made extensive investments in remote monitoring, remote patient setup, digital health, population health management over the last 5, 10-plus years that we can now offer and bring to the market to help them when they need it.  The combination of accelerated digital health technology and the recognition of the value of remote monitoring and the projected changes that are already happening in global reimbursement models for digital health, combined with the growing acceptance of virtual diagnosis and virtual setup, represents a new and significant medium to long-term tailwind for the ResMed business. This combined with our strong pipeline of new products and digital health solutions, including sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and the out-of-hospital SaaS gives us strong confidence in our future. We think this is a unique positioning that solidifies our leadership role in global digital health in med tech, but will also support ResMed's growth over the medium to long term. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I'd like to commit that while we have already played a significant role providing tens of thousands of ventilators, many, many more ventilation masks and clinical support to clinicians worldwide to fight the COVID-19 crisis, we are not done. We will do even more in the coming quarter and the coming quarters to deliver more ventilators, more ventilation masks for countries as they go through the patient surge. And we will be there to support health care systems around the world in respiratory medicine and digital health not only during this COVID-19 crisis, but in what we call the new normal post-COVID-19 world that will be more digitally enabled and more digitally connected than ever before.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett in Sydney. Brett? Thanks, Lyanne. Thanks for the question. And yes, you're right. We had 2 separate metrics that we sort of laid out there. One that we sold an extra $35 million worth of ventilator in the quarter. Those were from our inventory and stuff that we produced in Q2 and some in Q3 and so that was a $35 million tailwind for our business, and we expect some of that certainly to continue as the surge continues worldwide into Q4. And then in addition to that, we tripled our production from a year ago, and we made over 52,000 noninvasive ventilators, bilevel devices and invasive ventilators.  So your question of, can we continue and/or increase the production capacity? And the answer is absolutely yes. We are constrained on some key components for the invasive ventilators. So the Astral and Stellar have some significant constraints in the components that go into those invasive ventilators of the Astral and Stellar type products. Well, Astral is an invasive ventilator and Stellar is actually noninvasive ventilator. But we really don't have significant constraints to the Lumis STA other than some components around the alarms module and the extra components and the AirCurve ST. So those noninvasive ventilators can scale to 5x or 10x, and we can really scale to whatever the demand is. And so then it comes down to our ability to predict hospital-by-hospital, customer-by-customer, what those surges in demand are going to be as the virus moves around the world and to make sure that ResMed is there, getting an order and making sure we can deliver those invasive ventilators, but really importantly, those noninvasive ventilators and alternative therapies that are also used in the different levels of acuity for a patient with COVID-19. So the answer in short is, absolutely. We did all we could, and we tripled production in the quarter, and we are looking to do that and more in Q4 to deliver for the needs that continue worldwide. I am going to say, Lyanne, the audio wasn't fantastic during that, but I think I heard you say that how would we or how fast would we move from the sort of 3x increases to a 5x or 10x on AirCurve ST, that's going to be dependent upon our modeling of the different surges that happen city-by-city and country-by-country. And clearly, the masks are used far more rapidly because they are changed over pretty regularly certainly patient-to-patient, but often day-to-day with these non-vented ventilation masks. And so we expect the surge to continue and us to continue to be able to produce throughout Q4 and beyond for the needs as this goes -- as this virus goes around the world and continues to expand. Yes, I've got to say, I can't -- I think I heard you say, can we increase the ventilation mask production? We've increased it tenfold, and we'll continue to do so. I think we should go to the next question. Sorry, Lyanne. Thanks, Suraj. It's a great question. And as you know, you followed our stock for a long time. We look at a portfolio of investments to treat sleep apnea. And around 10 years ago, we actually invested in the 3D printing of a sleep apnea dental device called Narval, and that's now a great part of our portfolio and treats a great number of patients in France and across Northern Europe. The neurostimulation market is an interesting one and Nyxoah, we think, is a leader in that space, and we decided to make a minority equity investment in them. I'll actually hand over to Jim Hollingshead, who's the President of our Global Sleep business, to talk about how neurostim, dental, CPAP and how it all fits together. Yes, Chris, thanks for the question. And yes, certainly, every country around the world is different. I presume you're asking about the U.S. payer mix, Chris? Maybe you're on mute, but I'll start with the U.S. Okay. So obviously, we sell in 140 countries outside the U.S. and on the reimbursed part of our business, the non-SaaS part, it's close to that 60-40 range, 60% being within the U.S. and 40% being beyond that. And if you include SaaS businesses, it's more like 65% of our global business in the U.S. So I'll start with that. So we don't have contracts directly with payers, but our portfolio of home medical equipment customers do. And there's around 5,000 customers in the U.S home medical equipment providers, and their payer mix for the field of sleep apnea and COPD that we serve is around 20%, maybe 25% for some regions, Medicare; and around 75%, 80%, private pay.  And as we've seen through the COVID-19 crisis, we have seen ongoing payments from the -- both the government and private payers through to ResMed. We are carefully watching our accounts receivable. And as Brett said, we're carefully watching our cash flow to make sure that payers pay on time and with time, but we haven't seen any issues as yet. Clearly, unemployment has increased in the country from single digits to double digits through this crisis, and it's something that all companies are looking at very carefully. But we haven't seen any issues as yet, but we are watching the cash flow very carefully to make sure that we have continuing flow of capital and cash through our business. Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. And certainly, there's -- it's quite interesting. As you know, you've followed us for a long time, too, Mike. Our installed base of CPAP patients, sleep apnea patients is a very strong part of our mask business. We're talking north of 80-plus percent of our masks sales across the U.S. are to that installed base, the diagnosed patient who loves their therapies, changed their life and they're going to go and reorder every time. I think the focus of COVID-19, and that it's a respiratory medical issue and that has raised the importance of making sure that your lungs are well taken care of and that you breathe well and your overall health is well, has increased people to make sure they get their prescriptions for everything, including heart attack. Post heart attack patients are getting more prescription pills. As I noted earlier, the Propeller side, COPD medicines and asthma medicines, we're seeing increased use of those in respiratory medical health.  And we've seen a similar thing, I think, in the CPAP mask side, where when you are capable of getting a mask, you are more likely to click, yes, I would like that. And we haven't seen any reduction in people saying, \"Oh the co-pay is too high or I don't want to go there.\" We've seen actually the reverse where people are saying, \"wow, it's been 90 days, I'm due for a therapy, for a CPAP mask, tubing, et cetera.\" And they're clicking yes, and they're getting those devices delivered to them. So very strong ballast in the boat for our HME customers. And the HME customers themselves are really focusing on this part of their business because it's a good opportunity for them. We think -- look, there will be some deceleration if there is some sort of that surge of the sort of the toilet paper model where I'm going to over inventory, you all going to make sure I've got enough masks. That might decelerate somewhat, but we don't think -- we think there's a lot of ballast in that. And people who are on CPAP therapy and loving the CPAP therapy are going to want to get new masks. And through COVID and beyond, the importance of respiratory medicine will only be increased because of this. So we think that part of that business is very steady through the crisis and even stronger beyond. I think it will change behaviors that will last well beyond COVID-19 surge. Yes. Great follow-up question, Mike. And we're doing a lot in that space. I'm focused a lot with Rob Douglas on our global task force on COVID-19 and ventilators. Jim Hollingshead, at the same time, has been running our sleep business strongly. Jim, do you want to follow up on the -- follow-up there on home sleep apnea testing and scale? Margaret, that's a great question. And yes, certainly, we did -- you heard correctly. We made 52,000 noninvasive ventilators and invasive ventilators. So that includes everything across the Astral, Stellar, Lumis, Flexo, GA and AirCurve, all those devices. So we included across all that group, 52,000, and they have very different pricing. But clearly, it's a lot more than just the $35 million of sales in that quarter. So we are prepared for demand ahead. The only thing I'm really willing to say on a public call like this is that we have a public capability with the U.S. government through HHS and FEMA of over $30 million contract. And so that's a fixed contract that we will fulfill, mostly in Astrals.  And -- but we have many other contracts with hospitals, states, governments, nations around the world. I'm not going to go in and quantify any of those. They're usually one to one directly to those countries and directly to those hospitals. But what I can tell you is all the demand that they have and all the supply that we have, our supplies just cannot keep up with the demand as it moves around the world. And so what we're doing is maximizing production in advance and then making sure we get through the peak and through the surge, but not have an over amount of inventory at the other side. And so we're carefully managing the peak, the surge, the flattening and then making sure we get back to normal COPD, neuromuscular disease, ALS and other sales with those ventilators because those patients will be there beyond. And that's how we're looking at it, Margaret. But yes, clearly, we are preparing for more sales in the future of those ventilators and ventilation masks. That -- those tailwinds will last through Q4 and likely beyond. Yes, Steve, those are great questions. And I've had actually quite a lot of conference calls with the FDA commissioner, Hahn; and HHS secretary, Azar, during this crisis. ResMed was part of a Defense Production Act that was put in place by the White House to secure component supply for our ventilator so that we could supply HHS, FEMA and beyond. And so I had a lot of interaction there. Look, the FDA have really been a great partner through this process. They helped us get Emergency Use Authorization, EUA, for a number of our products to be used in different context. So for instance, our noninvasive ventilators, which were very scalable. And as we talked about, we made tens of thousands this quarter. We had doctors wanting to use them in various ways, invasive ways and others. And so the doctors needed an EUA to be able to do that, and they have got that. And the FDA were very quick to us and other manufacturers in providing those Emergency Use Authorizations.  Simultaneously, Secretary, Azar, over at Health and Human Services and CMS, they did take noninvasive ventilators out of competitive bidding around 2021, and that was a very good change for our HME customers. It really took a load off for them knowing that these NIV and ventilation businesses will be good ongoing concerns for them. So we saw a good partnership from both the FDA and HHS as part of this crisis. And HHS also worked with FEMA to make sure that we got the demand, and that was the $30-plus million contract I talked about to us, and there were 5 other manufacturers who got contracts as well. I think the government, not just in the U.S., but in all 100-plus countries that we're working with through this crisis, have done a great job in contacting us, working with us, helping us with supply chains and helping us with delivery of ventilators to people in the need for this crisis. Yes. I'll hand that over to Dave. He's got more insight on that, David Pendarvis? Yes. Look, it's a great question, David. And certainly, through this crisis, one of the leading countries early on this was the U.K. and the National Institute -- the National Health Service there, the NHS. And they created a protocol, which looked at the various acuity levels of COVID-19 patient because the disease -- the coronavirus gets into the lungs and then causes the COVID-19 disease, which is where mucus builds up as the alveoli react and try to fight off the virus, and it creates mucus in the lungs and builds it up. And so at different levels of buildup, different levels of acuity, different therapies are needed. And so the NHS created a very strong protocol of using both CPAP with some supplemental oxygen from the wall as well as bilevel therapy and then upgrading to more aggressive noninvasive ventilation therapy because bilevel is noninvasive positive pressure ventilation therapy. But then upgrading to higher levels of noninvasive ventilation therapy and even upgrading all the way to the full intubation through the trachea of invasive mechanical ventilation. And all those different modes can be moved up and down by the doctor as they move through the process.  Your question about -- and it was a big question and concern early on that, oh, gosh, what if we have some contagion that some of the COVID-19 will come out? Well, before you put on an invasive mechanical ventilator, if a patient coughs or sneezes, the room is already contaminated. So even with invasive inhalation, there are some contamination protocols. And so what you need is a COVID-19 ward, you need PPE for everybody and you need to establish this floor of the hospital is for COVID-19 with negative pressure and take care of it that way. And that's what they've done in the U.K.. And actually, that moved to different parts of New York, New Jersey. And as we see this go around the world, people are learning to do that. What you have is a non-vented mask, so a ventilation mask with an inlet and outlet and then a filter on the outlet of the device. And so our Chief Medical Officer, Carlos -- Dr. Carlos Nunez, has been working with key opinion leaders worldwide, and we have a clinical white paper with best practice from Wuhan, from Milan, from London, from Munich, but they're doing it really well in Germany and from New York and around the world. And that protocol does include CPAP, it does include bilevel, it does include noninvasive ventilation with positive pressure, all with specific masks and specific circuit set up all the way up to invasive mechanical ventilation.  Now the second part of your question, after the crisis will people continue to use more noninvasive ventilation? I think the answer is yes. I think it's going to be similar to digital health, where we've had to use home sleep apnea testing, you've had to use remote patient monitoring during this crisis. And you don't want to go to a patient's home. You don't want them to have to come to a hospital. And so that's driven digital health. I think people, doctors in critical care units have seen how noninvasive ventilation, including bilevel has very well treated patients with COVID-19, why can't it very well treat COPD patients? Well, guess what? It can. So I think the adoption of NIV will increase post COVID-19 because of the learnings during COVID-19. I can't quantify that exactly. It's more a medium, long-term thing. But anyway, I hope that answers your question, David. It's a very good one. It deserves a longer answer. And I know we're 10 minutes over, we might just take two more questions and let everyone get back to their work day, 3 more questions. Okay. Yes, it's a great question, Matthew. I'll hand that to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Rob, to talk about post COVID-19 discharge. What are the next steps, Rob? Sean, that's a great question. Not comfortable going into details of where the $35 million came from. That's sort of our global number. And it's truly an estimate. It's -- the vast majority of it is ventilation. And so it's Astrals, Stellars, Lumis, AirCurve ST types of products. I'll hand over to Brett Sandercock, our CFO, to see if he wants to provide any further detail on that $35 million. Yes, Gretel, thanks a lot. Look, as you can understand, there's a lot of moving pieces going on right at the moment, and we're watching it through the quarter. And in different countries, and even in some countries in the world, we've seen that decline. Like in China, we saw that decline in January, February, and we're actually starting to pick up on the rates as we started to exit the quarter, and some regions of China starting to open up and then diagnosis is starting to open up again. But -- and similarly in South Korea and some other areas that have COVID-19 under control now. But I'll hand over to Jim Hollingshead to see if he wants to provide any further details the sort of kinetics of the double-digit reduction in diagnostics and any impact on sort of that headwind, I guess, of sleep device sales, while we have the neutral element of sleep masks continuing through. Jim? Great. Well, thanks for all the questions, and thanks to everyone for continuing the 15 minutes over here. I think we'll all agree this was a very unique quarter for not just ResMed, but for all companies worldwide. Look, I'll go with the close now, I think, here and close on up. I'd like to thank again to all our shareholders who've joined us for this call. I'd also like to shout out again to the 7,500 Resmedians helping people in 140 countries. You guys are also shareholders in the most part, and I want to thank you for your dedication and hard work, helping people breathe better, sleep better and live better lives outside the hospital. Thanks for all that you do all day, every day. Thanks, especially to those frontline heroes, the people making the products, distributing the products and getting those vents to those 140 countries to somebody who's suffocating and needs our help. I look forward to talking to all of our stakeholders again here in 90 days. And with that, we'll close it up. Thank you, Diego."

            "content": "Yes. So thanks, Steve. We, along with the rest of the industry, have been suggesting to CMS that they either delay for a year the introduction of the 2021 round entirely or at least the respiratory offerings, respiratory product codes within that offering of the 2021 round of competitive bidding. We have had a dialogue with CMS on that topic, so they are listening. But I can't really handicap the likelihood that it will happen or not. I would echo what Mick said earlier, that CMS has been very responsive, and I think it has highlighted the importance of DME and home-based care in ensuring that as few people are in the hospital is not. And that's a real positive. And we hope that, that cooperative working relationship will continue."

We're seeing different trials and tests being carried out. In some areas, we are seeing patients get discharged with oxygen, and we are noticing an uptick in demand for oxygen around the place. And in other areas, we are seeing some discharges with more CPAP. But I think it's still way too early to say, probably the earliest data we've got is in China where things are normalizing a little bit. The sleep labs aren't yet open, but we're seeing continued ongoing demand for longer-term ventilation. So it's probably leading off the dynamic, that Mick mentioned earlier, that ventilation is noninvasive ventilation and chronic ventilation is recognized as a more relevant treatment than what it had been before."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin.\nAmy Wakeham: Great, thank you, Christine. Good afternoon and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us, and welcome to ResMed's second quarter fiscal year 2020 earnings call. This call is being webcast live and the replay, along with a copy of the earnings press release and our updated investor presentation, will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today. Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results are CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett Sandercock. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. During our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please review the notes to today's earnings release. As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.\nMick Farrell: Great, thanks Amy, and I'll go a little fast on my prepared remarks so we still have time for Q&A, despite the phone difficulties. Thanks, Amy. And thank you to all our shareholders for joining us today as we review results for ResMed's second quarter of fiscal year 2020. On today's call, I will discuss our long-term strategy. I'll then review top level financial results, some business highlights from the quarter, and a few key milestones. Then, I'll hand the call over to Brett who will walk you through our financials in further detail. Our team achieved another quarter of strong revenue growth across the portfolio driven by superb performance in the mask category, particularly in the US market with good performance across the 140 countries where we provide our solutions. We continue to take market share with our software solutions that enable increased therapy adherence with resupply programs providing support to those who need it and with our innovative new products. Customers are voting with their wallets and they are voting for ResMed. As the world's leading software driven medical device company, we are using digital health technology to transform the industry. We have sold nearly 11 million, 100% cloud connectable medical devices into the market, and Air Solutions our cloud-based ecosystem manages more than 12 million patients. In the last 12 months, we have changed over 15 million lives by providing a person with a ResMed device or complete ResMed mask system to help them breathe better and live better lives. In addition, our Brightree and MatrixCare software systems are helping to manage 90 million more people outside the hospital. Digital health technology is an integrator across everything that ResMed does. AirView, myAir, Propeller, and a portfolio of other digital health solutions allow us to better engage with our customers and partners, including patients, physicians, providers, payers, and complete healthcare systems. We are investing in advanced analytics and expanding our capabilities in machine learning and machine intelligence so that we can grow this digital health ecosystem at double digits on a volume basis. We will grow from just over 100 million lives improved with our healthcare products and solutions as we ended 2019 to our ambitious forward looking goal of improving 250 million lives in 2025. We now have over 5.5 billion nights of respiratory medical data in the cloud, and we are analyzing these data to derive actionable insights for the benefit of patients, physicians, providers, and healthcare systems. Our relentless focus on product and software innovation continues to set us apart from our competition. We have massive opportunities ahead in sleep apnea, in COPD, as well as in outside the hospital software to help patients live better quality lives, to help patients and healthcare systems save money, and to help achieve better management of chronic disease. We believe that the future of healthcare is outside the hospital. That's where ResMed competes today and that's where we are winning today. We have the right elements in place to achieve our strategy and to drive financial success as we provide market-leading value to customers. Let's now briefly review our top level financial results. We achieved another quarter of double digit revenue growth. We're up 14% in constant currency across our portfolio. This growth continues to be well balanced across our domestic US, as well as our global product sales, as well as from our software-as-a-service business. We continue to deliver operating leverage with non-GAAP operating profit growth of 21% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.21. I'd like to focus now on our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. In the device\u2019s category, we delivered a good quarter with year-over-year constant currency device growth of 8% globally supported by strong 9% device growth in the United States, Canada, and Latin America geographies as well as by improving Europe, Asia, and rest of world growth, which was at 6% constant currency in the device category. We continue to face headwinds for device growth in France as a result of the 2018 and 2019 digital health related fleet upgrades. We expect that the headwinds will begin to abate in the upcoming European summer, and we will start to return to market growth for devices in France during fiscal year 2021. Underlying patient growth remains healthy around the globe, and we continue to benefit from strong market dynamics with over 900 million people worldwide suffering from undiagnosed and untreated sleep apnea. Growth in the masks and accessories category of our business was incredibly strong during the quarter. We were up 16% constant currency globally in this category, well ahead of market growth rates, indicating that we gained significant market share with our latest patient interface innovations. Removing the impact of some software within this category, we are still growing our global mask franchise in the mid-teens. Our flagship masks the AirFit F20 and the AirFit N20 continued their growth across global markets. The success of these masks was augmented by continued good uptake of our more recent mask launches. We have launched a steady rhythm of mass innovation over the past 15 months. We have just lapped the successful launch of the F30 in the December quarter, and we will lap the launch of the N30, the N30i, and the P30i during the coming 12 months. The F30i was launched just over a week ago combining the needs for patients in the Freedom and the Minimalist mask segments.  With our portfolio of solutions, we are ensuring that we have the right mask for every patient, every time. We are innovating and expanding our mask portfolio to offer comprehensive options for physicians and home care providers, and for the specific needs of the ultimate customer, and that's the person who suffocates every night with sleep apnea. We remain focused on driving innovation to meet underserved customer needs. We are creating future products that are smaller, quieter, more comfortable, and more customized to each person's needs. Through digital health technologies, such as the myAir app, we are driving patient engagement without therapy, so that people can enjoy the benefits of better breathing and better sleep. We have well over 2 million patients using myAir and leveraging its insights and personalized feedback through coaching algorithms. In parallel, we are also ensuring that the cost of sleep apnea as a chronic disease can be better managed by physicians, providers, payers, and healthcare systems. Our Digital end-to-end solutions combined with available 100% cloud connectivity, as well as information provided to patients on their own smartphones are all leading to significant improvements in cost, improvements in healthcare outcomes and improvements in quality of life. We believe cloud based software combined with world leading medical devices can add value and improve both clinical outcomes as well as the patient experience. On the partnership front, our joint venture with Verily is creating software solutions to help identify and engage and enroll people with sleep apnea on a journey to better sleep and better breathing. We have commenced pilots in a handful of US cities to improve awareness, identification and engagement with the importance of good sleep and breathing to overall health. Our philosophy is this, the more a person knows about how much they suffocate every night, and the consequences of that suffocation on their overall health outcomes, the more likely they will seek solutions. At its simplest level, this partnership will drive incremental growth in our core sleep apnea business over the longer term and on a deeper level. This partnership will also allow ResMed to participate in a broad chronic disease management platform covering sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health and beyond. I'd like to now focus on our business in respiratory care. There are nearly 400 million people suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD worldwide. We don't believe these people are well served by global healthcare systems today and many COPD patients are frequent visitors to hospital emergency rooms with admissions and frequent readmissions. We have a vision to better manage COPD patients through the use of technology with digital end-to-end solutions. Technology such as our Propeller platform helps how patients are communicated to, it helps how they are encouraged in the medical care and it helps how folks are looked after as an individual person. We believe that technology combined with world leading medical equipment can add substantial value to improve both clinical outcomes and the patient experience. We plan to offer a portfolio of solutions through all stages of COPD progression. We will be there with Stage 1 and Stage 2 COPD patients as they commence inhaled pharmaceutical therapy managed by the Propeller platform. We will be there with Stage 2 and Stage 3 COPD patients as they add portable oxygen therapy to their care. We will also be there with Stage 3 and Stage 4 COPD patients as they commence non-invasive ventilation therapy and ultimately life support ventilation therapy. We will manage the person on one end-to-end digital health COPD platform, helping the patient, helping their caregivers and loved ones, as well as helping their physicians and providers so that they have the right information at the right time, lowering costs and improving outcomes. Our team at Propeller continues to progress their business as we move along the path from pilot trials to commercial partnerships with both pharmaceutical partners and healthcare systems. The digital health opportunity with inhaled respiratory medicine adherence will take time to build and we are making good progress. In December Propeller was included the only chronic respiratory disease solution in Express Scripts first formulary for digital health solutions. In November, access for Propeller users was expanded to pharmacy services from CVS, from Walmart, from Kroger and from Rite Aid. This was access directly from the Propeller app via my pharmacy feature within that smartphone application. We will update you on the milestones for Propeller with partners in both pharma as well as healthcare systems as we move forward throughout 2020. Finally, I'd like to focus on our software as a service business. We continue to integrate and optimize the out of hospital SAAS portfolio for long-term growth. We are focused on leveraging our competitive advantage as the only strategic player competing with leading software solutions focused on home medical equipment providers, skilled nursing facilities as well as home health and hospice providers. Our SAAS portfolio revenue grew 37% year-on-year this last quarter, benefiting from the MatrixCare acquisition that we left during November. We estimate that the weighted average market growth rate of these sectors we compete in is in the high single digits, excluding the timing benefit of the MatrixCare acquisition and on a pro forma basis, our SAAS portfolio grew in line with market in Q2. Our plan is to beat that market growth rate over the medium to long-term. As we reached the fourth anniversary of our Brightree tree acquisition here in 2020, we are achieving strong [Technical Difficulty] in our home medical equipment or HME sector with our Brightree team in Atlanta. We just passed the one year anniversary without MatrixCare acquisition in the quarter and we are increasing our investments in our MatrixCare team up there in Minneapolis. This investment is focused on new module introduction for our MatrixCare platform, so that we can ensure that we're able to grow and share in our skilled nursing facility as well as home health and hospice sectors as we move forward. We're doing the hard work to make MatrixCare as successful as Brightree is in the ResMed portfolio. And we have all the elements in place to do that. It took around 24 months to see strong sustainable returns from our investments in R&D and our management team at Brightree. We think we can meet or beat that timeline for strong and sustainable returns from our MatrixCare investments that we are currently making. Last quarter, we announced a collaboration with Cerner as the new preferred partner for home health and hospice software for Cerner's customers. It is early days in that partnership and things are going very well. We've started to migrate existing home health and hospice customers to our MatrixCare solution. Our sales team is actively engaged with Cerner's sales team, with customers learning of the benefits of our MatrixCare, home health and hospice software. We are excited to drive growth from this partnership. The rich interoperability between our two solutions will provide value for both Cerner and ResMed and customers as well as their patients and residents. I would like to take a moment to announce and exciting technology tuck-in acquisition that we are just in the process of completing. Just this week Brightree signed an agreement to acquire a company called SnapWorx. SnapWorx is a privately held software company that provides patient contact management and workflow optimization for sleep apnea resupply. The combination of Brightree's technology and logical services with this new SnapWorx technology creates the largest resupply base in the industry with end-to-end workflow automation. For our HME customers, the combination of these two technologies Brightree and SnapWorx will increase patient adherence and increase operational efficiency. We expect the transaction to close very shortly. The acquisition of SnapWorx is expected to be neutral to our non-GAAP ResMed earnings per share initially. However, we expect this acquisition will be accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share during fiscal year 2021. In summary, we have the vision to transform and significantly improved software solutions across outside the hospital healthcare sectors. We see a future where patients seamlessly transfer from HME to skilled nursing facilities to home health providers to hospice providers and beyond with reduced costs and increased efficiency resulting in better system outcomes as well as a high quality of life for the person in out of hospital care. Before I turn the call over to Brett, let me close with this. The first half of fiscal year 2020 was strong, and we are well positioned to grow through the second half of fiscal 2020 and beyond. The continued success of our mask and device portfolio along with a solid pipeline of new products and new digital health solutions covering sleep apnea, COPD and out of hospital software gives us confidence in continued growth as we move through the year. We have positioned ResMed for the long-term as the global leader in digital health driving top line and bottom line growth as we execute toward our 2025 strategy. We are focused on our triple aim; first, to slow chronic disease progression; second, to reduce overall healthcare system costs and third, to improve quality of life to the ultimate customer, the patient. With that all hands go over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks and then we'll go to Q&A. Brett?\nBrett Sandercock: Great, thanks Mick. In my remarks today I'll provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. As Mick noted we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the December quarter was 736 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms revenue increased by 14%. Excluding revenue from acquisitions, group revenue increased by 11% on a constant currency basis. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business our sales in US, Canada and Latin America countries were 408 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled 242 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. However, in constant currency terms sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 8% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments; US, Canada and Latin America device sales were 204 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales was 204 million, an increase of 19% of the prior year quarter. The revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales of 162 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms an increase of 6%. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets was 79 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms an increase of 11%. Globally in constant currency terms device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other sales increased by 16% over the prior year quarter. Software as a service revenue for the second quarter was 87 million, an increase of 37% over the prior year quarter. During the rest of my commentary today, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjusted the impact of amortization acquired intangibles, purchase accounting fair value adjustments to MatrixCare deferred revenue, litigation settlement expenses and acquisition related expenses. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Note that this quarter for GAAP reporting purposes we are now reflecting the portion of amortization of acquired intangibles attributable to develop technology in our cost of sale, rather than being allocated to operating expenses. We've made this change along with SEC disclosure guidance. This mainly [ph] will disclose both GAAP and non-GAAP profit ratios going forward. We have included reconciliation of both GAAP and non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin in our press release. Going forward I will reference this non-GAAP metric because I believe it is the best measure of our underline gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin improved to 59.7% in the December quarter compared to 59.1% in the same quarter last year. Compared to the prior year, our non-GAAP gross margin increased by 60 basis points, this was predominantly attributable to viable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies partially offset by typical declines in average selling prices. Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the second quarter were 171 million, an increase a 6% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms SG&A expenses increased by 8%. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A expenses increased by 2% on a constant currency basis. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 23.3% compared to 24.8% that we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward subject to currency movements and taking into account recent acquisitions, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 23% to 25% for the remaining two quarters of fiscal year 2020. R&D expenses for the quarter were 50 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 18%. Excluding acquisitions, R&D expenses increased by 4% on a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.8% contains a 6.6% in the prior year. Looking forward subject to currency movements we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2020. Total amortization of acquired intangibles was 20.6 million for the quarter, an increase of 30% over the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact from our recent acquisitions. Stock based compensation expense for the quarter was 14.1 million. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was 219.5 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter. While non-GAAP net income for the quarter was 176.3 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter. On a GAAP basis our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 10.2%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rates for the quarter with 11.6%. Our tax rate was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of 20.3 million associated with the vesting of employee share based compensation in particular the tax deduction associated with the vesting of executive performance documents in November, Excluding the impact from this benefit, our GAAP effective the tax rate would have been 21.6%. And our non-GAAP effective tax rate would have been 21.5%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rates for the second half of fiscal year 2020 will bring the range of 19% to 21%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.21, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.10. Our diluted earnings per share were also favorably impacted by the text benefit that I've just discussed. Excluding the impact of this guidance our non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $1.07. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was 69.9 million reflecting robust underlying earnings partially offset by the timing of tax payments with 111 million in tax paid in our second quarter. Additionally, we made the payment for our settlement to the US Department of Justice of 40.6 million this quarter. Capital expenditure for the quarter was 25.1 million. Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled 45.5 million. During the quarter we paid dividends of 56.1 million. We recorded equity losses of 6.9 million in our income statement in the December quarter associated with a Verily joint venture. We expect to record approximately 6 million in equity losses each quarter for the balance of fiscal year 2020 associated with the joint venture operations. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share. At December 31, we had 1.3 billion in gross debt and 1.1 billion in net debt. Our total assets were 4.4 billion and our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. Finally, to recap, our top line revenue was strong this quarter with growth across all major categories. Gross Margin expanded and our operating costs remained well controlled. As a result, we are continuing to drive operating leverage with Q2 non-GAAP operating profit up 21% year-on-year. We are focused on driving operating results, integrating our SAAS acquisitions and ensuring we continue to invest in our strategic long-term opportunities. And with that I'll hand the call back to Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great, thank you Brett. We'll now turn to the Q&A portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone to limit yourself to one question and if you have additional questions, please feel free to return to the call queue. Christine. We're now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is open.\nMargaret Kaczor: Hey, good afternoon, guys and Good morning to Brett out in Australia.\nMick Farrell: Thank you.\nMargaret Kaczor: And you may be the first one for me is on mask growth. Obviously, you guys continue to do very, very well from that perspective. So as we look at the last maybe 12 to 18 months, can you give us a sense of the relative impact of new product launches, especially in the white spaces maybe that you weren't in before, the resupply agreements that you kind of referenced, a little bit at JP Morgan, market growth and general share taking and the idea is as we look forward how're the moving dynamics between those categories, and how do you kind of adjust your strategy to keep performance high? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Yeah, thanks for your question, Margaret. And as you noted, there's a number of factors contributing to this very strong mask growth that we had, 16% constant currency on a global basis, and even taking out some of the software just well up there in the mid-teens. You hit on pretty much all of them. There's an increased adherence that we're driving through our digital health solutions when we're achieving 87% adherence, when the doctor is using AirView and the patient is using myAir, and all the digital techs in play that drives up our mask growth. Secondly, when there's resupply and patients have the opportunity if they want to, to participate in getting a fresh mask as their old mask becomes used, and we are partnering with Brightree, Connect, and with ResMed ReSupply to provide that and the acquisition of SnapWorx will help. And then thirdly and really importantly, these last 15 months, the steady flow of four really exciting new mask innovations. Interestingly, these mask innovations aren't to replace a previous product, but to go after underserved or under met customer needs. And we call the minimalist category and the freedom category where people move through different positions during sleep; prone, left, right, sleepers want a Freedom mask and people who had some claustrophobia or want small, larger masks go to the minimalist category, and the F30 that we just launched is right in the heart of both of those. So it's all the above contributing to this really strong growth. We still think that the market growth right is in the high-single digits for masks. And we took really good share during this December quarter. Our job and challenge is to keep driving all those things: resupply, adherence, mask innovation and we plan to do just that.\nMargaret Kaczor: Thanks guys.\nMick Farrell: Thanks Margaret.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nMatthew Mishan: Great and thank you for taking the questions, hi, just a follow up on the market share gains in masks. Are you winning new patients at a higher market share clip or are you able to convert existing sleep apnea patients from competitors and getting them to switch?\nMick Farrell: Yeah, Matthew, that's a really good question. I'll hand that to Jim Hollingshead, the President of our Sleep Division to walk through that.\nJim Hollingshead: Good morning, Matthew. I'm down in Australia. So I hope you can all hear me as well.\nMatthew Mishan: I can hear you just fine.\nJim Hollingshead: Yeah, it's a combination of both. We feel very confident in our overall position with mask that we\u2019ve had so many masks launched, and and as Mick referenced, we've had several mask launches in the last 15 months. All of them have been successful launches. We now have a very wide portfolio. It's the widest portfolio offering of mask on the market. So, we continue to take new patient share across all three mask categories. I'm sure we're likely to also be getting competitors switching, and there's less market data available on that dynamic, but we're very confident we're taking new patient share pretty successfully.\nMatthew Mishan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSean Laaman: Good morning, Mick. Hope you're well. My question relates to something you announced last quarter, and I wonder if you can give a bit of an update on how this Novartis deal with Propeller, is there any update there and how that might be tracking? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Sean. Well, we don't talk in our core business or in our new software businesses about individual customers or partners until things are public and moving along, but there was a public data last quarter from our work with pilot trials with both GSK and Novartis in the Propeller area looking at inhaled pharmaceutical medicines. Look, the beauty of it \u2013 as I sort of described in the opening remarks, the beauty of Propeller is it provides an end-to-end platform to help us take care of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. And so, Stage 1 and 2, with Propeller, we can take care of the patients, ensure they have the medicines that their doctor prescribed for them but also engage with that person because they're going to \u2013 it's a progressive disease, they're going to move from Stage 1 to Stage 2 and Stage 3 and Stage 4 COPD. And so our goal with Propeller is not just to have a partnership with pharma company A or B, but it's to really create a platform where we help end-to-end management of a person as they move through disease progression and it helps us engage with that person to help them adhere to their therapy, whether that therapy is the pharmaceutical inhaler or that therapy is a portable oxygen concentrated or that therapy as they move forward is a non-invasive ventilator or a life support ventilator. And so that's our goal with these partnerships. As we hit milestones during 2020 on the pharma side and as we hit milestones on the healthcare system side, we'll give updates on that. But look, yes, we did talk to the MAGNIFY trial that we're still enrolling patients for with Novartis. That's in its early days. So we will give updates on the clinical data, but also importantly commercial partnerships as they move forward through 2020. Thanks for your question, Sean.\nSean Laaman: Yeah, thank you Mick.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Deakin-Bell from Citigroup. Your line is open.\nJohn Deakin-Bell: Good morning. My question just relates to the increase in the SG&A, obviously, you've got fantastic leverage from that and I think we've talked about it previously, but the 2% underlying seems a \u2013 I think that's a record low numbers for you. And just give us a sense perhaps, of how that might look over the next six months and maybe going forward or should it return back to the kind of mid-single digit levels?\nMick Farrell: So I'll hand that to Brett who's down in Sydney.\nBrett Sandercock: Yeah, thanks. Hi, John. Yeah, it was a low this quarter. And we did benefit, certainly from much lower litigation related expenses this quarter relative to last year. So that did certainly moderate that growth rate. In my guidance, I said, I think will revert back to the range of 23 to 25 for the second half, which would suggest that it will track higher in terms of growth rates for SG&A at least in the back half, but certainly helped by some reduction or significant reduction in litigation costs coming through this quarter relative to last year was probably the single biggest driver. And that certainly motivated the growth rate. And try to adjust for that in that kind of range above given as a percentage of revenue going forward to be a better indicator, I think.\nJohn Deakin-Bell: That's helpful. Thanks Brett.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Saul Hadassin from UBS. Your line is open.\nMick Farrell: Saul, you may be on mute.\nSaul Hadassin: No, I'm not. Can you hear me?\nMick Farrell: We can hear you now. Yes.\nSaul Hadassin: Great, thanks. Yeah, just a question for Brett, Brett just on gross margin, I'm just wondering if you can give some color on the underlying sleep and respiratory care business to what the gross margin has done ex acquisition contribution and usually provide an outlook for the rest of the fiscal year for gross margin as well. Can you just give us that some color there too? Thanks.\nBrett Sandercock: Yeah, I mean, I think going forward the second half, I think we'll be consistent with where we are, would be an estimate on the gross margin, as you know, a lot of moving parts on that. That would be our expectation. If you look at the acquisitions, we did \u2013 [indiscernible] halfway through the quarter, but fairly \u2013 it's kind of fairly minimal impact this quarter, the big drivers of that year-on-year growth or expansion of that gross margin around the product mix. And that's really being driven by that out performance you're seeing in mask growth and that's typically high margins, what you would see on devices so that that's the biggest impact. And then we're still seeing manufacturing efficiencies, some around logistics and so on as well. And they continue to come through on gross margin, so they're the two big drivers this quarter.\nSaul Hadassin: Alright, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Shane Storey from Wilson HTM Limited. Your line is open.\nShane Storey: Yeah, hi, thanks. Just looking again, back at the US mask business kind of just from another angle, you spoke about the adherence in resupply. But have you measured the step up in the number of mask per patient per year say, over the last 12 to 18 months and the last reference point that I've got is may be a tick under two per patient per year? So any observations around that might be very useful. Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Yeah, Shane thanks for your question. I think there's a whole portfolio of customers doing different levels of resupply in different countries around the world. If you take the example of France, there's a government mandated requirement that you provide to masks, two masks per patient per year. And it's different in all the 140 countries. Yeah, you focused on the US growth, which was strong. And yes, the last public number we didn't talk about that was 1.9 masks per patient per year. But look out of the 5000 customers in the US there's a broad spectrum of adoption of Brightree. Resupply, Brightree Connect, ResMed resupply, and technologies like SnapWorx that we just acquired. And so there's a broad range. But Jim, do you want to \u2013 Jim Hollingshead, do you want to provide any further color as to what you'd want to share on mask supply metrics?\nJim Hollingshead: Yes. Thanks Mick and thanks Shane. I would just add to add to a mix that just a couple things. The first one is the trend is we don't we don't talk about the number of publicly obviously, but the trend in the US has been steadily slowly, but steadily up over the last several years. And we attribute that both to the range of things Mick talked about earlier in the call. So better adherence tools that we're providing our platforms, better masks lead to better adherence initially and therefore better long term adherence and also the adoption of resupply platforms by our HME customers. So the trend is slowly and steadily up. It's still well below Medicare and commercial parallel levels and so it's a good trend and there's still a lot of opportunity.\nShane Storey: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Steve Wheen from Evans & Partners. Your line is open.\nSteve Wheen: Hey, good afternoon guys. My question is just on specs [ph] businesses and growth rate there. I was wondering if you could help us reconstruct that growth rate, particularly between MatrixCare and Brightree and perhaps as part of that, to give us an update as to your understanding of how those businesses are performing since you've been acquired. I guess, with reference to the EPS outlook that you provided at the time of the acquisitions.\nMick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Steve. That allows us to talk to our investment in SAAS and again SAAS this quarter was 12% of our global revenue. And so it's a sector that we're calling out and you'll see that in our financials. It's a very hyper competitive sector, when you look at HME software, you look at skilled nursing facility software and you look at home health and hospice software, so I'm going to be really hesitant to give detailed market share and/or growth rates within each of those sectors. What I said on the prepared remarks is true that cost \u2013 if you look at ResMed's weighted average revenue across HME, skilled nursing facility, home health and hospice, as well as the others private duty home care and client communities. The weighted average market growth rate in those sectors is in that high single digit. And during the December quarter over that portfolio we held share, we grew at the \u2013 taking out the acquisition benefit that gave us 37% growth. We grew in that high single digit on our weighted average portfolio. One thing I'll say is we've \u2013 when we hit April here in 2020, we will have and Brightree four years. And as you guys remember, because you followed the stock for a long time, the first two years with Brightree we were investing. Yeah, we put some new management team leaders in there we brought in new CEO, new CTO and some skill sets in R&D. We're doing very similar things now in our MatrixCare journey. And so I'm not going to break it out in detail, but qualitatively I'll say that the investments that we put in those first two years into Brightree are really starting to pay off. We've got new logos, new customers, new modules, and we're taking share, the growth is picking up. And at MatrixCare we're making those investments today in more R&D, more management skills and capabilities and looking obviously back in synergies across our portfolio. So I think we can meet or beat the timing of our Brightree investments and the strong and sustainable growth that we're now getting out of that in our MatrixCare investment.\nSteve Wheen: Thanks Mick.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Low from JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nDavid Low: Thanks very much. Just a quick one from me, you mentioned that the mask sales included some software revenues, just wondering if you could explain what that is and how much contribution that will make going forward?\nMick Farrell: Yeah, there's a little bit of that. I'll hand it to Brett to go through the financial details on that.\nBrett Sandercock: Sure. The probably the bigger one there is the \u2013 just through the software related to the \u2013 or the platform related to Propeller acquisition. So that's kind of \u2013 that's probably the biggest single delta, but there are a few other things there, but that's probably the biggest one.\nDavid Low: Great, thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Andrew Goodsall from MST Marquee. Your line is open.\nAndrew Goodsall: Thanks very much, just obviously looking at the current of coronavirus issue and I think if we go back to size, you might sales of about $5 million of sleep [indiscernible] levels into China. Just wondering if there's any follow through affect to yourself from the current coronavirus.\nRob Douglas: Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. It's Rob Douglas speaking. There's a pretty dynamic situation going on at the moment in China. And so tracking, it's difficult, but we are tracking very closely. In terms of our China business, we think obviously the hospital's going to be very busy on their respiratory. So there'll be a lot of focus on that. We would expect to see increased demand for ventilators, whether it's of the same relative scale to size or not, we don't know yet. We're actually working hard on our local supply chain there. Remember, we've got a really good team in China building good ventilators in China for China. And so, in fact, some of that team has been working in some of these hospitals and Jason Sun, Head of China they're local heroes who are really staying on the ground there and helping look after patients in the face of this terrible disease. So I wouldn't be predicting exactly what the impact will be on an overall scale, there will be an offset as well, likely the hospitals won't be looking at sleep patients for a while. So there may be some in asleep in China, but it's unlikely all of that to be material. Just one other point in terms of the overall business, we've mentioned many times our supply chain isn't configured around China. Most of its not in China, but there are some second and third tier suppliers in their way work closely with them at the moment. We wouldn't expect this to be a problem, but we'll have to keep a close eye on them.\nAndrew Goodsall: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nLyanne Harrison: Good morning, gentlemen and thank you for taking my question. Just to continue the discussion on the SaaS business and probably most specifically previously we talked about resupply expansion and that given over about six months in, can you share how the resupply program outside of sleep apnea is tracking and what your expectations are for the remainder of financial year '20?\nMick Farrell: Thanks Lyanne. Yeah, so you're talking about our expansion of \u2013 our resupply capabilities, we went into some diabetic supplies and orthotics and urology products and so those \u2013 they're not a material part of ResMed's overall business. But they were a good expansion of ResMed's capabilities to look off to the HME sector beyond just sleep apnea and sleep app supplies that we are very good at making sure that they work through and so it's not material to our overall business. I'm not going to break out the specifics and other than to say they're going well and customers are adopting them and I'd love them to become a material part of our overall business to be able to break out like that. But it's early days and it's a good strategic ply of Brightree to sort of expand their capability with workflow optimization and both the combination of live call and tech that we use on masks and sleep apnea supplies. It's the same technology used on those diabetics and those other areas of HME. And so we're just helping our customers grow their businesses and get appropriate resupply when customers are there and requiring for authorization for it as well. So sorry, I can't get more specific than that, Lyanne.\nLyanne Harrison: Thank you.\nMick Farrell: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Gretel Janu from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nGretel Janu: Thanks. Good morning. So would you be able to give us an update on the outlook for competitive bidding? So what are your expectations in terms of reimbursement changes in 2021? And if there is potentially a decline in mask reimbursements, how is ResMed thinking about responding? Thanks\nMick Farrell: So I'll hand that question to Dave Pendarvis. Dave?\nDavid Pendarvis: Yeah. Thanks Gretel. We continue to be at the same place we were last quarter. And that is we're waiting along with everyone else in the industry what the results are, the competitive bids that are in. We expect them at the end of the North American summer. So sometime around August or September and we'll know where the results are. We are pleased with the efforts that we made and others in the industry made to educate bidders, so they understand the portfolio nature of the lead item pricing and the impact of bidding on CPAP reimbursement on mask reimbursement. We're comfortable that that we conduct business with our customers now on a portfolio basis. And however, reimbursement settles out in the Medicare space. We expect to there'll continue to be strong demand for mask resupply that will continue to be important part of our customers business and it'll be an important part for patients' long term adherence success. So we don't see any significant changes in the trajectory going forward. But obviously, like with everyone else, we just have to wait and see what the actual reimbursement amounts come out to be.\nGretel Janu: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of David Bailey from Macquarie. Your line is open.\nDavid Bailey: Yeah, good morning, guys. Just for me Brett, cash flow looked a bit awake this quarter. Just wondering if you could talk through some of the moving parts there? You've called out the Department of Justice litigation settlement. Just talk us through what normalized tax cash payment would look like? And then also net interest on a cash basis for the quarter will be great.\nBrett Sandercock: Yeah, so yeah, was impacted by plenty of tax payments as well, if you look at it underlying, excluding those I still think actually pretty strong on the cash flow front. Normalize is probably \u2013you're probably more like around the kind of 40 million a quarter. And I think going into Q3, it's going to be more like that. So that's impacted for this quarter. Expect Q3 and Q4 to be much better in terms of cash flow performance. And in the next one was that on the interest, interest expense?\nDavid Bailey: Managed expenses, it is broadly monitor [ph] the income statement you're talking about.\nBrett Sandercock: Yeah, pretty close. You wouldn't \u2013 that's a good proxy. It's not that far different to that.\nDavid Bailey: Yeah. Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nChris Cooper: Thanks for taking the question. I was going to follow up to one of the previous questions. So the competitive bidding, I know it's a bit early to speculate on the particular outcome. I just guess I'm more interested in how you expect to manage the discussion with the DNA partners yourselves. Would you expect positive and negative changes to be passed on to you one to one? Or is there an outcome here where, I guess you bet more downside than the upside given there's a possible agreement here were some categories going to increase and some decrease just any thoughts around how you think that would be helpful.\nMick Farrell: So I'll hand that for David and if Jim, you want to add any color from the customer perspective, as well, but Dave you first and then Jim?\nDavid Pendarvis: Sure, I mean, we already have ongoing discussions with our customers. We view them as good partners with us and we have robust discussions where they would like to get the best prices they can and we want to make sure that we serve them as best we can. That dynamic won't change with competitive bidding or anything else. So we expect to continue to have good discussions with them and the environment for the last year and a half and for the balance of calendar year '20 is that there's been about a 2% increase each year in the Medicare reimbursement. And so that's obviously contributed to a benign pricing environment that we've been experiencing for the last period of time. But we didn't participate with our customers in their bidding, obviously, they made their own decisions, we're confident that the bidding process will be a more fair one this time, and we're hoping it'll end up with a process that will be able to be good for the overall industry. But in terms of individual customer negotiations, Jim, you might want to comment on that.\nJim Hollingshead: Thank you, Dave. I'll just add to that, I mean, I think that's very well, but we do have very good relationships with all of our customers with our key customers and we'll work through it together. The other thing I would just remind everybody is a Medicare fee for service is the minority part of the market. So it's an important part of the market, but it's a small percentage of the market.\nOperator: And your next question comes from line of Mike Matson from Needham. Your line is open.\nMike Matson: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just have, I guess one more competitive bidding question. So with \u2013 specifically with non-invasive ventilation, that's the first time it's been included, I think could see a fairly steep decline. So can you maybe comment on what you expect there? And then also, I don't know if you could quantify how much of your sales are coming from non-invasive ventilation in the US, but just to help us understand what the exposure is.\nMick Farrell: Dave and Jim, you again,\nDavid Pendarvis: Up again, so thanks, Mike. Non-invasive ventilation obviously is in two different categories. One what we would characterize as life support ventilation is the new category that it's now going to be a competitive bidding, our air curve ranges the buy levels have previously been in competitive bidding. So that's not changing. It's more on the life support side. And that is newly there, but they're also had been reductions in that reimbursement over the past few years leading up to this. So it's not necessarily the case that you'll see the same kinds of reductions that you saw in the round two kind of range previously for the sleep products. Nevertheless, we think it's important that patients can benefit particularly COPD patients can benefit from these devices, they ought to get into the hands and that's of those patients and it's certainly a device that requires a lot of service. A lot of people in the in the home are making sure the device is working appropriately, so you need to have a strong reimbursement for it. It's a smaller group of customers who actually do this kind of business, and they're probably likely to be focused on what their real cost of serving are. So again, we're optimistic that our customers are sophisticated customers, they'll bid appropriately, so that they can make an adequate margin to be able to provide that service that's really, particularly in this area very well needed. So we'll wait and see how it goes. But we don't break out specifically our sales of life support anywhere in the US or otherwise, but thanks.\nMike Matson: Okay, thanks and then just would SnapWorx, maybe just comment on what that brings to the table they didn't already have with Brightree? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Yeah, so SnapWorx is a technology that adds to Brightree end-to-end capabilities that SnapWorx has to partner with the HME. So it goes beyond just the live call and technology capability. They have provided to a number of customers and ability to further reach out to customers. And we had observed this software that was partnering with our Brightree platform and performing really well with those customers. And so we had a relationship with SnapWorx over the last 12, 24, 36 months and we've seen them really grow into a really good technology talking and the Brightree team looked at the technology from the team there in Nashville, Tennessee that created this tech and the entrepreneurs that created it. And we're really excited not only by what they're achieving in the market, which has better adherence and better engagement with both the HME and really importantly, with the end user customer. And what I bring it back which is the patient, what I bring it back to this is some data, some clinical data that we presented from the 5.5 billion knots of data that show that as you increase adherence, and as you engage with the patient and resupply the two add to each other. And some data we just released last quarter shows that for every hour of sleep, we reduce the total healthcare costs for inpatient by 8%. So this is all tied together, right. So Brightree, resupply \u2013 ResMed resupply and SnapWorx will increase adherence, drive increased mask resupply and that will also through that increased adherence lower the costs of the total healthcare system by 8% for every hour of sleep after those seven hours and so I think that combination is really powerful of now Brightree plus SnapWorx. Now, it's early days, we're just literally going through the finals of this acquisition, but watch us over the next 12, 24 months and we'll give you updates obviously every quarter as to how well that integration on that technology's going.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. This is Mike on for Suraj. We read recently that Fitbit is adding an oxygen variation graph for select users with an FDA submission for sleep apnea diagnosis somewhere in the near term here. I'm just curious if you see that as longer term helping to increase the number of OSA patients treated.\nMick Farrell: Yeah, Mike thanks for the question. And look, it's really interesting that tech companies are really getting involved in the field of, I call it health wellness and sleep wellness is a big part of that. Obviously, we have our partnership with Verily and I have the Google watch as part of their baseline study and they're doing some identification, I'd call it. You call the diagnosis; I call it identification of potentially at risk people for poor sleep suffocation or sleep apnea. I think what Fitbit has is along those same lines and what they try to do, and that Fitbit is now part of the Google portfolio. I believe there's an acquisition in line there. It'll probably add on to that capability of, if you see de-saturations in the oxygen, there's a higher likelihood. There's other causes potentially of those de-sat, but there's a high likelihood of sleep apnea, so I would call it more in the medical terms a screener that will then hopefully identify and engage a person that maybe I have a sleep issue, maybe I have a breathing issue and indicate to them they need to get on to the true diagnostic pathway. And then we can sort of bring them into the identification, engagement enrollment capability we're trying to perform. But look, Jim you run the global fleet business, is there any further detail you think about some of these tech companies and the ability for them to identify more patients?\nJim Hollingshead: Sure yet, Mike, thanks for the question. I think it's an unreserved good that companies like Fitbit are putting in place technologies to help consumers understand how they're sleeping and whether they might have a sleep disorder. And we know that there's 936 million people globally, who suffer from sleep apnea, the vast majority of them don't know it. And forever in the industry, one of the bottlenecks has been driving awareness on the one hand and then making objective screening and then diagnosis, on the other hand easier and so when companies like Fitbit \u2013 there's a whole range of companies that are now doing something like that in the space. When they when they decide to put that out in consumers hands. It's fantastic for us and for those patients more importantly.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thanks Mick and Jim.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nAnthony Petrone: So maybe just two quick ones, one just on local manufacturing just given bushfires, obviously in Australia, so any update just on that manufacturing plant. And then just one on legislation in the US, H.R.2771 just to maintain the 50-50 blended rate in rural areas, is there any update on actually where that sits and the likelihood that it gets to Congress this year? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Thanks for the questions Anthony. I'll ask Rob to answer the first one around manufacturing and then Dave to answer the second one around the H.R.\nRob Douglas: Yeah. Thanks, Anthony. As we said the ResMed supply chain is configured around multiple sources. At this stage most of our manufactured products come from our Singapore plant, but we have full capability in the Sydney plant that does often focus on newer and more complex products. But we have full process capability in both plants. The fire season in Australia has been devastating. However, it hasn't actually gone into the outskirts of Sydney, which would actually make the whole thing a lot worse if it did. And today, we haven't seen any interference with that at all. But if there was interference that wouldn't overly affect us because of our ability to reconfigure.\nAnthony Petrone: Thank you.\nDavid Pendarvis: And as to the bill and we certainly support that bill. Again, we think it's important that our customers receive the appropriate reimbursement and particularly in rural areas. It's difficult to do that. So we certainly support 2771. I think it's \u2013 you may have noticed there's a lot going on in Congress these days. So it's a little difficult to get anything through. But there is an opportunity in the middle part of the year, when I think some of the Medicare extenders come up for renewal, that there could be a push to get this along with some of the other items the industry supports in place. So we'll have to wait and see. But we certainly support that. And at a minimum, Congress indicating their support the industry is positive.\nAnthony Petrone: Thanks.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of David Bailey from Macquarie. Your line is open.\nDavid Bailey: You know like I'm just following up on Saul's question actually, just wondering if you're able to quantify the contribution of those acquisitions to US or America's masks and accessories revenues for the quarter that would be helpful.\nMick Farrell: Yeah, I said in the prepared \u2013 thanks for the question David. I said in the prepared remarks, it's the \u2013 so if you take that sort of global mask growth rate of 16%, and you take out Propeller software, you're going to be in the mid-teens, so maybe 100 basis points or something on global. And if you take the US growth, we're all pretty \u2013 I mean most of the Propeller software is the US growth on masks was 19% on a constant currency basis. If you take out Propeller and the software, you're about 200 basis points there, you're probably around 17% growth in the US territory, so 16 becomes around 15 and 19 would become around 17 David. I think that answers both your questions. And thanks to everyone for spending an extra eight minutes since we were eight minutes delayed due to the phone lines there, but appreciate that all.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.\nMick Farrell: Hey, great. Thanks, Christine. And thanks again to all of our shareholders for joining us on this call. I'd also like to take the opportunity to thank the 7,500 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders, for their dedication and hard work. You produce these great numbers that we get to report. You help people sleep better, you help people breathe better, you help people live better lives outside the hospital in a 140 countries, which is pretty amazing. Thanks for all that you do today and every day and we'll talk to all of you again in around 90 days. Amy?\nAmy Wakeham: Great, thank you all again, for joining us today and to echo Mick, thanks for bearing with us through the audio difficulties. If you do have any questions or additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. As previously mentioned, all the documents along with the transcript and hopefully a clean replay of today's call will be available on our website. Christine, you can now close the call.\nOperator: This concludes ResMed's second quarter of fiscal year 2020 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jim Hollingshead",
            "content": "Good morning, Matthew. I'm down in Australia. So I hope you can all hear me as well. Yeah, it's a combination of both. We feel very confident in our overall position with mask that we've had so many masks launched, and and as Mick referenced, we've had several mask launches in the last 15 months. All of them have been successful launches. We now have a very wide portfolio. It's the widest portfolio offering of mask on the market. So, we continue to take new patient share across all three mask categories. I'm sure we're likely to also be getting competitors switching, and there's less market data available on that dynamic, but we're very confident we're taking new patient share pretty successfully. Yes. Thanks Mick and thanks Shane. I would just add to add to a mix that just a couple things. The first one is the trend is we don't we don't talk about the number of publicly obviously, but the trend in the US has been steadily slowly, but steadily up over the last several years. And we attribute that both to the range of things Mick talked about earlier in the call. So better adherence tools that we're providing our platforms, better masks lead to better adherence initially and therefore better long term adherence and also the adoption of resupply platforms by our HME customers. So the trend is slowly and steadily up. It's still well below Medicare and commercial parallel levels and so it's a good trend and there's still a lot of opportunity. Thank you, Dave. I'll just add to that, I mean, I think that's very well, but we do have very good relationships with all of our customers with our key customers and we'll work through it together. The other thing I would just remind everybody is a Medicare fee for service is the minority part of the market. So it's an important part of the market, but it's a small percentage of the market. Sure yet, Mike, thanks for the question. I think it's an unreserved good that companies like Fitbit are putting in place technologies to help consumers understand how they're sleeping and whether they might have a sleep disorder. And we know that there's 936 million people globally, who suffer from sleep apnea, the vast majority of them don't know it. And forever in the industry, one of the bottlenecks has been driving awareness on the one hand and then making objective screening and then diagnosis, on the other hand easier and so when companies like Fitbit \u2013 there's a whole range of companies that are now doing something like that in the space. When they when they decide to put that out in consumers hands. It's fantastic for us and for those patients more importantly."

            "content": "Great, thanks Mick. In my remarks today I'll provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. As Mick noted we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the December quarter was 736 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms revenue increased by 14%. Excluding revenue from acquisitions, group revenue increased by 11% on a constant currency basis. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business our sales in US, Canada and Latin America countries were 408 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled 242 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. However, in constant currency terms sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 8% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments; US, Canada and Latin America device sales were 204 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales was 204 million, an increase of 19% of the prior year quarter. The revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales of 162 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms an increase of 6%. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets was 79 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms an increase of 11%. Globally in constant currency terms device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other sales increased by 16% over the prior year quarter. Software as a service revenue for the second quarter was 87 million, an increase of 37% over the prior year quarter. During the rest of my commentary today, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjusted the impact of amortization acquired intangibles, purchase accounting fair value adjustments to MatrixCare deferred revenue, litigation settlement expenses and acquisition related expenses. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Note that this quarter for GAAP reporting purposes we are now reflecting the portion of amortization of acquired intangibles attributable to develop technology in our cost of sale, rather than being allocated to operating expenses. We've made this change along with SEC disclosure guidance. This mainly [ph] will disclose both GAAP and non-GAAP profit ratios going forward. We have included reconciliation of both GAAP and non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin in our press release. Going forward I will reference this non-GAAP metric because I believe it is the best measure of our underline gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin improved to 59.7% in the December quarter compared to 59.1% in the same quarter last year. Compared to the prior year, our non-GAAP gross margin increased by 60 basis points, this was predominantly attributable to viable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies partially offset by typical declines in average selling prices. Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the second quarter were 171 million, an increase a 6% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms SG&A expenses increased by 8%. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A expenses increased by 2% on a constant currency basis. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 23.3% compared to 24.8% that we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward subject to currency movements and taking into account recent acquisitions, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 23% to 25% for the remaining two quarters of fiscal year 2020. R&D expenses for the quarter were 50 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 18%. Excluding acquisitions, R&D expenses increased by 4% on a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.8% contains a 6.6% in the prior year. Looking forward subject to currency movements we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2020. Total amortization of acquired intangibles was 20.6 million for the quarter, an increase of 30% over the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact from our recent acquisitions. Stock based compensation expense for the quarter was 14.1 million. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was 219.5 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter. While non-GAAP net income for the quarter was 176.3 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter. On a GAAP basis our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 10.2%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rates for the quarter with 11.6%. Our tax rate was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of 20.3 million associated with the vesting of employee share based compensation in particular the tax deduction associated with the vesting of executive performance documents in November, Excluding the impact from this benefit, our GAAP effective the tax rate would have been 21.6%. And our non-GAAP effective tax rate would have been 21.5%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rates for the second half of fiscal year 2020 will bring the range of 19% to 21%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.21, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.10. Our diluted earnings per share were also favorably impacted by the text benefit that I've just discussed. Excluding the impact of this guidance our non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $1.07. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was 69.9 million reflecting robust underlying earnings partially offset by the timing of tax payments with 111 million in tax paid in our second quarter. Additionally, we made the payment for our settlement to the US Department of Justice of 40.6 million this quarter. Capital expenditure for the quarter was 25.1 million. Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled 45.5 million. During the quarter we paid dividends of 56.1 million. We recorded equity losses of 6.9 million in our income statement in the December quarter associated with a Verily joint venture. We expect to record approximately 6 million in equity losses each quarter for the balance of fiscal year 2020 associated with the joint venture operations. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share. At December 31, we had 1.3 billion in gross debt and 1.1 billion in net debt. Our total assets were 4.4 billion and our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. Finally, to recap, our top line revenue was strong this quarter with growth across all major categories. Gross Margin expanded and our operating costs remained well controlled. As a result, we are continuing to drive operating leverage with Q2 non-GAAP operating profit up 21% year-on-year. We are focused on driving operating results, integrating our SAAS acquisitions and ensuring we continue to invest in our strategic long-term opportunities. And with that I'll hand the call back to Amy. Yeah, thanks. Hi, John. Yeah, it was a low this quarter. And we did benefit, certainly from much lower litigation related expenses this quarter relative to last year. So that did certainly moderate that growth rate. In my guidance, I said, I think will revert back to the range of 23 to 25 for the second half, which would suggest that it will track higher in terms of growth rates for SG&A at least in the back half, but certainly helped by some reduction or significant reduction in litigation costs coming through this quarter relative to last year was probably the single biggest driver. And that certainly motivated the growth rate. And try to adjust for that in that kind of range above given as a percentage of revenue going forward to be a better indicator, I think. Yeah, I mean, I think going forward the second half, I think we'll be consistent with where we are, would be an estimate on the gross margin, as you know, a lot of moving parts on that. That would be our expectation. If you look at the acquisitions, we did \u2013 [indiscernible] halfway through the quarter, but fairly \u2013 it's kind of fairly minimal impact this quarter, the big drivers of that year-on-year growth or expansion of that gross margin around the product mix. And that's really being driven by that out performance you're seeing in mask growth and that's typically high margins, what you would see on devices so that that's the biggest impact. And then we're still seeing manufacturing efficiencies, some around logistics and so on as well. And they continue to come through on gross margin, so they're the two big drivers this quarter. Sure. The probably the bigger one there is the \u2013 just through the software related to the \u2013 or the platform related to Propeller acquisition. So that's kind of \u2013 that's probably the biggest single delta, but there are a few other things there, but that's probably the biggest one. Yeah, so yeah, was impacted by plenty of tax payments as well, if you look at it underlying, excluding those I still think actually pretty strong on the cash flow front. Normalize is probably \u2013you're probably more like around the kind of 40 million a quarter. And I think going into Q3, it's going to be more like that. So that's impacted for this quarter. Expect Q3 and Q4 to be much better in terms of cash flow performance. And in the next one was that on the interest, interest expense? Yeah, pretty close. You wouldn't \u2013 that's a good proxy. It's not that far different to that."

            "name": "Rob Douglas",
            "content": "Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. It's Rob Douglas speaking. There's a pretty dynamic situation going on at the moment in China. And so tracking, it's difficult, but we are tracking very closely. In terms of our China business, we think obviously the hospital's going to be very busy on their respiratory. So there'll be a lot of focus on that. We would expect to see increased demand for ventilators, whether it's of the same relative scale to size or not, we don't know yet. We're actually working hard on our local supply chain there. Remember, we've got a really good team in China building good ventilators in China for China. And so, in fact, some of that team has been working in some of these hospitals and Jason Sun, Head of China they're local heroes who are really staying on the ground there and helping look after patients in the face of this terrible disease. So I wouldn't be predicting exactly what the impact will be on an overall scale, there will be an offset as well, likely the hospitals won't be looking at sleep patients for a while. So there may be some in asleep in China, but it's unlikely all of that to be material. Just one other point in terms of the overall business, we've mentioned many times our supply chain isn't configured around China. Most of its not in China, but there are some second and third tier suppliers in their way work closely with them at the moment. We wouldn't expect this to be a problem, but we'll have to keep a close eye on them. Yeah. Thanks, Anthony. As we said the ResMed supply chain is configured around multiple sources. At this stage most of our manufactured products come from our Singapore plant, but we have full capability in the Sydney plant that does often focus on newer and more complex products. But we have full process capability in both plants. The fire season in Australia has been devastating. However, it hasn't actually gone into the outskirts of Sydney, which would actually make the whole thing a lot worse if it did. And today, we haven't seen any interference with that at all. But if there was interference that wouldn't overly affect us because of our ability to reconfigure."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "David Pendarvis",
            "content": "Yeah. Thanks Gretel. We continue to be at the same place we were last quarter. And that is we're waiting along with everyone else in the industry what the results are, the competitive bids that are in. We expect them at the end of the North American summer. So sometime around August or September and we'll know where the results are. We are pleased with the efforts that we made and others in the industry made to educate bidders, so they understand the portfolio nature of the lead item pricing and the impact of bidding on CPAP reimbursement on mask reimbursement. We're comfortable that that we conduct business with our customers now on a portfolio basis. And however, reimbursement settles out in the Medicare space. We expect to there'll continue to be strong demand for mask resupply that will continue to be important part of our customers business and it'll be an important part for patients' long term adherence success. So we don't see any significant changes in the trajectory going forward. But obviously, like with everyone else, we just have to wait and see what the actual reimbursement amounts come out to be. Sure, I mean, we already have ongoing discussions with our customers. We view them as good partners with us and we have robust discussions where they would like to get the best prices they can and we want to make sure that we serve them as best we can. That dynamic won't change with competitive bidding or anything else. So we expect to continue to have good discussions with them and the environment for the last year and a half and for the balance of calendar year '20 is that there's been about a 2% increase each year in the Medicare reimbursement. And so that's obviously contributed to a benign pricing environment that we've been experiencing for the last period of time. But we didn't participate with our customers in their bidding, obviously, they made their own decisions, we're confident that the bidding process will be a more fair one this time, and we're hoping it'll end up with a process that will be able to be good for the overall industry. But in terms of individual customer negotiations, Jim, you might want to comment on that. Up again, so thanks, Mike. Non-invasive ventilation obviously is in two different categories. One what we would characterize as life support ventilation is the new category that it's now going to be a competitive bidding, our air curve ranges the buy levels have previously been in competitive bidding. So that's not changing. It's more on the life support side. And that is newly there, but they're also had been reductions in that reimbursement over the past few years leading up to this. So it's not necessarily the case that you'll see the same kinds of reductions that you saw in the round two kind of range previously for the sleep products. Nevertheless, we think it's important that patients can benefit particularly COPD patients can benefit from these devices, they ought to get into the hands and that's of those patients and it's certainly a device that requires a lot of service. A lot of people in the in the home are making sure the device is working appropriately, so you need to have a strong reimbursement for it. It's a smaller group of customers who actually do this kind of business, and they're probably likely to be focused on what their real cost of serving are. So again, we're optimistic that our customers are sophisticated customers, they'll bid appropriately, so that they can make an adequate margin to be able to provide that service that's really, particularly in this area very well needed. So we'll wait and see how it goes. But we don't break out specifically our sales of life support anywhere in the US or otherwise, but thanks. And as to the bill and we certainly support that bill. Again, we think it's important that our customers receive the appropriate reimbursement and particularly in rural areas. It's difficult to do that. So we certainly support 2771. I think it's \u2013 you may have noticed there's a lot going on in Congress these days. So it's a little difficult to get anything through. But there is an opportunity in the middle part of the year, when I think some of the Medicare extenders come up for renewal, that there could be a push to get this along with some of the other items the industry supports in place. So we'll have to wait and see. But we certainly support that. And at a minimum, Congress indicating their support the industry is positive."

            "name": "Mick Farrell",
            "content": "Great, thanks Amy, and I'll go a little fast on my prepared remarks so we still have time for Q&A, despite the phone difficulties. Thanks, Amy. And thank you to all our shareholders for joining us today as we review results for ResMed's second quarter of fiscal year 2020. On today's call, I will discuss our long-term strategy. I'll then review top level financial results, some business highlights from the quarter, and a few key milestones. Then, I'll hand the call over to Brett who will walk you through our financials in further detail. Our team achieved another quarter of strong revenue growth across the portfolio driven by superb performance in the mask category, particularly in the US market with good performance across the 140 countries where we provide our solutions. We continue to take market share with our software solutions that enable increased therapy adherence with resupply programs providing support to those who need it and with our innovative new products. Customers are voting with their wallets and they are voting for ResMed. As the world's leading software driven medical device company, we are using digital health technology to transform the industry. We have sold nearly 11 million, 100% cloud connectable medical devices into the market, and Air Solutions our cloud-based ecosystem manages more than 12 million patients. In the last 12 months, we have changed over 15 million lives by providing a person with a ResMed device or complete ResMed mask system to help them breathe better and live better lives. In addition, our Brightree and MatrixCare software systems are helping to manage 90 million more people outside the hospital. Digital health technology is an integrator across everything that ResMed does. AirView, myAir, Propeller, and a portfolio of other digital health solutions allow us to better engage with our customers and partners, including patients, physicians, providers, payers, and complete healthcare systems. We are investing in advanced analytics and expanding our capabilities in machine learning and machine intelligence so that we can grow this digital health ecosystem at double digits on a volume basis. We will grow from just over 100 million lives improved with our healthcare products and solutions as we ended 2019 to our ambitious forward looking goal of improving 250 million lives in 2025. We now have over 5.5 billion nights of respiratory medical data in the cloud, and we are analyzing these data to derive actionable insights for the benefit of patients, physicians, providers, and healthcare systems. Our relentless focus on product and software innovation continues to set us apart from our competition. We have massive opportunities ahead in sleep apnea, in COPD, as well as in outside the hospital software to help patients live better quality lives, to help patients and healthcare systems save money, and to help achieve better management of chronic disease. We believe that the future of healthcare is outside the hospital. That's where ResMed competes today and that's where we are winning today. We have the right elements in place to achieve our strategy and to drive financial success as we provide market-leading value to customers. Let's now briefly review our top level financial results. We achieved another quarter of double digit revenue growth. We're up 14% in constant currency across our portfolio. This growth continues to be well balanced across our domestic US, as well as our global product sales, as well as from our software-as-a-service business. We continue to deliver operating leverage with non-GAAP operating profit growth of 21% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.21. I'd like to focus now on our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. In the device's category, we delivered a good quarter with year-over-year constant currency device growth of 8% globally supported by strong 9% device growth in the United States, Canada, and Latin America geographies as well as by improving Europe, Asia, and rest of world growth, which was at 6% constant currency in the device category. We continue to face headwinds for device growth in France as a result of the 2018 and 2019 digital health related fleet upgrades. We expect that the headwinds will begin to abate in the upcoming European summer, and we will start to return to market growth for devices in France during fiscal year 2021. Underlying patient growth remains healthy around the globe, and we continue to benefit from strong market dynamics with over 900 million people worldwide suffering from undiagnosed and untreated sleep apnea. Growth in the masks and accessories category of our business was incredibly strong during the quarter. We were up 16% constant currency globally in this category, well ahead of market growth rates, indicating that we gained significant market share with our latest patient interface innovations. Removing the impact of some software within this category, we are still growing our global mask franchise in the mid-teens. Our flagship masks the AirFit F20 and the AirFit N20 continued their growth across global markets. The success of these masks was augmented by continued good uptake of our more recent mask launches. We have launched a steady rhythm of mass innovation over the past 15 months. We have just lapped the successful launch of the F30 in the December quarter, and we will lap the launch of the N30, the N30i, and the P30i during the coming 12 months. The F30i was launched just over a week ago combining the needs for patients in the Freedom and the Minimalist mask segments.  With our portfolio of solutions, we are ensuring that we have the right mask for every patient, every time. We are innovating and expanding our mask portfolio to offer comprehensive options for physicians and home care providers, and for the specific needs of the ultimate customer, and that's the person who suffocates every night with sleep apnea. We remain focused on driving innovation to meet underserved customer needs. We are creating future products that are smaller, quieter, more comfortable, and more customized to each person's needs. Through digital health technologies, such as the myAir app, we are driving patient engagement without therapy, so that people can enjoy the benefits of better breathing and better sleep. We have well over 2 million patients using myAir and leveraging its insights and personalized feedback through coaching algorithms. In parallel, we are also ensuring that the cost of sleep apnea as a chronic disease can be better managed by physicians, providers, payers, and healthcare systems. Our Digital end-to-end solutions combined with available 100% cloud connectivity, as well as information provided to patients on their own smartphones are all leading to significant improvements in cost, improvements in healthcare outcomes and improvements in quality of life. We believe cloud based software combined with world leading medical devices can add value and improve both clinical outcomes as well as the patient experience. On the partnership front, our joint venture with Verily is creating software solutions to help identify and engage and enroll people with sleep apnea on a journey to better sleep and better breathing. We have commenced pilots in a handful of US cities to improve awareness, identification and engagement with the importance of good sleep and breathing to overall health. Our philosophy is this, the more a person knows about how much they suffocate every night, and the consequences of that suffocation on their overall health outcomes, the more likely they will seek solutions. At its simplest level, this partnership will drive incremental growth in our core sleep apnea business over the longer term and on a deeper level. This partnership will also allow ResMed to participate in a broad chronic disease management platform covering sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health and beyond. I'd like to now focus on our business in respiratory care. There are nearly 400 million people suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD worldwide. We don't believe these people are well served by global healthcare systems today and many COPD patients are frequent visitors to hospital emergency rooms with admissions and frequent readmissions. We have a vision to better manage COPD patients through the use of technology with digital end-to-end solutions. Technology such as our Propeller platform helps how patients are communicated to, it helps how they are encouraged in the medical care and it helps how folks are looked after as an individual person. We believe that technology combined with world leading medical equipment can add substantial value to improve both clinical outcomes and the patient experience. We plan to offer a portfolio of solutions through all stages of COPD progression. We will be there with Stage 1 and Stage 2 COPD patients as they commence inhaled pharmaceutical therapy managed by the Propeller platform. We will be there with Stage 2 and Stage 3 COPD patients as they add portable oxygen therapy to their care. We will also be there with Stage 3 and Stage 4 COPD patients as they commence non-invasive ventilation therapy and ultimately life support ventilation therapy. We will manage the person on one end-to-end digital health COPD platform, helping the patient, helping their caregivers and loved ones, as well as helping their physicians and providers so that they have the right information at the right time, lowering costs and improving outcomes. Our team at Propeller continues to progress their business as we move along the path from pilot trials to commercial partnerships with both pharmaceutical partners and healthcare systems. The digital health opportunity with inhaled respiratory medicine adherence will take time to build and we are making good progress. In December Propeller was included the only chronic respiratory disease solution in Express Scripts first formulary for digital health solutions. In November, access for Propeller users was expanded to pharmacy services from CVS, from Walmart, from Kroger and from Rite Aid. This was access directly from the Propeller app via my pharmacy feature within that smartphone application. We will update you on the milestones for Propeller with partners in both pharma as well as healthcare systems as we move forward throughout 2020. Finally, I'd like to focus on our software as a service business. We continue to integrate and optimize the out of hospital SAAS portfolio for long-term growth. We are focused on leveraging our competitive advantage as the only strategic player competing with leading software solutions focused on home medical equipment providers, skilled nursing facilities as well as home health and hospice providers. Our SAAS portfolio revenue grew 37% year-on-year this last quarter, benefiting from the MatrixCare acquisition that we left during November. We estimate that the weighted average market growth rate of these sectors we compete in is in the high single digits, excluding the timing benefit of the MatrixCare acquisition and on a pro forma basis, our SAAS portfolio grew in line with market in Q2. Our plan is to beat that market growth rate over the medium to long-term. As we reached the fourth anniversary of our Brightree tree acquisition here in 2020, we are achieving strong [Technical Difficulty] in our home medical equipment or HME sector with our Brightree team in Atlanta. We just passed the one year anniversary without MatrixCare acquisition in the quarter and we are increasing our investments in our MatrixCare team up there in Minneapolis. This investment is focused on new module introduction for our MatrixCare platform, so that we can ensure that we're able to grow and share in our skilled nursing facility as well as home health and hospice sectors as we move forward. We're doing the hard work to make MatrixCare as successful as Brightree is in the ResMed portfolio. And we have all the elements in place to do that. It took around 24 months to see strong sustainable returns from our investments in R&D and our management team at Brightree. We think we can meet or beat that timeline for strong and sustainable returns from our MatrixCare investments that we are currently making. Last quarter, we announced a collaboration with Cerner as the new preferred partner for home health and hospice software for Cerner's customers. It is early days in that partnership and things are going very well. We've started to migrate existing home health and hospice customers to our MatrixCare solution. Our sales team is actively engaged with Cerner's sales team, with customers learning of the benefits of our MatrixCare, home health and hospice software. We are excited to drive growth from this partnership. The rich interoperability between our two solutions will provide value for both Cerner and ResMed and customers as well as their patients and residents. I would like to take a moment to announce and exciting technology tuck-in acquisition that we are just in the process of completing. Just this week Brightree signed an agreement to acquire a company called SnapWorx. SnapWorx is a privately held software company that provides patient contact management and workflow optimization for sleep apnea resupply. The combination of Brightree's technology and logical services with this new SnapWorx technology creates the largest resupply base in the industry with end-to-end workflow automation. For our HME customers, the combination of these two technologies Brightree and SnapWorx will increase patient adherence and increase operational efficiency. We expect the transaction to close very shortly. The acquisition of SnapWorx is expected to be neutral to our non-GAAP ResMed earnings per share initially. However, we expect this acquisition will be accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share during fiscal year 2021. In summary, we have the vision to transform and significantly improved software solutions across outside the hospital healthcare sectors. We see a future where patients seamlessly transfer from HME to skilled nursing facilities to home health providers to hospice providers and beyond with reduced costs and increased efficiency resulting in better system outcomes as well as a high quality of life for the person in out of hospital care. Before I turn the call over to Brett, let me close with this. The first half of fiscal year 2020 was strong, and we are well positioned to grow through the second half of fiscal 2020 and beyond. The continued success of our mask and device portfolio along with a solid pipeline of new products and new digital health solutions covering sleep apnea, COPD and out of hospital software gives us confidence in continued growth as we move through the year. We have positioned ResMed for the long-term as the global leader in digital health driving top line and bottom line growth as we execute toward our 2025 strategy. We are focused on our triple aim; first, to slow chronic disease progression; second, to reduce overall healthcare system costs and third, to improve quality of life to the ultimate customer, the patient. With that all hands go over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks and then we'll go to Q&A. Brett? Thank you. Yeah, thanks for your question, Margaret. And as you noted, there's a number of factors contributing to this very strong mask growth that we had, 16% constant currency on a global basis, and even taking out some of the software just well up there in the mid-teens. You hit on pretty much all of them. There's an increased adherence that we're driving through our digital health solutions when we're achieving 87% adherence, when the doctor is using AirView and the patient is using myAir, and all the digital techs in play that drives up our mask growth. Secondly, when there's resupply and patients have the opportunity if they want to, to participate in getting a fresh mask as their old mask becomes used, and we are partnering with Brightree, Connect, and with ResMed ReSupply to provide that and the acquisition of SnapWorx will help. And then thirdly and really importantly, these last 15 months, the steady flow of four really exciting new mask innovations. Interestingly, these mask innovations aren't to replace a previous product, but to go after underserved or under met customer needs. And we call the minimalist category and the freedom category where people move through different positions during sleep; prone, left, right, sleepers want a Freedom mask and people who had some claustrophobia or want small, larger masks go to the minimalist category, and the F30 that we just launched is right in the heart of both of those. So it's all the above contributing to this really strong growth. We still think that the market growth right is in the high-single digits for masks. And we took really good share during this December quarter. Our job and challenge is to keep driving all those things: resupply, adherence, mask innovation and we plan to do just that. Thanks Margaret. Yeah, Matthew, that's a really good question. I'll hand that to Jim Hollingshead, the President of our Sleep Division to walk through that. Thanks, Sean. Well, we don't talk in our core business or in our new software businesses about individual customers or partners until things are public and moving along, but there was a public data last quarter from our work with pilot trials with both GSK and Novartis in the Propeller area looking at inhaled pharmaceutical medicines. Look, the beauty of it \u2013 as I sort of described in the opening remarks, the beauty of Propeller is it provides an end-to-end platform to help us take care of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. And so, Stage 1 and 2, with Propeller, we can take care of the patients, ensure they have the medicines that their doctor prescribed for them but also engage with that person because they're going to \u2013 it's a progressive disease, they're going to move from Stage 1 to Stage 2 and Stage 3 and Stage 4 COPD. And so our goal with Propeller is not just to have a partnership with pharma company A or B, but it's to really create a platform where we help end-to-end management of a person as they move through disease progression and it helps us engage with that person to help them adhere to their therapy, whether that therapy is the pharmaceutical inhaler or that therapy is a portable oxygen concentrated or that therapy as they move forward is a non-invasive ventilator or a life support ventilator. And so that's our goal with these partnerships. As we hit milestones during 2020 on the pharma side and as we hit milestones on the healthcare system side, we'll give updates on that. But look, yes, we did talk to the MAGNIFY trial that we're still enrolling patients for with Novartis. That's in its early days. So we will give updates on the clinical data, but also importantly commercial partnerships as they move forward through 2020. Thanks for your question, Sean. So I'll hand that to Brett who's down in Sydney. Saul, you may be on mute. We can hear you now. Yes. Yeah, Shane thanks for your question. I think there's a whole portfolio of customers doing different levels of resupply in different countries around the world. If you take the example of France, there's a government mandated requirement that you provide to masks, two masks per patient per year. And it's different in all the 140 countries. Yeah, you focused on the US growth, which was strong. And yes, the last public number we didn't talk about that was 1.9 masks per patient per year. But look out of the 5000 customers in the US there's a broad spectrum of adoption of Brightree. Resupply, Brightree Connect, ResMed resupply, and technologies like SnapWorx that we just acquired. And so there's a broad range. But Jim, do you want to \u2013 Jim Hollingshead, do you want to provide any further color as to what you'd want to share on mask supply metrics? Thanks for the question, Steve. That allows us to talk to our investment in SAAS and again SAAS this quarter was 12% of our global revenue. And so it's a sector that we're calling out and you'll see that in our financials. It's a very hyper competitive sector, when you look at HME software, you look at skilled nursing facility software and you look at home health and hospice software, so I'm going to be really hesitant to give detailed market share and/or growth rates within each of those sectors. What I said on the prepared remarks is true that cost \u2013 if you look at ResMed's weighted average revenue across HME, skilled nursing facility, home health and hospice, as well as the others private duty home care and client communities. The weighted average market growth rate in those sectors is in that high single digit. And during the December quarter over that portfolio we held share, we grew at the \u2013 taking out the acquisition benefit that gave us 37% growth. We grew in that high single digit on our weighted average portfolio. One thing I'll say is we've \u2013 when we hit April here in 2020, we will have and Brightree four years. And as you guys remember, because you followed the stock for a long time, the first two years with Brightree we were investing. Yeah, we put some new management team leaders in there we brought in new CEO, new CTO and some skill sets in R&D. We're doing very similar things now in our MatrixCare journey. And so I'm not going to break it out in detail, but qualitatively I'll say that the investments that we put in those first two years into Brightree are really starting to pay off. We've got new logos, new customers, new modules, and we're taking share, the growth is picking up. And at MatrixCare we're making those investments today in more R&D, more management skills and capabilities and looking obviously back in synergies across our portfolio. So I think we can meet or beat the timing of our Brightree investments and the strong and sustainable growth that we're now getting out of that in our MatrixCare investment. Yeah, there's a little bit of that. I'll hand it to Brett to go through the financial details on that. Thanks Lyanne. Yeah, so you're talking about our expansion of \u2013 our resupply capabilities, we went into some diabetic supplies and orthotics and urology products and so those \u2013 they're not a material part of ResMed's overall business. But they were a good expansion of ResMed's capabilities to look off to the HME sector beyond just sleep apnea and sleep app supplies that we are very good at making sure that they work through and so it's not material to our overall business. I'm not going to break out the specifics and other than to say they're going well and customers are adopting them and I'd love them to become a material part of our overall business to be able to break out like that. But it's early days and it's a good strategic ply of Brightree to sort of expand their capability with workflow optimization and both the combination of live call and tech that we use on masks and sleep apnea supplies. It's the same technology used on those diabetics and those other areas of HME. And so we're just helping our customers grow their businesses and get appropriate resupply when customers are there and requiring for authorization for it as well. So sorry, I can't get more specific than that, Lyanne. Thank you. So I'll hand that question to Dave Pendarvis. Dave? So I'll hand that for David and if Jim, you want to add any color from the customer perspective, as well, but Dave you first and then Jim? Dave and Jim, you again, Yeah, so SnapWorx is a technology that adds to Brightree end-to-end capabilities that SnapWorx has to partner with the HME. So it goes beyond just the live call and technology capability. They have provided to a number of customers and ability to further reach out to customers. And we had observed this software that was partnering with our Brightree platform and performing really well with those customers. And so we had a relationship with SnapWorx over the last 12, 24, 36 months and we've seen them really grow into a really good technology talking and the Brightree team looked at the technology from the team there in Nashville, Tennessee that created this tech and the entrepreneurs that created it. And we're really excited not only by what they're achieving in the market, which has better adherence and better engagement with both the HME and really importantly, with the end user customer. And what I bring it back which is the patient, what I bring it back to this is some data, some clinical data that we presented from the 5.5 billion knots of data that show that as you increase adherence, and as you engage with the patient and resupply the two add to each other. And some data we just released last quarter shows that for every hour of sleep, we reduce the total healthcare costs for inpatient by 8%. So this is all tied together, right. So Brightree, resupply \u2013 ResMed resupply and SnapWorx will increase adherence, drive increased mask resupply and that will also through that increased adherence lower the costs of the total healthcare system by 8% for every hour of sleep after those seven hours and so I think that combination is really powerful of now Brightree plus SnapWorx. Now, it's early days, we're just literally going through the finals of this acquisition, but watch us over the next 12, 24 months and we'll give you updates obviously every quarter as to how well that integration on that technology's going. Yeah, Mike thanks for the question. And look, it's really interesting that tech companies are really getting involved in the field of, I call it health wellness and sleep wellness is a big part of that. Obviously, we have our partnership with Verily and I have the Google watch as part of their baseline study and they're doing some identification, I'd call it. You call the diagnosis; I call it identification of potentially at risk people for poor sleep suffocation or sleep apnea. I think what Fitbit has is along those same lines and what they try to do, and that Fitbit is now part of the Google portfolio. I believe there's an acquisition in line there. It'll probably add on to that capability of, if you see de-saturations in the oxygen, there's a higher likelihood. There's other causes potentially of those de-sat, but there's a high likelihood of sleep apnea, so I would call it more in the medical terms a screener that will then hopefully identify and engage a person that maybe I have a sleep issue, maybe I have a breathing issue and indicate to them they need to get on to the true diagnostic pathway. And then we can sort of bring them into the identification, engagement enrollment capability we're trying to perform. But look, Jim you run the global fleet business, is there any further detail you think about some of these tech companies and the ability for them to identify more patients? Thanks for the questions Anthony. I'll ask Rob to answer the first one around manufacturing and then Dave to answer the second one around the H.R. Yeah, I said in the prepared \u2013 thanks for the question David. I said in the prepared remarks, it's the \u2013 so if you take that sort of global mask growth rate of 16%, and you take out Propeller software, you're going to be in the mid-teens, so maybe 100 basis points or something on global. And if you take the US growth, we're all pretty \u2013 I mean most of the Propeller software is the US growth on masks was 19% on a constant currency basis. If you take out Propeller and the software, you're about 200 basis points there, you're probably around 17% growth in the US territory, so 16 becomes around 15 and 19 would become around 17 David. I think that answers both your questions. And thanks to everyone for spending an extra eight minutes since we were eight minutes delayed due to the phone lines there, but appreciate that all. Hey, great. Thanks, Christine. And thanks again to all of our shareholders for joining us on this call. I'd also like to take the opportunity to thank the 7,500 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders, for their dedication and hard work. You produce these great numbers that we get to report. You help people sleep better, you help people breathe better, you help people live better lives outside the hospital in a 140 countries, which is pretty amazing. Thanks for all that you do today and every day and we'll talk to all of you again in around 90 days. Amy?"

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us, and welcome to ResMed's first quarter fiscal year 2020 earnings call. This call is being webcast live and the replay, along with a copy of the earnings press release and our updated investor presentation, will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today. Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results are CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett Sandercock. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. During our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please review the notes to today's earnings release. As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review the results for ResMed\u2019s first quarter of fiscal year 2020. On today's call, I will discuss our long-term strategy. I'll then review top level financial results, some business highlights from the quarter and a few key milestones. Then I'll hand the call over to Brett, who will walk you through our financials in further detail. We have started fiscal year 2020 right where we left off with 2019. Our team achieved another quarter of balanced growth across the portfolio, driven by continued strong performance in the mask category. We are taking share with recent new product introductions and our solutions are enabling increased therapy adherence as well as expansion of resupply programs to those who need it. Our dedicated team of more than 7,500 ResMedians around the world, have again delivered strong results. As the world's leading software-driven medical device company, we continue to use technology to advance our leadership position. We have sold more than 10 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices into the market. And our AirView, cloud-based ecosystem manages more than 11 million patient accounts. In the last 12 months, we changed over 15 million lives by providing a person with a ResMed device or a complete mask system, to help them breathe better and live better lives. In addition, our Brightree and MatrixCare branded out of hospital software systems are helping to manage 93 million more people. So during the last 12 months we improved more than 108 million lives with ResMed products, services and software solutions. We are well on our way to the ambitious goal to improve 250 million lives in 2025. Our connected solutions are providing us with valuable access to de-identified therapy data that we are using to derive actionable insights to benefit patients, physicians and providers, as well as to inform future innovation in products and software. These datasets are growing exponentially and we now have 5 billion knots of medical sleep and respiratory care data in the cloud. Our relentless focus on product and software innovation continues to set us apart from our competition. We remained laser focused on growth in our core market of sleep apnea, as well as in our adjacent respiratory medical markets of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as asthma. Our expanded focus to now grow outside the hospital software solutions allows us to help customers create efficiencies to take costs out of the healthcare system and to improve the quality of care across home medical equipment, home health, hospice, skilled nursing facilities, life plan communities and beyond. We believe the future of healthcare is outside the hospital. That's where ResMed competes today. That's where we are winning today and that's where we will continue to win in the future as we provide market-leading value to customers. Let's now briefly review our top level financial results for the quarter. We achieved another quarter of double-digit revenue growth, up 17% in constant currency across the portfolio. This growth was well balanced across domestic U.S. and global products sales, as well as balanced across our Software-as-a-Service businesses. We continued to deliver operating leverage in the quarter leading to a non-GAAP operating profit growth of 22% year-over-year, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.93. Turning to a brief discussion of our sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. In the devices category, we delivered a good quarter. We achieved year-over-year constant currency device growth of 6% globally, supported by very strong 8% device growth in the United States, Canada, and Latin America geographies. We achieved 4% constant currency growth of devices in combined Europe, Asia and rest of world. We achieved excellent device growth in the UK, Switzerland and across our Nordics countries. As discussed over the last few quarters, we experienced a continued headwind during the quarter for device growth in France as a result of digital health-related fleet upgrades. We expect that headwind to ease by the end of this fiscal year and then return to market device growth in France. It is great to see a steady flow of our digital health solutions into different European countries and to see positive constant currency device growth across the continent this quarter. The growth in the masks and accessories category of our business was incredibly strong during the quarter. We were up 19% in constant currency globally. This is well ahead of market growth rates, indicating we gained significant market share during the quarter. The reason that we continued to take share around the world is that we make the smallest, the quietest and the most comfortable masks available in the market. Our flagship masks, the AirFit F20 and the AirFit N20 continue their growth across global markets. The success of these flagship masks was augmented during the quarter by good uptake of our recent mask launches. To recap those launches, we have now launched four new masks during the last 12 months; the F30, the N30i and the P30i. And just this week, actually on Monday, our newest innovation was launched, the N30. We have the right mask for every patient, every time, and the N30 adds innovative dimensions to these portfolios. The N30 is a world first tube-down nasal cradle CPAP mask in a new product subcategory that we are calling the minimalist category. The N30 is our smallest, our lightest mask ever and our quietest nasal mask ever. I personally think this new N30 is another winner from our amazing research and development engineers. Watch this space as it gets into the hands of our market-leading marketing and sales teams. Now mask portfolio overall is positioned to offer world-leading options for physicians to prescribe for home care providers to fit in a first-time set-up, and most especially for the needs of the ultimate customer, the person who suffocates every night with sleep apnea. We remain focused on driving innovation to meet all underserved customer needs. The bottom line is that our new masks have a lot of runway ahead. Unfortunately, they don't let me talk about ResMed\u2019s future product pipeline, so I won\u2019t. Our success comes as healthcare providers, physicians and patients around the world continue to vote with their wallets and choose ResMed products, not just for the innovative design and high quality of our devices and masks, but also for the sustainable value proposition of the digital health solutions that we offer. Our digital end-to-end solutions combined with available 100% cloud connectivity, as well as information provided to patients on their own smartphones through apps like myAir and apps like Propeller, are all leading to significant improvements in lowering cost, and improving health outcomes and improving quality of life for patients around the world. Through digital health technology, we are driving patient engagement so that people can enjoy the benefits of the best therapy available. In parallel, we are also ensuring that the cost of chronic disease can be better managed by physicians, healthcare providers, payers and governments. There's still a long way to go. Our research that was just published by the Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal in July shows that there are over 936 million sleep apnea sufferers worldwide, while only around 20 million or so are being treated today. We keep forging ahead, investing in our own research and development to drive further innovation and advancement, as well as by working with partners. On the partnership front, our joint venture with Verily is working on software solutions to help identify and engage and better manage more people with sleep apnea. It is very early days on \u2013 in this JV, but our philosophy is that the more person knows about how much they suffocate every night and the consequences of that suffocation on their own personal healthcare outcomes, the more likely they will seek solutions. Over time, we know this partnership will drive incremental growth in our core sleep apnea business, while allowing ResMed to participate in a broader chronic disease management ecosystem, covering not just sleep apnea, but also cardiovascular disease, diabetes, COPD and beyond. These chronic disease management platforms will include clinical care as well as wellness improvements in nutrition, in cardiovascular exercise and in mental health. Let's now turn to our second vector of growth here at ResMed, our business in respiratory care. There were nearly 400 million people worldwide suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD. We don't believe they are well served by healthcare systems today. We see the opportunity to better manage COPD through the use of technology with digital end-to-end solutions that can help patients as they progress with this chronic disease, including how patients are communicated to, how patients are encouraged in their medical care and how patients are looked after as individual persons. We're advancing our respiratory care strategy in multiple ways. Earlier this summer we introduced a number of enhancements to AirView, our cloud-based patient management platform. We are making management of ventilation patients much simpler and much more useful for home medical equipment providers. Physicians and HMEs can now look deep into therapy data to see key performance indicators such as pulse rate, inspiratory time, maximum airflow, and even a patient\u2019s rapid shallow breathing index or RSBI. All these data are now available within our digital healthcare ecosystem, with the easy to use AirView platform. Our goal is to help create a frictionless experience when managing COPD patients with ResMed's solutions. Our team at Propeller also continues to grow their business as we move from pilot trials to commercial partnerships with leading respiratory pharmaceutical companies. The team was recently at the European Respiratory Society Annual Congress in Madrid. It was great to see Propeller represented at multiple pharma booths, including live demonstrations of Propeller solutions for physicians. Propeller was also featured in several scientific presentations during ERS, including the public announcement of a new large COPD outcomes trial that's sponsored by Novartis. The trial will compare Propeller plus COPD standard of care to COPD standard of care alone. The trial has already begun enrolling patients during this quarter. As we outlined, when we acquired Propeller in January, the digital health opportunity with respiratory medicine adherence will take time to build into critical mass. This quarter, we passed a significant milestone with more than 100,000 people enrolled into the Propeller ecosystem. Let's be clear, we are still in the early days of market development here. The analogy is that we are now just lacing our shoes for the digital health ultra marathon in both COPD and in asthma. So there's lots of terrain ahead. The evolution that we have made in our respiratory care business has set ResMed up to become the global leader in digital health for COPD. From Stage 1 and Stage 2 COPD with Propeller's pharmaceutical adherence solutions to Stage 3 and Stage 4 COPD with portable oxygen concentrators as well as our cloud-connected non-invasive ventilation solutions. Let's now turn to our third vector of growth, our Software-as-a-Service business. We continue to integrate and optimize the SaaS portfolio for long-term growth. Our competitive advantage derives from our leadership position in SaaS solutions for home medical equipment, for skilled nursing facilities, for home, health, hospice, life plan communities and home care services. ResMed is the best strategic player competing in these verticals. And we have the expertise running global digital health systems at scale to be able to succeed in the future. Our SaaS portfolio continues its growth trajectory this quarter with revenue up 83% year-on-year during the quarter. Clearly, growth in this first quarter was accelerated leveraging our MatrixCare acquisition in November of 2018. We will lap that acquisition during this current second quarter. We estimate that the underlying market growth of the blended portfolio of seven out-of-hospital SaaS verticals that we serve is in the high single digits. Leaving out the MatrixCare acquisition, we grew right in line with the market in Q1. We have set up an execution plan to continue to innovate and to continue to launch market-leading upgrades combined with new capabilities that will allow us to gain market share in our SaaS verticals and participate in the fastest growing ones so that we can beat market growth. We plan to exit fiscal 2020 with solid double digit growth in our SaaS business segment. One example of the progress that we're making in our SaaS portfolio is the recent announcement of our collaboration with Cerner as a new preferred provider for home health and hospice software. This agreement validates ResMed as an industry-leading provider of digital health solutions for out-of-hospital healthcare. Our Matrixcare managed offering for home health and hospice customers includes the best-of-breed capabilities from both the MatrixCare technology and from the Brightree technology. This agreement ensures our home health and hospice solution is available to all of Cerner's large customer base. The net result is growth opportunities for both Cerner and MatrixCare sales teams. In fact at the recent Cerner Health Care Conference, a major healthcare system with a very large home health business was introduced to the ResMed solution and they are quickly moving toward a contract with our MatrixCare team. It is clearly early days as the ink dries on the Cerner contract, but the bottom line is, we are excited to drive growth from this partnership and to leverage interoperability to provide value for all of our customers. In summary, for the SaaS business, we have the vision to transform and significantly improve out-of-hospital healthcare. We are helping people stay out of the hospital and in the care setting of their choice with lower costs and a higher quality of life for the person. The best place that people often choose is almost always their own home. Ageing in place is a trend that is growing not just in the U.S. but globally and we plan to enable and leverage that positive change. We think that's an important part of the future of healthcare. Before I turn the call over to Brett, Let me close with this. We have had a great start to the new fiscal year and we are well positioned to grow throughout fiscal year 2020 and beyond. We have positioned ResMed for the long-term as the global leader in digital health driving both top-line and bottom-line growth as well as executing on our strategy to improve 250 million lives in healthcare that's delivered outside the hospital in 2025. We are focused on our triple aim to slow chronic disease progression, to reduce overall healthcare system costs and to improve outcomes and quality of life for the ultimate customer, the person who simply to sleep well, to breathe well and to live a better life well away from that hospital. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks and then we'll open up for Q&A. Brett, over to you in Sydney.\nBrett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the September quarter was $691 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 17%. Excluding revenue from acquisitions, group revenue increased by 11% on a constant currency basis. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin American countries were $317 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $224 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. However, in constant currency terms, sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 8% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $197 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $193 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter. The revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets device sales were $152 million, which is consistent with the prior year quarter, but in constant currency terms, a 4% increase. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets was $72 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, a 19% increase. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 6% while masks and other sales increased by 19% over the prior year quarter. Software-as-a-Service revenue for the first quarter was $87 million, an increase of 83% over the prior year quarter. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and the purchase accounting fair value adjustment to MatrixCare deferred revenue. The prior year comparable excludes amortization of acquired intangibles. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Our gross margin for the September quarter was 59.5% compared to 58.3% in the same quarter last year and 59.3% in Q4 FY19. Compared to the prior year, our gross margin increased by 120 basis points. This was predominantly attributable to manufacturing and procurement efficiencies, the MatrixCare acquisition and favorable product mix. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the first quarter were $167 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 16%. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A expenses increased by 6% on a constant currency basis. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 24.6% compared to 25% that we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward subject to currency movements and taking into account recent acquisitions, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 23% to 24% for the remaining three quarters of fiscal year 2020. R&D expenses for the quarter were $48 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 27%. Excluding acquisitions, R&D expenses increased by 2% on a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.1% compared to 6.6% in the prior year. Looking forward, subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2020. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $18.5 million for the quarter, an increase of 44% over the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact from our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $13.3 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $191 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $135 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.93, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.83. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 20.2%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.6. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2020 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $162 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $22.7 million. Depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $38 million. And during the quarter, we paid dividends of $56.1 million. We recorded equity losses of $6.8 million in our income statement in the September quarter as I said via Verily joint venture. We expect to record approximately $7 million of equity loss of each quarter in fiscal year 2020 associated with the joint venture operations. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share. During the quarter, we repaid $49 million of our outstanding debt. At September 30, we had $1.2 billion in gross debt and $1 billion in net debt. Our balance sheet remained strong with modest debt levels. Finally, to recap, our top-line revenue was strong this quarter with growth across all major categories. Gross margin expanded and our operating costs remained well controlled. As a result, we're continuing to drive operating leverage with Q1 non-GAAP operating profit up 22% year-on-year. We are focused on driving operating results, integrating our SaaS acquisitions and ensuring we continue to invest in our strategic long-term opportunities. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thanks. Brett. We will now going to turn the call over to the Q&A portion. I'd like to remind everyone to please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, please do feel free to return to the call queue. Chris, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gretel Janu with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nGretel Janu: Thanks. Good morning. So just on the U.S. device growth continues to be very strong, just wondering what would be the growth in kind of new patient setups in the quarter, give us some detail on that?\nMick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Gretel. So we don't actually have full visibility even to the number. We sell to in the U.S. to home medical equipment companies that then sell to patients that are renewing in their five-year renewal or to new patient. So we don't have full visibility into that. But it is interesting with a reasonably sized patient pool in the United States it would be a good double-digit percentage or so of those that will be replenishment devices. But the 8% growth I think is really ahead of market. We think the market growth is in the sort of mid-single digits. And so to be at 8% growth in the U.S. shows that we were taking some share due to the value of Air Solutions, AirView and myAir and all the sort of digital health solutions that are there.\nGretel Janu: Thank you.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Gretel.\nOperator: Your next question is from Steve Wheen with Evans. Your line is open.\nSteve Wheen: Yes. Hi guys. Just a question also on the devices, there seems to be certainly amongst the DME land a bit of a rush on COPD codes and the setting up of patients with ventilators. Just wondering if you're seeing any benefit from that, particularly around amongst your Astral \u2013 your ventilator range in particular, the Astral?\nMick Farrell: Steve, thanks for the question. We actually saw really solid growth in the core fleet business, as a sizeable chunk of that 8% growth in the U.S. Astral tends to be more of a player, ventilation in general tends to be more of a player in Europe and so some of that sort of 4% constant currency growth in Europe, Asia and rest of world will have been driven by the Astral in some sort of much smaller element of the 8% U.S. growth. But one thing that we've been really strong with our DME customers is to make sure that the right device goes on the right patient at the right time. And when you look at COPD, there were lots of solutions from our [indiscernible] as well as \u2013 so non-invasive ventilation, as well as even Stellar product in non-invasive ventilation all the way through to our Astral product, which is really a life support ventilator and should be used in very severe COPD and in life support needs. And so, yes, it really wasn't a huge contributor in the U.S. this quarter, probably slightly more significant in Europe. But it's really good solid balanced growth, if you like, from our sleep apnea side with some additions from respiratory care is how I'd position it.\nSteve Wheen: Great. Thanks very much.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is open.\nMargaret Kaczor: Hey, good afternoon. And good afternoon to most people, good morning for others. But thanks for taking the question. Just kind of big picture, I know some people are going to focus on the device sleep apnea growth, but I know you guys ended up delivering 11% top line growth, excluding acquisitions and that's above market in almost every category and even as you're seeing a headwind in France. So I guess looking out whether it's this year or the next couple of years, what prohibits you guys from continuing that double-digit top line growth rate and what could drive it higher or lower from today's levels? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Margaret. Certainly, we did have a very good quarter here in Q1. And as you said, we grew like sort of 11% constant currency globally in our sleep and respiratory care combined businesses. If you think about the global growth and we have enough data now to know that the growth really is in that mid- to high-single digits, so the devices growing in the mid-single digits and masks growing in the high-single digits. Clearly, we did take share in Q1 and a lot of that is driven by the digital health technology on the flow generator side to have some of the share taking on the device side, and then the new product introductions that I detailed in the prepared remarks, four new masks in addition to two strong flagship marks there, so NPI has been an incredible contributor to us. Just if you think through the year ahead, even during this quarter that we're currently in the second quarter, we're going to lap one of those four product launches on the mask side and we'll continue to lap those during the quarter. So look, I'm always very excited about our innovations; the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable, the most connected, and I think that innovation drives. But you can't outgrow market forever, right? You've got to then focus on getting more patients into the funnel, which is our whole identify, engage and enroll people in. So I think a fantastic Q1, but as we look through the fiscal year, we think we can meet or beat market growth, but you're not going to beat it every single time.\nMargaret Kaczor: Great. Thank you, guys.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Margaret.\nOperator: Your next question is from David Low with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nDavid Low: Thanks very much. During the period, we heard \u2013 we saw from your competitor Philips that they had issues with their connected care business. They talked about tariffs, et cetera. Just wondering sort of market landscape in the U.S., whether you saw any disruption from that? Do you think some of the \u2013 that ResMed may have been a beneficiary of the issues that they were working through?\nMick Farrell: Yes, I'll hand that \u2013 good questions, David. I'll hand that to Rob Douglas, our COO.\nRob Douglas: Sure, David. Just generally on the tariffs issue just to reiterate, as we've said before, the way our whole supply chain is configured, we're not really affected by the specific tariffs. We export very little into China from the U.S. and very little from China to the U.S. Our supply chain is more Southeast Asian focused. And we've got a great team in China doing local products for China. So that's pretty solid. Our AirView solutions on the other hand, mostly by the way developed by teams all around the world, but really a strong product offering, continues to deliver superior value to our customers. And we think \u2013 with day-in and day-out we'll fight competitions with those products and belief that we've got a better proposition to offer. So we \u2013 from our perspective, we didn't see any particular competitive issues that were sort of changing the normal competitive dynamics. We do have to sell and execute well. And our teams have been doing that.\nDavid Low: Great. All right. Thanks very much.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Goodsall with MST Marquee. Your line is open.\nAndrew Goodsall: Thanks very much, guys. Perhaps just thinking forward into competitive bidding and I guess the bids are in, so I guess by the next time we\u2019ve got a sense where the clearing price land. I'm just wondering whether there\u2019s any preliminary comments you've got and your thoughts there or any preliminary actions you're taking I guess to prepare for competitive bidding, and whether that involves new product launches or anything? Just say preliminary is your sort of doing or preparatory actions?\nMick Farrell: Yes, thanks for the question, Andrew. I'll hand that to David Pendarvis.\nDavid Pendarvis: Thanks, Andrew. The \u2013 obviously we spent a lot of time along with others in the industry trying to educate the market participants so they would be able to bid effectively and bid smartly given the new rules. We remained encouraged with the changes that were put in place principally that clearing price is what's going to drive reimbursement as opposed to the median price under the old regime, and some of the other changes that were made, including requiring bonds to bid in particular areas. We hoping that together with the education that the industry did will lead to smart bids and that'll lead to a fair, more realistic reimbursement. We obviously didn't participate in the bidding process and haven't had direct conversations with customers about what they bid. So it's all conjecture at this point as to where the ultimate reimbursement will land. But no matter where it is, whether it's a private pay, reimbursement change or a Medicare U.S. change or something elsewhere in the world, we're continually working with our customers to help them be more efficient, help them take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves and to enable them to better serve patients under whatever the reimbursement schemes are. So we'll definitely continue to do that, and watch where the U.S. Medicare landscape evolves. But at the moment, that's still a year and a bit away. So we'll just keep doing what we're doing and obviously focus on it when the time comes.\nAndrew Goodsall: Thank you.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: Your next question is from Lyanne Harrison with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\nLyanne Harrison: Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you for taking my question. Solid mask growth outside of outside of America, and I just wanted to understand you've had one of your competitors launch a new full face mask outside of America. Have you seen any difference in your full face mask sales outside of the U.S. versus within the U.S.? And how are you positioning yourself now that they've got FDA approval to launch within the U.S.?\nMick Farrell: Yes. So thanks for the question, Lyanne. And look, we have multiple competitors in the 120 countries we sell into and we expect new product introduction from our competitors on a regular basis. Yes, as you noted, during the quarter, we had 19% constant currency growth in U.S., Canada, Latin America. We also had 19% constant currency growth of masks in Europe, Asia and rest of world, where some of those masks and new launches have already been in play during the quarter. So I think we've \u2013 I know we've got the most robust sleep apnea mask portfolio on the planet versus our competitors in all the 120 countries that we participate in. But there's no arrogance or hubris heated out. Our team of R&D engineers furiously working, not only on technology to address underserved needs, but to think differently about how to really achieve that ultimate goal, which is sort of the silent CPAP and the invisible mask. And if you look at the N30 that we just launched, this minimalist category mask, it's about as close to an invisible mask as you can get. It is small, it is quiet, it is comfortable. So, look, I love innovation coming to the market from our competitors and from us because it keeps us all honest. But during the quarter, we performed very well versus all the NPI from our competitors with our own NPI. And I expect us to be able to do that into the future. And competition is just a healthy part of making sure that tens of millions of people get the breathing night.\nLyanne Harrison: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Deakin-Bell with Citi. Your line is open.\nJohn Deakin-Bell: Well, good morning. I have a question for Brett. Just to deconstruct that gross margin expansion a little bit. I think previously you've given us the fee of what was from the MatrixCare. But can you just maybe elaborate a bit more in terms of strong mask growth, higher margin that would have impacted, and also whether there's a more benign processing environment in the U.S. which is helping as well?\nBrett Sandercock: Hi, John, it\u2019s Brett. I think it's all of those things, probably the pricing environment is relatively been on at the moment, so the impacts there were pretty modest. In terms of acquisitions that contributed around 50 basis points. So if you think about that, still really a strong, let's call it organic expansion of the margin, which is really good. That's really around the manufacturing and procurement efficiencies. And then clearly some product mix benefit there as you saw the outperformance in the mask growth. So a combination of all of those factors I think led to that expansion.\nJohn Deakin-Bell: Okay. Thanks, Brett.\nOperator: And your next question comes from David Bailey with Macquarie. Your line is open.\nDavid Bailey: Good morning, guys. Just in relation to U.S. mask and accessories, you've talked to adherence to resuppliers as key drivers of growth. Just wondering if you can comment on your views as to those factors being drivers of growth over the next two to three years?\nMick Farrell: Yes, it's a good question, David. I'll hand that to Rob.\nRob Douglas: Yes, thanks, David. Yes. The resupply program has definitely supported the mask portfolio. We've talked many times. You've got to understand the sort of the feedback of this. If we can get patients onto a good mask, they're more likely to stay on treatment, they'll do better and then they'll need a mask. And so we continue to see that dynamic happening. Our software solutions that support the resupply programs and enable our HME customers to manage resupply programs more efficiently and ensure that the patients have the treatment that they need when they need it. We\u2019re also supporting it. These are long-term programs. We've been running resupply programs for many years now and our teams will continue to refine and focus it. And as Mick said earlier though, these markets are competitive. We do have competitors playing it. We have competition in resupply programs as well as in mask. And it really gets down to, we've got a really strong team executing broadly across all parts of the portfolio on this that will continue to make sure that we're providing the best solutions for patients and providers delivering the best outcomes. So I think it's really a steady as she goes progress. We love \u2013 we really like these resupply programs and they're providing us a very solid steady business.\nDavid Bailey: Thanks very much.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Next question is from Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSean Laaman: Good morning, everybody. Mick, I'm wondering if you can give a little bit more granularity on the Novartis study you mentioned in your preliminary comments and perhaps some timelines that would be really useful.\nMick Farrell: Yes, thanks for the question, Sean. I wasn't at ERS, but I'll hand over to David Pendarvis, who can give us some more detail on the Novartis clinical trial.\nDavid Pendarvis: Terrific. Sean, we mentioned in the opening remarks, it goes by the name of magnify, and of course with trials these days you have to have a good acronym, and that stands for maximizing adherence and gaining new information for your COPD. And the trial is going to be obviously sponsored by Novartis. And what it's doing is taking patients within clinics and then within those clinics, randomizing the patients to either standard clinical practice or using Propeller. And then there'll be a comparison. And the endpoint is the time to failure of treatment. And then failure of treatment is defined in various ways such as needing an additional medication, having some particularly acute exacerbations, winding up in hospital, those kinds of things. And it'll look and see, whether or not adding the adherence benefits of Propeller linked since the time that patients stay in that good controlled state. It's beginning recruiting now and I believe it's supposed to run through the end of 2021. So it will take quite a while before it meets it\u2019s \u2013 the end of that time period. But the important thing is a lot of the data that's been out now has been done in the asthma setting. Obviously, that's an important area and we want to take care of those patients. But the COPD strategy is very important to us because of the way it connects with our overall respiratory care strategy. So having someone like Novartis sponsor a study, looking at Propeller benefits to a COPD patient population, we think is a real important milestone and we'll look for good benefits to come out of that study in the future, but it will be a few years.\nSean Laaman: Fantastic. Thanks, Dave. Thanks, Mick.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Sean.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nAnthony Petrone: Thank you. Great. I'm just going to have a follow-up to the Novartis question and somewhat Mick, you mentioned a couple of weeks ago indications of interest from AstraZeneca, Glaxo and Novartis on Propeller health. I'm just wondering if you have an update there and anything you can share potentially on how that would be priced on a per user per month basis. Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Yes Thanks for the question, Anthony. Pharma companies \u2013 there are many respiratory pharmaceutical, pharma players in the field and the names you mentioned all have drugs in the market. One thing about pharma companies is they\u2019re very competitive with each other and they don\u2019t want information shared too much publicly. Certainly on our Investor deck we put the names of those where we have published clinical data and we are working with. And the reason we\u2019re bringing Novartis in our prep remarks here is that\u2019s a public clinical trial. One of the interesting things that\u2019s happening here is there\u2019s a lot of trials that aren\u2019t public that are happening out there that obviously we cannot talk about. As we look forward, the important thing if you think about milestones, Anthony, to sort of to look at on this, sort of digital health option play if you like that we have in our strategy with the Propeller solution is when somebody goes from these pilot trials to a commercial trial and when they would allow us to talk about that publicly. And so, if and when that happens, that\u2019s the milestone, I think that\u2019s most important in a material element to our shareholders. As I said in the prep remarks, we got in early with Propeller and this is a long road. I think I used the analogy that it\u2019s an ultra marathon. This is beyond just 26.2 mile. This is a huge journey. COPD number two cause for hospitalization and rehospitalization, the number three cause of death. It has such good runway for us in the future, but there\u2019s nothing material in the quarter. And so, we\u2019re just giving the update. We hit 100,000 patients. We think that\u2019s fantastic. Right validation to have Novartis start its public study. It\u2019s going to take a couple of years as Dave said. But I would expect that before those couple of years we will have some other milestones of going to some commercial trials that we can talk about in upcoming conference calls. But at the moment this quarter, Anthony, there\u2019s nothing to report other than really good early data.\nAnthony Petrone: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Saul Hadassin with UBS. Your line is open.\nSaul Hadassin: Thanks. Good morning, Mick. Good morning or good afternoon, Mick and Brett. I want to talk about the SaaS business making the tie-up with Cerner, I mean it suggests that they\u2019re effectively leaving that post-acute space to providers like yourself. I\u2019m just interested to know the \u2013 how much work needs to be done to allow for the two architectures to talk to each other. If you have a new electronic medical record for example in the acute space offered by Cerner, what work has to be done in terms of your SaaS business to allow those two systems to talk to each other. When do you expect to see the ability of the benefits of that tie-up to come through? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Saul. It allows us to talk to the area of interoperability, which is incredibly important for us here at ResMed. We have 100 API calls per second from integrators into our air solutions ecosystem. So every second 100 interactions with another EHR, EMR whether it\u2019s an individual person or myAir app checking the therapy or a physician at Massachusetts pioneer looking over 20,000 patients to do some management by exception protocol. And so, the Cerner contract or deal is that they \u2013 Cerner are looking for ResMed and really truly through our MatrixCare managed team to take care of home health and hospice customers for them. So they have customers that have hospital systems, but for the out-of-hospital part where it goes to home health and hospice, they want ResMed to be their partner to take care of those. And we think it\u2019s a really exciting opportunity for the MatrixCare sales team and for the Cerner sales team to partner up and have that move forward. And it was really interesting at the Cerner conference to have our MatrixCare and Brightree teams there and all the technology available from the iPad app and all the capabilities that we have for home health and hospice and to get some really good leads. It\u2019s not going to be material in the next 90 days for us, this Cerner contract, but the reason we\u2019re talking about it is that idea of interoperability with Cerner, with Epic, with Allscripts, with all the players in hospital healthcare, we think it\u2019s going to be really important that ResMed is the best person that can provide that handshake that API from someone in acute care to what they call post-acute care, but what we call out-of-hospital healthcare and we think that partnership is going to be really strong. So we\u2019ll give you updates as the quarters progress, not just to the Cerner home health and hospice partnership, but to other partnerships with hospital systems, hospital providers and EHR providers. We think it\u2019s a good milestone to show that one of the top three leaders along with Epic and Allscripts there in hospital EHR has chosen ResMEd as their home health and hospice care provider with our MatrixCare managed solution and we\u2019re really excited about that.\nSaul Hadassin: Thanks. Operator Your next question is from Thomas Yeo with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nChris Cooper: Hi, there. It\u2019s Chris Cooper on for Tom. And apologies if I missed it, but I didn\u2019t hear much commentary on Mobi portable oxygen concentrator this morning and in your prepared remarks. Could you just give us an update there, please?\nMick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. I\u2019ll hand that to Rob.\nRob Douglas: Thanks, Mick. Yes, Thomas. We, as you recall, we launched Mobi very early this year and we\u2019ve sort of been in a really still in a learning mode. It\u2019s a great product. We\u2019re actually learning a lot about the performance of the product and we\u2019ve talked about and continue to validate the issue of the balance of the performance specifications and how the product works. And so, we\u2019re in good shape there. What we\u2019re also learning is that it is challenging through, particularly through the U.S. reimbursement model how to get the right patients on the right treatment and how to get that property funded and we have been trialing experiments in looking at ways to optimize and develop that. Really we\u2019re learning a lot about what our sort of future pathways to market would be and how to \u2013 how can we make it best suitable for our HME customers to support patients and also what are the future needs of products further down the track and feeding learnings into our future roadmap. So with that all going on, the learning process is quite successful. We\u2019re still not a major market share player with the product and that\u2019s unlikely to change into the short-term future with the Mobi product that we\u2019re currently investing and the way we\u2019re heading at the moment.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mike Matson with Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nMike Matson: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I just wanted to ask about, there is a I guess a bill in Congress H.R. 2771 to kind of extend the relief from the bidding program that I think is set to expire into 2020. So just curious to get your thoughts on that and what that mean if that were not to be successful? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: I\u2019ll hand that question to Dave Pendarvis.\nDavid Pendarvis: Yes. Thanks, Mike. Yes, there is a lot of efforts under way in the U.S. Congress right now to try to provide relief, particularly the one you mentioned which is try to extend the relief that was given that was that sort of 50-50 blend between prior reimbursement and the new system reimbursement into those rural areas. We certainly support that legislation. We think it\u2019s important that our customers who are operating particularly in extended areas where they\u2019ve got to drive many miles to patients\u2019 homes need to have reimbursement that reflects the operating cost that they\u2019ve got and we would certainly hope that the champions that there in Congress will carry the day. Now as your question implies, there is a lot going on in the U.S. Congress these days. It\u2019s very difficult to predict whether something like that will ultimately pass or whether CMS could respond on their own and provide that kind of relief. If it doesn\u2019t, I think as I said before when talking about competitive bidding, we\u2019ll obviously work with our customers to do what we can to support them. We think the remote capabilities of our devices are ideal for providing care to remote setting. You could do things like change some of the settings on a CPAP, you can certainly interrogate the CPAP for information about the quality of the therapy that has been provided, all without having to drive to someone\u2019s home. So we think that those systems helping customers whether they are in rural areas or not to deploy them is probably the best thing we can do to help in that kind of a setting. But we\u2019ll continue to support that legislation and other efforts with CMS to try to make sure that the Medicare policies and reimbursement is as favorable as it can be for the ultimate benefit of Medicare beneficiaries.\nMike Matson: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Shane Storey with Wilson. Your line is open.\nShane Storey: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. It\u2019s maybe a bit tangential, but it relates to the CMS reimbursement changes that hit skilled nursing providers this month. Sort of weighing up that as an incremental opportunity for Matrix, I mean do you have an estimate of the proportion of providers that are yet to adopt good solutions there? And just interested to know, just how much growth there is, a scope sort of toward available for Matrix there in the SaaS market?\nMick Farrell: Yes, Shane. Thanks for the question. It\u2019s a good one. There are changes in reimbursement not just in HME as we just talked about, but also in skilled nursing facilities and within home health and hospice. These provide excellent opportunities for Software-as-a-Service providers to \u2013 if you\u2019re ahead of the game as MatrixCare was for the skilled nursing facilities changes as we are for the home health and hospice changes to be able to support customers through that change and even grow share because you\u2019ve got the best solution that deals with those changes well. One thing I can say is that the new CEO there at MatrixCare, Steve Pacicco has formed great relationships with the customers and he has a great sales team that know the skilled nursing facility teams really well. And we\u2019ve not only helped them through these changes in this quarter, but also set them up for success that our systems are operating well under the new reimbursement approach within those verticals. So that\u2019s \u2013 when you roll that all together, it\u2019s part of sort of that 2020 execution plan I talked about earlier that we see a good pop even if the blended rate of growth across these seven out-of-hospital healthcare verticals is in those high single digits. We think there are areas where we can get better growth than that. And we plan to exit 2020 with a double digit growth trajectory in the segment of SaaS. And part of that is going to be doing just what your question asked about, which is every part of the vertical, whether it\u2019s skilled nursing facilities, whether it\u2019s our new play in home health and hospice, the hunting license with Cerner in addition to our ability to grow share through having solutions that are ahead of the curve on reimbursement changes, they\u2019re all opportunities to be able to grow faster and form longer partnerships with our customers.\nShane Storey: Thanks, Mick. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question is from Steve Wheen with Evans. Your line is open.\nSteve Wheen: Hi, sorry. I just wanted to come back to Brett on the gross margin. You typically gave a bit of a range for that in terms of guidance. Are you able to do that again this quarter?\nBrett Sandercock: Yes. Sure, Steve. I mean there\u2019s a lot of moving parts, but I would think it would be broadly consistent with where we were for Q1.\nSteve Wheen: Perfect. Thank you.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: And your next question is from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nAnthony Petrone: Just a quick follow-ups on masks. I know you mentioned, Mick, a couple of launches. I\u2019m just wondering how much stocking potentially there was in the quarter? And then just on lead item. Is there any \u2013 Dave, you mentioned, we spoke a couple of days ago, but is there any indication on how this is kind of coming in post the notification period? Thanks again.\nMick Farrell: Yes. So Anthony, I\u2019ll take the first part of your question on masks and Dave will take the second part. Clearly we had excellent new product introduction over the last 12 months, but your question was around do people do stocking orders. Our U.S. distribution, and frankly, our global distribution partners are getting very intelligent about inventory management, not just those who use Brightree and have ResMed\u2019s Brightree inventory management system, which will actually manage it for them, but many of them are getting really appropriate on that knowing when a new mask comes, watching how there r teasers setting it up and seeing the patient flow and making sure they don\u2019t get too ahead of the curve or behind the curve. You don\u2019t want a patient in the fitting room that wants the N30 and it\u2019s not there, but on the other hand, you don\u2019t want excess inventory because I have inventory carrying costs as everyone knows and our U.S. distributors are actually quite sophisticated on this. So I \u2013 obviously when some \u2013 you launch a brand new mask, people do need to make sure they got that mask on the shelf. But given the proportion of existing resupply patients, which is a very large portion, particularly the U.S. distributors patient flow, we don\u2019t think there was material impact from stocking. Now, we don\u2019t have full insight into our customers that aren\u2019t using Brightree or other inventory management solutions, but we think it\u2019s a pretty steady approach and we\u2019ve done new product introductions over the 20, 30 years we\u2019ve been in business. And I don\u2019t \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen that a significant rate before and I don\u2019t think we saw any significant rate of that during the last quarter. Dave, the second part of the question for you.\nDavid Pendarvis: Sure. Yes, thanks Anthony. I mentioned a little bit earlier that ResMed along with other industry participants put a lot of energy and resources behind trying to educate the market participants who are going to be bidding about various factors including lead item pricing and we developed a calculator that was put out. There were some stats that were just discussed in the Medtrade meeting just earlier this week in Atlanta that there were over 17,000 downloads of that calculator. And that\u2019s just simply the one that was available to the participants here. CMS had their own calculator that folks downloaded. From the conversations that I\u2019ve had, my understanding is that most DMEs have a pretty good understanding of lead item pricing and how it works. And hopefully they\u2019ve avail themselves of the tools to be able to model out scenarios based on their own business and their own volume of products in different categories so that they can bid intelligently and in a way that\u2019s going to ultimately derive a fair and reasonable reimbursement. So I\u2019m confident that we got that message out that it was received. Obviously, we don\u2019t know how people bid and we\u2019ll work with customers as best we can to try to implement things when the day comes. But we are confident that we did what we could to try to educate.\nAnthony Petrone: Thanks again.\nOperator: We are now at the one hour mark, so I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Chris. And thanks again to all our shareholders for joining us on the call this quarter. I\u2019d also like to thank the 7,500 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders for their dedication and hard work, helping people breathe better, sleep better and live better lives outside the hospital in a 120 countries worldwide. Thanks for all that you do today and every day. We will talk again with all of our shareholders in approximately 90 days. Talk to you all then.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you all again for joining us today. If you do have any additional questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Investor Relations or to me directly. As previously mentioned, all documents including the transcript and a replay of today\u2019s call will be available on our website later today. Chris, you may now close the call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Sure, David. Just generally on the tariffs issue just to reiterate, as we've said before, the way our whole supply chain is configured, we're not really affected by the specific tariffs. We export very little into China from the U.S. and very little from China to the U.S. Our supply chain is more Southeast Asian focused. And we've got a great team in China doing local products for China. So that's pretty solid. Our AirView solutions on the other hand, mostly by the way developed by teams all around the world, but really a strong product offering, continues to deliver superior value to our customers. And we think \u2013 with day-in and day-out we'll fight competitions with those products and belief that we've got a better proposition to offer. So we \u2013 from our perspective, we didn't see any particular competitive issues that were sort of changing the normal competitive dynamics. We do have to sell and execute well. And our teams have been doing that. Yes, thanks, David. Yes. The resupply program has definitely supported the mask portfolio. We've talked many times. You've got to understand the sort of the feedback of this. If we can get patients onto a good mask, they're more likely to stay on treatment, they'll do better and then they'll need a mask. And so we continue to see that dynamic happening. Our software solutions that support the resupply programs and enable our HME customers to manage resupply programs more efficiently and ensure that the patients have the treatment that they need when they need it. We're also supporting it. These are long-term programs. We've been running resupply programs for many years now and our teams will continue to refine and focus it. And as Mick said earlier though, these markets are competitive. We do have competitors playing it. We have competition in resupply programs as well as in mask. And it really gets down to, we've got a really strong team executing broadly across all parts of the portfolio on this that will continue to make sure that we're providing the best solutions for patients and providers delivering the best outcomes. So I think it's really a steady as she goes progress. We love \u2013 we really like these resupply programs and they're providing us a very solid steady business. Thanks, Mick. Yes, Thomas. We, as you recall, we launched Mobi very early this year and we've sort of been in a really still in a learning mode. It's a great product. We're actually learning a lot about the performance of the product and we've talked about and continue to validate the issue of the balance of the performance specifications and how the product works. And so, we're in good shape there. What we're also learning is that it is challenging through, particularly through the U.S. reimbursement model how to get the right patients on the right treatment and how to get that property funded and we have been trialing experiments in looking at ways to optimize and develop that. Really we're learning a lot about what our sort of future pathways to market would be and how to \u2013 how can we make it best suitable for our HME customers to support patients and also what are the future needs of products further down the track and feeding learnings into our future roadmap. So with that all going on, the learning process is quite successful. We're still not a major market share player with the product and that's unlikely to change into the short-term future with the Mobi product that we're currently investing and the way we're heading at the moment."

            "name": "Brett Sandercock",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the September quarter was $691 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 17%. Excluding revenue from acquisitions, group revenue increased by 11% on a constant currency basis. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin American countries were $317 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $224 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. However, in constant currency terms, sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 8% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $197 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $193 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter. The revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets device sales were $152 million, which is consistent with the prior year quarter, but in constant currency terms, a 4% increase. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets was $72 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, a 19% increase. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 6% while masks and other sales increased by 19% over the prior year quarter. Software-as-a-Service revenue for the first quarter was $87 million, an increase of 83% over the prior year quarter. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and the purchase accounting fair value adjustment to MatrixCare deferred revenue. The prior year comparable excludes amortization of acquired intangibles. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Our gross margin for the September quarter was 59.5% compared to 58.3% in the same quarter last year and 59.3% in Q4 FY19. Compared to the prior year, our gross margin increased by 120 basis points. This was predominantly attributable to manufacturing and procurement efficiencies, the MatrixCare acquisition and favorable product mix. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the first quarter were $167 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 16%. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A expenses increased by 6% on a constant currency basis. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 24.6% compared to 25% that we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward subject to currency movements and taking into account recent acquisitions, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 23% to 24% for the remaining three quarters of fiscal year 2020. R&D expenses for the quarter were $48 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 27%. Excluding acquisitions, R&D expenses increased by 2% on a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.1% compared to 6.6% in the prior year. Looking forward, subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2020. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $18.5 million for the quarter, an increase of 44% over the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact from our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $13.3 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $191 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $135 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.93, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.83. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 20.2%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.6. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2020 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $162 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $22.7 million. Depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $38 million. And during the quarter, we paid dividends of $56.1 million. We recorded equity losses of $6.8 million in our income statement in the September quarter as I said via Verily joint venture. We expect to record approximately $7 million of equity loss of each quarter in fiscal year 2020 associated with the joint venture operations. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share. During the quarter, we repaid $49 million of our outstanding debt. At September 30, we had $1.2 billion in gross debt and $1 billion in net debt. Our balance sheet remained strong with modest debt levels. Finally, to recap, our top-line revenue was strong this quarter with growth across all major categories. Gross margin expanded and our operating costs remained well controlled. As a result, we're continuing to drive operating leverage with Q1 non-GAAP operating profit up 22% year-on-year. We are focused on driving operating results, integrating our SaaS acquisitions and ensuring we continue to invest in our strategic long-term opportunities. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy. Hi, John, it's Brett. I think it's all of those things, probably the pricing environment is relatively been on at the moment, so the impacts there were pretty modest. In terms of acquisitions that contributed around 50 basis points. So if you think about that, still really a strong, let's call it organic expansion of the margin, which is really good. That's really around the manufacturing and procurement efficiencies. And then clearly some product mix benefit there as you saw the outperformance in the mask growth. So a combination of all of those factors I think led to that expansion. Yes. Sure, Steve. I mean there's a lot of moving parts, but I would think it would be broadly consistent with where we were for Q1."

            "name": "David Pendarvis",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew. The \u2013 obviously we spent a lot of time along with others in the industry trying to educate the market participants so they would be able to bid effectively and bid smartly given the new rules. We remained encouraged with the changes that were put in place principally that clearing price is what's going to drive reimbursement as opposed to the median price under the old regime, and some of the other changes that were made, including requiring bonds to bid in particular areas. We hoping that together with the education that the industry did will lead to smart bids and that'll lead to a fair, more realistic reimbursement. We obviously didn't participate in the bidding process and haven't had direct conversations with customers about what they bid. So it's all conjecture at this point as to where the ultimate reimbursement will land. But no matter where it is, whether it's a private pay, reimbursement change or a Medicare U.S. change or something elsewhere in the world, we're continually working with our customers to help them be more efficient, help them take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves and to enable them to better serve patients under whatever the reimbursement schemes are. So we'll definitely continue to do that, and watch where the U.S. Medicare landscape evolves. But at the moment, that's still a year and a bit away. So we'll just keep doing what we're doing and obviously focus on it when the time comes. Terrific. Sean, we mentioned in the opening remarks, it goes by the name of magnify, and of course with trials these days you have to have a good acronym, and that stands for maximizing adherence and gaining new information for your COPD. And the trial is going to be obviously sponsored by Novartis. And what it's doing is taking patients within clinics and then within those clinics, randomizing the patients to either standard clinical practice or using Propeller. And then there'll be a comparison. And the endpoint is the time to failure of treatment. And then failure of treatment is defined in various ways such as needing an additional medication, having some particularly acute exacerbations, winding up in hospital, those kinds of things. And it'll look and see, whether or not adding the adherence benefits of Propeller linked since the time that patients stay in that good controlled state. It's beginning recruiting now and I believe it's supposed to run through the end of 2021. So it will take quite a while before it meets it's \u2013 the end of that time period. But the important thing is a lot of the data that's been out now has been done in the asthma setting. Obviously, that's an important area and we want to take care of those patients. But the COPD strategy is very important to us because of the way it connects with our overall respiratory care strategy. So having someone like Novartis sponsor a study, looking at Propeller benefits to a COPD patient population, we think is a real important milestone and we'll look for good benefits to come out of that study in the future, but it will be a few years. Yes. Thanks, Mike. Yes, there is a lot of efforts under way in the U.S. Congress right now to try to provide relief, particularly the one you mentioned which is try to extend the relief that was given that was that sort of 50-50 blend between prior reimbursement and the new system reimbursement into those rural areas. We certainly support that legislation. We think it's important that our customers who are operating particularly in extended areas where they've got to drive many miles to patients' homes need to have reimbursement that reflects the operating cost that they've got and we would certainly hope that the champions that there in Congress will carry the day. Now as your question implies, there is a lot going on in the U.S. Congress these days. It's very difficult to predict whether something like that will ultimately pass or whether CMS could respond on their own and provide that kind of relief. If it doesn't, I think as I said before when talking about competitive bidding, we'll obviously work with our customers to do what we can to support them. We think the remote capabilities of our devices are ideal for providing care to remote setting. You could do things like change some of the settings on a CPAP, you can certainly interrogate the CPAP for information about the quality of the therapy that has been provided, all without having to drive to someone's home. So we think that those systems helping customers whether they are in rural areas or not to deploy them is probably the best thing we can do to help in that kind of a setting. But we'll continue to support that legislation and other efforts with CMS to try to make sure that the Medicare policies and reimbursement is as favorable as it can be for the ultimate benefit of Medicare beneficiaries. Sure. Yes, thanks Anthony. I mentioned a little bit earlier that ResMed along with other industry participants put a lot of energy and resources behind trying to educate the market participants who are going to be bidding about various factors including lead item pricing and we developed a calculator that was put out. There were some stats that were just discussed in the Medtrade meeting just earlier this week in Atlanta that there were over 17,000 downloads of that calculator. And that's just simply the one that was available to the participants here. CMS had their own calculator that folks downloaded. From the conversations that I've had, my understanding is that most DMEs have a pretty good understanding of lead item pricing and how it works. And hopefully they've avail themselves of the tools to be able to model out scenarios based on their own business and their own volume of products in different categories so that they can bid intelligently and in a way that's going to ultimately derive a fair and reasonable reimbursement. So I'm confident that we got that message out that it was received. Obviously, we don't know how people bid and we'll work with customers as best we can to try to implement things when the day comes. But we are confident that we did what we could to try to educate."

            "name": "Mick Farrell",
            "content": "Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review the results for ResMed's first quarter of fiscal year 2020. On today's call, I will discuss our long-term strategy. I'll then review top level financial results, some business highlights from the quarter and a few key milestones. Then I'll hand the call over to Brett, who will walk you through our financials in further detail. We have started fiscal year 2020 right where we left off with 2019. Our team achieved another quarter of balanced growth across the portfolio, driven by continued strong performance in the mask category. We are taking share with recent new product introductions and our solutions are enabling increased therapy adherence as well as expansion of resupply programs to those who need it. Our dedicated team of more than 7,500 ResMedians around the world, have again delivered strong results. As the world's leading software-driven medical device company, we continue to use technology to advance our leadership position. We have sold more than 10 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices into the market. And our AirView, cloud-based ecosystem manages more than 11 million patient accounts. In the last 12 months, we changed over 15 million lives by providing a person with a ResMed device or a complete mask system, to help them breathe better and live better lives. In addition, our Brightree and MatrixCare branded out of hospital software systems are helping to manage 93 million more people. So during the last 12 months we improved more than 108 million lives with ResMed products, services and software solutions. We are well on our way to the ambitious goal to improve 250 million lives in 2025. Our connected solutions are providing us with valuable access to de-identified therapy data that we are using to derive actionable insights to benefit patients, physicians and providers, as well as to inform future innovation in products and software. These datasets are growing exponentially and we now have 5 billion knots of medical sleep and respiratory care data in the cloud. Our relentless focus on product and software innovation continues to set us apart from our competition. We remained laser focused on growth in our core market of sleep apnea, as well as in our adjacent respiratory medical markets of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as asthma. Our expanded focus to now grow outside the hospital software solutions allows us to help customers create efficiencies to take costs out of the healthcare system and to improve the quality of care across home medical equipment, home health, hospice, skilled nursing facilities, life plan communities and beyond. We believe the future of healthcare is outside the hospital. That's where ResMed competes today. That's where we are winning today and that's where we will continue to win in the future as we provide market-leading value to customers. Let's now briefly review our top level financial results for the quarter. We achieved another quarter of double-digit revenue growth, up 17% in constant currency across the portfolio. This growth was well balanced across domestic U.S. and global products sales, as well as balanced across our Software-as-a-Service businesses. We continued to deliver operating leverage in the quarter leading to a non-GAAP operating profit growth of 22% year-over-year, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.93. Turning to a brief discussion of our sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. In the devices category, we delivered a good quarter. We achieved year-over-year constant currency device growth of 6% globally, supported by very strong 8% device growth in the United States, Canada, and Latin America geographies. We achieved 4% constant currency growth of devices in combined Europe, Asia and rest of world. We achieved excellent device growth in the UK, Switzerland and across our Nordics countries. As discussed over the last few quarters, we experienced a continued headwind during the quarter for device growth in France as a result of digital health-related fleet upgrades. We expect that headwind to ease by the end of this fiscal year and then return to market device growth in France. It is great to see a steady flow of our digital health solutions into different European countries and to see positive constant currency device growth across the continent this quarter. The growth in the masks and accessories category of our business was incredibly strong during the quarter. We were up 19% in constant currency globally. This is well ahead of market growth rates, indicating we gained significant market share during the quarter. The reason that we continued to take share around the world is that we make the smallest, the quietest and the most comfortable masks available in the market. Our flagship masks, the AirFit F20 and the AirFit N20 continue their growth across global markets. The success of these flagship masks was augmented during the quarter by good uptake of our recent mask launches. To recap those launches, we have now launched four new masks during the last 12 months; the F30, the N30i and the P30i. And just this week, actually on Monday, our newest innovation was launched, the N30. We have the right mask for every patient, every time, and the N30 adds innovative dimensions to these portfolios. The N30 is a world first tube-down nasal cradle CPAP mask in a new product subcategory that we are calling the minimalist category. The N30 is our smallest, our lightest mask ever and our quietest nasal mask ever. I personally think this new N30 is another winner from our amazing research and development engineers. Watch this space as it gets into the hands of our market-leading marketing and sales teams. Now mask portfolio overall is positioned to offer world-leading options for physicians to prescribe for home care providers to fit in a first-time set-up, and most especially for the needs of the ultimate customer, the person who suffocates every night with sleep apnea. We remain focused on driving innovation to meet all underserved customer needs. The bottom line is that our new masks have a lot of runway ahead. Unfortunately, they don't let me talk about ResMed's future product pipeline, so I won't. Our success comes as healthcare providers, physicians and patients around the world continue to vote with their wallets and choose ResMed products, not just for the innovative design and high quality of our devices and masks, but also for the sustainable value proposition of the digital health solutions that we offer. Our digital end-to-end solutions combined with available 100% cloud connectivity, as well as information provided to patients on their own smartphones through apps like myAir and apps like Propeller, are all leading to significant improvements in lowering cost, and improving health outcomes and improving quality of life for patients around the world. Through digital health technology, we are driving patient engagement so that people can enjoy the benefits of the best therapy available. In parallel, we are also ensuring that the cost of chronic disease can be better managed by physicians, healthcare providers, payers and governments. There's still a long way to go. Our research that was just published by the Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal in July shows that there are over 936 million sleep apnea sufferers worldwide, while only around 20 million or so are being treated today. We keep forging ahead, investing in our own research and development to drive further innovation and advancement, as well as by working with partners. On the partnership front, our joint venture with Verily is working on software solutions to help identify and engage and better manage more people with sleep apnea. It is very early days on \u2013 in this JV, but our philosophy is that the more person knows about how much they suffocate every night and the consequences of that suffocation on their own personal healthcare outcomes, the more likely they will seek solutions. Over time, we know this partnership will drive incremental growth in our core sleep apnea business, while allowing ResMed to participate in a broader chronic disease management ecosystem, covering not just sleep apnea, but also cardiovascular disease, diabetes, COPD and beyond. These chronic disease management platforms will include clinical care as well as wellness improvements in nutrition, in cardiovascular exercise and in mental health. Let's now turn to our second vector of growth here at ResMed, our business in respiratory care. There were nearly 400 million people worldwide suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD. We don't believe they are well served by healthcare systems today. We see the opportunity to better manage COPD through the use of technology with digital end-to-end solutions that can help patients as they progress with this chronic disease, including how patients are communicated to, how patients are encouraged in their medical care and how patients are looked after as individual persons. We're advancing our respiratory care strategy in multiple ways. Earlier this summer we introduced a number of enhancements to AirView, our cloud-based patient management platform. We are making management of ventilation patients much simpler and much more useful for home medical equipment providers. Physicians and HMEs can now look deep into therapy data to see key performance indicators such as pulse rate, inspiratory time, maximum airflow, and even a patient's rapid shallow breathing index or RSBI. All these data are now available within our digital healthcare ecosystem, with the easy to use AirView platform. Our goal is to help create a frictionless experience when managing COPD patients with ResMed's solutions. Our team at Propeller also continues to grow their business as we move from pilot trials to commercial partnerships with leading respiratory pharmaceutical companies. The team was recently at the European Respiratory Society Annual Congress in Madrid. It was great to see Propeller represented at multiple pharma booths, including live demonstrations of Propeller solutions for physicians. Propeller was also featured in several scientific presentations during ERS, including the public announcement of a new large COPD outcomes trial that's sponsored by Novartis. The trial will compare Propeller plus COPD standard of care to COPD standard of care alone. The trial has already begun enrolling patients during this quarter. As we outlined, when we acquired Propeller in January, the digital health opportunity with respiratory medicine adherence will take time to build into critical mass. This quarter, we passed a significant milestone with more than 100,000 people enrolled into the Propeller ecosystem. Let's be clear, we are still in the early days of market development here. The analogy is that we are now just lacing our shoes for the digital health ultra marathon in both COPD and in asthma. So there's lots of terrain ahead. The evolution that we have made in our respiratory care business has set ResMed up to become the global leader in digital health for COPD. From Stage 1 and Stage 2 COPD with Propeller's pharmaceutical adherence solutions to Stage 3 and Stage 4 COPD with portable oxygen concentrators as well as our cloud-connected non-invasive ventilation solutions. Let's now turn to our third vector of growth, our Software-as-a-Service business. We continue to integrate and optimize the SaaS portfolio for long-term growth. Our competitive advantage derives from our leadership position in SaaS solutions for home medical equipment, for skilled nursing facilities, for home, health, hospice, life plan communities and home care services. ResMed is the best strategic player competing in these verticals. And we have the expertise running global digital health systems at scale to be able to succeed in the future. Our SaaS portfolio continues its growth trajectory this quarter with revenue up 83% year-on-year during the quarter. Clearly, growth in this first quarter was accelerated leveraging our MatrixCare acquisition in November of 2018. We will lap that acquisition during this current second quarter. We estimate that the underlying market growth of the blended portfolio of seven out-of-hospital SaaS verticals that we serve is in the high single digits. Leaving out the MatrixCare acquisition, we grew right in line with the market in Q1. We have set up an execution plan to continue to innovate and to continue to launch market-leading upgrades combined with new capabilities that will allow us to gain market share in our SaaS verticals and participate in the fastest growing ones so that we can beat market growth. We plan to exit fiscal 2020 with solid double digit growth in our SaaS business segment. One example of the progress that we're making in our SaaS portfolio is the recent announcement of our collaboration with Cerner as a new preferred provider for home health and hospice software. This agreement validates ResMed as an industry-leading provider of digital health solutions for out-of-hospital healthcare. Our Matrixcare managed offering for home health and hospice customers includes the best-of-breed capabilities from both the MatrixCare technology and from the Brightree technology. This agreement ensures our home health and hospice solution is available to all of Cerner's large customer base. The net result is growth opportunities for both Cerner and MatrixCare sales teams. In fact at the recent Cerner Health Care Conference, a major healthcare system with a very large home health business was introduced to the ResMed solution and they are quickly moving toward a contract with our MatrixCare team. It is clearly early days as the ink dries on the Cerner contract, but the bottom line is, we are excited to drive growth from this partnership and to leverage interoperability to provide value for all of our customers. In summary, for the SaaS business, we have the vision to transform and significantly improve out-of-hospital healthcare. We are helping people stay out of the hospital and in the care setting of their choice with lower costs and a higher quality of life for the person. The best place that people often choose is almost always their own home. Ageing in place is a trend that is growing not just in the U.S. but globally and we plan to enable and leverage that positive change. We think that's an important part of the future of healthcare. Before I turn the call over to Brett, Let me close with this. We have had a great start to the new fiscal year and we are well positioned to grow throughout fiscal year 2020 and beyond. We have positioned ResMed for the long-term as the global leader in digital health driving both top-line and bottom-line growth as well as executing on our strategy to improve 250 million lives in healthcare that's delivered outside the hospital in 2025. We are focused on our triple aim to slow chronic disease progression, to reduce overall healthcare system costs and to improve outcomes and quality of life for the ultimate customer, the person who simply to sleep well, to breathe well and to live a better life well away from that hospital. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks and then we'll open up for Q&A. Brett, over to you in Sydney. Yes. Thanks for the question, Gretel. So we don't actually have full visibility even to the number. We sell to in the U.S. to home medical equipment companies that then sell to patients that are renewing in their five-year renewal or to new patient. So we don't have full visibility into that. But it is interesting with a reasonably sized patient pool in the United States it would be a good double-digit percentage or so of those that will be replenishment devices. But the 8% growth I think is really ahead of market. We think the market growth is in the sort of mid-single digits. And so to be at 8% growth in the U.S. shows that we were taking some share due to the value of Air Solutions, AirView and myAir and all the sort of digital health solutions that are there. Thanks, Gretel. Steve, thanks for the question. We actually saw really solid growth in the core fleet business, as a sizeable chunk of that 8% growth in the U.S. Astral tends to be more of a player, ventilation in general tends to be more of a player in Europe and so some of that sort of 4% constant currency growth in Europe, Asia and rest of world will have been driven by the Astral in some sort of much smaller element of the 8% U.S. growth. But one thing that we've been really strong with our DME customers is to make sure that the right device goes on the right patient at the right time. And when you look at COPD, there were lots of solutions from our [indiscernible] as well as \u2013 so non-invasive ventilation, as well as even Stellar product in non-invasive ventilation all the way through to our Astral product, which is really a life support ventilator and should be used in very severe COPD and in life support needs. And so, yes, it really wasn't a huge contributor in the U.S. this quarter, probably slightly more significant in Europe. But it's really good solid balanced growth, if you like, from our sleep apnea side with some additions from respiratory care is how I'd position it. Thanks, Steve. Thanks for the question, Margaret. Certainly, we did have a very good quarter here in Q1. And as you said, we grew like sort of 11% constant currency globally in our sleep and respiratory care combined businesses. If you think about the global growth and we have enough data now to know that the growth really is in that mid- to high-single digits, so the devices growing in the mid-single digits and masks growing in the high-single digits. Clearly, we did take share in Q1 and a lot of that is driven by the digital health technology on the flow generator side to have some of the share taking on the device side, and then the new product introductions that I detailed in the prepared remarks, four new masks in addition to two strong flagship marks there, so NPI has been an incredible contributor to us. Just if you think through the year ahead, even during this quarter that we're currently in the second quarter, we're going to lap one of those four product launches on the mask side and we'll continue to lap those during the quarter. So look, I'm always very excited about our innovations; the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable, the most connected, and I think that innovation drives. But you can't outgrow market forever, right? You've got to then focus on getting more patients into the funnel, which is our whole identify, engage and enroll people in. So I think a fantastic Q1, but as we look through the fiscal year, we think we can meet or beat market growth, but you're not going to beat it every single time. Thanks, Margaret. Yes, I'll hand that \u2013 good questions, David. I'll hand that to Rob Douglas, our COO. Thanks, David. Yes, thanks for the question, Andrew. I'll hand that to David Pendarvis. Thanks, Andrew. Yes. So thanks for the question, Lyanne. And look, we have multiple competitors in the 120 countries we sell into and we expect new product introduction from our competitors on a regular basis. Yes, as you noted, during the quarter, we had 19% constant currency growth in U.S., Canada, Latin America. We also had 19% constant currency growth of masks in Europe, Asia and rest of world, where some of those masks and new launches have already been in play during the quarter. So I think we've \u2013 I know we've got the most robust sleep apnea mask portfolio on the planet versus our competitors in all the 120 countries that we participate in. But there's no arrogance or hubris heated out. Our team of R&D engineers furiously working, not only on technology to address underserved needs, but to think differently about how to really achieve that ultimate goal, which is sort of the silent CPAP and the invisible mask. And if you look at the N30 that we just launched, this minimalist category mask, it's about as close to an invisible mask as you can get. It is small, it is quiet, it is comfortable. So, look, I love innovation coming to the market from our competitors and from us because it keeps us all honest. But during the quarter, we performed very well versus all the NPI from our competitors with our own NPI. And I expect us to be able to do that into the future. And competition is just a healthy part of making sure that tens of millions of people get the breathing night. Yes, it's a good question, David. I'll hand that to Rob. Thanks, David. Yes, thanks for the question, Sean. I wasn't at ERS, but I'll hand over to David Pendarvis, who can give us some more detail on the Novartis clinical trial. Thanks, Sean. Yes Thanks for the question, Anthony. Pharma companies \u2013 there are many respiratory pharmaceutical, pharma players in the field and the names you mentioned all have drugs in the market. One thing about pharma companies is they're very competitive with each other and they don't want information shared too much publicly. Certainly on our Investor deck we put the names of those where we have published clinical data and we are working with. And the reason we're bringing Novartis in our prep remarks here is that's a public clinical trial. One of the interesting things that's happening here is there's a lot of trials that aren't public that are happening out there that obviously we cannot talk about. As we look forward, the important thing if you think about milestones, Anthony, to sort of to look at on this, sort of digital health option play if you like that we have in our strategy with the Propeller solution is when somebody goes from these pilot trials to a commercial trial and when they would allow us to talk about that publicly. And so, if and when that happens, that's the milestone, I think that's most important in a material element to our shareholders. As I said in the prep remarks, we got in early with Propeller and this is a long road. I think I used the analogy that it's an ultra marathon. This is beyond just 26.2 mile. This is a huge journey. COPD number two cause for hospitalization and rehospitalization, the number three cause of death. It has such good runway for us in the future, but there's nothing material in the quarter. And so, we're just giving the update. We hit 100,000 patients. We think that's fantastic. Right validation to have Novartis start its public study. It's going to take a couple of years as Dave said. But I would expect that before those couple of years we will have some other milestones of going to some commercial trials that we can talk about in upcoming conference calls. But at the moment this quarter, Anthony, there's nothing to report other than really good early data. Yes. Thanks for the question, Saul. It allows us to talk to the area of interoperability, which is incredibly important for us here at ResMed. We have 100 API calls per second from integrators into our air solutions ecosystem. So every second 100 interactions with another EHR, EMR whether it's an individual person or myAir app checking the therapy or a physician at Massachusetts pioneer looking over 20,000 patients to do some management by exception protocol. And so, the Cerner contract or deal is that they \u2013 Cerner are looking for ResMed and really truly through our MatrixCare managed team to take care of home health and hospice customers for them. So they have customers that have hospital systems, but for the out-of-hospital part where it goes to home health and hospice, they want ResMed to be their partner to take care of those. And we think it's a really exciting opportunity for the MatrixCare sales team and for the Cerner sales team to partner up and have that move forward. And it was really interesting at the Cerner conference to have our MatrixCare and Brightree teams there and all the technology available from the iPad app and all the capabilities that we have for home health and hospice and to get some really good leads. It's not going to be material in the next 90 days for us, this Cerner contract, but the reason we're talking about it is that idea of interoperability with Cerner, with Epic, with Allscripts, with all the players in hospital healthcare, we think it's going to be really important that ResMed is the best person that can provide that handshake that API from someone in acute care to what they call post-acute care, but what we call out-of-hospital healthcare and we think that partnership is going to be really strong. So we'll give you updates as the quarters progress, not just to the Cerner home health and hospice partnership, but to other partnerships with hospital systems, hospital providers and EHR providers. We think it's a good milestone to show that one of the top three leaders along with Epic and Allscripts there in hospital EHR has chosen ResMEd as their home health and hospice care provider with our MatrixCare managed solution and we're really excited about that. Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. I'll hand that to Rob. I'll hand that question to Dave Pendarvis. Yes, Shane. Thanks for the question. It's a good one. There are changes in reimbursement not just in HME as we just talked about, but also in skilled nursing facilities and within home health and hospice. These provide excellent opportunities for Software-as-a-Service providers to \u2013 if you're ahead of the game as MatrixCare was for the skilled nursing facilities changes as we are for the home health and hospice changes to be able to support customers through that change and even grow share because you've got the best solution that deals with those changes well. One thing I can say is that the new CEO there at MatrixCare, Steve Pacicco has formed great relationships with the customers and he has a great sales team that know the skilled nursing facility teams really well. And we've not only helped them through these changes in this quarter, but also set them up for success that our systems are operating well under the new reimbursement approach within those verticals. So that's \u2013 when you roll that all together, it's part of sort of that 2020 execution plan I talked about earlier that we see a good pop even if the blended rate of growth across these seven out-of-hospital healthcare verticals is in those high single digits. We think there are areas where we can get better growth than that. And we plan to exit 2020 with a double digit growth trajectory in the segment of SaaS. And part of that is going to be doing just what your question asked about, which is every part of the vertical, whether it's skilled nursing facilities, whether it's our new play in home health and hospice, the hunting license with Cerner in addition to our ability to grow share through having solutions that are ahead of the curve on reimbursement changes, they're all opportunities to be able to grow faster and form longer partnerships with our customers. Thanks, Steve. Yes. So Anthony, I'll take the first part of your question on masks and Dave will take the second part. Clearly we had excellent new product introduction over the last 12 months, but your question was around do people do stocking orders. Our U.S. distribution, and frankly, our global distribution partners are getting very intelligent about inventory management, not just those who use Brightree and have ResMed's Brightree inventory management system, which will actually manage it for them, but many of them are getting really appropriate on that knowing when a new mask comes, watching how there r teasers setting it up and seeing the patient flow and making sure they don't get too ahead of the curve or behind the curve. You don't want a patient in the fitting room that wants the N30 and it's not there, but on the other hand, you don't want excess inventory because I have inventory carrying costs as everyone knows and our U.S. distributors are actually quite sophisticated on this. So I \u2013 obviously when some \u2013 you launch a brand new mask, people do need to make sure they got that mask on the shelf. But given the proportion of existing resupply patients, which is a very large portion, particularly the U.S. distributors patient flow, we don't think there was material impact from stocking. Now, we don't have full insight into our customers that aren't using Brightree or other inventory management solutions, but we think it's a pretty steady approach and we've done new product introductions over the 20, 30 years we've been in business. And I don't \u2013 we haven't seen that a significant rate before and I don't think we saw any significant rate of that during the last quarter. Dave, the second part of the question for you. Thanks, Chris. And thanks again to all our shareholders for joining us on the call this quarter. I'd also like to thank the 7,500 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders for their dedication and hard work, helping people breathe better, sleep better and live better lives outside the hospital in a 120 countries worldwide. Thanks for all that you do today and every day. We will talk again with all of our shareholders in approximately 90 days. Talk to you all then."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Rob, and hi, everyone. Welcome to ResMed's fourth quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us. As Rob said, this call is being webcast live and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today along with a copy of the earnings release and presentation. On the call today are CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett Sandercock. Other members of management will join us during the Q&A session. During today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, please review the notes in today's earnings press release or the appendix of the earnings presentation. And as a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions; however, actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review ResMed's SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. Before I turn the call over to Mick, I would like to highlight ResMed's upcoming Virtual Investor Day on September 8, which we announced in our earnings press release today. More details and information including an agenda and how to register will be available on our Investor Relations website approximately 2 weeks before the event. Okay, Mick, over to you.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review result of our June quarter, the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2021. On today's call, I'll provide a high-level overview of our financial results as well as review progress towards ResMed's 2025 strategic goals. I will discuss execution highlights against our top three strategic priorities and our urgent and ongoing actions to address current industry supply chain issues and opportunities. I'll then hand the call over to Brett for further detail on our financial results. Let me start with the situation that has generated many stakeholder questions in the last month and half. During the quarter, demand for ResMed's Sleep and Respiratory Care devices surged dramatically after our competitors recall announcement, putting additional pressure on an already challenging environment for our industry's supply chain. Global supply chain limitations including a shortage of electronic components, as well as ongoing freight constraints and costs are impacting our ability to respond to the unprecedented increase in demand for ResMed products. Executive teams across automotive, consumer product and communications technology industries have confirmed on their recent earnings calls that they are struggling with the same issues. Some major producers have suggested the chip and electronic components shortages could extend 12 or even 18 months. We are working incredibly closely with our global supply chain partners to ensure access to additional supply of the critical components that we need to further increase production of our medical devices. During this June quarter, the demand spike was so high that we have been forced to allocate products due to the unprecedented demand and these real world supply chain capacity constraints. In doing so, our guiding principles are very simple. We are focused on the highest acuity patient needs first. It's very similar to our approach to ventilator allocation during the peaks of the COVID crisis these last 18 months. We will continue to coordinate with all of our stakeholders as the situation develops, and we begin to open up the supply constraints. We understand this is a frustrating situation for all of our customer groups, including physicians, home medical equipment providers, payers, and most importantly the ultimate customer, the patient. It is a unique time in our industry, with steady recovery of patient flow after COVID-19 peaks in various countries. With these global supply chain constraints and with an unforeseen competitor recall, all occurring simultaneously. I want to be clear that through it all our priority will always be patients, doing our best to help those who need treatment for sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other respiratory diseases. Our goal is to ensure that patients get the therapy that they need and when they need it. Let me be very clear about a couple of things. One, ResMed sleep apnea and respiratory care devices are safe to use. They are the best in the market. They are the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable and the most connected therapies. And Positive Airway Pressure therapy remains the gold standard for the treatment of sleep apnea. And two, ResMed will not be able to fill the entire supply gap that has been created by this situation caused by a competitor just 7 weeks ago. They were the number two player to our number one leading market position in almost all of the 140 countries that we compete in worldwide. We're doing everything that we can to partner further and further up our supply chain in order to increase our access to the supply of the past, the pieces and the components that we need to manufacture at scale. We expect to be in a somewhat supply chain constrained environment throughout fiscal year 2022. This news from our competitor was only released to the market on June 14. So we are in the first 7.5 weeks of our response. However, we have already partnered with our global supply chain team both internal and external. And although we expect the current quarter and the December 2021 quarter will be the most supply constrained. We do see room for expansion of supply ahead. We expect that the flow of ResMed products will accelerate significantly during the March 2022 and the June 2022 quarters. We are focused on partnering with physicians, providers and distributors to ensure that our devices get to newly diagnosed patients. And while that human impact is the most important, I know our investors and our analysts need to model the future financial impact of this accelerated growth on our ResMed financials. Based upon our latest supply chain information and analysis, we see a path to $300 million to $350 million in additional revenue in fiscal 2022 over and above our previously planned revenue growth for fiscal 2022. Importantly, we see a clear opportunity to increase our long-term sustainable market share, as patients, physicians and providers experience our ResMed market leading device and integrated cloud-based software solutions. Our experience over the last 7 plus years since we launched our online platform called Air Solutions at scale is that when providers adopt and embrace our suite of digital health solutions, they can lower their own labor costs by over 50%. They can drive their own patient adherence rates up to over 87% and beyond. After doing that, they don't want to go back to an inferior solution. And yes, during the near distant future, we will be starting the full product launch of our brand new next-generation platform called AirSense 11. Let me now turn to overall market conditions in our industry. As we discussed last quarter, the countries we operate in are at various stages of the post-COVID peak recovery process in terms of sleep apnea and COPD patient flow. We are seeing continued improvement in patient flow country-by-country. But there is a wide variance in that total patient flow from 75% of pre-COVID levels in some countries around the world to 95% or even 100% of pre-COVID levels in other countries. Vaccines are steadily rolling out country by country. And at the same time new variants including the Delta variant continue to cause disruption in some geographies. Our team remains committed to working with hospitals and health care providers to provide the ventilators, masks and training that they need for acute care. We will continue to support frontline respiratory therapists and physicians as well as providers, patients and our ResMedian team throughout the 140 plus countries that we operate in. A few things that have become really clear during this pandemic is that every country in the world has: one, increased its adoption of digital health solutions; two, increased its focus on respiratory hygiene and respiratory health; and three, increased its investments in health care treatment outside the hospital, and particularly in the home. These are all catalysts for ResMed's long-term growth. We are pleased with the steady progress that we are seeing in diagnosing new sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patients. During the fourth quarter, our sales team delivered very strong revenue growth across our core sleep apnea and respiratory care business. This incredible double-digit growth was despite the headwind from lapping $125 million of incremental COVID related ventilator sales in the June 2020 quarter, and with some tailwinds from our competitors recall right at the end of the quarter. While I am proud of the team for this 10% constant currency revenue growth in the quarter, I'm also very proud of their achievement over the fiscal year with over 6% growth in revenue throughout fiscal year 2021 to over $3.2 billion in total annual revenue, and with leverage producing over 12% growth in our non-GAAP operating profit and all the while fighting for recovery patient flow and battling COVID-19 impacts. Quite a performance from our team of 8,000 ResMedians helping people in 140 countries. We expect to see steady improvement in patient flow for sleep apnea and respiratory care therapy as we move throughout our fiscal year 2022. We are encouraged to see patients, physicians and providers adopting digital health tools for remote patient screening, for home-based testing, for patient monitoring and for ongoing population health management. As the leader in digital health for the treatment of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma as well as other chronic respiratory conditions, we are well-positioned to drive this growth with our health care delivery partners. During the quarter, we generated over $227 million of operating cash flow, allowing us to return $57 million in cash dividends to shareholders these last 90 days. Today, we announced an 8% increase in our quarterly dividend for shareholders to $0.42 per share. We are pleased to return your cash to you, our shareholders, reflecting our confidence in ResMed's resilient business and our ongoing cash flow. We also increased our R&D investments in digital health technology during the quarter, as well as our research and development for masks, for devices, for embedded device software and for global clinical research. All the while maintaining fiscal discipline with SG&A and keeping other operating costs in line. We are reinvesting for long-term growth. We lead the field of remote patient engagement and population health management with over 15 million cloud connectable medical devices in the market. Our increasing investments in digital health innovation will ensure that we provide superior value to patients, to physicians and to providers to be their partner of choice. We don't take our leading market share position for granted, we have to earn it every day with every product, every solution, and every service and every customer interaction. Customers vote with their wallets. And right now they are voting for us, and we plan to keep earning their support. Our digital health technologies are a growth catalyst for our business. We have an exciting pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium and long-term value. With an industry leading intellectual property portfolio, including over 8,200 patents and designs. We now have over 9 billion nights of respiratory medical data in our cloud-based platform called Air Solutions. We have over 16.5 million patients enrolled in our cloud-based AirView software solution for physicians. And we recently upgraded our patient engagement tool called myAir. This app is now cloud native and serverless in the cloud. This new myAir 2.0 release supports our next-generation platform called AirSense 11. The AirSense 11 platform comes to the market with new capabilities with improved data delivery, with scalable architecture, and with support for full cycle teams. And what that all means is that we have the opportunity for accelerated innovation in our ecosystem. We have over 110 million patients managed within our Software-as-a-Service network for out of hospital care. These incredible data assets allow us to unlock value for all of our customer groups, for patients, for physicians, for providers, as well as for private and government payers and the community -- communities that they serve. Let me now update you on our top three strategic priorities. These are: one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses; two, to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital, and especially in the home. Last quarter, we previewed our next gen platform called AirSense 11. Responding to the current industry situation, our market leading research and development team accelerated the launch of the AirSense 11. First, by expanding the control product launch to additional customers just this last month. And second by moving to an earlier full product launch date. We now expect to launch in the United States before the end of this current quarter, and then to other countries gradually over time. This AirSense 11 device launch will be a device launch like no other in the history of ResMed. Previously we carefully timed new product platform launches to minimize the selling overlap of device platforms. We are in a unique situation today. Our market leading AirSense 10 continues to be very strongly adopted, and we believe that it is better than any other device currently on the market. In short, it makes sense to continue to sell the AirSense 10 at Skype, particularly as this will help maximize the overall CPAP, IPAP and bilevel volume available for our customers for sale given the unprecedented demand for new patients to receive ResMed devices in the market right now. The bottom line is that we're going to be selling both the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11 in parallel for quite some time, as we meet this extraordinary market demand over the coming fiscal year. And as we continue to expand the availability of AirSense 11 to new markets and new geographies around the ResMed world. We are very excited to bring the AirSense 11 to market, and I am understating the results when I say that the response to our control product launch has been very positive. AirSense 11 benefits patients and bed partners and the device and software platform combination will also benefit physicians, providers, payers and overall health care systems. As I said earlier, we make the smallest, the quietest and the smartest and the most comfortable devices on the market. But they are also the most connected and the most clever devices. All AirSense 11 devices are 100% cloud connectable with upgraded digital health technology to increase patient engagement and inherence to improve clinical outcomes and to deliver proven cost reductions within our customers own health care systems, engaging patients directly in their own digital therapy like never before in the industry. Let me now turn to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and the 330 million asthma patients worldwide. Our goal is to reach these many hundreds of millions of potential patients with our Respiratory Care Solutions, including non-invasive ventilation, and life support ventilation, as well as newer therapeutic areas such as cloud connected pharmaceutical drug delivery solutions, and high flow therapy offerings. We announced that our respiratory care business benefited this time last year in the June 2020 quarter as we sold incremental ventilation devices and mass solutions to meet the growing demand for COVID, on an acute scale to the tune of $125 million in sales. During the current June 2021 quarter, we had modest COVID-related ventilator sales. They were not material to our overall results, they were under $20 million in sales, just under. As the Delta variant of this coronavirus surges in various markets and regions, we will still be there to support governments and health care systems and the patients they serve in their acute need. But we do not expect the resulting revenue from COVID to be material to our global business. Of course, the broader humanitarian impact is measurable with preservation of life through our ventilation solutions, a top priority in all of these countries. Our supply chain focus is for Astral, our life support ventilator, then Stellar, our non-invasive ventilator, and then our Lumis and AirCurve platforms to ensure that we can help patients who need our support the most. Demand for our core, non-invasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for COPD are experiencing the same steady recovery and new patient flow as we see in our sleep apnea business. We are balancing the growth in demand with the supply of ventilators that made it to market throughout the last 18 months as customers balance their inventory with ongoing acute and chronic ventilation patient needs. We continue to see rapid adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe this time a year-ago. We are now expanding this technology to regions around the world. The value being provided through AirView for ventilation has been helpful to physicians not only during the COVID crisis, but it is also increasingly valuable as an ongoing clinical tool for them and for the health care systems that they operate in. In summary, we are helping to ensure that digital health is the new standard of care for respiratory care. Let me now review our Software-as-a-Service business for out of hospital health care. During the quarter, our SaaS business grew in mid single digits year-over-year across our portfolio of markets, including home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, private duty home care, home infusion, and life plan communities. The continued growth of home-based care is providing tailwinds for our HME and home health products. And we continue to grow with customers as they utilize and optimize our resupply solutions to improve patient care. The COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging for some verticals in our SaaS business, particularly skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs. However, we are seeing positive trends as census rates improve across SNFs, and other care settings. We are watching this very closely as COVID peaks in the case of varying rates around the country. We expect there to be pent-up demand for our software purchasing that provides opportunities for us to increase our pipeline as COVID restrictions continue to ease state-by-state. Our leading position as the software provider of choice to the HME market enabled us to help customers manage through the pandemic and to maintain a healthy business. Our Brightree branded software solutions are allowing HMEs to work through current challenges within our industry, including the need for increased patient support, the need for management of product shortages in some categories, as well as ongoing growth in the resupply of much needed home medical equipment. As we look across our portfolio of solutions, we expect our SaaS revenue growth to gradually accelerate increasing from its current mid single-digit growth to high single-digit growth by the back end of this fiscal year. As always, our goal is to meet or beat these market growth rates as we continue to innovate and take market share from competitors. Additionally, we see opportunities on our radar screen to drive growth through further SaaS acquisitions to augment our existing organic growth. We have a good history of thorough due diligence, ensuring that ResMed is the best owner of the asset. And of course, that we can bring additional value for our customers with the new offering, and of course additional value for all of our shareholders. In summary, our SaaS offerings are well received in each of the verticals that we serve. And we see an increasing opportunity to leverage analytics to minimize acute care episodes for residents, patients and clients in our provider network. And ultimately, to allow people to age in place, away from a hospital and preferably in their own homes. Looking at the portfolio of ResMed's businesses across both sleep and respiratory care as well as our SaaS solutions, we remain very confident in our long-term strategy and our pipeline of innovative products and solutions. Our mission and specific goal to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025 drives and motivates ResMedians every day. The light shining on the importance of respiratory health and hygiene is brighter than it ever was due to this pandemic. COVID has also highlighted the importance of digital health, it's accelerated awareness and adoption of technologies that can be used for remote patient screening, diagnosis set up as well as patient monitoring and management. We continue to invest aggressively in R&D to ensure ResMed solutions remain market leading and provide a catalyst for long-term growth. With over 1.5 billion people around the world suffering from sleep apnea, COPD and asthma, we see incredible opportunities for greater identification, enrollment, and engagement of people within our digital health ecosystem. We are relentlessly driving innovation and development to provide the scale needed to expand the impact of this technology across all of the 140 countries that we operate in. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to again express my sincere gratitude to the more than 8,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication during the most unusual, almost perfect storm of circumstances. You have helped save the lives of many hundreds of thousands of people around the world with emergency needs for ventilation these last 18 months as we suffered through COVID. And now you have rapidly pivoted the company back to provide ongoing support for our customers and patients during very challenging industry dynamics and supply chain constraints with unprecedented demand. Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney and then we will go to Q&A with the whole team. Brett, over to you.\nBrett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. Group revenue for the June quarter was $876 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 10% compared to the prior year quarter. Revenue growth reflected increased demand for our sleep devices and masks, which was in turn driven by both sleep patient flow recovering from the COVID-19 impacted reduced levels in the prior year quarter, and by increased demand in response to the recent product recall by one of our competitors. The increased year-over-year demand for our sleep solutions during Q4 was partially offset by a significant decline in COVID-19 related demand for our ventilators and related accessories. In the June quarter, we estimate the incremental revenue from COVID-19 related demand primarily in India was approximately $20 million, a decline of $105 million compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 related revenue in both the June '21 and June '20 quarters, our global revenue increased by 29% on a constant currency basis. Going forward, we expect minimal revenue from COVID-19 related demand. Note, as a reminder, in Q1 FY '21, we had COVID-19 related incremental revenue of approximately $40 million. As I mentioned before, during the June quarter, one of our competitors announced a product recall on certain sleep and respiratory devices, which in turn has resulted in significantly increased demand for our devices. We estimate that we generate an incremental device revenue of approximately $60 million to $70 million in the June quarter due to our competitors recall. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution, excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries were $472 million, an increase of 18%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $308 million, an increase of 11%, or an increase of 2% in constant currency terms. By product segments, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $268 million, an increase of 30%. Masks and other sales were $204 million, an increase of 5%. In Europe, Asia and other markets device sales totaled $210 million, an increase of 2% or in constant currency terms, a decrease of 6%. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $98 million, an increase of 36% or in constant currency terms a 24% increase. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 12%, while masks and other sales increased by 10%. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 related sales in both the current quarter and the prior year quarter, global device sales increased by 46% in constant currency terms, while masks and other sales increased by 16% in constant currency terms. Software-as-a-Service revenue for the fourth quarter was $96 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. Looking forward to fiscal year '22, we expect several factors will drive demand, including the general recovery of the global sleep market from COVID-19 impacts, the launch of our next-generation AirSense 11 platform and share gains during our competitors recall. However, while we are working hard to increase capacity, we will not be able to meet all the expected demand resulting from our products -- compared from our competitors recall, primarily because of supply constraints for electronic components. And we expect these constraints to be more limiting in the first half of FY '22 than the second half. As Mick mentioned, we believe component supply constraints as they stand will currently limit incremental device revenue attributable to our competitors recall to somewhere between $300 million and $350 million during fiscal year '22. During my remaining commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin decreased by 260 basis points to 57.3% in the June quarter, compared to 59.9% in the same quarter last year. The decrease is predominantly attributable to a negative product mix impact, specifically a proportional increase in sales of our lower margin sleep devices, ISP [ph] declines and unfavorable foreign currency movements. We also continue to experience elevated and significant freight costs. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter were $181 million, an increase of 10% or in constant currency terms SG&A expenses increased by 4% compared to the prior year period. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 20.7% compared to the 21.5% we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect the SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% during fiscal year '22. R&D expenses for the quarter was $60 million, an increase of 14%. While on a constant currency basis, an increase of 9%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.8%, which is consistent with the prior year. We continue to make significant investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product and digital solutions will deliver sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenues to be in the vicinity of 7% during fiscal year '22. Total amortization of required intangibles was $19 million for the quarter and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $17 million. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $260 million, an increase of 7% underpinned by strong revenue growth. As I reported last quarter, we estimated and recorded an accounting tax reserve of $255 million during the previous quarter, which was net of credits and deductions for a proposed settlement of transfer pricing audits by the Australian Taxation Office or ATO. During the quarter, we progressed our settlement discussions with the ATO and have refined our tax reserve estimate. As a result, we have determined the required reserve is $249 million or $6 million lower than the previous quarter estimate. And accordingly, we have recorded this as reduction in our GAAP tax expense in the June quarter. Next steps involve concluding a written agreement with the ATO and obtaining final approvals from each side, which we hope to achieve this quarter. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 18.4%. While on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.5%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rates for FY '21 was 18.7%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rates for fiscal year '22 will be in the range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $198 million, an increase of 3%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.35, an increase of 2%. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $195 million and our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.33. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $227 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings partially offset by increases in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $28 million. Depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $42 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $57 million. We recorded equity losses of $1.3 million in our income statement in the June quarter associated with the Verily joint venture, now called Primasun. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $2 million for the quarter for fiscal year '22 associated with the joint venture operation. We ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $295 million. At June 30, we had $655 million in gross debt, and $360 million in net debt. Our debt levels remain modest. And at June 30, we had a further $1.6 billion available for drawdown under existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share. This represents an increase of 8% over the previous quarterly dividend and reflects the Board's confidence in our strong liquidity position and operating performance. Our solid cash flow and liquidity provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. During the pandemic we have focused on paying down debt. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest for growth through R&D. We will also likely continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions such as Citus Health. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Brett. Rob, let's go ahead and start the Q&A portion of the call. I will turn it over to you to provide instructions and get going.\nOperator: Thank you, Amy. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Deakin-Bell with Citigroup. Pleased proceed with your question.\nJohn Deakin-Bell: Thanks very much. My question was just around the likely mix going forward. You've talked about that $300 million to $350 million impact from the recall, but we noticed quite a big difference in the growth rates in the U.S versus rest of the world in the quarter for devices. Can you just give us a feel for, firstly, why there was such a difference in the U.S versus the rest of the world for the quarter? And then going forward, how you think that mix might look in FY '22?\nMick Farrell: Yes, thanks for the question, John. And, yes, look, it's really exciting to be able to provide $300 million to $350 million in incremental revenue for our shareholders, but devices for much needed patients out there over the coming fiscal year. And we actually we hope to get better than that as we look for more parts and pieces and components. That's our current forecast. Look, just breaking down the device numbers for the quarter, really strong device numbers for the U.S., at plus 30%. That was off the comp. If you remember this time a year-ago where sleep devices were way down and ventilators were picking up in the U.S., I think it was around plus 1% the comp, and so huge turnaround there plus 30% in this last quarter. And then in EMEA, Asia and rest of world this time last year, we had plus 35% growth because we had really strong ventilator sales, particularly to some Asia Pacific regions in their COVID crisis. And so that combo plus 35% was being analyzed, and we saw a minus 6% for EMEA, Asia and rest of world. So it's a combination, John of multiple factors of COVID for both those sort of regions, U.S., Canada, Latin America, plus 30% versus EMEA, Asia and rest of world lapping a plus 30% at their minus 6%. So as we project for the $300 million to $350 million, I think that's probably the most guidance we've ever given around an opportunity like this. I'm not going to split that by region, or by type or by area. But I can tell you, its supply chain constrained, not demand constrained. And everyone in all the 140 countries wants ResMed products. And everyone we make we sell and we are doing everything we can to drive more and more elements in our supply chain, wherever that bottleneck is in supply, whatever that part or pieces. I personally as the CEO, I'm calling up that supplier and talking to their CEO and saying, look, this component can go into a cell phone or a car, or it can go into a medical device that literally gives someone the gift of breathe. Please prioritize our part of the supply chain, and it's been working those last 7 weeks. We've been able to match $300 million to $350 million in additional revenue. And our goal is to continue every week, every month to do better and better on that.\nJohn Deakin-Bell: Thanks, Mick.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Dan Hurren of MST. Please proceed with your question.\nDan Hurren: Good morning, everyone. Mick, thanks very much for that additional information, the $300 million to $350 million. We're just trying to understand how that plays out over the year. And I guess we're trying to understand what the exit run rate would be on that plan as an uplift of your normal operations. So I guess, looking at how linear that will be and what sort of shape you'll be as you exited the full year?\nMick Farrell: Yes, Dan, it's a good question. And I don't want to get into a sort of breakdown every 90 days approach on it. But what I can say in terms of color, Dan, for your modeling is that, we found out about this 7.5 weeks ago, and we've been working like crazy these last 2 months on the supply chain. And it's easy to open up supply 3 months out, 6 months out, 9 months out. So a lot of the additional flow of parts and pieces is back end loaded in the fiscal year. And so, much less supply chain constrained in the March quarter, and the June quarter of this fiscal year '22 we're in. And it's going to be tough out here. We're already in the September quarter, and we're hand to mouth. But look, we're not stockpiling. We're not putting stuff in inventory. We are pushing stuff through plants. Our plants aren't at full capacity, so we have capacity. It's really around components and parts and pieces that are the bottlenecks. And so, if you think about that color, it sort of gives you guidance to know that Q3 and Q4 will be a lot less constrained than Q1 and Q2. Q2 should be slightly better than Q1 and Q3 should be significantly better than Q2, and Q4 should be significantly better than Q2 and Q1 as well.\nDan Hurren: Understood. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Bailey with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Bailey: Yes, good morning, Mick. Good morning, Brett. [Indiscernible] I mean, that's great additional detail on $300 million and $350 million. Is that devices [indiscernible] or is that the entire opportunity, as you said currently capturing consumables as well as ventilator -- any incremental ventilator sales coming through?\nMick Farrell: Yes, David, that's a good clarification. So the $300 million to $350 million is incremental devices, including Astral, Stellar, AirCurve, Lumis as well as AirSense 10 and AirSense 11. So it's all physical product devices. It does not include any potential upside in masks that you can get while selling great flow generated capabilities. And so it doesn't include incremental sales of those. It's focused on the device side, but both ventilation and sleep apnea devices are included in that number.\nDavid Bailey: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up, if I can. Just on the -- on a new patient coming in to the system, into observations over the last 12 months, I mean what sort of proportion should we think about of new patients that have a ResMed device also have ResMed [indiscernible] ResMed consumables. Is there a sort of a rough number, you're able to provide to try and understand what that could look like?\nMick Farrell: Yes, I see where you're going with the question. It's sort of trying to get to the understanding of how much incremental mask share we might get when they're on a ResMed device. Look, as you know, it's an open system. And there's no requirement that a ResMed device has a ResMed mask. They are designed by the same engineers and the same building out there in Sydney, in the manufacturing -- advanced manufacturing site across the road. So they design to work together very well and they are better together. So there is a better uptake of ResMed masks with ResMed devices. And certainly, it's going through a channel where there's a sales person who's providing both of them. And so there's some opportunities on both the sort of clinical and technical side as well as the commercial and execution side for some incremental growth. I won't quantify that for you. But I do think there is some upside.\nDavid Bailey: That's great. Thank you, Mick.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question\nSean Laaman: Thank you, and good morning, Mick and team. Mick, my question relates to the commonality between components of the various devices. Is that -- is there a lot of commonality between the S 10 and S 11 platform. So therefore, the challenges of the same with respect to sourcing and does the 3x increase to capacity from your competitor compound [indiscernible] the picture for you? Thanks, Mick.\nMick Farrell: Yes, Sean, two very good questions and very much related. Yes, I think there is some overlap of some of the parts and pieces between the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11 platform. It's 7 years newer in the market. And so there's a lot of upgraded electronic, mechanical, plastic and digital health technology in the device. And so there's a lot of new components as well. And there is demand from our competitor out there trying to cover their recall amount as well as catch up with the patients that need urgent replacements. We're not seeing as much of the latter, though. We have a supply chain that have some overlaps with some of our competitors, but actually very individually designed. And as we work through the supply chains, the whole medical device industry is a very small percentage point of the suppliers total capacity, which is great for us in that. We're not fighting for limited share versus a competitor, we're really fighting for share versus a large consumer phone company or automobile company and the suppliers, like medical devices, because firstly, we're relatively recession resistant. We don't suddenly stop our sales during the recession, as some people do in consumer purchases and automotive, and we're usually high margin for them. So -- and more sustainable growth in terms of what we're doing for our platforms. The AirSense 10 has been in the market for 7 years. And so these are long-term sustainable for them. So our arguments are very good with the supply chain. And that's why in the last 7 weeks, we've been able to identify that extra $300 million to $350 million in opportunity. But there is some commonality between our devices. And we will make those trade-offs and that's why we will provide both AirSense 10 and AirSense 11. But the AirSense 11 is a huge leap forward to the industry and our goal will be country-by-country to roll that out. But, yes, for the next 6, 12 months, there's going to be a lot of selling both the fantastic AirSense 10 and the amazing AirSense 11 in parallel in countries around the world.\nSean Laaman: Great color, Mick. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Sean.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nMaggie Nolan: Hey, this is Maggie on from Margaret today. I wanted to ask a little bit more on the assumption of the $300 million to $350 million. So, in that assumption, are you assuming that new patients or is that going to be swapping your competitors existing patients. And then is there a potential here for more than your current revenue assumptions, if that incremental supply can be located a bit earlier than your current expectations. And then taking a one step further and looking out to fiscal year 2023, how are you guys looking at the tail of the benefit post recall? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Okay. Great, Maggie. This -- I think four great questions in your question there. I'll address the first half of that, and then I'll hand over to maybe Jim Hollings to address some of the latter questions about long-term. Firstly, yes, we are focused on new patients as they come through. We\u2019re the number one provider in almost all of the 140 countries that we're in, but the competitive with this recall was often the number two to our number one position. And so there's a lot of demand for new patient flow, and that's where we're focused, that\u2019s where we're laser focused. Frankly, it's their job to focus on replacement or recall, that was their job and their duty to go take care of those patients, and we're focused on the new patients, both together will create unprecedented demand in the market. So that's point one. We are focused on new patients. At a high-level, as we look out beyond sort of this competitive recall to say, what's the steady state as we get to fiscal '23 and towards the end of fiscal '22, I do think, as I said in the prepared remarks that we will achieve a permanent market share increase from this. ResMed has always been the quality leader, always been the clinical leader, always been the smallest class and most comfortable. But there were some customers who just been used to, the old devices from an American brand that was bought by the Dutch company for a long time, they just stuck with what they had. I think that will get a chance to experience. The [indiscernible] improvement, the efficiency improvement, the doctors being excited about having full digital on AirView and patients being excited about the interaction on MyAir and [indiscernible] that they get patients happy, physicians happy and provider happy because a happy patient is one who is buying masks because they need them on a replenishment basis. So I won't quantify it for you. But I do think there's a magnificent opportunity for us to get our technology in front of a whole new range of customers. On the other hand, where supplies are constrained right now, so we're focused on our existing customers and taking care of them and making sure that we can get the new patients set up for them. But Jim, any other color, you think on sort of changes to the market conditions and longer term implications?\nJames Hollings: Yes, thanks, Mick and thanks, Maggie, for your question. I would say on long-term, as we were preparing to launch AirSense 11, our plan was to take market share, to take device share with the offering because the AirSense 11 offering both the device and the software we think is by far the best offering on the market. We're introducing at launch a number of innovations and the platform because of its connectivity allows us to introduce even more software innovations post-launch on an ongoing basis. And so as Mick said in his opening comments, we feel very confident that with AirSense 10 and AirSense 11, we have the two best sleep therapy devices on the market. So that was our plan all along. And I think that our competitors recall simply creates a window of opportunity for us, as Mick [indiscernible] to familiarize more customers, more patients with the innovations and to streamline workflows for providers and to provide, continually improving the patient experience on therapy, which drives up adherence, improves outcomes for patients and all of our stakeholders then winners with that. So we felt very confident as we were launching and I think the circumstances give us even more of an opportunity.\nMaggie Nolan: Great. Thanks so much.\nMick Farrell: Maggie.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Andrew Paine with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Paine: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my call. Just looking at the supply chain issues, in particular, semiconductors, what can you do to actually increasing supply there. I noted last year you got 38 million semiconductors from Infineon to the COVID response. Are you able to get more access to semiconductors due to your position within the medical -- the health care system?\nMick Farrell: Andrew, great question. I'll address maybe the first half and hand to Rob Douglas to talk a little bit to that. But look, I can tell you, as CEO, traditionally I'm taken into discussions with major customers, talking to the large multinational customers around the world and governments that we provide these great therapies and solutions for so that I can engage with them and talk about our great value. But at the moment I'm not doing that, because customer demand is almost infinite. And I'm being taken by my global supply team to talk to suppliers. And Andrew without naming individuals, I know that individual supply was named during the COVID crisis at their request, we are going and I'm spending time not just 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 steps up our supply chain and talking to people who make these basic plastics, electronics and components and parts and pieces and telling them. Sometimes they're unaware that further down the supply chain there's a life support ventilator or a non-invasive ventilator or a sleep apnea device that cures and treats sleep suffocation. And so just getting me that opportunity, firstly, it's very interesting for me. It's a new dynamic, and we're getting really good response from these suppliers. They also are under difficult supply chain conditions and often asked me to go with them further up the supply chain to talk to someone else. And it's a game of sort of bottleneck -- debottlenecking, if you like, in the global supply chain. We have a very advanced engineering team that are looking all day every day in our global supply alliance internally, led by Linda Laidlaw and her team and Andrew Price and his team. And they are pulling me in and doing much more themselves all day, every day to drive that. So it's an ongoing opportunity for us. It's a supply chain opportunity, but unique through the COVID impacts on freight costs and impacts on freight availability, but also the growth that we see ahead due to this unique situation. Rob any more color to talk about there on about supply chain for -- to Andrew's question?\nRob Douglas: Yes, a few other factors, Mick. One is, after following up with COVID last year, when we rapidly ramp ventilation, usually for that ramp, you've got to put in longer term commitments. So we did have actually a lot of commitments on the ventilator devices going forward. And that will be helpful for us. As Mick said, we can always make a better case than a cyclical consumer product. And in fact, one of the key factors around that not only residing lives, but also for these supplies, we can give them very long-term forecasts that we usually hit and do really well. So we're able to give long-term forecasts and we know they like that and they can plan that in. The forecast is stable. It's unusual to have the sort of sudden increments that we've had as a result of recent industry events. And so we're putting that in and pulling stuff forward. But also given out, just the number of patients we've got to treat and where we are in the market, we're able to make some really solid long-term commitments with the suppliers as well. And so that really, really helps. And we will see, our commitment horizon actually had go quite a lot longer than what traditionally it's been. And then the other fact that Mick mentioned briefly also is we've got a really strong design team. And where there are sort of acute bottlenecks on particular components, we can forward design around those, but those design changes do take time. And they've got to be properly validated and tested and very rigorous testing on these products. So we can't just rapidly switch to a new component. But we can plan some months out that we'll be able to add in additional sources of components. So as you can imagine, this is sort of full core press for our supply chain and engineering teams and they're going flat out on this.\nAndrew Paine: That's great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Cooper with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Cooper: Thanks, Mick and Brett. Can I just ask about the cost side of the equation. I mean, presumably, given the competition for chips here that you've been referring to through the call, I mean, it would be reasonable to assume that the cost side of the $300 million to $350 million is just going to be elevated versus what we normally see if you're business. And if that is the case, are you going to need to try and offset some of that pressure with price?\nMick Farrell: Chris, that's a good question. I'll hand to Brett to talk a little bit around the costs and how we're taking care of those. And Rob, if he wants to chime in as well. Look, this is an unprecedented time. Before our competitor made this announcement, 7 weeks ago, there was already constraints in the market around some of the components. And certainly because of nobody travelling really internationally, consumer travel was down so much and all the freight in the back of those consumer jets was gone. The costs were higher. And look, we talked about this 90 days ago on our last earnings call, and you saw it in the COGS numbers for this June quarter. And that's going to be with us for a while. I mean, these, these costs aren't going away. It is more costly to get freight than it was because there's much less planes available. And it is -- with scarce components, although we have very long-term contracts, prices are being impacted by that. At the same time, we're in an environment where we have customers with contracts with payers, and the consumer side of our business, there might be some opportunity to work with the supply chain to think about how to get some of those costs through the channel. But certainly in the reimburse side of the market, it's about and you've got to think really long-term about on the other side of this crisis, how we and our customers going to engage in our long-term interactions. And so it's a complex equation. And -- but, Brett, do you want to talk a little bit to what we're doing to negotiate to achieve the best prices that we can get and to manage our gross margin there and the COGS there. And, maybe Jim talked to how we're working with customers on long-term pricing. So Brett, and then Jim.\nBrett Sandercock: Yes, Thanks, Mike. I mean, we do -- Chris, we do. I mean, obviously, and Rob mentioned that kind of, we have some of these longer term commitments that are contractually so that helps us there. But if you look at an industry wide, I think for electronic components, you are seeing price pressures there. So I think over the course of the year, you expects, I think, some increases on those components there. We can mitigate that to some extent with some of these longer term contractual arrangements. So that is a pressure point, if you like on our cost side. And then freight, definitely as Nick mentioned, that remains pretty elevated. And for a number of reasons, and just really even getting slots and so on, that's a freight. That\u2019s even into even containers now for [indiscernible]. So that I think we will continue some -- probably for this year. With that, you think -- I don't think the freight is going to be [indiscernible] I think that will resolve itself over time. But I think for the over the course of this fiscal, I think that's going to remain as a cost pressure for us.\nRob Douglas: If I just pick up on the price topic, very quickly, I think Mick has covered in broadly quite well. But if you think of our industry, it's historically been a price down industry, right. And that's because reimbursements come down, and prices come down, because we as manufacturers have been able to drive down the materials and move the industry in that direction while preserving margins. Our customers still are very constrained on their ability to pass on any price increases that they face, because for the most part, they're either have government reimbursement or they have some sort of contracted reimbursement with a commercial payer. And those reimbursements have remained static or come down over time. So as we think about what we might be able to do pass price forward, we have to be very thoughtful about how we accomplish that if we can do it. And then couple that with the fact that we're also in contracts with most of our customers, right? So we might be in a tender contract with the government payer or many of our larger customers. We've contracts around for 12 months, that have a renewal cycle and that sort of thing. So I think that we've done very good job of being disciplined in pricing and maintaining price stability. And we'll be very, very thoughtful as we think about any kind of price changes that we do over time. But I think the circumstances are quite unique. And we really want to preserve long standing relationships with our customers who are really our partners in the channel.\nChris Cooper: Perfect. Thanks a lot.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Lyanne Harrison with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nLyanne Harrison: Good morning. Well, I'd like to continue with that line of thought. You mentioned there that with some of the larger customers, obviously, you've got contracts with them. Can you talk a little bit about whether those contracts with those larger customers to what extent they might have volume pricing in terms of that wholesale price? Is that with more volumes going through? Is that likely to squeeze margins further?\nMick Farrell: Jim, I'll hand that question to you. It's a follow up really to your response to the previous question. Yes, that\u2019s a terrific question. And we're actually in many way -- in many cases working through those contract negotiations in real time, I think that we have pretty good clarity with most of our customers that this is an unusual set of circumstances. And so we have a number of customers. And this varies a lot by geography, for everybody to understand. But we have we do have a number of customers who have, need volume based or rebate -- volume based rebates or pricing levels. And this is an unusual set of circumstances that drive more volume into those accounts. And so those are contracts we're working through in real time, but they're not uncapped discounts. And we're managing those conversations, I think very carefully. This is in a way, the flip side of the previous question where because we have relationships with customers who understand the dynamic of what's going on, we're able to negotiate pretty, pretty good price stability. So there's no risk for us of runaway in a sort of runaway discounts and rebates. And on the other hand, we're, working to create a kind of a stable pricing environment for our customers as well.\nLyanne Harrison: Thank you.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Lyanne.\nOperator: Next question comes from David Low with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Low: Thanks. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just wanted to meet on mass resupplied, we had load or I had worried that with the recall that we might see a lot of patients stop using their device, particularly given that was the advice. And that would have a flow on effect to everyone's resupply programs. Now we can see the numbers today and then [multiple speakers] growth, obviously, it's not matching up with device sales growth by any means. And I know there's a lot of factors in that. But just wonder if you could talk to that risk and what your expectations are on that front, please.\nMick Farrell: Yes, David, there was some confusion after the June 14 announcement, but I think many of the regulatory authorities and many of the clinician groups came out pretty quickly to say, let's talk to you doctor and work out a risk pathway between now and when you get that replacement device from that competitor. And also, for new patients, the doctors and certainly all of us in the industry we're very focused on the safe and effective therapies from ResMed and other players in the market. And so I think that that messaging was actually pretty quickly put out there by those physician societies and relevant health authorities after somewhat confusing announcements, right on that June 14 from our competitor. And so long-term, there's been some impacts that are quite beneficial in patients making that trade off. And certainly for us, you saw plus 5% growth in masks in the quarter for the U.S., you saw plus 24% growth in Europe, over a COVID [indiscernible] there, but very, very solid growth in our mask business. As you said, there's a bunch of factors, David, that this time last year, we had all the ventilation Mark sales, because it in the U.S which was, you know, a confident we were was like a headwind. And the other headwind, we had was the annualization of the snap acquisition, which we did just before COVID, we closed it just in that sort of February through June period. And then, there's some balancing of inventory and cash flow due to the competitive recall all going on at once. And so a lot of competing dynamics, but as you saw, it's a resilient business. When people getting great sleep apnea therapy, they love feeling better, sleeping well and waking up refreshed, and they want to get a new mask every three or six months. And they're doing it at increasing rates due to COVID, that step change has remained. And we're confident, we look through the fiscal year that we're going to see, mid single-digit up to high single-digit growth. In our mask business and it's all about us engaging with those, those patients getting new patients on board. As we talked about some incremental revenue opportunities, they're on the devices, maybe some of the masks, and then we get back to where we were before, right. And we go back to engaging patients, ensuring they stay on therapy, and they have really quick and easy access to resupply, if they want it and when they want it, and when it's covered by insurance and co pays and everything.\nDavid Low: Great, thanks very much.\nOperator: Next question comes from Matthew Mishan with Keybanc. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Low: All right. Good afternoon, guys. And thank you for taking the questions. Hey, Mick, just to switch it up for at least one question. Are there any meaningful milestones for Propeller or Verily -- or the Verily JV in FY '22 that you could that you would like to call out, and as the loss is a lower loss on the JV, because it's now generating some revenue.\nDavid Low: Thanks, Matthew. And it's great to have a question that sort of looking out beyond the next 12 months, given the dynamics I'm not surprised by that. I'll take the first part on the joint venture with Verily and hand to Jim to talk a little bit more about Verily and also about Propeller and other great development opportunities we have across our portfolio in sleep and respiratory care. Yes, firstly, the joint venture with Verily. Its name -- now its Primasun. And so we've got the branding out there. And we have Jonathon Lobbins, fantastic CEO that comes to us from Edwards Lifesciences, and other large med tech companies that he's been a part of, and really exciting to have a new CEO there. He's a strong leader, and the ability to identify, engage and enroll. What I call sleep concerned consumers into a digital pathway and a treatment pathway for sleep apnea is incredible and some really good experiments happening in certain metropolitan statistical areas with that technology and so great to have a new leader and the opportunity. The milestones are really around those MSIS and the success we're having before will scale. And obviously, given the current industry dynamics, we don't need to drive demand right now. We have unprecedented, almost unlimited demand, but we're doing lots of pilots and lots of testing and I can see as we get towards our 2023 and we analyze all this and we're moving towards that 2025 strategy. That Primasun joint venture will create incredible opportunities to identify and engage and enroll the 936 million people worldwide who suffocate and want to find a pathway to treatment for their sleep apnea. Jim, any other thoughts about Primasun or Propeller or any other great developments you've got on the horizon in SRC [ph]?\nJames Hollings:  I would say just in specific to Propeller, we remain very excited about Propeller as a part of our portfolio. And, like a lot of number of things, over the last 18 months, the headwinds for Propeller were largely driven by their customer base, focusing on COVID. So, a big part of Propeller's business is working with payers and with health systems to drive adoption of their digital solutions, and there was just distraction in their customer base for many months, obviously. So we're starting to see some more traction in those conversations as COVID starts to decline, and the market starts to stabilize. And we've taken the opportunity during that span to do to continue to develop our capabilities in Propeller and I would say -- just a couple of highlights, I would say, we've added quite a lot of muscle to the commercial side of that business by adding talent into the business. And we've also been working hard behind the scenes to build out the cloud architecture and make sure that Propeller's cloud architecture is paired up really nicely matching and kind of aligned with ResMed's overall cloud architecture for our other digital offerings. And all of that kind of investment is just going to accelerate Propeller's traction in the market as we continue to accelerate digital offerings across our entire portfolio. So we're very excited about it. I think that material revenues out of Propeller are a couple of years away in all likelihood, but as we get more milestones and do things like sign contracts we will keep everybody apprised.\nOperator: Thank you. We are now approaching the 75 minute mark. So I'll turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.\nMick Farrell: Yes, thanks, Rob and thanks to all of you for sticking around a little long. Clearly some unique circumstances in this perfect storm. Thanks again to all of our shareholders for joining us on the call today. I'd like to once again take the opportunity to thank 8,000 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders for their dedication and hard work helping people breathe better, sleep better, and live better lives outside the hospital in 140 countries worldwide. Thanks for all that you do today, and every day, and thanks especially to our ResMed heroes on the front lines during this global private crisis, including patient care provider support and hospitals, production, global supply chain management, distribution, and tech service. Once again, thank you. And I'd like to thank all of you, our shareholders for joining us here and we'll see you in 90 days. Thank you very much. Great. Thanks, Mick and thank you again for joining us today. We do appreciate your interest and your time. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out directly. This does conclude our call. Rob, you may now close it up.\nOperator: This concludes ResMed's fourth quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Rob Douglas",
            "content": "Yes, a few other factors, Mick. One is, after following up with COVID last year, when we rapidly ramp ventilation, usually for that ramp, you've got to put in longer term commitments. So we did have actually a lot of commitments on the ventilator devices going forward. And that will be helpful for us. As Mick said, we can always make a better case than a cyclical consumer product. And in fact, one of the key factors around that not only residing lives, but also for these supplies, we can give them very long-term forecasts that we usually hit and do really well. So we're able to give long-term forecasts and we know they like that and they can plan that in. The forecast is stable. It's unusual to have the sort of sudden increments that we've had as a result of recent industry events. And so we're putting that in and pulling stuff forward. But also given out, just the number of patients we've got to treat and where we are in the market, we're able to make some really solid long-term commitments with the suppliers as well. And so that really, really helps. And we will see, our commitment horizon actually had go quite a lot longer than what traditionally it's been. And then the other fact that Mick mentioned briefly also is we've got a really strong design team. And where there are sort of acute bottlenecks on particular components, we can forward design around those, but those design changes do take time. And they've got to be properly validated and tested and very rigorous testing on these products. So we can't just rapidly switch to a new component. But we can plan some months out that we'll be able to add in additional sources of components. So as you can imagine, this is sort of full core press for our supply chain and engineering teams and they're going flat out on this. If I just pick up on the price topic, very quickly, I think Mick has covered in broadly quite well. But if you think of our industry, it's historically been a price down industry, right. And that's because reimbursements come down, and prices come down, because we as manufacturers have been able to drive down the materials and move the industry in that direction while preserving margins. Our customers still are very constrained on their ability to pass on any price increases that they face, because for the most part, they're either have government reimbursement or they have some sort of contracted reimbursement with a commercial payer. And those reimbursements have remained static or come down over time. So as we think about what we might be able to do pass price forward, we have to be very thoughtful about how we accomplish that if we can do it. And then couple that with the fact that we're also in contracts with most of our customers, right? So we might be in a tender contract with the government payer or many of our larger customers. We've contracts around for 12 months, that have a renewal cycle and that sort of thing. So I think that we've done very good job of being disciplined in pricing and maintaining price stability. And we'll be very, very thoughtful as we think about any kind of price changes that we do over time. But I think the circumstances are quite unique. And we really want to preserve long standing relationships with our customers who are really our partners in the channel."

            "name": "Brett Sandercock",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. Group revenue for the June quarter was $876 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 10% compared to the prior year quarter. Revenue growth reflected increased demand for our sleep devices and masks, which was in turn driven by both sleep patient flow recovering from the COVID-19 impacted reduced levels in the prior year quarter, and by increased demand in response to the recent product recall by one of our competitors. The increased year-over-year demand for our sleep solutions during Q4 was partially offset by a significant decline in COVID-19 related demand for our ventilators and related accessories. In the June quarter, we estimate the incremental revenue from COVID-19 related demand primarily in India was approximately $20 million, a decline of $105 million compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 related revenue in both the June '21 and June '20 quarters, our global revenue increased by 29% on a constant currency basis. Going forward, we expect minimal revenue from COVID-19 related demand. Note, as a reminder, in Q1 FY '21, we had COVID-19 related incremental revenue of approximately $40 million. As I mentioned before, during the June quarter, one of our competitors announced a product recall on certain sleep and respiratory devices, which in turn has resulted in significantly increased demand for our devices. We estimate that we generate an incremental device revenue of approximately $60 million to $70 million in the June quarter due to our competitors recall. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution, excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries were $472 million, an increase of 18%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $308 million, an increase of 11%, or an increase of 2% in constant currency terms. By product segments, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $268 million, an increase of 30%. Masks and other sales were $204 million, an increase of 5%. In Europe, Asia and other markets device sales totaled $210 million, an increase of 2% or in constant currency terms, a decrease of 6%. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $98 million, an increase of 36% or in constant currency terms a 24% increase. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 12%, while masks and other sales increased by 10%. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 related sales in both the current quarter and the prior year quarter, global device sales increased by 46% in constant currency terms, while masks and other sales increased by 16% in constant currency terms. Software-as-a-Service revenue for the fourth quarter was $96 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. Looking forward to fiscal year '22, we expect several factors will drive demand, including the general recovery of the global sleep market from COVID-19 impacts, the launch of our next-generation AirSense 11 platform and share gains during our competitors recall. However, while we are working hard to increase capacity, we will not be able to meet all the expected demand resulting from our products -- compared from our competitors recall, primarily because of supply constraints for electronic components. And we expect these constraints to be more limiting in the first half of FY '22 than the second half. As Mick mentioned, we believe component supply constraints as they stand will currently limit incremental device revenue attributable to our competitors recall to somewhere between $300 million and $350 million during fiscal year '22. During my remaining commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin decreased by 260 basis points to 57.3% in the June quarter, compared to 59.9% in the same quarter last year. The decrease is predominantly attributable to a negative product mix impact, specifically a proportional increase in sales of our lower margin sleep devices, ISP [ph] declines and unfavorable foreign currency movements. We also continue to experience elevated and significant freight costs. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter were $181 million, an increase of 10% or in constant currency terms SG&A expenses increased by 4% compared to the prior year period. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 20.7% compared to the 21.5% we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect the SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% during fiscal year '22. R&D expenses for the quarter was $60 million, an increase of 14%. While on a constant currency basis, an increase of 9%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.8%, which is consistent with the prior year. We continue to make significant investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product and digital solutions will deliver sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenues to be in the vicinity of 7% during fiscal year '22. Total amortization of required intangibles was $19 million for the quarter and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $17 million. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $260 million, an increase of 7% underpinned by strong revenue growth. As I reported last quarter, we estimated and recorded an accounting tax reserve of $255 million during the previous quarter, which was net of credits and deductions for a proposed settlement of transfer pricing audits by the Australian Taxation Office or ATO. During the quarter, we progressed our settlement discussions with the ATO and have refined our tax reserve estimate. As a result, we have determined the required reserve is $249 million or $6 million lower than the previous quarter estimate. And accordingly, we have recorded this as reduction in our GAAP tax expense in the June quarter. Next steps involve concluding a written agreement with the ATO and obtaining final approvals from each side, which we hope to achieve this quarter. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 18.4%. While on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.5%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rates for FY '21 was 18.7%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rates for fiscal year '22 will be in the range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $198 million, an increase of 3%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.35, an increase of 2%. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $195 million and our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.33. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $227 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings partially offset by increases in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $28 million. Depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $42 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $57 million. We recorded equity losses of $1.3 million in our income statement in the June quarter associated with the Verily joint venture, now called Primasun. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $2 million for the quarter for fiscal year '22 associated with the joint venture operation. We ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $295 million. At June 30, we had $655 million in gross debt, and $360 million in net debt. Our debt levels remain modest. And at June 30, we had a further $1.6 billion available for drawdown under existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share. This represents an increase of 8% over the previous quarterly dividend and reflects the Board's confidence in our strong liquidity position and operating performance. Our solid cash flow and liquidity provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. During the pandemic we have focused on paying down debt. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest for growth through R&D. We will also likely continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions such as Citus Health. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. Yes, Thanks, Mike. I mean, we do -- Chris, we do. I mean, obviously, and Rob mentioned that kind of, we have some of these longer term commitments that are contractually so that helps us there. But if you look at an industry wide, I think for electronic components, you are seeing price pressures there. So I think over the course of the year, you expects, I think, some increases on those components there. We can mitigate that to some extent with some of these longer term contractual arrangements. So that is a pressure point, if you like on our cost side. And then freight, definitely as Nick mentioned, that remains pretty elevated. And for a number of reasons, and just really even getting slots and so on, that's a freight. That's even into even containers now for [indiscernible]. So that I think we will continue some -- probably for this year. With that, you think -- I don't think the freight is going to be [indiscernible] I think that will resolve itself over time. But I think for the over the course of this fiscal, I think that's going to remain as a cost pressure for us."

            "name": "James Hollings",
            "content": "Yes, thanks, Mick and thanks, Maggie, for your question. I would say on long-term, as we were preparing to launch AirSense 11, our plan was to take market share, to take device share with the offering because the AirSense 11 offering both the device and the software we think is by far the best offering on the market. We're introducing at launch a number of innovations and the platform because of its connectivity allows us to introduce even more software innovations post-launch on an ongoing basis. And so as Mick said in his opening comments, we feel very confident that with AirSense 10 and AirSense 11, we have the two best sleep therapy devices on the market. So that was our plan all along. And I think that our competitors recall simply creates a window of opportunity for us, as Mick [indiscernible] to familiarize more customers, more patients with the innovations and to streamline workflows for providers and to provide, continually improving the patient experience on therapy, which drives up adherence, improves outcomes for patients and all of our stakeholders then winners with that. So we felt very confident as we were launching and I think the circumstances give us even more of an opportunity. I would say just in specific to Propeller, we remain very excited about Propeller as a part of our portfolio. And, like a lot of number of things, over the last 18 months, the headwinds for Propeller were largely driven by their customer base, focusing on COVID.

            "name": "Mick Farrell",
            "content": "Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review result of our June quarter, the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2021. On today's call, I'll provide a high-level overview of our financial results as well as review progress towards ResMed's 2025 strategic goals. I will discuss execution highlights against our top three strategic priorities and our urgent and ongoing actions to address current industry supply chain issues and opportunities. I'll then hand the call over to Brett for further detail on our financial results. Let me start with the situation that has generated many stakeholder questions in the last month and half. During the quarter, demand for ResMed's Sleep and Respiratory Care devices surged dramatically after our competitors recall announcement, putting additional pressure on an already challenging environment for our industry's supply chain. Global supply chain limitations including a shortage of electronic components, as well as ongoing freight constraints and costs are impacting our ability to respond to the unprecedented increase in demand for ResMed products. Executive teams across automotive, consumer product and communications technology industries have confirmed on their recent earnings calls that they are struggling with the same issues. Some major producers have suggested the chip and electronic components shortages could extend 12 or even 18 months. We are working incredibly closely with our global supply chain partners to ensure access to additional supply of the critical components that we need to further increase production of our medical devices. During this June quarter, the demand spike was so high that we have been forced to allocate products due to the unprecedented demand and these real world supply chain capacity constraints. In doing so, our guiding principles are very simple. We are focused on the highest acuity patient needs first. It's very similar to our approach to ventilator allocation during the peaks of the COVID crisis these last 18 months. We will continue to coordinate with all of our stakeholders as the situation develops, and we begin to open up the supply constraints. We understand this is a frustrating situation for all of our customer groups, including physicians, home medical equipment providers, payers, and most importantly the ultimate customer, the patient. It is a unique time in our industry, with steady recovery of patient flow after COVID-19 peaks in various countries. With these global supply chain constraints and with an unforeseen competitor recall, all occurring simultaneously. I want to be clear that through it all our priority will always be patients, doing our best to help those who need treatment for sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other respiratory diseases. Our goal is to ensure that patients get the therapy that they need and when they need it. Let me be very clear about a couple of things. One, ResMed sleep apnea and respiratory care devices are safe to use. They are the best in the market. They are the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable and the most connected therapies. And Positive Airway Pressure therapy remains the gold standard for the treatment of sleep apnea. And two, ResMed will not be able to fill the entire supply gap that has been created by this situation caused by a competitor just 7 weeks ago. They were the number two player to our number one leading market position in almost all of the 140 countries that we compete in worldwide. We're doing everything that we can to partner further and further up our supply chain in order to increase our access to the supply of the past, the pieces and the components that we need to manufacture at scale. We expect to be in a somewhat supply chain constrained environment throughout fiscal year 2022. This news from our competitor was only released to the market on June 14. So we are in the first 7.5 weeks of our response. However, we have already partnered with our global supply chain team both internal and external. And although we expect the current quarter and the December 2021 quarter will be the most supply constrained. We do see room for expansion of supply ahead. We expect that the flow of ResMed products will accelerate significantly during the March 2022 and the June 2022 quarters. We are focused on partnering with physicians, providers and distributors to ensure that our devices get to newly diagnosed patients. And while that human impact is the most important, I know our investors and our analysts need to model the future financial impact of this accelerated growth on our ResMed financials. Based upon our latest supply chain information and analysis, we see a path to $300 million to $350 million in additional revenue in fiscal 2022 over and above our previously planned revenue growth for fiscal 2022. Importantly, we see a clear opportunity to increase our long-term sustainable market share, as patients, physicians and providers experience our ResMed market leading device and integrated cloud-based software solutions. Our experience over the last 7 plus years since we launched our online platform called Air Solutions at scale is that when providers adopt and embrace our suite of digital health solutions, they can lower their own labor costs by over 50%. They can drive their own patient adherence rates up to over 87% and beyond. After doing that, they don't want to go back to an inferior solution. And yes, during the near distant future, we will be starting the full product launch of our brand new next-generation platform called AirSense 11. Let me now turn to overall market conditions in our industry. As we discussed last quarter, the countries we operate in are at various stages of the post-COVID peak recovery process in terms of sleep apnea and COPD patient flow. We are seeing continued improvement in patient flow country-by-country. But there is a wide variance in that total patient flow from 75% of pre-COVID levels in some countries around the world to 95% or even 100% of pre-COVID levels in other countries. Vaccines are steadily rolling out country by country. And at the same time new variants including the Delta variant continue to cause disruption in some geographies. Our team remains committed to working with hospitals and health care providers to provide the ventilators, masks and training that they need for acute care. We will continue to support frontline respiratory therapists and physicians as well as providers, patients and our ResMedian team throughout the 140 plus countries that we operate in. A few things that have become really clear during this pandemic is that every country in the world has: one, increased its adoption of digital health solutions; two, increased its focus on respiratory hygiene and respiratory health; and three, increased its investments in health care treatment outside the hospital, and particularly in the home. These are all catalysts for ResMed's long-term growth. We are pleased with the steady progress that we are seeing in diagnosing new sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patients. During the fourth quarter, our sales team delivered very strong revenue growth across our core sleep apnea and respiratory care business. This incredible double-digit growth was despite the headwind from lapping $125 million of incremental COVID related ventilator sales in the June 2020 quarter, and with some tailwinds from our competitors recall right at the end of the quarter. While I am proud of the team for this 10% constant currency revenue growth in the quarter, I'm also very proud of their achievement over the fiscal year with over 6% growth in revenue throughout fiscal year 2021 to over $3.2 billion in total annual revenue, and with leverage producing over 12% growth in our non-GAAP operating profit and all the while fighting for recovery patient flow and battling COVID-19 impacts. Quite a performance from our team of 8,000 ResMedians helping people in 140 countries. We expect to see steady improvement in patient flow for sleep apnea and respiratory care therapy as we move throughout our fiscal year 2022. We are encouraged to see patients, physicians and providers adopting digital health tools for remote patient screening, for home-based testing, for patient monitoring and for ongoing population health management. As the leader in digital health for the treatment of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma as well as other chronic respiratory conditions, we are well-positioned to drive this growth with our health care delivery partners. During the quarter, we generated over $227 million of operating cash flow, allowing us to return $57 million in cash dividends to shareholders these last 90 days. Today, we announced an 8% increase in our quarterly dividend for shareholders to $0.42 per share. We are pleased to return your cash to you, our shareholders, reflecting our confidence in ResMed's resilient business and our ongoing cash flow. We also increased our R&D investments in digital health technology during the quarter, as well as our research and development for masks, for devices, for embedded device software and for global clinical research. All the while maintaining fiscal discipline with SG&A and keeping other operating costs in line. We are reinvesting for long-term growth. We lead the field of remote patient engagement and population health management with over 15 million cloud connectable medical devices in the market. Our increasing investments in digital health innovation will ensure that we provide superior value to patients, to physicians and to providers to be their partner of choice. We don't take our leading market share position for granted, we have to earn it every day with every product, every solution, and every service and every customer interaction. Customers vote with their wallets. And right now they are voting for us, and we plan to keep earning their support. Our digital health technologies are a growth catalyst for our business. We have an exciting pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium and long-term value. With an industry leading intellectual property portfolio, including over 8,200 patents and designs. We now have over 9 billion nights of respiratory medical data in our cloud-based platform called Air Solutions. We have over 16.5 million patients enrolled in our cloud-based AirView software solution for physicians. And we recently upgraded our patient engagement tool called myAir. This app is now cloud native and serverless in the cloud. This new myAir 2.0 release supports our next-generation platform called AirSense 11. The AirSense 11 platform comes to the market with new capabilities with improved data delivery, with scalable architecture, and with support for full cycle teams. And what that all means is that we have the opportunity for accelerated innovation in our ecosystem. We have over 110 million patients managed within our Software-as-a-Service network for out of hospital care. These incredible data assets allow us to unlock value for all of our customer groups, for patients, for physicians, for providers, as well as for private and government payers and the community -- communities that they serve. Let me now update you on our top three strategic priorities. These are: one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses; two, to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital, and especially in the home. Last quarter, we previewed our next gen platform called AirSense 11. Responding to the current industry situation, our market leading research and development team accelerated the launch of the AirSense 11. First, by expanding the control product launch to additional customers just this last month. And second by moving to an earlier full product launch date. We now expect to launch in the United States before the end of this current quarter, and then to other countries gradually over time. This AirSense 11 device launch will be a device launch like no other in the history of ResMed. Previously we carefully timed new product platform launches to minimize the selling overlap of device platforms. We are in a unique situation today. Our market leading AirSense 10 continues to be very strongly adopted, and we believe that it is better than any other device currently on the market. In short, it makes sense to continue to sell the AirSense 10 at Skype, particularly as this will help maximize the overall CPAP, IPAP and bilevel volume available for our customers for sale given the unprecedented demand for new patients to receive ResMed devices in the market right now. The bottom line is that we're going to be selling both the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11 in parallel for quite some time, as we meet this extraordinary market demand over the coming fiscal year. And as we continue to expand the availability of AirSense 11 to new markets and new geographies around the ResMed world. We are very excited to bring the AirSense 11 to market, and I am understating the results when I say that the response to our control product launch has been very positive. AirSense 11 benefits patients and bed partners and the device and software platform combination will also benefit physicians, providers, payers and overall health care systems. As I said earlier, we make the smallest, the quietest and the smartest and the most comfortable devices on the market. But they are also the most connected and the most clever devices. All AirSense 11 devices are 100% cloud connectable with upgraded digital health technology to increase patient engagement and inherence to improve clinical outcomes and to deliver proven cost reductions within our customers own health care systems, engaging patients directly in their own digital therapy like never before in the industry. Let me now turn to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and the 330 million asthma patients worldwide. Our goal is to reach these many hundreds of millions of potential patients with our Respiratory Care Solutions, including non-invasive ventilation, and life support ventilation, as well as newer therapeutic areas such as cloud connected pharmaceutical drug delivery solutions, and high flow therapy offerings. We announced that our respiratory care business benefited this time last year in the June 2020 quarter as we sold incremental ventilation devices and mass solutions to meet the growing demand for COVID, on an acute scale to the tune of $125 million in sales. During the current June 2021 quarter, we had modest COVID-related ventilator sales. They were not material to our overall results, they were under $20 million in sales, just under. As the Delta variant of this coronavirus surges in various markets and regions, we will still be there to support governments and health care systems and the patients they serve in their acute need. But we do not expect the resulting revenue from COVID to be material to our global business. Of course, the broader humanitarian impact is measurable with preservation of life through our ventilation solutions, a top priority in all of these countries. Our supply chain focus is for Astral, our life support ventilator, then Stellar, our non-invasive ventilator, and then our Lumis and AirCurve platforms to ensure that we can help patients who need our support the most. Demand for our core, non-invasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for COPD are experiencing the same steady recovery and new patient flow as we see in our sleep apnea business. We are balancing the growth in demand with the supply of ventilators that made it to market throughout the last 18 months as customers balance their inventory with ongoing acute and chronic ventilation patient needs. We continue to see rapid adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe this time a year-ago. We are now expanding this technology to regions around the world. The value being provided through AirView for ventilation has been helpful to physicians not only during the COVID crisis, but it is also increasingly valuable as an ongoing clinical tool for them and for the health care systems that they operate in. In summary, we are helping to ensure that digital health is the new standard of care for respiratory care. Let me now review our Software-as-a-Service business for out of hospital health care. During the quarter, our SaaS business grew in mid single digits year-over-year across our portfolio of markets, including home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, private duty home care, home infusion, and life plan communities. The continued growth of home-based care is providing tailwinds for our HME and home health products. And we continue to grow with customers as they utilize and optimize our resupply solutions to improve patient care. The COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging for some verticals in our SaaS business, particularly skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs. However, we are seeing positive trends as census rates improve across SNFs, and other care settings. We are watching this very closely as COVID peaks in the case of varying rates around the country. We expect there to be pent-up demand for our software purchasing that provides opportunities for us to increase our pipeline as COVID restrictions continue to ease state-by-state. Our leading position as the software provider of choice to the HME market enabled us to help customers manage through the pandemic and to maintain a healthy business. Our Brightree branded software solutions are allowing HMEs to work through current challenges within our industry, including the need for increased patient support, the need for management of product shortages in some categories, as well as ongoing growth in the resupply of much needed home medical equipment. As we look across our portfolio of solutions, we expect our SaaS revenue growth to gradually accelerate increasing from its current mid single-digit growth to high single-digit growth by the back end of this fiscal year. As always, our goal is to meet or beat these market growth rates as we continue to innovate and take market share from competitors. Additionally, we see opportunities on our radar screen to drive growth through further SaaS acquisitions to augment our existing organic growth. We have a good history of thorough due diligence, ensuring that ResMed is the best owner of the asset. And of course, that we can bring additional value for our customers with the new offering, and of course additional value for all of our shareholders. In summary, our SaaS offerings are well received in each of the verticals that we serve. And we see an increasing opportunity to leverage analytics to minimize acute care episodes for residents, patients and clients in our provider network. And ultimately, to allow people to age in place, away from a hospital and preferably in their own homes. Looking at the portfolio of ResMed's businesses across both sleep and respiratory care as well as our SaaS solutions, we remain very confident in our long-term strategy and our pipeline of innovative products and solutions. Our mission and specific goal to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025 drives and motivates ResMedians every day. The light shining on the importance of respiratory health and hygiene is brighter than it ever was due to this pandemic. COVID has also highlighted the importance of digital health, it's accelerated awareness and adoption of technologies that can be used for remote patient screening, diagnosis set up as well as patient monitoring and management. We continue to invest aggressively in R&D to ensure ResMed solutions remain market leading and provide a catalyst for long-term growth. With over 1.5 billion people around the world suffering from sleep apnea, COPD and asthma, we see incredible opportunities for greater identification, enrollment, and engagement of people within our digital health ecosystem. We are relentlessly driving innovation and development to provide the scale needed to expand the impact of this technology across all of the 140 countries that we operate in. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to again express my sincere gratitude to the more than 8,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication during the most unusual, almost perfect storm of circumstances. You have helped save the lives of many hundreds of thousands of people around the world with emergency needs for ventilation these last 18 months as we suffered through COVID. And now you have rapidly pivoted the company back to provide ongoing support for our customers and patients during very challenging industry dynamics and supply chain constraints with unprecedented demand. Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney and then we will go to Q&A with the whole team. Brett, over to you. Yes, thanks for the question, John. And, yes, look, it's really exciting to be able to provide $300 million to $350 million in incremental revenue for our shareholders, but devices for much needed patients out there over the coming fiscal year. And we actually we hope to get better than that as we look for more parts and pieces and components. That's our current forecast. Look, just breaking down the device numbers for the quarter, really strong device numbers for the U.S., at plus 30%. That was off the comp. If you remember this time a year-ago where sleep devices were way down and ventilators were picking up in the U.S., I think it was around plus 1% the comp, and so huge turnaround there plus 30% in this last quarter. And then in EMEA, Asia and rest of world this time last year, we had plus 35% growth because we had really strong ventilator sales, particularly to some Asia Pacific regions in their COVID crisis. And so that combo plus 35% was being analyzed, and we saw a minus 6% for EMEA, Asia and rest of world. So it's a combination, John of multiple factors of COVID for both those sort of regions, U.S., Canada, Latin America, plus 30% versus EMEA, Asia and rest of world lapping a plus 30% at their minus 6%. So as we project for the $300 million to $350 million, I think that's probably the most guidance we've ever given around an opportunity like this. I'm not going to split that by region, or by type or by area. But I can tell you, its supply chain constrained, not demand constrained. And everyone in all the 140 countries wants ResMed products. And everyone we make we sell and we are doing everything we can to drive more and more elements in our supply chain, wherever that bottleneck is in supply, whatever that part or pieces. I personally as the CEO, I'm calling up that supplier and talking to their CEO and saying, look, this component can go into a cell phone or a car, or it can go into a medical device that literally gives someone the gift of breathe. Please prioritize our part of the supply chain, and it's been working those last 7 weeks. We've been able to match $300 million to $350 million in additional revenue. And our goal is to continue every week, every month to do better and better on that. Yes, Dan, it's a good question. And I don't want to get into a sort of breakdown every 90 days approach on it. But what I can say in terms of color, Dan, for your modeling is that, we found out about this 7.5 weeks ago, and we've been working like crazy these last 2 months on the supply chain. And it's easy to open up supply 3 months out, 6 months out, 9 months out. So a lot of the additional flow of parts and pieces is back end loaded in the fiscal year. And so, much less supply chain constrained in the March quarter, and the June quarter of this fiscal year '22 we're in. And it's going to be tough out here. We're already in the September quarter, and we're hand to mouth. But look, we're not stockpiling. We're not putting stuff in inventory. We are pushing stuff through plants. Our plants aren't at full capacity, so we have capacity. It's really around components and parts and pieces that are the bottlenecks. And so, if you think about that color, it sort of gives you guidance to know that Q3 and Q4 will be a lot less constrained than Q1 and Q2. Q2 should be slightly better than Q1 and Q3 should be significantly better than Q2, and Q4 should be significantly better than Q2 and Q1 as well. Yes, David, that's a good clarification. So the $300 million to $350 million is incremental devices, including Astral, Stellar, AirCurve, Lumis as well as AirSense 10 and AirSense 11. So it's all physical product devices. It does not include any potential upside in masks that you can get while selling great flow generated capabilities. And so it doesn't include incremental sales of those. It's focused on the device side, but both ventilation and sleep apnea devices are included in that number. Yes, I see where you're going with the question. It's sort of trying to get to the understanding of how much incremental mask share we might get when they're on a ResMed device. Look, as you know, it's an open system. And there's no requirement that a ResMed device has a ResMed mask. They are designed by the same engineers and the same building out there in Sydney, in the manufacturing -- advanced manufacturing site across the road. So they design to work together very well and they are better together. So there is a better uptake of ResMed masks with ResMed devices. And certainly, it's going through a channel where there's a sales person who's providing both of them. And so there's some opportunities on both the sort of clinical and technical side as well as the commercial and execution side for some incremental growth. I won't quantify that for you. But I do think there is some upside. Thanks, David. Yes, Sean, two very good questions and very much related. Yes, I think there is some overlap of some of the parts and pieces between the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11 platform. It's 7 years newer in the market. And so there's a lot of upgraded electronic, mechanical, plastic and digital health technology in the device. And so there's a lot of new components as well. And there is demand from our competitor out there trying to cover their recall amount as well as catch up with the patients that need urgent replacements. We're not seeing as much of the latter, though. We have a supply chain that have some overlaps with some of our competitors, but actually very individually designed. And as we work through the supply chains, the whole medical device industry is a very small percentage point of the suppliers total capacity, which is great for us in that. We're not fighting for limited share versus a competitor, we're really fighting for share versus a large consumer phone company or automobile company and the suppliers, like medical devices, because firstly, we're relatively recession resistant. We don't suddenly stop our sales during the recession, as some people do in consumer purchases and automotive, and we're usually high margin for them. So -- and more sustainable growth in terms of what we're doing for our platforms. The AirSense 10 has been in the market for 7 years. And so these are long-term sustainable for them. So our arguments are very good with the supply chain. And that's why in the last 7 weeks, we've been able to identify that extra $300 million to $350 million in opportunity. But there is some commonality between our devices. And we will make those trade-offs and that's why we will provide both AirSense 10 and AirSense 11. But the AirSense 11 is a huge leap forward to the industry and our goal will be country-by-country to roll that out. But, yes, for the next 6, 12 months, there's going to be a lot of selling both the fantastic AirSense 10 and the amazing AirSense 11 in parallel in countries around the world. Thanks, Sean. Okay. Great, Maggie. This -- I think four great questions in your question there. I'll address the first half of that, and then I'll hand over to maybe Jim Hollings to address some of the latter questions about long-term. Firstly, yes, we are focused on new patients as they come through. We're the number one provider in almost all of the 140 countries that we're in, but the competitive with this recall was often the number two to our number one position. And so there's a lot of demand for new patient flow, and that's where we're focused, that's where we're laser focused. Frankly, it's their job to focus on replacement or recall, that was their job and their duty to go take care of those patients, and we're focused on the new patients, both together will create unprecedented demand in the market. So that's point one. We are focused on new patients. At a high-level, as we look out beyond sort of this competitive recall to say, what's the steady state as we get to fiscal '23 and towards the end of fiscal '22, I do think, as I said in the prepared remarks that we will achieve a permanent market share increase from this. ResMed has always been the quality leader, always been the clinical leader, always been the smallest class and most comfortable. But there were some customers who just been used to, the old devices from an American brand that was bought by the Dutch company for a long time, they just stuck with what they had. I think that will get a chance to experience. The [indiscernible] improvement, the efficiency improvement, the doctors being excited about having full digital on AirView and patients being excited about the interaction on MyAir and [indiscernible] that they get patients happy, physicians happy and provider happy because a happy patient is one who is buying masks because they need them on a replenishment basis. So I won't quantify it for you. But I do think there's a magnificent opportunity for us to get our technology in front of a whole new range of customers. On the other hand, where supplies are constrained right now, so we're focused on our existing customers and taking care of them and making sure that we can get the new patients set up for them. But Jim, any other color, you think on sort of changes to the market conditions and longer term implications? Maggie. Andrew, great question. I'll address maybe the first half and hand to Rob Douglas to talk a little bit to that. But look, I can tell you, as CEO, traditionally I'm taken into discussions with major customers, talking to the large multinational customers around the world and governments that we provide these great therapies and solutions for so that I can engage with them and talk about our great value. But at the moment I'm not doing that, because customer demand is almost infinite. And I'm being taken by my global supply team to talk to suppliers. And Andrew without naming individuals, I know that individual supply was named during the COVID crisis at their request, we are going and I'm spending time not just 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 steps up our supply chain and talking to people who make these basic plastics, electronics and components and parts and pieces and telling them. Sometimes they're unaware that further down the supply chain there's a life support ventilator or a non-invasive ventilator or a sleep apnea device that cures and treats sleep suffocation. And so just getting me that opportunity, firstly, it's very interesting for me. It's a new dynamic, and we're getting really good response from these suppliers. They also are under difficult supply chain conditions and often asked me to go with them further up the supply chain to talk to someone else. And it's a game of sort of bottleneck -- debottlenecking, if you like, in the global supply chain. We have a very advanced engineering team that are looking all day every day in our global supply alliance internally, led by Linda Laidlaw and her team and Andrew Price and his team. And they are pulling me in and doing much more themselves all day, every day to drive that. So it's an ongoing opportunity for us. It's a supply chain opportunity, but unique through the COVID impacts on freight costs and impacts on freight availability, but also the growth that we see ahead due to this unique situation. Rob any more color to talk about there on about supply chain for -- to Andrew's question? Chris, that's a good question. I'll hand to Brett to talk a little bit around the costs and how we're taking care of those. And Rob, if he wants to chime in as well. Look, this is an unprecedented time. Before our competitor made this announcement, 7 weeks ago, there was already constraints in the market around some of the components. And certainly because of nobody travelling really internationally, consumer travel was down so much and all the freight in the back of those consumer jets was gone. The costs were higher. And look, we talked about this 90 days ago on our last earnings call, and you saw it in the COGS numbers for this June quarter. And that's going to be with us for a while. I mean, these, these costs aren't going away. It is more costly to get freight than it was because there's much less planes available. And it is -- with scarce components, although we have very long-term contracts, prices are being impacted by that. At the same time, we're in an environment where we have customers with contracts with payers, and the consumer side of our business, there might be some opportunity to work with the supply chain to think about how to get some of those costs through the channel. But certainly in the reimburse side of the market, it's about and you've got to think really long-term about on the other side of this crisis, how we and our customers going to engage in our long-term interactions. And so it's a complex equation. And -- but, Brett, do you want to talk a little bit to what we're doing to negotiate to achieve the best prices that we can get and to manage our gross margin there and the COGS there. And, maybe Jim talked to how we're working with customers on long-term pricing. So Brett, and then Jim. Thanks, Chris. Jim, I'll hand that question to you. It's a follow up really to your response to the previous question. Yes, that's a terrific question. And we're actually in many way -- in many cases working through those contract negotiations in real time, I think that we have pretty good clarity with most of our customers that this is an unusual set of circumstances. And so we have a number of customers. And this varies a lot by geography, for everybody to understand. But we have we do have a number of customers who have, need volume based or rebate -- volume based rebates or pricing levels. And this is an unusual set of circumstances that drive more volume into those accounts. And so those are contracts we're working through in real time, but they're not uncapped discounts. And we're managing those conversations, I think very carefully. This is in a way, the flip side of the previous question where because we have relationships with customers who understand the dynamic of what's going on, we're able to negotiate pretty, pretty good price stability. So there's no risk for us of runaway in a sort of runaway discounts and rebates. And on the other hand, we're, working to create a kind of a stable pricing environment for our customers as well. Thanks, Lyanne. Yes, David, there was some confusion after the June 14 announcement, but I think many of the regulatory authorities and many of the clinician groups came out pretty quickly to say, let's talk to you doctor and work out a risk pathway between now and when you get that replacement device from that competitor. And also, for new patients, the doctors and certainly all of us in the industry we're very focused on the safe and effective therapies from ResMed and other players in the market. And so I think that that messaging was actually pretty quickly put out there by those physician societies and relevant health authorities after somewhat confusing announcements, right on that June 14 from our competitor. And so long-term, there's been some impacts that are quite beneficial in patients making that trade off. And certainly for us, you saw plus 5% growth in masks in the quarter for the U.S., you saw plus 24% growth in Europe, over a COVID [indiscernible] there, but very, very solid growth in our mask business. As you said, there's a bunch of factors, David, that this time last year, we had all the ventilation Mark sales, because it in the U.S which was, you know, a confident we were was like a headwind. And the other headwind, we had was the annualization of the snap acquisition, which we did just before COVID, we closed it just in that sort of February through June period. And then, there's some balancing of inventory and cash flow due to the competitive recall all going on at once. And so a lot of competing dynamics, but as you saw, it's a resilient business. When people getting great sleep apnea therapy, they love feeling better, sleeping well and waking up refreshed, and they want to get a new mask every three or six months. And they're doing it at increasing rates due to COVID, that step change has remained. And we're confident, we look through the fiscal year that we're going to see, mid single-digit up to high single-digit growth. In our mask business and it's all about us engaging with those, those patients getting new patients on board. As we talked about some incremental revenue opportunities, they're on the devices, maybe some of the masks, and then we get back to where we were before, right. And we go back to engaging patients, ensuring they stay on therapy, and they have really quick and easy access to resupply, if they want it and when they want it, and when it's covered by insurance and co pays and everything. Yes, thanks, Rob and thanks to all of you for sticking around a little long. Clearly some unique circumstances in this perfect storm. Thanks again to all of our shareholders for joining us on the call today. I'd like to once again take the opportunity to thank 8,000 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders for their dedication and hard work helping people breathe better, sleep better, and live better lives outside the hospital in 140 countries worldwide. Thanks for all that you do today, and every day, and thanks especially to our ResMed heroes on the front lines during this global private crisis, including patient care provider support and hospitals, production, global supply chain management, distribution, and tech service. Once again, thank you. And I'd like to thank all of you, our shareholders for joining us here and we'll see you in 90 days. Thank you very much. Great. Thanks, Mick and thank you again for joining us today. We do appreciate your interest and your time. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out directly. This does conclude our call. Rob, you may now close it up."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Celin. Hello, everyone and welcome to ResMed's third quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings call. We appreciate you joining us. This call is being webcast live and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today along with the copy of the earnings release and presentation, both of which are available now. With me on the call today are CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett Sandercock. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion following our prepared remarks. During today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, please review the notes in today's earnings press release or in the appendix of the earnings presentation. As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions; however, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.\nMick Farrell: Thanks Amy. And thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review result of the March quarter, the third quarter of our fiscal year 2021. On today's call, I'll provide a high-level overview of our Q3 business metrics. And then I'll hand the call over to Brett for further detail on our financial results. I will review progress towards ResMed 2025 strategic goals including execution highlights against our quarterly and our annual operating priorities. A year ago, today when we discussed our March 2020 results, we were only just beginning to understand the scope of the COVID-19 pandemic. Much of business particularly in the United States had not yet been significantly impacted. However, outside the U.S., countries including China and Italy were already in the midst of emergency needs. We quickly mobilize our supply-chain and global operations to address and support ventilation needs world-wide, producing other 150,000 ventilators. We accelerate the production and distribution of noninvasive and life support ventilators in mask systems to those in need, resulting in an incremental $35 million of COVID related revenue during the March 2020 quarter. I'm incredibly proud of how we quickly pivoted business to meet that need, providing life citing solutions around the world, so that healthcare systems were prepared with the resources needed to treat patients who are fighting COVID-19. Today, one year later, the countries we operate in are various different stages of the post COVID peak recovery process in terms of getting to normal patient flow. We see a range of from 70% of pre-COVID patient flow in some countries, up to 90% of pre-COVID patient flow in other countries. Vaccines are steadily rolling out in the United States, the U.K. and many other countries worldwide. We still see significant impacts from ongoing second, third and fourth waves infection in some countries in Europe, as well as in South America and Asia. And especially right now, in the country of Brazil and particularly India. Our team is working with hospitals and healthcare providers in those two countries and beyond for preservation of life, making sure that they have ventilators, masks and the training that they need to use them. We continue to support the frontline respiratory therapists and the physicians who are there on the ground, as well as providers, patients and ResMedians throughout their 140 plus countries that we operate in. Were pleased with the steady progress that we are seeing and getting new sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patients diagnosed, excluding the $35 million of COVID related ventilator sales in the March 2020 quarter, our team delivered positive sales growth across our core sleep apnea and respiratory care business this quarter on both the headline and constant currency basis. We forecast a steady improvement trend of patient flow for sleep apnea and COPD and asthma continuing as we move through 2021 and into 2022. We expect this progress to accelerate as global vaccination rates continue. We are encouraged to see that patients, physicians and providers around the world are adopting digital health tools for remote patient screening, home-based testing, remote patient monitoring, and ongoing patient management. I'd like to be clear that the ventilation sales that we made in 2020 will be part of our comparables for the next two quarters. In the June 2020 quarter, we recognize $125 million in COVID related ventilator sales. And in September 2020 quarter, we recognized $40 million in such revenue. Over the coming quarters we expect to continue to show strong positive year-over-year revenue growth excluding these onetime sales from 2020. As we look further forward, we see a clear path to double digit revenue growth in the back half of our fiscal year 2022 across our full business, powered by opening economies and our pipeline of new technology and innovation. Our headline results were impacted this quarter by an accounting reserves. We talk in connection with discussions with the Australian Tax Office or ATR regarding their ongoing order getting back to fiscal year 2009. Brett has been leading those discussions and we'll speak to the details in his remarks. I will make this statement, ResMed pay significant taxes in countries around the world and we operate in over 140 countries helping people sleep better, breathe better and live better lives well away from the hospital. Brett and his team are working towards a final resolution of these transfer pricing discussions turning back over 12 years with the ATR. So we have taken this $255 million reserve. We believe that resolving these discussions is the pragmatic thing to do for all of our stakeholders, so that we can put this behind us and focus all of our efforts on our core mission of improving lives in respiratory medicine around the world. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, we generated over $196 million in operating cash, allowing us to return $57 million in cash dividends to shareholders. We also increased our R&D investments in the period in digital health technology, as well as R&D for hardware, embedded software and clinical research, while maintaining financial discipline with reduced SG&A and other operating costs. We are seeing increased demand for our digital health solutions from patients, physicians, providers and healthcare systems around the world as they embrace remote patient engagement and adopt population health management. We are the clear leader in this field with over 14 million cloud connectable medical devices in the market. And our ongoing and increasing investments in digital health innovation will ensure we provide superior value to patients, physicians and providers to be their partner of choice. We don't take our leading market share position for granted. We fight for it every day through innovation. Our digital technologies are a growth catalyst for our business. We have an exciting pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium and long term value with an industry leading IP portfolio including over 8000 patents and designs. We now have over 8.5 billion nights of respiratory medical data in our cloud based platform called air solutions. We have over 15.5 patients enrolled in our cloud based AirView software solution. And we also have over 105 million patients manage within our software as a service network for out-of-hospital healthcare. These incredible data assets allow us to unlock value for all of our customers, patients, physicians, providers, as well as private and government payers. Let me take a few minutes to share some recent clinical highlights that show how we are working with researchers to advance the field of sleep and respiratory medicine with these data and beyond. During 2020, an important 30-year duration study was published in the European respiratory journal following over 4,500 diagnosed OSA patients to better understand the long term impacts of untreated sleep apnea. The study showed that untreated sleep apnea leads to high incidence of myocardial infarction or heart attack, high incidence and prevalence of Type II diabetes and high incidence of ischemic heart disease. This real world clinical analysis is showing what we've known for over three decades. Sleep apnea is a public health epidemic that simply can't be ignored. In terms of clinical quality of life improvement from CPAP therapy, the data are also clear. In late 2019, the multicenter randomized controlled trial called MERGE was published in the journal, Lancet Respiratory Medicine. The results were that patients randomized to CPAP demonstrated clear improvement in quality of life for CPAP patients versus standard of care with symptomatic benefits, including reductions in sleepiness, as well as improvements in fatigue, and importantly, depression, a key part of mental health. Importantly, these results were evident in both mild as well as moderate and severe sleep apnea. In terms of economic data, and a dose response relationship from CPAP therapy, the data are also unequivocal. In 2019, a study was published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, showing the quantified dose response relationship from CPAP therapy. So, for every additional hour of Positive Airway Pressure use, there was an 8% decrease in hospital inpatient visits, and a 4% decrease in overall physician visits. In other words, treating sleep apnea without sleep therapy not only improves lives, it also saves money for the healthcare system by lowering total healthcare utilization costs. During the quarter, we saw the publication of a draft technology assessment from the Agency for Healthcare, Research and Quality, or AHRQ here in the U.S. market. AHRQ sought input and ResMed file public comments, along with comments from many physician groups, sleep apnea patient advocates, provider groups, and beyond. I won't repeat all the details of those public comments, but I will say this, we presented peer reviewed and published data showing that CPAP therapy improves quality of life, reduces healthcare costs, and even reduces mortality. In short, these data prove that in partnership with our physician and provider colleagues in the market, we are saving lives and saving money for the healthcare system through our medical technology. We have peer reviewed and published data showing that a reduction in incidence of heart attack, a reduction in hypertension, as well as a reduction in the incidence of solid cell cancer tumors. All of these are logical sequelae of the elimination of hypoxia that is associated with CPAP therapy in treated sleep apnea patients. We are encouraged by technical studies completed by the National Institute of Clinical Effectiveness. The acronym is nice in the U.K. Just last month NICE may publish there 2021 draft guidelines that recommend that CPAP therapy along with telemonitoring is the frontline treatment option for patients with mild OSA. That would be an expansion of coverage in the U.K., and also an expansion of the use of digital health technology in that market. Similarly, the ministries of health in France, Germany and Japan have seen the value of digital health in sleep apnea therapy and have begun investing reimbursement funds in the space. It's great to see this expansion of coverage for sleep apnea therapy and digital health around the world as government see improvement in outcomes and reductions in total healthcare system costs with this technology. While we respect the work of AHRQ, we, along with many other academic research focus institutes and practicing physician groups believe that they bypass a generation of data in real world evidence that needs to be taken into account along with their own select group of RCTs in the draft report. We are optimistic that the final report when issued we'll reflect the preponderance of real world evidence and broader RCTs showing both the clinical and economic benefits of treating sleep apnea with positive airway pressure. Okay, let me now update you on our top three, ResMed strategic priorities. These are, one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma businesses. Two, to design, develop and deliver world leading medical devices, as well as globally scalable digital health solutions. And three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and preferably in a person's home. In our core market of sleep apnea, we continue to see sequential improvement in new patient diagnosis trends, as we seek to provide solutions for the 936 million people worldwide who suffocate every night. The rate of new patients starting sleep apnea therapy in the U.S. was impacted by the typical seasonality that we see in the March quarter, primarily as a result of insurance deductibles resetting at the start of each calendar year. This season, in fact, affects devices more than mask systems, given the incremental cost of diagnosis and the relative price points of the two categories. We expect sequential growth in sleep and respiratory care as we move past this typical seasonality. We continue to see strong ongoing mask and accessory resupply in the U.S. market and beyond. New patient flow during the quarter was impacted by the recent COVID related case surges in select countries in Asia and Europe, including two large markets France and Germany. We see that impact the number of patients going for clinical based diagnosis pathways in these affected countries. We expect to see these markets reopen along with hospitals, as vaccines continue to roll out, and as we see further scaling of the remote home-based diagnostic capacity. Clearly the kinetics of opening of these economies and the rate of vaccination rollout are beyond our control. However, we can control our investments in digital solutions for our physician and provider partners, which we are doing at increasing velocity and with scalable systems and processes. More broadly, we are seeing growth in total sleep -- total new sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patient flow. And we expect to see this improve over time in our portfolio of 140 country markets each quarter. Importantly, our market leading share position has remained stable across both masks and devices. And we're excited about our future pipeline. We rarely talk about our future pipeline as those who've followed us for very time now. But today I would like to open up the curtain just a little bit on our next generation sleep apnea platform. You may have seen some recent U.S. regulatory filings that we made for our next generation, flow generator platform called the AirSense 11. Clearly, there are multiple steps in the process to bring this new platform to global markets and these public regulatory filings are simply one important step. But we are making good progress. Earlier this month, we started a limited controlled product launch of the AirSense 11 in certain parts of the United States. We expect to move to a broader commercial launch of the platform later this calendar year in the U.S. and then to country markets worldwide in sequence after that. For now I can say that as a personal user of our CPAP therapy, I have firsthand knowledge that the AirSense 11 device will benefit patients and their bed partners. And our early data show that the device and software platform combination will benefit physicians, providers, payers and beyond, and ultimately continue to catalyze ResMed's global leadership in digital health solutions for sleep apnea and then also accelerate our success in digital health solutions for COPD, asthma and other chronic diseases. We make the smallest, quietest, smartest and the most comfortable devices on the market. Importantly, they are all cloud connectable with the latest and greatest digital health technology to increase adherence, improve clinical outcomes, and deliver proven cost reductions within our customers on health care systems. Let me turn now to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million COPD or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and the 340 million asthma patients worldwide. Our goal is to reach more patients with our core respiratory care solutions including both non invasive ventilation and life support ventilation, as well as newer therapeutic areas, such as cloud connected pharmaceutical drugs delivery devices and high flow therapy devices. Our respiratory care business benefited in the March 2020 quarter as we sold incremental ventilator devices and ventilation mask solutions to meet growing demand worldwide as a result of the pandemic. During the March 2021 quarter COVID related ventilator sales were not material to the global business. However, we are seeing some demand in select countries affected by these latest COVID surges, such as just this month with the surge in India. And we're getting many 1000s of devices to those in need, the demand is there in that country. But as in Q3, we do not expect the revenue to be material to our global business. Even though the broader impact particularly with preservation in life in these countries is clearly priceless, and incredibly important to not only our local team in India, but to all of us here at ResMed worldwide. Demand for our core non invasive ventilator and life support ventilator solutions for COPD and other respiratory insufficiency are experiencing the same steady recovery in new patient flow as in sleep apnea. We are balancing the growth in patient demand there with the supply of ventilators that we made to the market throughout 2020 as customers balance their inventory and their core ongoing patient needs. We continue to see rapid adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe in the midst of the pandemic this time a year ago. We are now seeing that this technology has expanded to regions around the world. The value being provided through this cloud-based software solution has been fruitful not only during the COVID pandemic and the peak parts of the crisis, but it's also valuable on an ongoing value basis for physicians as well as the healthcare systems they operate in. We are helping to ensure that digital health is now the new standard of care for respiratory care. Let me now review our software as a service business for out-of-hospital care. During the quarter our SAAS business grew in the mid single digits year-on-year across our portfolio of markets. The verticals include home medical equipment, Brightree HME, skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, private duty home care, home infusion, senior living and life planned communities. Our HME customers are leveraging our advanced resupply solutions, including SNAP technology and Brightree resupply for our existing portfolio of patients. And they are contributing to ongoing growth as the flow of new patients in HME continues to recover steadily period by period. Over the past 12 months COVID-19 has had a dampening effect on elective and emergent procedures at hospitals as we all know, and that has slowed hospital discharge rates affecting patient flow and ultimately, the centers rates at skilled nursing facilities home health, hospice and beyond. As the rate of vaccinations accelerate across the U.S. and the number of COVID-19 cases continues to trend downward in this country, we're seeing improvements in the census rates across skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, and across all post acute care settings. In addition to the solid organic growth that we're seeing in our SaaS business, we closed an exciting acquisition just this month. The company is called Citus Health. Citus is a digital health leader specializing in patient engagement solutions for home infusion and specialty pharmacy, as well as the home health and hospice markets. Citus enhances the patient experience and it also improves provider efficiency and reduces the workload for frontline clinicians and caregivers. We are excited to have the Citus team as part of the ResMed family of solutions and to leverage their digital collaboration and patient support platform in our mission to improve patients lives outside the hospital. I'm very impressed by the breadth and depth of talent at Citus and their passion for patient care. This goes from their CEO, and co-founder, all the way to the front line. We're very excited to have them join our team and we will be better together. As we look across our portfolio solutions for Brightree to MatrixCare to now Citus, including HME, specialty pharmacy, home infusion, skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, senior living, life plan communities and private duty home care. We expect this portfolio, this SAAS portfolio of revenue growth to accelerate, increasing for mid single digit growth that we saw in this quarter to high single digit growth as we move forward. As always, our goal is to meet or beat these sort of market average growth rates and we continue to take share across the verticals that we're in. We also see opportunity to drive growth through further acquisitions that will augment and add to our existing portfolio of solutions. Our offerings are very well received in each of these verticals and we continue to see and leverage analytics and the technology that we have across our core business and the SAAS business to help people age in place, and minimize or eliminate acute care episodes. Looking at the broader ResMed portfolio of business across sleep, and respiratory care as well as our software as a service solutions, we remain confident in our long term strategy and our pipeline of innovative solutions. Our mission to improve lives, drives and motivates with millions across the world every day. COVID has highlighted and continues to highlight the importance of respiratory health and respiratory hygiene. It is highlighted also the importance of digital health and remote care. And it has also accelerated awareness and adoption of technologies that can be used for remote patient, screening, diagnosis, setup, as well as remote patient management and monitoring. We've continued to invest aggressively in R&D and innovation to ensure our solutions are best-in-class and are a catalyst for future growth. With 1.5 billion people around the world suffering from sleep apnea, COPD and asthma combined, we see incredible opportunities for greater identification, enrollment, and engagement of people with our digital health pathways. We are relentlessly driving innovation and development to provide the scale needed to expand the impact of this technology across the 140 countries that we operate in. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude for more than 7,500 ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication during these most unusual circumstances these last 15 months. This team has helped save the lives literally of many hundreds of 1000s of people around the world with ventilators. With these emergency needs. The team has now rapidly pivoted back to our core markets and our core purpose of helping people with sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma. And for all those who need world-class care delivered well away from the hospital, and preferably in their own home. Thank you. With that, I will now hand the call over to Brent in Sydney. And then we will move to Q&A. Brett, over to you.\nBrett Sandercock: Great. Thanks Mick. In my remarks today I will provide an overview of our results of the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 and comment on our FY 2022 outlook. Unless noted, all comparison are to the prior year quarter. Great revenue for the last quarter was $769 million, which is consistent with the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms revenue decreased by 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Consistent with our prediction during the Q2 earnings call, we drew off negligible incremental revenue from COVID-19 related demand in the March quarter, where their prior year to revenue included an incremental benefits from COVID-19 we've added sales of approximately $35 million. Excluding the impact, they actually carry FY 2021 revenue increased by 1% in constant currency terms. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business, a 1000 us Canada and Latin America countries were $403 million, an increase in 2%. Prior to Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $272 million, a decrease of 5% or a decrease of 13% in constant glassy terms. By product segment, U.S. Canada and Latin America device sales were 193 million, a decrease of 2%. Mask and other sales with 210 million an increase of 7%. Europe, Asia and other markets, the cost sales totaled $173 million, a decrease of 11% or in constant currency terms, 18% decrease. Now, when I was out in Europe, Asia and other markets were 99 million an increase of 9% or flat year over year in constant currency terms. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales decreased by 10%, while masks and other sales increased by 4%. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 related sales in the prior year quarter, Global device sales declined by 3% in constant currency terms, while masks and other sales increased by 6% in constant currency terms. Software as a service revenue for the third quarter was $94 million, an increase of 5% than the prior year quarter. During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We've provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin decreased by 40 basis points to 59.6% in the March quarter compared to 60% in the same quarter last year. The interest is predominantly attributable to higher freight costs, additional manufacturing costs associated with the transition to our new Singapore site we'll commenced operations during the quarter, and geographic mix changes. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the third quarter were $160 million, a decrease of 7% or in constant currency term SG&A expenses decreased by 11% compared to the prior year period. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 20.9% compared to the 22.4% we reported in the prior year quarter, benefiting from cost management and reduced travel as a result of COVID-19 restrictions. Looking forward, we expect SG&A expenses in Q4 FY 2021 to increase in the low single digit relative to the prior year period. R&D expenses for the quarter were $56 million, an increase of 9% or in constant currency basis, an increase of 3%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.3% compared to 6.7% in the prior year. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses in Q4 to increase year-over-year in the high single digits reflecting our long term commitment to innovation. Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $18 million for the quarter and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $16 million. Our Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $242 million, an increase of 2%, reflecting well contained operating expenses. For the March quarter, we estimated and recorded an accounting tax reserves of $255 million, which is net of credits and deductions for a proposed settlement and third-party audits by the Australian Taxation Office, or ATO. The audits covered tax year 2009 to 2018 [ph], as previously disclosed for 2009 to 2013. The OTO issued assessment of $256 million inclusive of penalties and interest. The 2014 to 2018 year audits remain open, ongoing and assessments have not been issued. We have tentatively agreed on a number with the ATO to resolve the entire matter for all years. We expect any adjustments to reserve will be taking this quarter would be material. Next steps include getting to a written agreement and final Board approval. If the deal falls apart, we will wait to get. We continue to believe we are more likely than not to succeed in litigation. However, transfer pricing litigation is complex, costly and uncertain. So we are looking forward to putting this behind us. As a result of reporting reserve on a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for March quarter was 136%. While our non GAAP basis, which excludes the reserve, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.4%. Looking forward, we estimate our underlying non-GAAP FY 2021 effective tax rate will be in the range of 17% to 19%. Our Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $190 million, an increase of 1%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.30, an increase of 1%. As a result of the tax reserve recorded this quarter, our GAAP net loss for the quarter was $78 million and our GAAP diluted loss per share for the quarter was $0.54. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $196 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings, partly offset by increases in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $26 million. Depreciation and amortization for the March quarter total $40 million. During the quarter we paid dividends of $57 million. We recorded equity losses of $5 million in our income statement in the last quarter associated with Verily joint venture. And going forward we expect to record equity losses in the range of $3 million to $5 million per quarter associated with the Verily joint venture. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $231 million. At March 31, we had $734 million in gross debt, and $503 million in net debt. Our debt levels remain modest and in March 31, we had a further $1.5 billion available for drawdown under existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. During the third quarter we completed the acquisition of Citus Health. Citus Health is a digital health leader specializing in patient engagement solutions that enable real time secure collaboration between patients and those involved in the care. We also acquired certain business assets of Tongil Medical company based in Korea, which primarily represented Tongil's sleep and respiratory distribution business. Both these acquisitions will not be material to our group results. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, reflecting the board's confidence in our strong liquidity position and operating performance. Our solid cash flow and liquidity providing flexibility in how we allocate capital. During the pandemic we have focused on paying down debt. Going forward, we plan to continue to invest for growth through R&D. We will also likely continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions like Cypress Hill. We intend to continue to return cash to shareholders through our dividend program. We may also resume our share buyback program sometime during the calendar year. This program has been on board since our acquisitions of MatrixCare and Propeller Health in fiscal year 2019. Turning now there are expectations on the outlook for Q4, FY 2021 and FY 2022 outlook, The remains uncertainty in the short term particularly interdicting the timing and recovery of the patient flow from COVID-19 related impacts across the many countries we operate in. Consequently, we expect Q4 FY 2021 revenue to reflect low single digit sequential growth over Q3 FY 2021. As we move through FY 2022, we expect to see continued improving in new patient flow and return to more normal I underline revenue growth trends. Additionally, we are seeing minimal COVID-19 generating demand for our ventilators. And do not expect that any material benefit going forward. As a reminder, we recorded 35 million COVID-19 generating revenue in a March last quarter last year, $125 million at June quarter last year, and $40 million in our first quarter of FY 2021. Mask and accessories has continued to demonstrate resilience and growth over the past three months reflecting the insulating value of the large patient installed base and the success of every supply service offering. We expect to see continued year on year growth of their mask sell in FY 2022. Finally, like many, many other companies, we continue to experience significant uncertainty in the current environment, particularly in relation to the timing of the reopening of economies if the vaccination programs rolled out. As a result, our forecast and possible future revenue outcomes remain dynamic. And with that, I'll hand call back to Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great, thanks, Brett. Saline, I'd like to now turn the call over to you to provide instructions and then run the Q&A portion of the call. Saline, are you there, ready to run the QA portion of the call.\nOperator: Excuse me, this is the backup operator. We have a question coming from the line of Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nLyanne Harrison: Good morning all, and thank you for taking my question. Perhaps I could start with and rest to the world or outside of the United States in America in terms of the device trends you're seeing there. Certainly down 18% on constant currency. Could you help split in terms of what you're seeing in terms of real devices decline without the COVID impact there? And then also, particularly for Germany and France, what you're seeing in that market currently, and what sort of rate it's offering as a percentage of normal, particularly given the increased COVID cases in those countries?\nMick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Lyanne. And clearly as I said in the prepared remarks, the March 2020, $35 million worth of ventilators were primarily where COVID was impacting them, which was Southwest China, and so probably Hubei province and Northern Italy. So China and Italy. And so clearly, the $35 million worth of sales in the March quarter last year, were predominantly in that rest of world category. So, you can imagine that the actual decline in terms of the COVID impact on year-on-year is significantly below that 18% cc that you talked about, much further below that. And really importantly, when you look at the sort of kinetics of this, and you think about the December quarter to the March quarter, and then what we're going to see in June, we're seeing countries opening up. They're adopting digital health and they're finding ways to make it work. And even in France and Germany where you didn't see lockdowns in the retail side, the healthcare was not as impacted. And our digital health solutions, particularly around remote patient screening diagnosis have been effective. And so, we're seeing that open up as we move forward. Rob, do you want to take the second part of the question?\nRob Douglas: Yes. The Germany and France?\nMick Farrell: Yes.\nRob Douglas: The challenge in Germany and France really in this quarter has been sort of the second waves, which really caused extensive lockdowns and put challenges in there. We had seen sort of incremental opening up, that actually slowed down. It wasn't quite as significant as before, where we really saw all of the sleep labs get converted into COVID wards. But we certainly saw a reduction in new patient flow in most countries as well, there's been a significant issue. In terms of actually breaking out the sort of the device sales in those specific countries without the COVID impact earlier, and I don't think we'll be able to give that sort of granularity to really clarify that for you. But underlying it, we need to understand that those sleep businesses continued, and also you're probably aware that ventilation businesses in Europe are a larger share than what they are with the ResMed business and what they are in terms of the global ResMed business. So there was a factor in that in terms of the relativity to what had happened with the incremental COVID ventilator sales in the previous period.\nLyanne Harrison: Thank you very much.\nRob Douglas: Thanks, Lyanne.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Gretel Janu with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nGretel Janu: Thanks. Good morning. Just firstly on U.S. devices. What was the performance of underlying CPAP devices next COVID? I'm assuming, there was very limited COVID ventilator sales in the prior year. So I guess when we compare this last quarter, was actually much weaker. So is that because there's less patients coming through the sleep labs? Or were there potentially market share losses? Can you explain what happened from a sequential performance between last quarter and this quarter? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Gretel. Good question. And if you look at just U.S., Canada, Latin America, so the Americas numbers, devices were down 2% year-on-year. And if you think about what we're talking about the COVID recovery rates being somewhere between 70% of pre COVID patient flow to 90% of recovered patient flow depending on the country. If you just do that raw math there, that comes out to 98% of pre-COVID, basically, which is not quite there, because there are some replacement devices included there. But certainly, we actually saw very steady market share, some gains in some of the mask areas, but very steady market share in the device side. Some of our competitors are having some difficulties around supply, as well as our global supply chains and other factors going on. We may have even taken some share in the device side. So, what we're seeing just in those U.S. numbers, when you think about sequential from the December to March quarter is really all about, as I said in the prepared remarks around deductibles, resetting those deductibles and impact devices significantly more than masks and accessories. If you look at the masks and accessories, just in that quarter, we saw 7% constant currency growth in masks and accessories in the March quarter year-on-year. But always there's a sequential impact from December to March. And so that's the net. But no actually share very steady, maybe moving up a little on the mask side, very steady on the devices with some modest gains. But the year-on-year 2% decline in devices is truly around the COVID recovery rates. And as we know, the rollout in the U.S. has actually been pretty strong in terms of the vaccinations. I don't think we're quite at the 98%, which would mean, that 2% decline could indicate. But I do think that we are moving well towards the 90% range in some states, and the sort of 80% range and some other states of pre COVID patients flow. But every period we look at, we see improvement in both of those. Thanks for the question Gretel.\nGretel Janu: Thanks very much.\nOperator: We have a next question coming in from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is open.\nMargaret Kaczor: Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. You guys mentioned that -- I believe one point in the comments that you expect to return to that double digit underlined growth in the second half of fiscal 2022. And then you were kind enough to give us a series of free instances, while [Indiscernible] suggests will go on the offensive. But the question is, how quickly can those investments take hold? And as you look at the short term, will growth still remain on the bottom of that you shaped that you discussed previously until you get to that second half of the fiscal year? Or can there be meaningful, more meaningful improvements driven by some of these investments? Sorry, I know, it's a long question. But can the U.S. for example, even being further ahead on the vaccination curve actually help you guys and offset maybe some other geographies that are a little weaker? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Yes. Thanks Margaret. That is a very good question and a thorough one. Look, clearly, we're very confident that the medium to long term of the core business is incredible, given the flow of patients and the flow of our new technology. There are short term dynamics around second and third waves, and then the vaccinations on the positive side and the opening up of the economies on the positive side. As we put it all together, we are very confident that as we get the AirSense 11 from control product launch, to then start to roll that out over this calendar year in the U.S. market, that will be a catalyst for growth. It brings not only the hardware, but also amazing software solutions for patients, physicians, providers, and others. And as we think about the scaling of just the remote patient, digital health models from some of our partners, and identification, engagement and enrollment, all the way through to home sleep, testing and home sleep set up and rolling out of those devices, we're seeing a lot of investments start to pay off on that. So look, it's really hard to get down to the dynamics of how quickly vaccines will go. How quickly economies will open up. But here in the U.S., which is our biggest market, we're certainly seeing both of those trend in a really positive manner. And that led me to talk about pretty bullish sort of double digit growth towards the back end of our fiscal year 2022. And so, I think they're all the dynamics going into it. I don't know Jim Hollings, if you've got any further thoughts as the President of our Sleep and Respiratory Care Business about how quickly we can use that technology to drive growth towards that back end.\nJames Hollings: Yes. Thanks, Mick, and thanks, Margaret, for the question. I really just would reiterate what Mick says. I think that when you think about growth, when we get back to double digit growth, the numbers were against the big comps that came out COVID, right? So when you think about growth as a percentage. And so, the underlying dynamic in the market and U.S. specific about the U.S. market, it\u2019s pretty strong. March was the best month of the quarter for us in new patient growth than the U.S. market. And so we think that that trend is going to continue. And we're very hopeful about vaccine rollouts. We'll start to open up diagnostics. And of course, we have the new product that will come out in the calendar year. So we feel very confident about the underlying cores, the business continuing to grow over the coming quarters. And then we'll be able to not just maintain share, but probably take some share. But there's obviously some uncertainty associated with COVID, and some other things where we feel very confident for underlying growth dynamic, and it's the COVID comp that has to clear for us to be able to talk about double digit growth.\nMargaret Kaczor: Okay. Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Margaret.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Matthew Mishan with Keybanc. Your line is open.\nMatthew Mishan: Great. Hello, Mick, thanks for the questions. I listened to the HCA calls, which is a theater [ph] large hospital system in the U.S. They seem to be integrating in hospice and home health into their systems at this point. And you've seen like Cerner not really want to follow up the hospital customers down. How can you work with large hospital systems as they migrate down into your victim to scale?\nMick Farrell: Matt, it\u2019s a great question, and it talks to within our software as a service business, obviously, we have privacy, we have cyber security, but then we have interoperability. And interoperability making sure our data can through secure Private API's be able to interact with hospital care systems, is an incredibly important part of the system. We call an out-of-hospital healthcare, because we don't believe you have to go to hospital to get good health care, but the hospital systems call it post acute care. And that link between post acute care and out-of-hospital care has to be very secure and has to be very seamless, if you like for the patient and for the healthcare system. We're now many quarters into our Cerner partnership and what we've shown in that to our partner there, Cerner is that ResMed is a great recipient of patient from the hospital system into both home health and hospice and beyond now into infusion with that partnership. And I think we've got a sort of a track record, that ResMed can take care of those patients and make sure that there's a seamless transition from hospital to the out-of-hospital healthcare network. And so, with that proven track record, I look to their customers, those sort of Cerner, Epic and Allscripts, their customers being HCA and others, as HCA sort of broadens their holistic care if you like, our patients from hospital to the home, that's an opportunity for those providers to partner with someone like ResMed. So there's the seamless transfer of the patients. Look, the ultimate goal is that we take costs out of the system. We take care of the patient better. And we have seamless transfer from hospital to home or out-of-hospital care. And then hopefully not but if you do go back to the hospital, that record can move back and forwards very well. We've got a good track record of it. And I actually see a lot of upside, as hospital systems think holistically in that sort of ACO sort of Accountable Care Organization approach. And we've got a lot of experience in Western Europe, in patients taking care of holistically throughout Northern Europe and beyond. So I'm confident that we will do well in this evolution of sort of an acute care system or sick care system to a true healthcare system and a preventative health care system, which is where ResMed best 90 plus percent of our revenues and profits, and really with the SAAS business, it's where we are the only strategic with the capability to scale not just across the U.S., but globally.\nMatthew Mishan: Thank you.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Mike Matson with Needham and Company. Your line is open.\nMike Matson: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the AirSense 11. Is there anything more you can tell us about that product and how it compares to AirSense 10. And then, historically, when you've launched new for generic platforms, it has had a fairly sizable impact on your growth, at least on the device side. So is there any reason to believe that that won't happen with this? And then, similar question on the cost. Is this going to be a higher, I guess a lower cost of manufacturing slash higher gross margin product? What just ramps up, obviously? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Yes, Thanks, Mike. Great question with three great parts to it. So the first part, the AirSense 11 is out there. It's in control product launch. As I said, in the prepared remarks, I'm personally part of that CPL. And just amazing benefits for the individual patient and the bed partner in terms of how quiet comfortable cloud connected and capabilities. So the features are extraordinary. One thing, we've opened up to the most we ever have around the pipeline that is out there, because there's a public regulatory documents out there, and it's in CPL. I don't want to go through all the features and functions other than to say that, but it's smaller, it's quieter, it's more comfortable, it's more cloud connected. And it's not just the device, it's the software system that goes with it that provides a value for not just the patient, but the physician, the provider, and the healthcare system that are part of it. So, to the second part in question around growth, yes, look, I do think this will be a catalyst for growth. That\u2019s why I'm comfortable in the prepbox [ph]. And you answered to Gretel earlier to talk about our comfort in saying, we're going to push towards double digit growth for the back end of this fiscal year that we're in here. And I think this device will be a catalyst for it. I think the software, the digital health technology software around it will be a large part of that catalyst for growth. Obviously, we're a different business than, when I was running the Sleaford, we launched the S9. It was, I think the total revenues of the company were less than a billion dollars. And now the total revenues are over $3 billion, trailing 12 months. And so, the percentage growth, the numbers won't be as impressive as 10 years ago, but the growth in terms of net revenue and profitability, we can reinvest in the business for more devices and less software will certainly be there. The third party question around cost. Clearly our goal, every generation is to create smaller, quieter, more comfortable, more clever devices and software systems, but also ones that have better efficiency. So we lower cost of manufacturing low cost to our supply chain. So clearly, that's an important part of this platform. We expect to do that, as he said, as we scale that up across our global business.\nMike Matson: Thank you.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of David Low with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nDavid Low: Thanks very much. Mick, we are all aware that Philips had the issue with their devices. Just wondering what your expectations are? One, if we can clarify whether there's any risks that ResMed has the same issue with ozone cleaning? And then secondly, what the implications might be for ResMed position in the market?\nMick Farrell: Yes, Thanks, David. And we clearly saw from the earnings call from our competitors, some issues that they're having with product quality. And I never comment on details of that. And I think all of us care most of all about our patients. And so, Rob, you want to talk a little bit to our quality standards and what we're working on as we look at that issue?\nRob Douglas: Sure. Yes, David, as Mick said, patient Safety is our number one priority, and we really focus on that. And we've actually paid a lot of attention to the timing devices over the years. And I can confidently say, we actually don't have this problem that has been reported by competitors. We have a different design using different materials. And we have a very solid test, aggressive testing procedure looking at this. We have a very sophisticated complaint tracking system, and across our 40 million installed base, we -- this is just not there at all. So we're extremely confident with that. We do -- we will always continue to pay close attention to patient safety and keep on it. The issue of ozone cleaning is an issue there. And we have communicated regarding our warranty position on that. It's an effective disinfectant, but the amount of use is important to keep a close eye on. So we've publicly put out information on that. And you can find that on our website, if you're interested in that. So, but we'll keep a close, very close eye on this as we would with any industry safety issue.\nDavid Low: Okay. Thanks very much.\nMick Farrell: Thanks. David, actually does the second part of your question talks about what would be the implications in the market? I mean, clearly, I don't know if Jim Hollings wants to talk to this. But look, we want to take share when our products are smaller, quieter, more comfortable and better. And we've been doing that for three decades. But clearly, they might be some share implications if a competitor has constraints around supply. Jim, do you want to talk a little bit to that?\nJames Hollings: Sure. I think we're waiting to see what will happen with our competitors position and their ability to deliver product, but we're obviously always ready, willing and able to help our customers and more product. And to whatever extent there's potential upside for us and market share gains during the next quarter or two, and that we'll certainly do our best to take advantage of it.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSean Laaman: Thank you. And good morning, Mick. Good morning, everybody. Mick, even just in broad brushstrokes to answer this question. We've seen, I guess, one of the better term the finale of competitive bidding, and it shape many, in its proposed shaped many months ago. I'm wondering if that's had any influence or what influenced that might have had with respect to pricing since that point in time?\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Sean. That's a great question. And I'll hand back to James Hollings to talk about whether the elimination of competitive bidding pretty much in terms of delight in 2024 has any implications for pricing with us without the U.S. customers. Jim, do you want to take that?\nJames Hollings: Yes, sure. Thanks. Thanks for the question. Competitive bidding being cancelled led to ongoing stability in the pricing in the U.S. market, and that's what we see. There's instability in pricing throughout the period, because there's stability of reimbursement. And we -- but far, we haven't seen any signals from CMS that they intend to relaunch a program. So it's a weird way to answer the question, but the non event lesson a little changes, we've just seen price instability.\nSean Laaman: Great. Thanks. Awesome. Appreciate the answer.\nMick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Sean.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Andrew Goodsall with MST Macquarie. Your line is open.\nAndrew Goodsall: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I'm just going to touch back on your SAAS business. I know a few questions on this particular MatrixCare. But just trying to think in practical terms, how quickly we can sort of see that come back to certainly a lot of commentary in the marketplace that there's a big swing on the back of COVID to home delivery care in the home. So yes, just trying to sort of think just over the next sort of quarter how you're seeing the profile, that recovery?\nMick Farrell: Yes, Andrew, thanks. It's a great question. And there are so many dynamics of hospital care and in the flow out through post acute care to our SAAS system. I think, as we look forward, we saw 5% growth in the quarter across our SAAS business. We think the weighted average market growth across those seven or now eight verticals that we're in with Citus joining the portfolio, and specialty pharmacy and home infusion. We think that sort of mid single digit growth can move towards high single digit growth as we see patients get back to the hospital and therefore get back to the discharged to skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, and beyond. And so, it's difficult to say the exact rate of increase, but it's going to increase. And I think our technology and what we've invested in, particularly, even during COVID, some of the software that we put for our skilled nursing facility customers to manage patients who may or may not be infected by COVID, and how they operate their businesses have been very well received. So even as case rates declined, but COVID is still here, and it is still across, even with vaccinations going up, still going to impact those customers. I think some of those tools will help us see a faster path to getting from that mid single digit growth to high single digit growth across the group. And as I said in the prep remarks, and this is true for ResMed always. We don't just want to meet market growth, we want to beat that market growth. So, as I look towards our long term strategy and 2025, we've got the opportunity for to get way back to double digit growth in our SAAS business. But in the short to medium term, I think we can move from mid single digits to high single digits in this part of our portfolio. We've made the investments in the technology. We've made the investments for the customers to help them deal with the dynamics of code. And as recovery happens, we will be a partner for them for growth on the other side.\nAndrew Goodsall: That's great. Thank you.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Suraj Kalia with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nSuraj Kalia: Hi, Mick. Brett, can you hear me, Alright?\nMick Farrell: Got you loud and clear, Suraj. Perfect.\nSuraj Kalia: So, Mick, couple of questions. And I'll just kind of put them together. Mick, I'm not sure I heard about the EHR 2 report. Would love to get you a perspective from a counter messaging perspective and any quantification of impact? And the second part of my question, Mick, if I could, the SAAS business, there was a period of time that it was a tailwind to margins to top line growth. And just kind of looking at it over the last, let's say, four or so quarters, it seems to be becoming a drag for the overall growth, some of these COVID issues notwithstanding, maybe you can just kind of parse this through the structural dynamics of returning this line item to what you would have perceived as normalized growth? Thank you for taking my questions.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Suraj. I'll hand the first question to Dave on AHRQ. And then I'll take the second one on SAAS.\nDavid Pendarvis: Yes. Thanks, Suraj. And I'll give you this kind of a brief response here. If you want any more details, feel free to reach out to Amy, and she can bring you up to speed. But basically, AHRQ, we believe is taking a very narrow perspective on looking at the clinical literature, looking at only randomized controlled trials done under certain very careful criteria. And while traditionally, that has been the hallmark of the gold standard of trials, we think, particularly in this industry, where you've got a massive amount of real world evidence and a lot of other longitudinal trials that clearly demonstrate a benefits in terms of longevity, benefits in terms of clinically significant cardiovascular outcomes, also quality of life outcomes, and also outcomes in terms of healthcare utilization, lower costs, all of that evidence ought to be used to come to a conclusion that treating sleep apnea with CPAP therapy is not only good for patients, but good for the healthcare systems, and good for economies as a whole. So, we're hopeful that all that evidence that we've brought in, and it's not just us, other societies, many of the clinical societies have come out. And there's been a vigorous sort of a cross industry wide cross clinical, academic, keeping leaders have all come out in the same direction. So we're hopeful that will be taken into account. And the final report, which we don't know when it'll be even likely, perhaps later this calendar year, we'll include that data and come to a better conclusion.\nMick Farrell: So Suraj, the only thing I'd add to Dave's response, which is very thorough, is that actually there are RCTs randomized control trials but also are excellent that weren't included. So if you're just looking at RCTs, even, you need to include some of those RCTs, which were in fact very positive. And the AHRQ just looked at some neutral RCTs and said, well, neutral that means no benefit. There's all these other proponents of evidence real world and RCTs that are positive. So, it was an interesting some section of the literature that they used. And we have lots of folks ask at academics working on that. On a second party question, SAAS, if you look at, it actually was a strong tailwind for us in this quarter, 5% growth versus the COVID included core part of the business. And I think it can be. As we look forward, and I spoke to this earlier in my answer to Andrew, about SAAS, going from mid single digits to high single digits, I think it can -- and then after meeting or beating that, so getting to double digit growth, in the SAAS part of our business, I do think that will become a tailwind for us that 12% of our revenue. So for the SAAS, as we get out of, the COVID, sort of slowdown of census rates in this out-of-hospital care, we get back to a normal flow of patients through. Because people are wanting to age in place, people are wanting to be outside the hospital. COVID just increase. The probability that people do not want to be in a hospital for any longer than they need to. And so I think the geographic and socio economic trends of a growing community and people wanting to age in place in an aging population, and the fact that people are seeing lower cost, lower acuity and better healthcare delivered outside the hospital all lead towards this. The dynamics of how quickly we go from mid single digit growth to high single digit growth, we can divide. But the fact is, it's going to go there, because people are moving from the hospital to out-of-hospital healthcare. And that's where we're investing. So, as I look forward to our long term strategy 2025, I am very confident that this will be a very strong tailwind to our business. The recovery of our whole business post COVID is what we're talking about here. But I look on the end of the FY 2022, strong double digit growth across our business. And I mean that across our whole business. Thanks for the questions, Suraj.\nOperator: We have our last question coming from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nAnthony Petrone: Thanks. Maybe just to follow up on the SAAS business and kind of going between Brightree and, and Matrix here. On the Brightree side, there was some consolidation in HME space through 2020. And just wonder if that is cycling through the numbers there. And in sort of how that plays out. But when sort of when we think of course, lead trends, if you could provide maybe a quick update on sleep labs in particular, I know, it's a small portion of the overall business. But it sounds like there could be a reversal in activity as folks actually get back to sleep labs. So just sort of an update on sleep labs? Thanks a lot.\nMick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the questions. Anthony. To your first part of question around SAAS. Yes, I mean, clearly there's consolidation of some plays in the HME industry, and that can impact our contracts with those. In general SAAS is per user per month, like per activating user per month approach. And so, acquisitions are -- HME acquiring another HME that doesn't currently use Brightree. Is actually upside for us, because usually, the acquiring entity has all the efficiencies and scale and capabilities, because they using Brightree, and then they put that into the acquired account. And so therefore, actually increased the number of users and the per user per month revenue for ResMed can be upside on that. If it's a Brightree user acquiring another Brightree user, well, then there can be some reduction, they might get some efficiencies and reductions of the number of chairs. But ultimately, if it's a smart customer it\u2019s going to continue to grow. And so then that over time, as they grow will increase our revenues as part of that. So a lot of dynamics around the M&A there. But in general, in the long run for us, it's about us betting on the winning and efficient ATMs and Brightree helps us do that. Because the people who adopt Brightree other winners, they have the lowest costs and the best outcomes for their patients. So the second part of your question around sleep labs, I look over capacity here in the U.S., and the reduction that happens during COVID or in lab tests, those people scale their digital health solutions in their home sleep testing capability. So as they come back and open up the in-lab facilities, I think that will absolutely have a rebound of the capacity in the in-labs, but they won't lose what they gained in home sleep testing. As Aristotle said, when the mind is stretched by a new idea, it never returns to its original size. So they're not going to forget about these great digital health solutions that have the home sleep testing. So yes, we'll get the capacity back in the sleep lab. But I also think the scalable opportunity for those sleep diagnostics providers to provide low cost, customer friendly diagnostics and the home will be just a part of their portfolio and hopefully, will improve the rate of diagnosing the 936 million people worldwide. But we're just looking at the U.S., the 70 million people in this country that have mild, severe obstructive sleep apnea that need to be taken care of. Thanks for the question, Anthony. And I'll hand back to you, Amy to close up the call.\nAmy Wakeham: Thanks, Mick. Did you want to give your closing remarks?\nMick Farrell: Sure. Yes. But I know we're nine minutes over. So I'll make this brief. Thanks again to all our shareholders for joining us on the call. I'd like to thanks once again, the 7,500 ResMedians, many of you, shareholders, thank you for your hard work, dedication, helping people sleep better, breathe better, around 140 countries worldwide. Thank you for the many 1000s of enlightens. You're getting right now to our team in India. So that we can take care of people in this another emergency. I look forward to talking to you and to all of our shareholders here again in 90 days. Thanks.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Mick. And thank you all again for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and your time. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out directly. This does conclude our call. Salini, you may now close out the call.\nOperator: This concludes ResMed's third quarter of fiscal year 2021 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brett Sandercock",
            "content": "Great. Thanks Mick. In my remarks today I will provide an overview of our results of the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 and comment on our FY 2022 outlook. Unless noted, all comparison are to the prior year quarter. Great revenue for the last quarter was $769 million, which is consistent with the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms revenue decreased by 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Consistent with our prediction during the Q2 earnings call, we drew off negligible incremental revenue from COVID-19 related demand in the March quarter, where their prior year to revenue included an incremental benefits from COVID-19 we've added sales of approximately $35 million. Excluding the impact, they actually carry FY 2021 revenue increased by 1% in constant currency terms. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business, a 1000 us Canada and Latin America countries were $403 million, an increase in 2%. Prior to Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $272 million, a decrease of 5% or a decrease of 13% in constant glassy terms. By product segment, U.S. Canada and Latin America device sales were 193 million, a decrease of 2%. Mask and other sales with 210 million an increase of 7%. Europe, Asia and other markets, the cost sales totaled $173 million, a decrease of 11% or in constant currency terms, 18% decrease. Now, when I was out in Europe, Asia and other markets were 99 million an increase of 9% or flat year over year in constant currency terms. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales decreased by 10%, while masks and other sales increased by 4%. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 related sales in the prior year quarter, Global device sales declined by 3% in constant currency terms, while masks and other sales increased by 6% in constant currency terms. Software as a service revenue for the third quarter was $94 million, an increase of 5% than the prior year quarter. During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We've provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin decreased by 40 basis points to 59.6% in the March quarter compared to 60% in the same quarter last year. The interest is predominantly attributable to higher freight costs, additional manufacturing costs associated with the transition to our new Singapore site we'll commenced operations during the quarter, and geographic mix changes. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the third quarter were $160 million, a decrease of 7% or in constant currency term SG&A expenses decreased by 11% compared to the prior year period. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 20.9% compared to the 22.4% we reported in the prior year quarter, benefiting from cost management and reduced travel as a result of COVID-19 restrictions. Looking forward, we expect SG&A expenses in Q4 FY 2021 to increase in the low single digit relative to the prior year period. R&D expenses for the quarter were $56 million, an increase of 9% or in constant currency basis, an increase of 3%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.3% compared to 6.7% in the prior year. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses in Q4 to increase year-over-year in the high single digits reflecting our long term commitment to innovation. Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $18 million for the quarter and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $16 million. Our Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $242 million, an increase of 2%, reflecting well contained operating expenses. For the March quarter, we estimated and recorded an accounting tax reserves of $255 million, which is net of credits and deductions for a proposed settlement and third-party audits by the Australian Taxation Office, or ATO. The audits covered tax year 2009 to 2018 [ph], as previously disclosed for 2009 to 2013. The OTO issued assessment of $256 million inclusive of penalties and interest. The 2014 to 2018 year audits remain open, ongoing and assessments have not been issued. We have tentatively agreed on a number with the ATO to resolve the entire matter for all years. We expect any adjustments to reserve will be taking this quarter would be material. Next steps include getting to a written agreement and final Board approval. If the deal falls apart, we will wait to get. We continue to believe we are more likely than not to succeed in litigation. However, transfer pricing litigation is complex, costly and uncertain. So we are looking forward to putting this behind us. As a result of reporting reserve on a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for March quarter was 136%. While our non GAAP basis, which excludes the reserve, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.4%. Looking forward, we estimate our underlying non-GAAP FY 2021 effective tax rate will be in the range of 17% to 19%. Our Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $190 million, an increase of 1%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.30, an increase of 1%. As a result of the tax reserve recorded this quarter, our GAAP net loss for the quarter was $78 million and our GAAP diluted loss per share for the quarter was $0.54. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $196 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings, partly offset by increases in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $26 million. Depreciation and amortization for the March quarter total $40 million. During the quarter we paid dividends of $57 million. We recorded equity losses of $5 million in our income statement in the last quarter associated with Verily joint venture. And going forward we expect to record equity losses in the range of $3 million to $5 million per quarter associated with the Verily joint venture. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $231 million. At March 31, we had $734 million in gross debt, and $503 million in net debt. Our debt levels remain modest and in March 31, we had a further $1.5 billion available for drawdown under existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. During the third quarter we completed the acquisition of Citus Health. Citus Health is a digital health leader specializing in patient engagement solutions that enable real time secure collaboration between patients and those involved in the care. We also acquired certain business assets of Tongil Medical company based in Korea, which primarily represented Tongil's sleep and respiratory distribution business. Both these acquisitions will not be material to our group results. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, reflecting the board's confidence in our strong liquidity position and operating performance. Our solid cash flow and liquidity providing flexibility in how we allocate capital. During the pandemic we have focused on paying down debt. Going forward, we plan to continue to invest for growth through R&D. We will also likely continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions like Cypress Hill. We intend to continue to return cash to shareholders through our dividend program. We may also resume our share buyback program sometime during the calendar year. This program has been on board since our acquisitions of MatrixCare and Propeller Health in fiscal year 2019. Turning now there are expectations on the outlook for Q4, FY 2021 and FY 2022 outlook, The remains uncertainty in the short term particularly interdicting the timing and recovery of the patient flow from COVID-19 related impacts across the many countries we operate in. Consequently, we expect Q4 FY 2021 revenue to reflect low single digit sequential growth over Q3 FY 2021. As we move through FY 2022, we expect to see continued improving in new patient flow and return to more normal I underline revenue growth trends. Additionally, we are seeing minimal COVID-19 generating demand for our ventilators. And do not expect that any material benefit going forward. As a reminder, we recorded 35 million COVID-19 generating revenue in a March last quarter last year, $125 million at June quarter last year, and $40 million in our first quarter of FY 2021. Mask and accessories has continued to demonstrate resilience and growth over the past three months reflecting the insulating value of the large patient installed base and the success of every supply service offering. We expect to see continued year on year growth of their mask sell in FY 2022. Finally, like many, many other companies, we continue to experience significant uncertainty in the current environment, particularly in relation to the timing of the reopening of economies if the vaccination programs rolled out. As a result, our forecast and possible future revenue outcomes remain dynamic. And with that, I'll hand call back to Amy."

            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Mick, and thanks, Margaret, for the question. I really just would reiterate what Mick says. I think that when you think about growth, when we get back to double digit growth, the numbers were against the big comps that came out COVID, right? So when you think about growth as a percentage. And so, the underlying dynamic in the market and U.S. specific about the U.S. market, it's pretty strong. March was the best month of the quarter for us in new patient growth than the U.S. market. And so we think that that trend is going to continue. And we're very hopeful about vaccine rollouts. We'll start to open up diagnostics. And of course, we have the new product that will come out in the calendar year. So we feel very confident about the underlying cores, the business continuing to grow over the coming quarters. And then we'll be able to not just maintain share, but probably take some share. But there's obviously some uncertainty associated with COVID, and some other things where we feel very confident for underlying growth dynamic, and it's the COVID comp that has to clear for us to be able to talk about double digit growth. Sure. I think we're waiting to see what will happen with our competitors position and their ability to deliver product, but we're obviously always ready, willing and able to help our customers and more product. And to whatever extent there's potential upside for us and market share gains during the next quarter or two, and that we'll certainly do our best to take advantage of it. Yes, sure. Thanks.

I will review progress towards ResMed 2025 strategic goals including execution highlights against our quarterly and our annual operating priorities. A year ago, today when we discussed our March 2020 results, we were only just beginning to understand the scope of the COVID-19 pandemic. Much of business particularly in the United States had not yet been significantly impacted. However, outside the U.S., countries including China and Italy were already in the midst of emergency needs. We quickly mobilize our supply-chain and global operations to address and support ventilation needs world-wide, producing other 150,000 ventilators. We accelerate the production and distribution of noninvasive and life support ventilators in mask systems to those in need, resulting in an incremental $35 million of COVID related revenue during the March 2020 quarter. I'm incredibly proud of how we quickly pivoted business to meet that need, providing life citing solutions around the world, so that healthcare systems were prepared with the resources needed to treat patients who are fighting COVID-19. Today, one year later, the countries we operate in are various different stages of the post COVID peak recovery process in terms of getting to normal patient flow. We see a range of from 70% of pre-COVID patient flow in some countries, up to 90% of pre-COVID patient flow in other countries. Vaccines are steadily rolling out in the United States, the U.K. and many other countries worldwide. We still see significant impacts from ongoing second, third and fourth waves infection in some countries in Europe, as well as in South America and Asia. And especially right now, in the country of Brazil and particularly India. Our team is working with hospitals and healthcare providers in those two countries and beyond for preservation of life, making sure that they have ventilators, masks and the training that they need to use them. We continue to support the frontline respiratory therapists and the physicians who are there on the ground, as well as providers, patients and ResMedians throughout their 140 plus countries that we operate in. Were pleased with the steady progress that we are seeing and getting new sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patients diagnosed, excluding the $35 million of COVID related ventilator sales in the March 2020 quarter, our team delivered positive sales growth across our core sleep apnea and respiratory care business this quarter on both the headline and constant currency basis. We forecast a steady improvement trend of patient flow for sleep apnea and COPD and asthma continuing as we move through 2021 and into 2022. We expect this progress to accelerate as global vaccination rates continue. We are encouraged to see that patients, physicians and providers around the world are adopting digital health tools for remote patient screening, home-based testing, remote patient monitoring, and ongoing patient management. I'd like to be clear that the ventilation sales that we made in 2020 will be part of our comparables for the next two quarters. In the June 2020 quarter, we recognize $125 million in COVID related ventilator sales. And in September 2020 quarter, we recognized $40 million in such revenue. Over the coming quarters we expect to continue to show strong positive year-over-year revenue growth excluding these onetime sales from 2020. As we look further forward, we see a clear path to double digit revenue growth in the back half of our fiscal year 2022 across our full business, powered by opening economies and our pipeline of new technology and innovation. Our headline results were impacted this quarter by an accounting reserves. We talk in connection with discussions with the Australian Tax Office or ATR regarding their ongoing order getting back to fiscal year 2009. Brett has been leading those discussions and we'll speak to the details in his remarks. I will make this statement, ResMed pay significant taxes in countries around the world and we operate in over 140 countries helping people sleep better, breathe better and live better lives well away from the hospital. Brett and his team are working towards a final resolution of these transfer pricing discussions turning back over 12 years with the ATR. So we have taken this $255 million reserve. We believe that resolving these discussions is the pragmatic thing to do for all of our stakeholders, so that we can put this behind us and focus all of our efforts on our core mission of improving lives in respiratory medicine around the world. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, we generated over $196 million in operating cash, allowing us to return $57 million in cash dividends to shareholders. We also increased our R&D investments in the period in digital health technology, as well as R&D for hardware, embedded software and clinical research, while maintaining financial discipline with reduced SG&A and other operating costs. We are seeing increased demand for our digital health solutions from patients, physicians, providers and healthcare systems around the world as they embrace remote patient engagement and adopt population health management. We are the clear leader in this field with over 14 million cloud connectable medical devices in the market. And our ongoing and increasing investments in digital health innovation will ensure we provide superior value to patients, physicians and providers to be their partner of choice. We don't take our leading market share position for granted. We fight for it every day through innovation. Our digital technologies are a growth catalyst for our business. We have an exciting pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium and long term value with an industry leading IP portfolio including over 8000 patents and designs. We now have over 8.5 billion nights of respiratory medical data in our cloud based platform called air solutions. We have over 15.5 patients enrolled in our cloud based AirView software solution. And we also have over 105 million patients manage within our software as a service network for out-of-hospital healthcare. These incredible data assets allow us to unlock value for all of our customers, patients, physicians, providers, as well as private and government payers. Let me take a few minutes to share some recent clinical highlights that show how we are working with researchers to advance the field of sleep and respiratory medicine with these data and beyond. During 2020, an important 30-year duration study was published in the European respiratory journal following over 4,500 diagnosed OSA patients to better understand the long term impacts of untreated sleep apnea. The study showed that untreated sleep apnea leads to high incidence of myocardial infarction or heart attack, high incidence and prevalence of Type II diabetes and high incidence of ischemic heart disease. This real world clinical analysis is showing what we've known for over three decades. Sleep apnea is a public health epidemic that simply can't be ignored. In terms of clinical quality of life improvement from CPAP therapy, the data are also clear. In late 2019, the multicenter randomized controlled trial called MERGE was published in the journal, Lancet Respiratory Medicine. The results were that patients randomized to CPAP demonstrated clear improvement in quality of life for CPAP patients versus standard of care with symptomatic benefits, including reductions in sleepiness, as well as improvements in fatigue, and importantly, depression, a key part of mental health. Importantly, these results were evident in both mild as well as moderate and severe sleep apnea. In terms of economic data, and a dose response relationship from CPAP therapy, the data are also unequivocal. In 2019, a study was published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, showing the quantified dose response relationship from CPAP therapy. So, for every additional hour of Positive Airway Pressure use, there was an 8% decrease in hospital inpatient visits, and a 4% decrease in overall physician visits. In other words, treating sleep apnea without sleep therapy not only improves lives, it also saves money for the healthcare system by lowering total healthcare utilization costs. During the quarter, we saw the publication of a draft technology assessment from the Agency for Healthcare, Research and Quality, or AHRQ here in the U.S. market. AHRQ sought input and ResMed file public comments, along with comments from many physician groups, sleep apnea patient advocates, provider groups, and beyond. I won't repeat all the details of those public comments, but I will say this, we presented peer reviewed and published data showing that CPAP therapy improves quality of life, reduces healthcare costs, and even reduces mortality. In short, these data prove that in partnership with our physician and provider colleagues in the market, we are saving lives and saving money for the healthcare system through our medical technology. We have peer reviewed and published data showing that a reduction in incidence of heart attack, a reduction in hypertension, as well as a reduction in the incidence of solid cell cancer tumors. All of these are logical sequelae of the elimination of hypoxia that is associated with CPAP therapy in treated sleep apnea patients. We are encouraged by technical studies completed by the National Institute of Clinical Effectiveness. The acronym is nice in the U.K. Just last month NICE may publish there 2021 draft guidelines that recommend that CPAP therapy along with telemonitoring is the frontline treatment option for patients with mild OSA. That would be an expansion of coverage in the U.K., and also an expansion of the use of digital health technology in that market. Similarly, the ministries of health in France, Germany and Japan have seen the value of digital health in sleep apnea therapy and have begun investing reimbursement funds in the space. It's great to see this expansion of coverage for sleep apnea therapy and digital health around the world as government see improvement in outcomes and reductions in total healthcare system costs with this technology. While we respect the work of AHRQ, we, along with many other academic research focus institutes and practicing physician groups believe that they bypass a generation of data in real world evidence that needs to be taken into account along with their own select group of RCTs in the draft report. We are optimistic that the final report when issued we'll reflect the preponderance of real world evidence and broader RCTs showing both the clinical and economic benefits of treating sleep apnea with positive airway pressure. Okay, let me now update you on our top three, ResMed strategic priorities. These are, one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma businesses. Two, to design, develop and deliver world leading medical devices, as well as globally scalable digital health solutions. And three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and preferably in a person's home. In our core market of sleep apnea, we continue to see sequential improvement in new patient diagnosis trends, as we seek to provide solutions for the 936 million people worldwide who suffocate every night. The rate of new patients starting sleep apnea therapy in the U.S. was impacted by the typical seasonality that we see in the March quarter, primarily as a result of insurance deductibles resetting at the start of each calendar year. This season, in fact, affects devices more than mask systems, given the incremental cost of diagnosis and the relative price points of the two categories. We expect sequential growth in sleep and respiratory care as we move past this typical seasonality. We continue to see strong ongoing mask and accessory resupply in the U.S. market and beyond. New patient flow during the quarter was impacted by the recent COVID related case surges in select countries in Asia and Europe, including two large markets France and Germany. We see that impact the number of patients going for clinical based diagnosis pathways in these affected countries. We expect to see these markets reopen along with hospitals, as vaccines continue to roll out, and as we see further scaling of the remote home-based diagnostic capacity. Clearly the kinetics of opening of these economies and the rate of vaccination rollout are beyond our control. However, we can control our investments in digital solutions for our physician and provider partners, which we are doing at increasing velocity and with scalable systems and processes. More broadly, we are seeing growth in total sleep -- total new sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patient flow. And we expect to see this improve over time in our portfolio of 140 country markets each quarter. Importantly, our market leading share position has remained stable across both masks and devices. And we're excited about our future pipeline. We rarely talk about our future pipeline as those who've followed us for very time now. But today I would like to open up the curtain just a little bit on our next generation sleep apnea platform. You may have seen some recent U.S. regulatory filings that we made for our next generation, flow generator platform called the AirSense 11. Clearly, there are multiple steps in the process to bring this new platform to global markets and these public regulatory filings are simply one important step. But we are making good progress. Earlier this month, we started a limited controlled product launch of the AirSense 11 in certain parts of the United States. We expect to move to a broader commercial launch of the platform later this calendar year in the U.S. and then to country markets worldwide in sequence after that. For now I can say that as a personal user of our CPAP therapy, I have firsthand knowledge that the AirSense 11 device will benefit patients and their bed partners. And our early data show that the device and software platform combination will benefit physicians, providers, payers and beyond, and ultimately continue to catalyze ResMed's global leadership in digital health solutions for sleep apnea and then also accelerate our success in digital health solutions for COPD, asthma and other chronic diseases. We make the smallest, quietest, smartest and the most comfortable devices on the market. Importantly, they are all cloud connectable with the latest and greatest digital health technology to increase adherence, improve clinical outcomes, and deliver proven cost reductions within our customers on health care systems. Let me turn now to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million COPD or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and the 340 million asthma patients worldwide. Our goal is to reach more patients with our core respiratory care solutions including both non invasive ventilation and life support ventilation, as well as newer therapeutic areas, such as cloud connected pharmaceutical drugs delivery devices and high flow therapy devices. Our respiratory care business benefited in the March 2020 quarter as we sold incremental ventilator devices and ventilation mask solutions to meet growing demand worldwide as a result of the pandemic. During the March 2021 quarter COVID related ventilator sales were not material to the global business. However, we are seeing some demand in select countries affected by these latest COVID surges, such as just this month with the surge in India. And we're getting many 1000s of devices to those in need, the demand is there in that country. But as in Q3, we do not expect the revenue to be material to our global business. Even though the broader impact particularly with preservation in life in these countries is clearly priceless, and incredibly important to not only our local team in India, but to all of us here at ResMed worldwide. Demand for our core non invasive ventilator and life support ventilator solutions for COPD and other respiratory insufficiency are experiencing the same steady recovery in new patient flow as in sleep apnea. We are balancing the growth in patient demand there with the supply of ventilators that we made to the market throughout 2020 as customers balance their inventory and their core ongoing patient needs. We continue to see rapid adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe in the midst of the pandemic this time a year ago. We are now seeing that this technology has expanded to regions around the world. The value being provided through this cloud-based software solution has been fruitful not only during the COVID pandemic and the peak parts of the crisis, but it's also valuable on an ongoing value basis for physicians as well as the healthcare systems they operate in. We are helping to ensure that digital health is now the new standard of care for respiratory care. Let me now review our software as a service business for out-of-hospital care. During the quarter our SAAS business grew in the mid single digits year-on-year across our portfolio of markets. The verticals include home medical equipment, Brightree HME, skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, private duty home care, home infusion, senior living and life planned communities. Our HME customers are leveraging our advanced resupply solutions, including SNAP technology and Brightree resupply for our existing portfolio of patients. And they are contributing to ongoing growth as the flow of new patients in HME continues to recover steadily period by period. Over the past 12 months COVID-19 has had a dampening effect on elective and emergent procedures at hospitals as we all know, and that has slowed hospital discharge rates affecting patient flow and ultimately, the centers rates at skilled nursing facilities home health, hospice and beyond. As the rate of vaccinations accelerate across the U.S. and the number of COVID-19 cases continues to trend downward in this country, we're seeing improvements in the census rates across skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, and across all post acute care settings. In addition to the solid organic growth that we're seeing in our SaaS business, we closed an exciting acquisition just this month. The company is called Citus Health. Citus is a digital health leader specializing in patient engagement solutions for home infusion and specialty pharmacy, as well as the home health and hospice markets. Citus enhances the patient experience and it also improves provider efficiency and reduces the workload for frontline clinicians and caregivers. We are excited to have the Citus team as part of the ResMed family of solutions and to leverage their digital collaboration and patient support platform in our mission to improve patients lives outside the hospital. I'm very impressed by the breadth and depth of talent at Citus and their passion for patient care. This goes from their CEO, and co-founder, all the way to the front line. We're very excited to have them join our team and we will be better together. As we look across our portfolio solutions for Brightree to MatrixCare to now Citus, including HME, specialty pharmacy, home infusion, skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, senior living, life plan communities and private duty home care. We expect this portfolio, this SAAS portfolio of revenue growth to accelerate, increasing for mid single digit growth that we saw in this quarter to high single digit growth as we move forward. As always, our goal is to meet or beat these sort of market average growth rates and we continue to take share across the verticals that we're in. We also see opportunity to drive growth through further acquisitions that will augment and add to our existing portfolio of solutions. Our offerings are very well received in each of these verticals and we continue to see and leverage analytics and the technology that we have across our core business and the SAAS business to help people age in place, and minimize or eliminate acute care episodes. Looking at the broader ResMed portfolio of business across sleep, and respiratory care as well as our software as a service solutions, we remain confident in our long term strategy and our pipeline of innovative solutions. Our mission to improve lives, drives and motivates with millions across the world every day. COVID has highlighted and continues to highlight the importance of respiratory health and respiratory hygiene. It is highlighted also the importance of digital health and remote care. And it has also accelerated awareness and adoption of technologies that can be used for remote patient, screening, diagnosis, setup, as well as remote patient management and monitoring. We've continued to invest aggressively in R&D and innovation to ensure our solutions are best-in-class and are a catalyst for future growth. With 1.5 billion people around the world suffering from sleep apnea, COPD and asthma combined, we see incredible opportunities for greater identification, enrollment, and engagement of people with our digital health pathways. We are relentlessly driving innovation and development to provide the scale needed to expand the impact of this technology across the 140 countries that we operate in. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude for more than 7,500 ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication during these most unusual circumstances these last 15 months. This team has helped save the lives literally of many hundreds of 1000s of people around the world with ventilators. With these emergency needs. The team has now rapidly pivoted back to our core markets and our core purpose of helping people with sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma. And for all those who need world-class care delivered well away from the hospital, and preferably in their own home. Thank you. With that, I will now hand the call over to Brent in Sydney. And then we will move to Q&A. Brett, over to you. Yes. Thanks for the question, Lyanne. And clearly as I said in the prepared remarks, the March 2020, $35 million worth of ventilators were primarily where COVID was impacting them, which was Southwest China, and so probably Hubei province and Northern Italy. So China and Italy. And so clearly, the $35 million worth of sales in the March quarter last year, were predominantly in that rest of world category. So, you can imagine that the actual decline in terms of the COVID impact on year-on-year is significantly below that 18% cc that you talked about, much further below that. And really importantly, when you look at the sort of kinetics of this, and you think about the December quarter to the March quarter, and then what we're going to see in June, we're seeing countries opening up. They're adopting digital health and they're finding ways to make it work. And even in France and Germany where you didn't see lockdowns in the retail side, the healthcare was not as impacted. And our digital health solutions, particularly around remote patient screening diagnosis have been effective. And so, we're seeing that open up as we move forward. Rob, do you want to take the second part of the question? Yes. Thanks, Gretel. Good question. And if you look at just U.S., Canada, Latin America, so the Americas numbers, devices were down 2% year-on-year. And if you think about what we're talking about the COVID recovery rates being somewhere between 70% of pre COVID patient flow to 90% of recovered patient flow depending on the country. If you just do that raw math there, that comes out to 98% of pre-COVID, basically, which is not quite there, because there are some replacement devices included there. But certainly, we actually saw very steady market share, some gains in some of the mask areas, but very steady market share in the device side. Some of our competitors are having some difficulties around supply, as well as our global supply chains and other factors going on. We may have even taken some share in the device side. So, what we're seeing just in those U.S. numbers, when you think about sequential from the December to March quarter is really all about, as I said in the prepared remarks around deductibles, resetting those deductibles and impact devices significantly more than masks and accessories. If you look at the masks and accessories, just in that quarter, we saw 7% constant currency growth in masks and accessories in the March quarter year-on-year. But always there's a sequential impact from December to March. And so that's the net. But no actually share very steady, maybe moving up a little on the mask side, very steady on the devices with some modest gains. But the year-on-year 2% decline in devices is truly around the COVID recovery rates. And as we know, the rollout in the U.S. has actually been pretty strong in terms of the vaccinations. I don't think we're quite at the 98%, which would mean, that 2% decline could indicate. But I do think that we are moving well towards the 90% range in some states, and the sort of 80% range and some other states of pre COVID patients flow. But every period we look at, we see improvement in both of those. Thanks for the question Gretel. Yes. Thanks Margaret. That is a very good question and a thorough one. Look, clearly, we're very confident that the medium to long term of the core business is incredible, given the flow of patients and the flow of our new technology. There are short term dynamics around second and third waves, and then the vaccinations on the positive side and the opening up of the economies on the positive side. As we put it all together, we are very confident that as we get the AirSense 11 from control product launch, to then start to roll that out over this calendar year in the U.S. market, that will be a catalyst for growth. It brings not only the hardware, but also amazing software solutions for patients, physicians, providers, and others. And as we think about the scaling of just the remote patient, digital health models from some of our partners, and identification, engagement and enrollment, all the way through to home sleep, testing and home sleep set up and rolling out of those devices, we're seeing a lot of investments start to pay off on that. So look, it's really hard to get down to the dynamics of how quickly vaccines will go. How quickly economies will open up. But here in the U.S., which is our biggest market, we're certainly seeing both of those trend in a really positive manner. And that led me to talk about pretty bullish sort of double digit growth towards the back end of our fiscal year 2022. And so, I think they're all the dynamics going into it. I don't know Jim Hollings, if you've got any further thoughts as the President of our Sleep and Respiratory Care Business about how quickly we can use that technology to drive growth towards that back end. Thanks, Margaret. Matt, it's a great question, and it talks to within our software as a service business, obviously, we have privacy, we have cyber security, but then we have interoperability. And interoperability making sure our data can through secure Private API's be able to interact with hospital care systems, is an incredibly important part of the system. We call an out-of-hospital healthcare, because we don't believe you have to go to hospital to get good health care, but the hospital systems call it post acute care. And that link between post acute care and out-of-hospital care has to be very secure and has to be very seamless, if you like for the patient and for the healthcare system. We're now many quarters into our Cerner partnership and what we've shown in that to our partner there, Cerner is that ResMed is a great recipient of patient from the hospital system into both home health and hospice and beyond now into infusion with that partnership. And I think we've got a sort of a track record, that ResMed can take care of those patients and make sure that there's a seamless transition from hospital to the out-of-hospital healthcare network. And so, with that proven track record, I look to their customers, those sort of Cerner, Epic and Allscripts, their customers being HCA and others, as HCA sort of broadens their holistic care if you like, our patients from hospital to the home, that's an opportunity for those providers to partner with someone like ResMed. So there's the seamless transfer of the patients. Look, the ultimate goal is that we take costs out of the system. We take care of the patient better. And we have seamless transfer from hospital to home or out-of-hospital care. And then hopefully not but if you do go back to the hospital, that record can move back and forwards very well. We've got a good track record of it. And I actually see a lot of upside, as hospital systems think holistically in that sort of ACO sort of Accountable Care Organization approach. And we've got a lot of experience in Western Europe, in patients taking care of holistically throughout Northern Europe and beyond. So I'm confident that we will do well in this evolution of sort of an acute care system or sick care system to a true healthcare system and a preventative health care system, which is where ResMed best 90 plus percent of our revenues and profits, and really with the SAAS business, it's where we are the only strategic with the capability to scale not just across the U.S., but globally. Yes, Thanks, Mike. Great question with three great parts to it. So the first part, the AirSense 11 is out there. It's in control product launch. As I said, in the prepared remarks, I'm personally part of that CPL. And just amazing benefits for the individual patient and the bed partner in terms of how quiet comfortable cloud connected and capabilities. So the features are extraordinary. One thing, we've opened up to the most we ever have around the pipeline that is out there, because there's a public regulatory documents out there, and it's in CPL. I don't want to go through all the features and functions other than to say that, but it's smaller, it's quieter, it's more comfortable, it's more cloud connected. And it's not just the device, it's the software system that goes with it that provides a value for not just the patient, but the physician, the provider, and the healthcare system that are part of it. So, to the second part in question around growth, yes, look, I do think this will be a catalyst for growth. That's why I'm comfortable in the prepbox [ph]. And you answered to Gretel earlier to talk about our comfort in saying, we're going to push towards double digit growth for the back end of this fiscal year that we're in here. And I think this device will be a catalyst for it. I think the software, the digital health technology software around it will be a large part of that catalyst for growth. Obviously, we're a different business than, when I was running the Sleaford, we launched the S9. It was, I think the total revenues of the company were less than a billion dollars. And now the total revenues are over $3 billion, trailing 12 months. And so, the percentage growth, the numbers won't be as impressive as 10 years ago, but the growth in terms of net revenue and profitability, we can reinvest in the business for more devices and less software will certainly be there. The third party question around cost. Clearly our goal, every generation is to create smaller, quieter, more comfortable, more clever devices and software systems, but also ones that have better efficiency. So we lower cost of manufacturing low cost to our supply chain. So clearly, that's an important part of this platform. We expect to do that, as he said, as we scale that up across our global business. Thanks, Mike. Yes, Thanks, David. And we clearly saw from the earnings call from our competitors, some issues that they're having with product quality. And I never comment on details of that. And I think all of us care most of all about our patients. And so, Rob, you want to talk a little bit to our quality standards and what we're working on as we look at that issue? Thanks. David, actually does the second part of your question talks about what would be the implications in the market? I mean, clearly, I don't know if Jim Hollings wants to talk to this. But look, we want to take share when our products are smaller, quieter, more comfortable and better. And we've been doing that for three decades. But clearly, they might be some share implications if a competitor has constraints around supply. Jim, do you want to talk a little bit to that? Thanks, Sean. That's a great question. And I'll hand back to James Hollings to talk about whether the elimination of competitive bidding pretty much in terms of delight in 2024 has any implications for pricing with us without the U.S. customers. Jim, do you want to take that? Thanks for the question, Sean. Yes, Andrew, thanks. It's a great question. And there are so many dynamics of hospital care and in the flow out through post acute care to our SAAS system. I think, as we look forward, we saw 5% growth in the quarter across our SAAS business. We think the weighted average market growth across those seven or now eight verticals that we're in with Citus joining the portfolio, and specialty pharmacy and home infusion. We think that sort of mid single digit growth can move towards high single digit growth as we see patients get back to the hospital and therefore get back to the discharged to skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, and beyond. And so, it's difficult to say the exact rate of increase, but it's going to increase. And I think our technology and what we've invested in, particularly, even during COVID, some of the software that we put for our skilled nursing facility customers to manage patients who may or may not be infected by COVID, and how they operate their businesses have been very well received. So even as case rates declined, but COVID is still here, and it is still across, even with vaccinations going up, still going to impact those customers. I think some of those tools will help us see a faster path to getting from that mid single digit growth to high single digit growth across the group. And as I said in the prep remarks, and this is true for ResMed always. We don't just want to meet market growth, we want to beat that market growth. So, as I look towards our long term strategy and 2025, we've got the opportunity for to get way back to double digit growth in our SAAS business. But in the short to medium term, I think we can move from mid single digits to high single digits in this part of our portfolio. We've made the investments in the technology. We've made the investments for the customers to help them deal with the dynamics of code. And as recovery happens, we will be a partner for them for growth on the other side. Thanks, Andrew. Got you loud and clear, Suraj. Perfect. Thanks, Suraj. I'll hand the first question to Dave on AHRQ. And then I'll take the second one on SAAS. So Suraj, the only thing I'd add to Dave's response, which is very thorough, is that actually there are RCTs randomized control trials but also are excellent that weren't included. So if you're just looking at RCTs, even, you need to include some of those RCTs, which were in fact very positive. And the AHRQ just looked at some neutral RCTs and said, well, neutral that means no benefit. There's all these other proponents of evidence real world and RCTs that are positive. So, it was an interesting some section of the literature that they used. And we have lots of folks ask at academics working on that. On a second party question, SAAS, if you look at, it actually was a strong tailwind for us in this quarter, 5% growth versus the COVID included core part of the business. And I think it can be. As we look forward, and I spoke to this earlier in my answer to Andrew, about SAAS, going from mid single digits to high single digits, I think it can -- and then after meeting or beating that, so getting to double digit growth, in the SAAS part of our business, I do think that will become a tailwind for us that 12% of our revenue. So for the SAAS, as we get out of, the COVID, sort of slowdown of census rates in this out-of-hospital care, we get back to a normal flow of patients through. Because people are wanting to age in place, people are wanting to be outside the hospital. COVID just increase. The probability that people do not want to be in a hospital for any longer than they need to. And so I think the geographic and socio economic trends of a growing community and people wanting to age in place in an aging population, and the fact that people are seeing lower cost, lower acuity and better healthcare delivered outside the hospital all lead towards this. The dynamics of how quickly we go from mid single digit growth to high single digit growth, we can divide. But the fact is, it's going to go there, because people are moving from the hospital to out-of-hospital healthcare. And that's where we're investing. So, as I look forward to our long term strategy 2025, I am very confident that this will be a very strong tailwind to our business. The recovery of our whole business post COVID is what we're talking about here. But I look on the end of the FY 2022, strong double digit growth across our business. And I mean that across our whole business. Thanks for the questions, Suraj. Yes. Thanks for the questions. Anthony. To your first part of question around SAAS. Yes, I mean, clearly there's consolidation of some plays in the HME industry, and that can impact our contracts with those. In general SAAS is per user per month, like per activating user per month approach. And so, acquisitions are -- HME acquiring another HME that doesn't currently use Brightree. Is actually upside for us, because usually, the acquiring entity has all the efficiencies and scale and capabilities, because they using Brightree, and then they put that into the acquired account. And so therefore, actually increased the number of users and the per user per month revenue for ResMed can be upside on that. If it's a Brightree user acquiring another Brightree user, well, then there can be some reduction, they might get some efficiencies and reductions of the number of chairs. But ultimately, if it's a smart customer it's going to continue to grow. And so then that over time, as they grow will increase our revenues as part of that. So a lot of dynamics around the M&A there. But in general, in the long run for us, it's about us betting on the winning and efficient ATMs and Brightree helps us do that. Because the people who adopt Brightree other winners, they have the lowest costs and the best outcomes for their patients. So the second part of your question around sleep labs, I look over capacity here in the U.S., and the reduction that happens during COVID or in lab tests, those people scale their digital health solutions in their home sleep testing capability. So as they come back and open up the in-lab facilities, I think that will absolutely have a rebound of the capacity in the in-labs, but they won't lose what they gained in home sleep testing. As Aristotle said, when the mind is stretched by a new idea, it never returns to its original size. So they're not going to forget about these great digital health solutions that have the home sleep testing. So yes, we'll get the capacity back in the sleep lab. But I also think the scalable opportunity for those sleep diagnostics providers to provide low cost, customer friendly diagnostics and the home will be just a part of their portfolio and hopefully, will improve the rate of diagnosing the 936 million people worldwide. But we're just looking at the U.S., the 70 million people in this country that have mild, severe obstructive sleep apnea that need to be taken care of. Thanks for the question, Anthony. And I'll hand back to you, Amy to close up the call. Sure. Yes. But I know we're nine minutes over. So I'll make this brief. Thanks again to all our shareholders for joining us on the call. I'd like to thanks once again, the 7,500 ResMedians, many of you, shareholders, thank you for your hard work, dedication, helping people sleep better, breathe better, around 140 countries worldwide. Thank you for the many 1000s of enlightens. You're getting right now to our team in India. So that we can take care of people in this another emergency. I look forward to talking to you and to all of our shareholders here again in 90 days. Thanks."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Shentel. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to ResMed's second quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings call. Thanks for joining us. This call is being webcast live and the replay along with a copy of the earnings press release and our updated investor presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today. On the call today to discuss our quarterly results are our CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett Sandercock. And several other members of management will be available during the Q&A following our prepared remarks. During today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, please review the notes to today's earnings release and earnings presentation. As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions; however, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. With that, I'd now turn the call over to Mick.\nMick Farrell: Thanks Amy. And thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us on today's call. On this our first call for calendar year 2021. We are happy to see the steady growth of production, distribution and availability of vaccines around the world. Clearly, we all want to see faster production and wider distribution so that people can be safe from COVID-19 and free to open up their communities and free to get back to their lives. We continue our work here at ResMed to support frontline respiratory therapists and pulmonary physicians, critical care physicians as well as providers, patients and Resmedian around the 140 plus countries that we operate in. In our core markets, the patient diagnosis trends in sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma are steadily increasing, modestly improving on the trends we saw in the September 2020 quarter. We're seeing this improvement of patient flow even as second and third waves come through northern winter hemisphere nations, because physicians and providers are adopting digital health, which enables patient engagement, even when people cannot or do not want to meet live and in person. In my remarks today, I will provide a high-level overview of our December Q2, FY21 business results and then hand the call over to Brett for further detail on the financials. I will also review progress towards our ResMed 2025 strategic goals, including execution highlights against our quarterly and annual operating priorities. Today, we have published and reported solid, high single digit growth in top line revenue and strong double-digit growth in both net operating profit as well as earnings per share. These results once again speak to our ResMed team's ability to work innovatively and deliver results, even when facing lower patient activity and little to no incremental benefit from ventilator sales. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we generated over $170 million of cash, allowing us to return over $57 million in dividends to shareholders. We have also grown research and development investments in digital health technology as well as hardware, software and clinical research. We forecast increasing digital health demand from patients from physicians from providers and from healthcare systems as they embrace remote patient monitoring, and they adopt data driven population health management systems. We have an exciting pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium and long-term value for our customers with an industry leading IP portfolio including over 6,000 patents and designs. Our digital health ecosystem is an important competitive advantage for ResMed that offers integrated care to drive superior clinical outcomes, to drive better patient experiences. And to drive lower health care system costs. We now have over 8 billion nights of respiratory medical data in our cloud-based air solutions platform. We have sold over 13.5 million, 100% Cloud connectable medical devices into the market from ResMed. And we have over 15 million patients enrolled in our AirView Solutions in the cloud. With these data liberated to the cloud, we can unlock value for all of our customer groups. We can unlock value for patients through Maya, we can unlock value for physicians through AirView, and we can unlock value for IDNs payer providers as well as private and government insurance for data driven population health management. That's the future of healthcare. The goals we share with all of our customer are these three. One to improve patient outcomes, patient quality of life, patient chronic disease outcomes. Two, to lower overall healthcare system costs, and three to bend the curve of chronic disease progression. To be clear, the spectrum of chronic diseases that we look at here at ResMed are of course, including our core focus areas of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma, but it also includes biological systems interaction with cardiovascular disease, with cancer, with type two diabetes with neuromuscular disease, Alzheimer's and beyond. During our last earnings call, I discussed how COVID has continued to accelerate the rapid adoption of digital health technology around the world. We are seeing the recognition of the value of Remote Patient screen, virtual diagnoses, Remote Patient Management, and the rapid evolution of digital reimbursement models in many of the nations that we serve patients. As an example of just one of these Germany during the quarter, approved reimbursement for mandibular repositioning devices including our digital 3D printed dental sleep apnea product called NARVAL. This is the first time Germany has approved such a product type to treat sleep apnea. In addition, several German states looking at experimenting with digital Health Reimbursement models. These are exciting developments and we expect this will benefit our German business over time. We've also seen other national governments including France, Japan, and the United States, where they've adopted models and taken action to accelerate digital health adoption. Remote healthcare is of incredible importance during this COVID-19 pandemic. But digital health is also valuable well beyond the impact of COVID because it provides better availability of healthcare. It provides excellent quality care for patients, and it provides significantly lower costs for healthcare systems worldwide. These trends are key to ResMed's 2025 strategy. We believe the accelerated adoption of digital Health Solutions represents a significant and permanent shift of the adoption curve for ResMed market leading digital health solutions. Let me now briefly update you on our top three strategic priorities. These three priorities are one to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses. Two, to design, develop and deliver world leading medical devices as well as globally scalable digital health solutions. And three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital, and especially in the home. In our core market of sleep apnea, we continue to see sequential improvement in new patient diagnosis trends, as well as very strong resupply activity, both of which has supported another quarter of solid revenue growth that you can see in the numbers we just released. Within 70% to 90% of the pre-COVID patient flow coming through our biggest market in the United States. And to take an example of a European country in Germany, we're already back to 85% to 90 plus percent in some states of Germany of pre-COVID patient flow. Even in countries like China, in our large Asia region, where we saw the sharpest declines at the start of this crisis with very severe lockdowns in Asia and particularly in China, we're now back to already seeing around 70 plus percent 70% to 75% of pre-COVID patient flow coming through the mainly hospital clinics in our China market. Obviously, the recovery rates of new patients starting sleep apnea therapy may be impacted by the typical seasonality we see in our largest market here in the United States in the March quarter. As a result of insurance deductibles resetting at the start of the calendar year this is as per normal. This seasonal impact affects devices more than it affects mask systems, given the relative price points of the two categories, and the fact that the vast majority of mask revenue is returning customers on resupply programs. The resiliency of our mask and accessory resupply has been strong throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. And we see it as remaining strong through the recovery and strong in a post-COVID Peak world. We continue to produce clinical research showing that diagnosing and treating sleep apnea saves money and improves quality of life for patients. This quarter, we are now showing data that treating sleep apnea is actually a life and death decision. The latest data from the European Respiratory Journal, which published during the quarter results from a 30-year study. The high-level summary of these results were that treating sleep apnea increases patient quality of life and extends quantity of life. It also showed the commerce side in that not trading sleep apnea leads to a significantly higher incidence of heart attack, type 2 diabetes and ischemic heart disease, leading to significantly higher healthcare costs, treating those diseases and ultimately leading to early death. Let me now turn from sleep apnea to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve COPD, and asthma patients worldwide. Our goal is to reach more patients in our core Respiratory Care markets, including non-invasive ventilation, as well as life support ventilation, as well as newer areas including pharmaceutical, drug delivery, and high-flow therapy. We make the smallest quietest and most comfortable devices on the market. And they are all 100% Cloud connectable. We continue to see rapid adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe in the midst of the peak of the COVID-19 crisis there about nine months ago; we accelerated the time to market to meet the needs of physicians and patients during the COVID peak. And it's proved to be very useful during the peak and beyond the peak. The value being provided for this platform has helped healthcare systems in the markets they operate in, where we ensure we are making digital health part of the standard of care for Respiratory Care, not just in Europe, but worldwide. During the quarter we decided to exit the portable oxygen market and shut down our concentrator business in that category. We entered the POC market in 2016 as a way to engage with stage two and stage three COPD patients. Since then, and these last five years we have acquired Propeller giving us access to COPD patients even earlier in their COPD disease progression, including stage one and stage two COPD patients. Additionally, and especially during COVID, we've seen more rapid adoption of high flow therapy that can support some COPD patients. And of course, we have our core, non-invasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for more severe COPD patients in markets globally already. In short, we don't need POC to help in our end-to-end digital health pathway for COPD. Additionally, given no positive changes to POC reimbursement in the latest round from the US government, and the economics of our customer acquisition cost versus lifetime value, the POC market itself is not as attractive as it was five years ago. The bottom line is this; we have pharmaceutical drug delivery management through Propeller to support COPD patients in stage one and stage two COPD. We have the emergence of high-flow therapy for stage two and stage three COPD. And we have growing use of non-invasive ventilation and life support ventilation to support patients in stage three and stage four COPD. So in summary, we are very well positioned to help patients, physicians, providers and payers with an end-to-end digital health management pathway for COPD. Let me now review our software as a service business. During the quarter our SaaS business grew in the mid-single digits year-on-year, driven by continued strong uptake of our Brightree HME resupply solutions. Impact of COVID on surgical procedures and other in hospital and out of hospital visits has impacted discharge rates that particularly affect the census at skilled nursing facilities and hospice. On the other hand, the flow of patients in home medical equipment and home health has been recovering well even stronger. So as we look across our portfolio of out of hospital care settings, including home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, home health and hospice, life plan communities, private duty home care and senior living, we expect that the weighted average market growth rate of these verticals will be in the low to mid single digit range for fiscal 2021. We expect this weighted average market growth rate portfolio to return to mid-single digits and then to high single digits. As hospital discharge and ambulatory surgery center discharge rates return. Our offerings are very well received in each of the verticals that we serve. So we will not just accept these market growth rates, we will look to meet and beat that group market growth rate as we did this quarter, getting a return from our significant investments in R&D within Brightree and MatrixCare. And through expansion of our partnerships with hospital based electronic health record providers. Brightree continues to innovate to drive resupply growth. Of particular note the integration and scaling of the Snap Technologies is going very well. This has allowed our home medical equipment customers to expand their resupply programs and support more patients with better engagement at a time during the COVID pandemic when they desperately need new innovation both the providers and the patients. MatrixCare has also introduced new technology; we introduce new voice to text technology at the point of care, which helps address caregiver shortages which are right during COVID by enabling better and more efficient workflows for the customer, while also delivering a better experience for the ultimate customer who's the patient. Our expanded relationship with Cerner is progressing very well. We are now Cerner's preferred solution across home health and hospice, as well as her medical equipment and their pharmacy and infusion businesses. Our increasingly important relationship with Cerner is leading to better interoperability for providers and mutual customers and an improved experience for patients. We anticipate opportunities to deepen and expand this collaboration to sleep apnea and COPD disease management. Clearly, 2020 was an unprecedented year for companies across every industry, and there was much suffering around the world. However, we see some blessings during all that suffering. Importantly, we hear it resonated we were able to be there during the emergency. We were able to pivot our whole team and our home business to provide over 150,000 ventilators during the peak needs of the endemic and get them to where they needed based upon a humanitarian epidemiology model. Additionally, COVID has highlighted the importance of respiratory health. COVID generally kills people through acute respiratory distress syndrome and awful but that has raised the awareness of respiratory hygiene, respiratory health and the field of respiratory medicine. The crisis also showed us the importance of digital health, and has accelerated the awareness and adoption of technologies that can be used for remote patient screening for remote patient diagnosis, Remote Patient setup, as well as remote patient monitoring and management. We have seen this crisis drive the importance of healthcare delivered outside the hospital. And that's where ResMed competes to more than 90% of our business. And it's where we add value to customers and where we win. We have seen an ability to bring digital technology that we've been inventing and developing for over a decade, digital screening, digital diagnostics, digital therapeutics, and digital health management of patients. With over 1.5 billion people worldwide suffering from sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma combined, we see incredible opportunities for greater and greater adoption of these scalable technologies. We are poised to continue relentless innovation and development, as well as to provide the global scale that's needed to drive this technology to the 140 countries that we operate in and beyond. Before I hand the coal over to Brett for his remarks, and then we get to the Q&A, I want to once again express my sincere genuine gratitude to the more than 7,500 ResMedians whose perseverance, hard work and dedication during the incredibly challenging circumstances for 2020 allowed our partners in healthcare to save the lives of many hundreds of 1000s of people around the world with emergency needs for ventilation, literally giving the gift of breath and the gift of life to many during COVID. I also thank you for the rapid pivot back to our core markets and our core purpose of helping people with sleep apnea, COPD, asthma, and all those who need world class care delivered well away from the hospital, and preferably in their own time. Thank you. With that I will hand the call over to Brett in Sydney and then we'll move to Q&A. Brett?\nBrett Sandercock: Right. Thanks Nick. Norman. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter fiscal year 2021. And some remarks on our FY21 second half outlook. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior quarter. As Mick noted we had a strong quarter. Total revenue for the December quarter was $800 million, an increase of 9% than the prior quarter, and in constant currency terms revenue increased by 7%. Consistent with our predictions in Q1 earnings call, we derive minimal incremental revenue from COVID-19 related demand in the December quarter. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business, our sales in US, Canada and Latin America countries were $427 million, an increase of 5%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $291 million; increases of 17% were in constant currency terms and increase of 10%. By product segment, US, Canada and Latin America device sales were $205 million, an increase in 1%. Masks and others sales were $222 million, an increase of 8%. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales total $188 million, an increase of 16%. When in constant currency terms a 10% increase. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $93 million, an increase 18% when in constant currency terms and increase of 12%. Globally in constant currency term, device sales increased by 5%, while mask and other sales increased by 9%. Software as a service revenue for the second quarter was $92 million, an increase of 6%. On non-GAAP basis, SaaS revenue increased by 5%. During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring expenses, the purchase accounting fair value adjustment that makes it clear deferred revenue, litigation settlement expenses and the fair value adjustment of equity investments. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin improved by 20 basis points to 59.9% in the December quarter compared to 59.7% in the same quarter last. The increase is predominantly attributable to manufacturing efficiencies, favorable product exchanges and foreign exchange rates, partially offset by declines in average selling prices. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the second quarter were $169 million, a decrease of 1%. On a constant currency terms, SG&A expenses decreased by 3%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 21.2% compared to the 23.3% recorded in the prior quarter. Benefiting from cost management and reduced travel as a result of COVID-19 restrictions. Looking forward with SG&A expenses in the second half of FY21 to increase in the low single digits relative to the prior year period. R&D expenses for the quarter were $55 million, an increase of 10% or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 7%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.9% compared to 6.8% in the prior year. We continue to provide for further investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product and solution development will deliver sustained and competitive advantage. Looking forward we expect R&D expenses to continue to grow year-over-year in a high single digit reflecting this commitment to innovation. Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $19 million for the quarter, and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $15 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $254 million, an increase of 16% reflecting strong top-line growth, expansion of gross margin, and well contained operating expenses. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 14.8%, while on a non-GAAP basis our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.3%. We continue to expect our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2021 will be in the range of 17% to 19%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $206 million, an increase of 17%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.41, also a 17% increase. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.23. During the December quarter, we closed our portable oxygen concentrator business. We recognized that restructuring expenses of $13.9 million associated with the closure. Going forward the cessation of the POC business will have an immaterial impact on both group revenue and earnings per share. We did not expect to incur additional expenses in connection with this activity in the future. And we have adjusted for this one-time expense within our non-GAAP results for the quarter. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $170 million reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by increases in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $35 million. Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter total $41 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $57 million. We recorded equity losses of $3.6 in our income statement in the December quarter associated with Verily joint venture. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $5million per quarter in the second half of FY21 associated with the joint venture operation. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $256 million. At December 31, we had $826 million in gross debt and $570 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. At December 31, we had a further $1.4 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, reflecting the board's confidence in our strong liquidity position and operating performance. Our total cash flow and liquidity provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. We've focused on paying down debt as well as ensuring we have cash reserves to support the company through the uncertainty caused by the ongoing pandemic. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest to grow through R&D. We will also likely deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions such as Snap which we completed during the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. We intend to continue returning cash to shareholders through our dividend program and we might also resume our share buyback program some time during the calendar year. This program has been on par since our acquisition of MatrixCare and Propeller Health in fiscal 2019. Turning now to our FY21 outlook. At a high level, we are now seeing a negligible COVID-19-generated demand for our ventilators and do not expect any incremental benefit in the second half of FY21.Q2. Note as a reminder we recorded $35 million in COVID generated ventilator revenue in our March quarter last year. And $125 million COVID generated ventilator revenue in our June quarter last year. Mask and accessories have continued to demonstrate resilience and growth over the past 12 months, reflecting the insulating value of the large patient installed base and the success of our resupply service offering. We expect to see continued year-on-year growth of our mask sales in the second half of FY21. Notwithstanding continued COVID-19 challenges, we continue to expect the sequential increase in new sleep patients that should support our devices as we move through the second half of FY21. However, we typically experienced a small seasonal sequential decline in revenue from Q2 to Q3, largely attributable to reset of deductibles and health insurance plans in our US market. We expect this trend will also be apparent in FY21. Of course, like many other companies, we continue to experience significant uncertainty in the current environment, including the potential disruptive impacts of ongoing restrictions imposed in many of the countries we operate in. As a result, our forecast and possible future revenue outcomes remain dynamic. And with that, I'll hand call back to Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great, thank you, Brett. And thank you, Mick. Shentel, let's now go ahead and turn to the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair.\nMargaretKaczor: Hey, good afternoon, and good morning to you, Mick. Thanks for taking the questions. And maybe the first one for me as to hit it off. You guys mentioned that there were negligible vent sales this quarter. So does that imply that this is a good revenue base for our model to grow off of for that coarsely business? And the reason I ask is, if it does, and then sales went from $40 million last quarter, none this quarter actually does imply that the business is doing quite well. So any details would be great. Thanks Mick.\nMickFarrell: Thanks for the question, Margaret. And yes, clearly in the December quarter, we had as we predicted sort of the minimis ventilator sales a little bit in Northern Europe, perhaps, but not material across the group. And as Brett said in the remarks just now from him, and I said as well, we expect no sort of COVID related than later sales throughout the rest of the fiscal year and beyond. People have enough in the hospitals, which is great. And so yes, look, it does start to form a good a good base, when you look at the core business of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patient flow. I mean, as we said, the seasonality, usually from Q2, December quarter to Q3 March quarter relating to the US market and deductibles, and so on. But for the other 139 countries we're in and across the portfolio, so it's a good base to start to, to get that slow and steady improvement in the patient flow in this new digital health driven world, Margaret. Our patients going to primary care on zoom and telemedicine and getting referrals to their specialists and coming through the pipeline. And so we think it's better for the long term, but it is slowly and steadily coming back from advice. And yes, as we said, sort of in those numbers of the percentage flow patients as best we can see it. We saw improvement from September to December. And so those in takings up vent sales over that 90-day period as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Bailey of Macquarie.\nDavidBailey: Yes, thanks. Good morning, Mick and Brett. I'm just interested in actually what you've seen adherence levels over COVID-19, whether you've seen it pick up over the last sort of calendar year? And an extension of that any sort of relationship that you've been able to gather from in between resupply and adherence level? Any comments there would be interesting.\nMickFarrell: Yes, it's interesting. And we certainly think sort of modest, sort of single digit improvements in overall adherence, as we look at the big data, and we're actually doing a whole bunch of research on this to understand the sort of kinetics and dynamics of COVID-19 on the market. I think really early stage instead of March, April, people, there was a lot of things going around, and maybe using a CPAP would bring more virus in the room if you have other people room. So some fear and uncertainty and doubt in that early period. But I think that was all covered over by doctors saying listen, if you get treated for sleep apnea, it's actually preventative and improving your lungs and lower impact and severity of COVID-19. And again, look, there's so much clinical literature out there in terms of the general press, but through the scientific data, we are able to see people are adhering, those who are adhering more and sleeping more and using the devices more. And David, to your point, they're participating more in those resupply programs; they are seeing the importance of respiratory hygiene and respiratory health. And when they get a text response, or an app click and a chance to say yes, I want that new mask, I want that new tubing, I want that new humidifier, they putting it at much higher rates and getting closer to, frankly, what they should have always done, which is keeping respiratory hygiene at top of mind. So I would say modest improvements in overall adherence and more significant improvements in the probability that a person says, who is adherent says, I want to get that mask with that copay. I want to get that mask now to get resupply and in cash markets, same thing as well. So it's a really good question, David. It's a complex equation. We're working through all the variables, but yes, modest improvement in adherence and really good improvement in mask resupply as you saw in the numbers, as well as you saw in the health of the patients.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Lyanne Harrison of Bank of America.\nLyanneHarrison: Good morning and congrats. Just a question. I'm trying to understand the change in these charts, I guess the recovery rate to create a few key markets do not appear to have yet improved much compared to the rates you quoted at the last result call. Can you give us some color on what you're hearing in relation to the pipeline in particular physicians' access in sleep testing, whether it being in the level at home to our key markets particularly as COVID cases staged in November and December?\nMickFarrell: Lyanne, it's a good question. And like David's, it's complex, because there's 140 countries all adopting digital health at different rates, and all having different sort of national rules around retail and restaurants as well as how you get back to life and back to health care as well. Healthcare has proved pretty resilient, I think, because people know, it's an essential industry. And the data that I shared earlier around truly life and death decision of using your CPAP or not for treating sleep apnea. I mean, it's incredible to have those data in the hands of our physicians worldwide as they are driving adherence. It's one thing to be doing a digital telemedicine call with a patient over a zoom or secure network, it's another one to say, listen, using this device will save your life, as well as improve your quality of life. And so the numbers of plus or minus 10% anyway, and that's why the ranges are so broad. But look, here the US key market is somewhere between 70 to 90% of pre-COVID patient flow as best we can measure it by at the link air usage by essence 10 sort of air solutions, activations of new devices and reactivations of resupply devices. And it's not perfect data. And it's different in all the 50 states just in the country that I'm living in here, between California, Massachusetts, and Florida, very different areas of opening up of their whole economies on local and state regulation. But that range is pretty broad, but it's pretty accurate in terms of the patient flow through. And that's why I think you've seen people really participating in masks and accessory resupply programs, but a slowdown, obviously a new patient starts. And as you pointed out the kinetics of it. Yes, true from the September quarter, I think we moved up sort of somewhere between 5% and 10% in each of the key markets, I talked about US, China and Germany as examples for Americas, Europe and Asia. So that's 5%, 10% 500 basis points, plus improvement in the quarter it's not this V shape, we're back to 100%, December 2019. Again, but it's a slow, steady sort of U-shaped improvement in the flow of patients, which we think does then over time flow through with all the systems and all the restrictions and portfolio of 140 countries through to patients getting set up and started on a lifetime of therapy on sleep apnea or COPD therapy.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Saul Hadassin of UBS.\nSaulHadassin: Good afternoon, Mick. Good morning, Brett. And say good afternoon Amy as well. Just a quick question on rest of the world sales, Mick, ex-US sales. So strong growth rates, both the costs for generators and masks, just wondering if you can give a bit more color, if sleep therapies are still sort of recovering back to you said 85% - 90% in some regions, just what else drove that very strong growth rate across those two product categories? And was there any tender timing for example, in Asia Pac that may be contributed to that strong growth rate?\nMickFarrell: Thank you, thanks for the question. So I'll have a little bit of a go at it. And then hand to Rob Douglas, our COO beside me here to provide more detail. Look as I said, there was some modest sales of ventilators in western and northern Europe during the quarter that'll flow into the devices number at plus 10% constant currency, and then the masks at plus 12% constant currency. Again, this is Europe, Asia, and the whole entire rest of worlds, and so we're talking 135 plus countries. And so, Rob, do you want to have a go at summarizing that is for sale singly.\nRobDouglas: Yes, let's just cross off the last point, Saul, I saw that there wasn't any kind of changes or issues in any of those markets, particularly. But across the board it was really interesting. We sort of had strong performance in many, many countries. Usually the countries are wary and some are strong and some aren't so on a given time, but it looked like there was pretty good strong performance. And we think the same underlying fundamentals that we've talked about, particularly in the US market. We're applying at different scales on these markets. And so in many small markets, we saw the uptake of that digital solutions being really strong. And in fact that underpinning that in our own technology base. In fact, actually a really good performance for that. Our technology team is meeting those digital requirements in each of the different countries as well. And then it was just really sort of patient demand for making sure their treatment is up to scratch. Really good, and we saw that dynamics across the board. The whole issue of the resurgence didn't seem to have quite effected that you might have thought because I think the health systems have learn that they actually didn't need to shut down everything in the health system and they knew what they can keep open. And so then the sort of the diagnosis processes and that kept going on. As Mick said before, things aren't yet back to fully open and normal. But the whole system's striving to get there. And additional things that have taken home sleep testing in some markets have been supportive as well. So it's really our whole suite of solutions is supporting a market that needs to treat these patients if it is going.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matthew Mishan of KeyBanc.\nMatthewMishan: Hey, great, and thank you for taking the questions. Hey, Mick, just a quick one for me, just what is the pushback, what is the pushback from the payer community on closing the gap and reimbursement between at home sleep testing and lab-based tests?\nMickFarrell: Thanks for the question, Matt. I think the payer community and it varies. Take the example of the United States where it's probably 25% government reimbursement and 75% if you like in our sleep PAP but seems like sleep apnea sales of private payers, they were very supportive of both in lab and in home with apnea testing. And if you look at this country pre-COVID was probably about 45% home sleep apnea testing versus 55% in lab. I think that's moved up very significantly during COVID. Obviously, during the peak of the lockdowns it went very high. And it will probably level out somewhere in that 50%, 55%, 60% range of the diagnoses being home sleep apnea testing. Plus often have deltas of anything you can vary from $250 for home sleep apnea test and $750 - $800 for in lab test, just relative to the cost over there. Obviously, for the payer they would want if it's clinically equivalent patient and good sensitivity, specificity of the data and good patient outcomes, and patient satisfaction as well the payers care about, they would flow towards home sleep apnea testing, where they can go. But look I'll hand over David Pendarvis to add any further color on that dynamic.\nDavidPendarvis: Yes, Matt, at least in the US there actually are some pretty straightforward dollar investment and time requirements that go into reimbursement for a lot of payers. And the fact of the matter is, PHP equipments a lot more expensive to purchase, more expensive to operate, and it takes more time from both the physician and the facility. So that's what they're looking at more so than necessarily the incentives that are driven by the lower cost of home sleep testing. And the higher reimbursement rate of PSG. We certainly support good PSG when it's appropriate for the patient, and there's a lot of sleep labs that have invested a lot of capital, they invest a lot of time for their staff in that. And it's important that they be reimbursed adequately. So they both have their place in the market. But I think it's generally those sorts of things that go into their reimbursement decisions, not necessarily what outcomes are they trying to drive.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Goodsall of MST Macquarie.\nAndrewGoodsall: Thanks very much for taking my question. Just looking at your margins, obviously, mask growth outpaced flow generated. So I can say it's a mixed effect. Could you sort of talk to that mix effect, but also expand on your comments on average selling price decline?\nMickFarrell: Brett, let's see it.\nBrettSandercock: Yes, thank you. Sure. Thanks Mick. Thanks, Andrew. Yes, I mean, we had if you look through the year-on-year 20 basis point expansion. So it was kind of a moderate expansion. So those moving parts that I talked about and those impacts are pretty much or pretty small overall. The mix, pretty much they kind of had that strong mask crisis it's going to underpin that product mix. If you look that, year-on-year little bit of benefit from some effects but pretty minor. And then on ASPs, again, it's I'd characterize a pretty benign environment from a pricing perspective, and that's probably reflected in that pretty small movements in the gross margin year-on-year.\nAndrewGoodsall: So the ASPs are pretty modest but you flagged that and -\nBrettSandercock: Yes, [Multiple Speakers] historic context. I think it's a pretty benign environment for us relative to historical trends.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sean Laaman of Morgan Stanley.\nSeanLaaman: Thank you and good morning, Mick. I have a question on the exit of the PIC business. If I get this right, and I think I've got it simplistically right, but please correct me that you think you've got those mid stage COPD patients covered already through non-invasive events, and there's better reimbursement. And maybe there's a better clinical outcome. But we consider any sort of change in the thinking about how the funnel might operate to get to those patients and service and with non-invasive events with Propeller. Thanks Mick.\nMickFarrell: Yes, Sean, it's a great question. And yes, you're right, look at what Propeller that acquisition is about 24 months old so that what that allowed us to do is to get to patients much earlier in the COPD development cycle. It's really stage one, COPD, where you have that shortness of breath, climbing a flight of stairs, and you go to see the primary care diagnosis and find out that you do have some lung dysfunction. And this broad category called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; you get put in that bucket. And there are many different types of therapies that the doctor can go to, but a lot of them are those pharmaceutical therapies up front. And those inhalers are not used as prescribed when they just given a prescription. The sign is when a pill is prescribed for high cholesterol or low blood pressure the adherence rates are very low in the general population 50% plus or minus. And with Propeller Health we are able to drive those adherence rates up double digits on a relative basis and drive to incredible adherence rates that the pharma industry just hasn't seen in respiratory medicine. And so Propeller technology is really exciting. It's really new. We have major global pharmaceutical companies partnering with us in major markets driving that. Early days but we think that allows us to get to stage one stage two patients in a very significant, scalable way to get them on that sort of end-to-end, digital health journey in COPD. As they progress to stage two, stage three, they sometimes get prescriptions for high-flow therapy, oxygen and ventilation, right. And so with it with non-invasive ventilation, and life support ventilation, which is really stage three, stage four, and in that sort of crossover phase from the pharmaceuticals to the ventilator, both oxygen and high flow therapy used. High-flow therapy is newer and more scaling. And we think more related to our core business and the core devices we make. And it allows us to treat the patients and take care of the patients. And so PSC just became an additional one that wasn't as important in that end-to-end journey, and certainly didn't have the sort of margin profile or the growth profile with the changes in reimbursement to allow us to have the same growth opportunity that we have in non-invasive ventilation and life support ventilation. So that's sort of it in a nutshell.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gretel Janu of Credit Suisse.\nGretelJanu: Thanks very much. Can you talk a bit more about the future pricing environment in the US? I know you said it's the benign currently. But and of course, we did have the announcement of 2 key DMEs merging could you expect great ASP price declines going forward in this benign environment that you're currently in?\nMickFarrell: Thanks for the question, Gretel. I'll hand that to the President of our Global Sleep and Respiratory Care Business. Jim, over to you.\nJamesHollings: Sorry, can you hear me now? It's a terrible way to enter the call. Thank you for the question. Thanks, Mick. I think that what we've seen this year is benign is maybe too softer word for price. But I'll go with benign. We've had a pretty stable pricing environment; I think in anticipation of - the market was anticipating the competitive bid rates. And then of course, competitive bid got delayed. And obviously, the Adapt Health acquisition of Arikare creates an even larger customer for us; they're very important customer for us. And we enjoy a very good relationship with them. I think both with that move. And then with ongoing trends into the year, we should see something that looks like more normal pricing environment, I think, in the second half of the fiscal year and going forward. And it'll be a little bit different by market as it always is, but I would expect it to be kind of back in a more normal trend.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Low of J.P. Morgan.\nDavidLow: Thanks very much. Look, my question is on the software business, Mick, I think you commented that Brightree delivered most of the growth, MatrixCare et cetera, facing more of a challenge from the pandemic. Can you elaborate a little bit and how much growth did you see through Brightree? And what's driving that and I guess most importantly, can we maintain that growth in that part of the software business?\nMickFarrell: Yes, thanks for the question. David, and clearly Brightree had strong growth driven by the strength of our home medical equipment, customers and their ability to pivot their businesses to mask and resupply, and the great adoption of Brightree resupply sort of our core resupply software there. But also the Snap Technologies acquisition that we closed almost exactly a year ago, we were doing due diligence a year ago and closed it sort of later on during this March quarter. And so those two technologies have been very well adopted. But look, in addition to that our Brightree team it's a significant double-digit percent of their revenues in R&D, they've delivered a whole bunch of innovation, some COVID related management opportunities for their HME customers, as well as other innovative ways to grow their business. And so that's allowed the Brightree business to support HMEs and really help them survive and thrive in the early stages, and later stages of COVID-19. And it's great help to the industry. And I'm really proud that ResMed and Brightree are able to deliver that. On the MatrixCare side, yes, it's a tougher story, because the verticals that they operate in will more severely affected skilled nursing facility, census was down high double digits the peak of the crisis and still is down year-on-year on the number of patients in skilled nursing facility operations, and that impacts MatrixCare census rights and ability to grow. In addition, hospice affected similarly, on the other hand home health has been a growth light within the MatrixCare area, and the addition of our MatrixCare branded, but it's healthcare first Brightree and MatrixCare technologies, all combined under the MatrixCare brand has been growing really well. And the Glen and his team who is the VP who's driving that has seen incredible growth in home health and hospice. And I think if you look across that portfolio, what sort of a guy that we deal with because it's you can go through all the verticals in detail is that we think that weighted average market growth rate is needed to have loading in single digits right now. You saw we grew 6% in the quarter. So we're growing a little bit ahead of market taking a little - some of those verticals. But as the weighted average market growth rate goes to mid-single digits, we're going to look to meet and do that. And then when it gets back to high single digits, as the flow of patients from hospitals, and ambulatory surgery centers, picks up, we will then see skilled nursing facilities, hospice and all the verticals, pick up their census rights and get us back to those sorts of growth rates and beyond the time. So, David, it's really sort of part related to the whole recovery of the economy, and that really related to the hospital what people are calling elective surgeries. And I think if you need a heart valve, or a new hip, it's hardly elective when the pain or the probability of death starts going up. And I think healthcare systems are really starting to address that and get their patients back into care. So we should start to see those recoveries over time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Matson of Needham and Co.\nMichaelMatson: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I guess I just wanted asked about the decision to exit the PSC market. You made some comments on that in the prepared remarks, but I was just wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit. I guess what I'm wondering is, was this really a marketing issue? Do you think that the markets just not attractive or the margins on the products too low relative to their other products? Was the product that you had to kind of start with just not competitive enough? Or were there other reasons for exiting this market? I guess what I'm getting at was this a product issue or market issue or both?\nMickFarrell: Thanks for the question, Mike. Like I'll - I said, what I said in the prepared remarks and the question before, maybe I'll hand to Jim Hollings for any further detail. I mean we have the end-to-end play with all that we have in, our core capabilities of Propeller, high-flow therapy, non-invasive ventilation and lots of ventilation. But Jim any further detail you want to share from Mike.\nJamesHollings: Yes. Thanks, Mick. And thanks Mike. I think Mike, and for balancing sort of market versus our portfolios the way I would frame it, I think it's a little bit of both. So if you look at the market, we've thought for a long time that POCs should be reimbursed in a better way than a differential way because they create a lot of value for patients, they allow patients to be mobile and to get out about which is actually better for the care. But especially in the US market reimbursements always been upside down sort of unfavorable to POCs versus stationary. And we enter the category knowing that and we're innovating and we actually feel really good about the product. We had been developing the product, we had a market and the next generation that we were developing, but then you see how reimbursement is not changed and in fact has become less favorable and in relative terms of categories are just not that attractive, right. It doesn't have the same growth that it had five years ago when we enter it as a category, and that sort of thing. And then when you take that line of business and compare it to our overall portfolio in the sleep and respiratory care business, in relative terms, it's not nearly as strong a profile as the other opportunities, we have to invest in innovation, right? So we have a fantastic opportunity to continue to invest in Propeller or health, a fantastic opportunity, it's early days, but a fantastic opportunity to invest in high-flow therapy, which we think has a really interesting clinical profile and could be of great benefit to patients. And then, of course, as we continue to grow our digital offerings, our R&D portfolio there is just plenty of places for us to put R&D into other digital offerings in the expansion of our digital offerings. And so there's both the question of looking at the market and where that category had evolved since we'd entered with that acquisition, but also just looking at the range of opportunities we have in hand and making a decision to invest in things that we think afford more attractive, both for ResMed shareholders and also for patients.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Cooper of Goldman Sachs.\nChrisCooper: Hi, morning and afternoon. Thank you. Most of my near 10 questions have been asked. So just given there's been lots of references to high-flow therapy, today, I guess it would be remiss of me not to just ask you guys for a bit more of a sort of comprehensive update on where you're positioned. And what your strategy is there. I mean, did you guys have what you need in terms of current portfolio or are there some areas that might make sense from sort of a tuck-in perspective? And just generally, I guess your views on market growth and how you fit within that over the quarters and years ahead. I mean the references you made today are indicative clearly of how increasingly important this therapy looks and embrace this therapy markets but that just been keen to get some sense of quantification from you that would be helpful, if that would be possible. Thank you.\nMickFarrell: Thanks for your question, Chris. And look, it's a really exciting new area for us, obviously, with further down the road on Propeller Health and it's starting to move into stage one stage two area. During COVID-19, there were uses of high-flow therapy for patients with low oxygen and it's always been an area that has been looked at. We're interested in, ResMed's 90% of our revenues are in the home, we're really interested in home care, and the idea of high-flow therapy in the home we think has a lot of future. There's not a lot of reimbursement, in fact, virtually zero anywhere around the world. So it's a new development area. But we think, given some of the clinical data that are coming out, and some of the research we're doing with providers around the world, there is an opportunity to get patients out of the hospital and into the home with high-flow therapy treatment, and as a stepping stone on the pathway to our non-invasive ventilators and life support ventilators and in combination with our drug delivery system. So it's very early days, Chris, not at all material to our business, but it provides that sort of bridge portfolio, if you like, from Propeller through to the ventilation side, and we think was validated somewhat during COVID-19. And some clinical data that we are working with people with around the world says that as we look towards 2025, we think this will be a good part of our homecare portfolio of taking care of patients with high-flow therapy.\nChrisCooper: And just a very brief follow up, Mick. So for the homecare opportunity to really manifest in the way you expect do you need reimbursement to become more supportive? Or do you think that the current arrangements would allow that to happen?\nMickFarrell: No, Chris, I think we'd want to see our reimbursement models developed because that's how change happens, right? I mean, it's both the Hippocratic Oath and Adam Smith, if you like that are required to move some areas of healthcare. We've seen that in digital health where we had amazing solutions for over a decade in the field of liberating data to the cloud and driving up adherence and so on. But it was when we started to see models in the US and France and Japan and now Germany, where digital health started to be reimbursed because it is providing care that is of value and then reflecting that for the doctors and the providers and reimbursing in that. So I think reimbursement is a very important part of developing the home care market for high-flow therapy. So obviously, our research and partnerships with payers, providers and IDNs will be along those lines.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Suraj Kalia of Oppenheimer.\nSurajKalia: Good afternoon. Can you hear me all right? Perfect. So Mick a couple of subpart questions related to COVID. Are you seeing any COVID related shifts in the mask replacement cycle now these transients are relatively stickier in nature, and if I could, has COVID identified any manufacturing, location re-optimization that would help you all realize incremental margin gains over the next few years? Thank you for taking my questions.\nMickFarrell: Thanks, Suraj. I'll hand the first question to Jim around replacement rates around masks during COVID and stickiness of that beyond. And then the second part around global manufacturing to Rob Douglas. So Jim you first?\nJamesHollings: Sure. Thanks, Mick thanks Suraj. On mask replacement, I think, what we've seen all year during the pandemic is a couple and we've talked about this, I think on this call, before we've seen a couple of dynamics. The first one is I do think patients are just more attentive to the idea that their equipment might be older, I think there's a greater sensitivity and awareness on behalf of patients to sort of have clean and disinfected reading apparatus, right? I mean, so I think that's driven a bit of incremental demand. And it's an open question as to how persistent and will be, but I would think it's going to be a bit more persistent. I think you'll see patients just more attentive to cleaning their masks and their tubes, and resupply and on a regular cadence. But that's speculation, and you certainly seen it this year. I don't know how long that will continue, or if it will increase and so on. I think the other thing that, of course, has been happening is in the markets where resupply is a benefit, which is largely the US market or other markets where it is for the provider, but the US market, I think HME customers have been, if anything more focused on driving the supply as a part of the business to patients. And so that's been a marriage of two trends where the HME wants to pay attention to the supply, as new patient starts have been slower, and the patient wants the equipment. And I think that behind that, in addition to behind that we've had increasing adoption of automated resupply platforms, including our offerings there. So I think all three of those trends have led to higher resupply overall. And I think it probably will persist, but it's very difficult to predict as all things COVID are.\nRobDouglas: Yes, and Suraj to your question on the manufacturing impact, the whole issue around COVID been very challenging for supply chains, and freight trains, all over the world, for many, many companies. And I think like many companies, we are carefully looking at the resilience of our supply chain through there. There are other issues going on around politics and trade relationships that we've got to work. Some of these are going to be beneficial as you talk about margins and some of the headwinds. And I think as we continue to scale our business, we should be able to run faster than those headwinds over time.\nOperator: We are now at the end of the scheduled time for the call. So I'll turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Shentel. And thanks again to all our shareholders for joining us on today's call. I'd like to once again take the opportunity to thank the 7,500 ResMedians, almost all of them are our shareholders for their dedication and hard work helping people sleep better, breathe better, and live better lives outside the hospital in over 140 countries. Thanks for all that you do today and every day. Thanks especially to our ResMed heroes on the front lines, production, distribution, tech service, customer service, talking to customers and delivering product every day. I look forward to talking with all of our stakeholders here again in 90 days. Thank you, Amy, over to you.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Mick. And thank you all again for joining us today. I know we weren't able to get to all the questions in the queue. So please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly if you've got anything further. And as previously mentioned, all the documents along with the transcript and a replay of today's call will be available on our website later today. Shentel, you may now go ahead and close out the call.\nOperator: This concludes ResMed's second quarter of fiscal year 2021 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brett Sandercock",
            "content": "Right. Thanks Nick. Norman. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter fiscal year 2021. And some remarks on our FY21 second half outlook. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior quarter. As Mick noted we had a strong quarter. Total revenue for the December quarter was $800 million, an increase of 9% than the prior quarter, and in constant currency terms revenue increased by 7%. Consistent with our predictions in Q1 earnings call, we derive minimal incremental revenue from COVID-19 related demand in the December quarter. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business, our sales in US, Canada and Latin America countries were $427 million, an increase of 5%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $291 million; increases of 17% were in constant currency terms and increase of 10%. By product segment, US, Canada and Latin America device sales were $205 million, an increase in 1%. Masks and others sales were $222 million, an increase of 8%. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales total $188 million, an increase of 16%. When in constant currency terms a 10% increase. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $93 million, an increase 18% when in constant currency terms and increase of 12%. Globally in constant currency term, device sales increased by 5%, while mask and other sales increased by 9%. Software as a service revenue for the second quarter was $92 million, an increase of 6%. On non-GAAP basis, SaaS revenue increased by 5%. During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring expenses, the purchase accounting fair value adjustment that makes it clear deferred revenue, litigation settlement expenses and the fair value adjustment of equity investments. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin improved by 20 basis points to 59.9% in the December quarter compared to 59.7% in the same quarter last. The increase is predominantly attributable to manufacturing efficiencies, favorable product exchanges and foreign exchange rates, partially offset by declines in average selling prices. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the second quarter were $169 million, a decrease of 1%. On a constant currency terms, SG&A expenses decreased by 3%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 21.2% compared to the 23.3% recorded in the prior quarter. Benefiting from cost management and reduced travel as a result of COVID-19 restrictions. Looking forward with SG&A expenses in the second half of FY21 to increase in the low single digits relative to the prior year period. R&D expenses for the quarter were $55 million, an increase of 10% or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 7%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.9% compared to 6.8% in the prior year. We continue to provide for further investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product and solution development will deliver sustained and competitive advantage. Looking forward we expect R&D expenses to continue to grow year-over-year in a high single digit reflecting this commitment to innovation. Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $19 million for the quarter, and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $15 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $254 million, an increase of 16% reflecting strong top-line growth, expansion of gross margin, and well contained operating expenses. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 14.8%, while on a non-GAAP basis our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.3%. We continue to expect our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2021 will be in the range of 17% to 19%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $206 million, an increase of 17%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.41, also a 17% increase. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.23. During the December quarter, we closed our portable oxygen concentrator business. We recognized that restructuring expenses of $13.9 million associated with the closure. Going forward the cessation of the POC business will have an immaterial impact on both group revenue and earnings per share. We did not expect to incur additional expenses in connection with this activity in the future. And we have adjusted for this one-time expense within our non-GAAP results for the quarter. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $170 million reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by increases in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $35 million. Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter total $41 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $57 million. We recorded equity losses of $3.6 in our income statement in the December quarter associated with Verily joint venture. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $5million per quarter in the second half of FY21 associated with the joint venture operation. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $256 million. At December 31, we had $826 million in gross debt and $570 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. At December 31, we had a further $1.4 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, reflecting the board's confidence in our strong liquidity position and operating performance. Our total cash flow and liquidity provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. We've focused on paying down debt as well as ensuring we have cash reserves to support the company through the uncertainty caused by the ongoing pandemic. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest to grow through R&D. We will also likely deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions such as Snap which we completed during the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. We intend to continue returning cash to shareholders through our dividend program and we might also resume our share buyback program some time during the calendar year. This program has been on par since our acquisition of MatrixCare and Propeller Health in fiscal 2019. Turning now to our FY21 outlook. At a high level, we are now seeing a negligible COVID-19-generated demand for our ventilators and do not expect any incremental benefit in the second half of FY21.Q2. Note as a reminder we recorded $35 million in COVID generated ventilator revenue in our March quarter last year. And $125 million COVID generated ventilator revenue in our June quarter last year. Mask and accessories have continued to demonstrate resilience and growth over the past 12 months, reflecting the insulating value of the large patient installed base and the success of our resupply service offering. We expect to see continued year-on-year growth of our mask sales in the second half of FY21. Notwithstanding continued COVID-19 challenges, we continue to expect the sequential increase in new sleep patients that should support our devices as we move through the second half of FY21. However, we typically experienced a small seasonal sequential decline in revenue from Q2 to Q3, largely attributable to reset of deductibles and health insurance plans in our US market. We expect this trend will also be apparent in FY21. Of course, like many other companies, we continue to experience significant uncertainty in the current environment, including the potential disruptive impacts of ongoing restrictions imposed in many of the countries we operate in. As a result, our forecast and possible future revenue outcomes remain dynamic. And with that, I'll hand call back to Amy. Yes, thank you. Sure. Thanks Mick. Thanks, Andrew. Yes, I mean, we had if you look through the year-on-year 20 basis point expansion. So it was kind of a moderate expansion. So those moving parts that I talked about and those impacts are pretty much or pretty small overall. The mix, pretty much they kind of had that strong mask crisis it's going to underpin that product mix. If you look that, year-on-year little bit of benefit from some effects but pretty minor. And then on ASPs, again, it's I'd characterize a pretty benign environment from a pricing perspective, and that's probably reflected in that pretty small movements in the gross margin year-on-year. Yes, [Multiple Speakers] historic context. I think it's a pretty benign environment for us relative to historical trends."

            "content": "Yes, let's just cross off the last point, Saul, I saw that there wasn't any kind of changes or issues in any of those markets, particularly. But across the board it was really interesting. We sort of had strong performance in many, many countries. Usually the countries are wary and some are strong and some aren't so on a given time, but it looked like there was pretty good strong performance. And we think the same underlying fundamentals that we've talked about, particularly in the US market. We're applying at different scales on these markets. And so in many small markets, we saw the uptake of that digital solutions being really strong. And in fact that underpinning that in our own technology base. In fact, actually a really good performance for that. Our technology team is meeting those digital requirements in each of the different countries as well. And then it was just really sort of patient demand for making sure their treatment is up to scratch. Really good, and we saw that dynamics across the board. The whole issue of the resurgence didn't seem to have quite effected that you might have thought because I think the health systems have learn that they actually didn't need to shut down everything in the health system and they knew what they can keep open. And so then the sort of the diagnosis processes and that kept going on. As Mick said before, things aren't yet back to fully open and normal. But the whole system's striving to get there. And additional things that have taken home sleep testing in some markets have been supportive as well. So it's really our whole suite of solutions is supporting a market that needs to treat these patients if it is going. Yes, and Suraj to your question on the manufacturing impact, the whole issue around COVID been very challenging for supply chains, and freight trains, all over the world, for many, many companies. And I think like many companies, we are carefully looking at the resilience of our supply chain through there. There are other issues going on around politics and trade relationships that we've got to work. Some of these are going to be beneficial as you talk about margins and some of the headwinds. And I think as we continue to scale our business, we should be able to run faster than those headwinds over time."

            "content": "Sorry, can you hear me now? It's a terrible way to enter the call. Thank you for the question. Thanks, Mick. I think that what we've seen this year is benign is maybe too softer word for price. But I'll go with benign. We've had a pretty stable pricing environment; I think in anticipation of - the market was anticipating the competitive bid rates. And then of course, competitive bid got delayed. And obviously, the Adapt Health acquisition of Arikare creates an even larger customer for us; they're very important customer for us. And we enjoy a very good relationship with them. I think both with that move. And then with ongoing trends into the year, we should see something that looks like more normal pricing environment, I think, in the second half of the fiscal year and going forward. And it'll be a little bit different by market as it always is, but I would expect it to be kind of back in a more normal trend. Yes. Thanks, Mick. And thanks Mike. I think Mike, and for balancing sort of market versus our portfolios the way I would frame it, I think it's a little bit of both. So if you look at the market, we've thought for a long time that POCs should be reimbursed in a better way than a differential way because they create a lot of value for patients, they allow patients to be mobile and to get out about which is actually better for the care. But especially in the US market reimbursements always been upside down sort of unfavorable to POCs versus stationary. And we enter the category knowing that and we're innovating and we actually feel really good about the product. We had been developing the product, we had a market and the next generation that we were developing, but then you see how reimbursement is not changed and in fact has become less favorable and in relative terms of categories are just not that attractive, right. It doesn't have the same growth that it had five years ago when we enter it as a category, and that sort of thing. And then when you take that line of business and compare it to our overall portfolio in the sleep and respiratory care business, in relative terms, it's not nearly as strong a profile as the other opportunities, we have to invest in innovation, right? So we have a fantastic opportunity to continue to invest in Propeller or health, a fantastic opportunity, it's early days, but a fantastic opportunity to invest in high-flow therapy, which we think has a really interesting clinical profile and could be of great benefit to patients. And then, of course, as we continue to grow our digital offerings, our R&D portfolio there is just plenty of places for us to put R&D into other digital offerings in the expansion of our digital offerings. And so there's both the question of looking at the market and where that category had evolved since we'd entered with that acquisition, but also just looking at the range of opportunities we have in hand and making a decision to invest in things that we think afford more attractive, both for ResMed shareholders and also for patients. Sure. Thanks, Mick thanks Suraj. On mask replacement, I think, what we've seen all year during the pandemic is a couple and we've talked about this, I think on this call, before we've seen a couple of dynamics. The first one is I do think patients are just more attentive to the idea that their equipment might be older, I think there's a greater sensitivity and awareness on behalf of patients to sort of have clean and disinfected reading apparatus, right? I mean, so I think that's driven a bit of incremental demand. And it's an open question as to how persistent and will be, but I would think it's going to be a bit more persistent. I think you'll see patients just more attentive to cleaning their masks and their tubes, and resupply and on a regular cadence. But that's speculation, and you certainly seen it this year. I don't know how long that will continue, or if it will increase and so on. I think the other thing that, of course, has been happening is in the markets where resupply is a benefit, which is largely the US market or other markets where it is for the provider, but the US market, I think HME customers have been, if anything more focused on driving the supply as a part of the business to patients. And so that's been a marriage of two trends where the HME wants to pay attention to the supply, as new patient starts have been slower, and the patient wants the equipment. And I think that behind that, in addition to behind that we've had increasing adoption of automated resupply platforms, including our offerings there. So I think all three of those trends have led to higher resupply overall. And I think it probably will persist, but it's very difficult to predict as all things COVID are."

            "content": "Yes, Matt, at least in the US there actually are some pretty straightforward dollar investment and time requirements that go into reimbursement for a lot of payers. And the fact of the matter is, PHP equipments a lot more expensive to purchase, more expensive to operate, and it takes more time from both the physician and the facility. So that's what they're looking at more so than necessarily the incentives that are driven by the lower cost of home sleep testing. And the higher reimbursement rate of PSG. We certainly support good PSG when it's appropriate for the patient, and there's a lot of sleep labs that have invested a lot of capital, they invest a lot of time for their staff in that. And it's important that they be reimbursed adequately. So they both have their place in the market. But I think it's generally those sorts of things that go into their reimbursement decisions, not necessarily what outcomes are they trying to drive."

            "content": "Thanks Amy. And thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us on today's call. On this our first call for calendar year 2021. We are happy to see the steady growth of production, distribution and availability of vaccines around the world. Clearly, we all want to see faster production and wider distribution so that people can be safe from COVID-19 and free to open up their communities and free to get back to their lives. We continue our work here at ResMed to support frontline respiratory therapists and pulmonary physicians, critical care physicians as well as providers, patients and Resmedian around the 140 plus countries that we operate in. In our core markets, the patient diagnosis trends in sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma are steadily increasing, modestly improving on the trends we saw in the September 2020 quarter. We're seeing this improvement of patient flow even as second and third waves come through northern winter hemisphere nations, because physicians and providers are adopting digital health, which enables patient engagement, even when people cannot or do not want to meet live and in person. In my remarks today, I will provide a high-level overview of our December Q2, FY21 business results and then hand the call over to Brett for further detail on the financials. I will also review progress towards our ResMed 2025 strategic goals, including execution highlights against our quarterly and annual operating priorities. Today, we have published and reported solid, high single digit growth in top line revenue and strong double-digit growth in both net operating profit as well as earnings per share. These results once again speak to our ResMed team's ability to work innovatively and deliver results, even when facing lower patient activity and little to no incremental benefit from ventilator sales. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we generated over $170 million of cash, allowing us to return over $57 million in dividends to shareholders. We have also grown research and development investments in digital health technology as well as hardware, software and clinical research. We forecast increasing digital health demand from patients from physicians from providers and from healthcare systems as they embrace remote patient monitoring, and they adopt data driven population health management systems. We have an exciting pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium and long-term value for our customers with an industry leading IP portfolio including over 6,000 patents and designs. Our digital health ecosystem is an important competitive advantage for ResMed that offers integrated care to drive superior clinical outcomes, to drive better patient experiences. And to drive lower health care system costs. We now have over 8 billion nights of respiratory medical data in our cloud-based air solutions platform. We have sold over 13.5 million, 100% Cloud connectable medical devices into the market from ResMed. And we have over 15 million patients enrolled in our AirView Solutions in the cloud. With these data liberated to the cloud, we can unlock value for all of our customer groups. We can unlock value for patients through Maya, we can unlock value for physicians through AirView, and we can unlock value for IDNs payer providers as well as private and government insurance for data driven population health management. That's the future of healthcare. The goals we share with all of our customer are these three. One to improve patient outcomes, patient quality of life, patient chronic disease outcomes. Two, to lower overall healthcare system costs, and three to bend the curve of chronic disease progression. To be clear, the spectrum of chronic diseases that we look at here at ResMed are of course, including our core focus areas of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma, but it also includes biological systems interaction with cardiovascular disease, with cancer, with type two diabetes with neuromuscular disease, Alzheimer's and beyond. During our last earnings call, I discussed how COVID has continued to accelerate the rapid adoption of digital health technology around the world. We are seeing the recognition of the value of Remote Patient screen, virtual diagnoses, Remote Patient Management, and the rapid evolution of digital reimbursement models in many of the nations that we serve patients. As an example of just one of these Germany during the quarter, approved reimbursement for mandibular repositioning devices including our digital 3D printed dental sleep apnea product called NARVAL. This is the first time Germany has approved such a product type to treat sleep apnea. In addition, several German states looking at experimenting with digital Health Reimbursement models. These are exciting developments and we expect this will benefit our German business over time. We've also seen other national governments including France, Japan, and the United States, where they've adopted models and taken action to accelerate digital health adoption. Remote healthcare is of incredible importance during this COVID-19 pandemic. But digital health is also valuable well beyond the impact of COVID because it provides better availability of healthcare. It provides excellent quality care for patients, and it provides significantly lower costs for healthcare systems worldwide. These trends are key to ResMed's 2025 strategy. We believe the accelerated adoption of digital Health Solutions represents a significant and permanent shift of the adoption curve for ResMed market leading digital health solutions. Let me now briefly update you on our top three strategic priorities. These three priorities are one to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses. Two, to design, develop and deliver world leading medical devices as well as globally scalable digital health solutions. And three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital, and especially in the home. In our core market of sleep apnea, we continue to see sequential improvement in new patient diagnosis trends, as well as very strong resupply activity, both of which has supported another quarter of solid revenue growth that you can see in the numbers we just released. Within 70% to 90% of the pre-COVID patient flow coming through our biggest market in the United States. And to take an example of a European country in Germany, we're already back to 85% to 90 plus percent in some states of Germany of pre-COVID patient flow. Even in countries like China, in our large Asia region, where we saw the sharpest declines at the start of this crisis with very severe lockdowns in Asia and particularly in China, we're now back to already seeing around 70 plus percent 70% to 75% of pre-COVID patient flow coming through the mainly hospital clinics in our China market. Obviously, the recovery rates of new patients starting sleep apnea therapy may be impacted by the typical seasonality we see in our largest market here in the United States in the March quarter. As a result of insurance deductibles resetting at the start of the calendar year this is as per normal. This seasonal impact affects devices more than it affects mask systems, given the relative price points of the two categories, and the fact that the vast majority of mask revenue is returning customers on resupply programs. The resiliency of our mask and accessory resupply has been strong throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. And we see it as remaining strong through the recovery and strong in a post-COVID Peak world. We continue to produce clinical research showing that diagnosing and treating sleep apnea saves money and improves quality of life for patients. This quarter, we are now showing data that treating sleep apnea is actually a life and death decision. The latest data from the European Respiratory Journal, which published during the quarter results from a 30-year study. The high-level summary of these results were that treating sleep apnea increases patient quality of life and extends quantity of life. It also showed the commerce side in that not trading sleep apnea leads to a significantly higher incidence of heart attack, type 2 diabetes and ischemic heart disease, leading to significantly higher healthcare costs, treating those diseases and ultimately leading to early death. Let me now turn from sleep apnea to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve COPD, and asthma patients worldwide. Our goal is to reach more patients in our core Respiratory Care markets, including non-invasive ventilation, as well as life support ventilation, as well as newer areas including pharmaceutical, drug delivery, and high-flow therapy. We make the smallest quietest and most comfortable devices on the market. And they are all 100% Cloud connectable. We continue to see rapid adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe in the midst of the peak of the COVID-19 crisis there about nine months ago; we accelerated the time to market to meet the needs of physicians and patients during the COVID peak. And it's proved to be very useful during the peak and beyond the peak. The value being provided for this platform has helped healthcare systems in the markets they operate in, where we ensure we are making digital health part of the standard of care for Respiratory Care, not just in Europe, but worldwide. During the quarter we decided to exit the portable oxygen market and shut down our concentrator business in that category. We entered the POC market in 2016 as a way to engage with stage two and stage three COPD patients. Since then, and these last five years we have acquired Propeller giving us access to COPD patients even earlier in their COPD disease progression, including stage one and stage two COPD patients. Additionally, and especially during COVID, we've seen more rapid adoption of high flow therapy that can support some COPD patients. And of course, we have our core, non-invasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for more severe COPD patients in markets globally already. In short, we don't need POC to help in our end-to-end digital health pathway for COPD. Additionally, given no positive changes to POC reimbursement in the latest round from the US government, and the economics of our customer acquisition cost versus lifetime value, the POC market itself is not as attractive as it was five years ago. The bottom line is this; we have pharmaceutical drug delivery management through Propeller to support COPD patients in stage one and stage two COPD. We have the emergence of high-flow therapy for stage two and stage three COPD. And we have growing use of non-invasive ventilation and life support ventilation to support patients in stage three and stage four COPD. So in summary, we are very well positioned to help patients, physicians, providers and payers with an end-to-end digital health management pathway for COPD. Let me now review our software as a service business. During the quarter our SaaS business grew in the mid-single digits year-on-year, driven by continued strong uptake of our Brightree HME resupply solutions. Impact of COVID on surgical procedures and other in hospital and out of hospital visits has impacted discharge rates that particularly affect the census at skilled nursing facilities and hospice. On the other hand, the flow of patients in home medical equipment and home health has been recovering well even stronger. So as we look across our portfolio of out of hospital care settings, including home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, home health and hospice, life plan communities, private duty home care and senior living, we expect that the weighted average market growth rate of these verticals will be in the low to mid single digit range for fiscal 2021. We expect this weighted average market growth rate portfolio to return to mid-single digits and then to high single digits. As hospital discharge and ambulatory surgery center discharge rates return. Our offerings are very well received in each of the verticals that we serve. So we will not just accept these market growth rates, we will look to meet and beat that group market growth rate as we did this quarter, getting a return from our significant investments in R&D within Brightree and MatrixCare. And through expansion of our partnerships with hospital based electronic health record providers. Brightree continues to innovate to drive resupply growth. Of particular note the integration and scaling of the Snap Technologies is going very well. This has allowed our home medical equipment customers to expand their resupply programs and support more patients with better engagement at a time during the COVID pandemic when they desperately need new innovation both the providers and the patients. MatrixCare has also introduced new technology; we introduce new voice to text technology at the point of care, which helps address caregiver shortages which are right during COVID by enabling better and more efficient workflows for the customer, while also delivering a better experience for the ultimate customer who's the patient. Our expanded relationship with Cerner is progressing very well. We are now Cerner's preferred solution across home health and hospice, as well as her medical equipment and their pharmacy and infusion businesses. Our increasingly important relationship with Cerner is leading to better interoperability for providers and mutual customers and an improved experience for patients. We anticipate opportunities to deepen and expand this collaboration to sleep apnea and COPD disease management. Clearly, 2020 was an unprecedented year for companies across every industry, and there was much suffering around the world. However, we see some blessings during all that suffering. Importantly, we hear it resonated we were able to be there during the emergency. We were able to pivot our whole team and our home business to provide over 150,000 ventilators during the peak needs of the endemic and get them to where they needed based upon a humanitarian epidemiology model. Additionally, COVID has highlighted the importance of respiratory health. COVID generally kills people through acute respiratory distress syndrome and awful but that has raised the awareness of respiratory hygiene, respiratory health and the field of respiratory medicine. The crisis also showed us the importance of digital health, and has accelerated the awareness and adoption of technologies that can be used for remote patient screening for remote patient diagnosis, Remote Patient setup, as well as remote patient monitoring and management. We have seen this crisis drive the importance of healthcare delivered outside the hospital. And that's where ResMed competes to more than 90% of our business. And it's where we add value to customers and where we win. We have seen an ability to bring digital technology that we've been inventing and developing for over a decade, digital screening, digital diagnostics, digital therapeutics, and digital health management of patients. With over 1.5 billion people worldwide suffering from sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma combined, we see incredible opportunities for greater and greater adoption of these scalable technologies. We are poised to continue relentless innovation and development, as well as to provide the global scale that's needed to drive this technology to the 140 countries that we operate in and beyond. Before I hand the coal over to Brett for his remarks, and then we get to the Q&A, I want to once again express my sincere genuine gratitude to the more than 7,500 ResMedians whose perseverance, hard work and dedication during the incredibly challenging circumstances for 2020 allowed our partners in healthcare to save the lives of many hundreds of 1000s of people around the world with emergency needs for ventilation, literally giving the gift of breath and the gift of life to many during COVID. I also thank you for the rapid pivot back to our core markets and our core purpose of helping people with sleep apnea, COPD, asthma, and all those who need world class care delivered well away from the hospital, and preferably in their own time. Thank you. With that I will hand the call over to Brett in Sydney and then we'll move to Q&A. Brett? Thanks for the question, Margaret. And yes, clearly in the December quarter, we had as we predicted sort of the minimis ventilator sales a little bit in Northern Europe, perhaps, but not material across the group. And as Brett said in the remarks just now from him, and I said as well, we expect no sort of COVID related than later sales throughout the rest of the fiscal year and beyond. People have enough in the hospitals, which is great. And so yes, look, it does start to form a good a good base, when you look at the core business of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patient flow. I mean, as we said, the seasonality, usually from Q2, December quarter to Q3 March quarter relating to the US market and deductibles, and so on. But for the other 139 countries we're in and across the portfolio, so it's a good base to start to, to get that slow and steady improvement in the patient flow in this new digital health driven world, Margaret. Our patients going to primary care on zoom and telemedicine and getting referrals to their specialists and coming through the pipeline. And so we think it's better for the long term, but it is slowly and steadily coming back from advice. And yes, as we said, sort of in those numbers of the percentage flow patients as best we can see it. We saw improvement from September to December. And so those in takings up vent sales over that 90-day period as well. Yes, it's interesting. And we certainly think sort of modest, sort of single digit improvements in overall adherence, as we look at the big data, and we're actually doing a whole bunch of research on this to understand the sort of kinetics and dynamics of COVID-19 on the market. I think really early stage instead of March, April, people, there was a lot of things going around, and maybe using a CPAP would bring more virus in the room if you have other people room. So some fear and uncertainty and doubt in that early period. But I think that was all covered over by doctors saying listen, if you get treated for sleep apnea, it's actually preventative and improving your lungs and lower impact and severity of COVID-19. And again, look, there's so much clinical literature out there in terms of the general press, but through the scientific data, we are able to see people are adhering, those who are adhering more and sleeping more and using the devices more. And David, to your point, they're participating more in those resupply programs; they are seeing the importance of respiratory hygiene and respiratory health. And when they get a text response, or an app click and a chance to say yes, I want that new mask, I want that new tubing, I want that new humidifier, they putting it at much higher rates and getting closer to, frankly, what they should have always done, which is keeping respiratory hygiene at top of mind. So I would say modest improvements in overall adherence and more significant improvements in the probability that a person says, who is adherent says, I want to get that mask with that copay. I want to get that mask now to get resupply and in cash markets, same thing as well. So it's a really good question, David. It's a complex equation. We're working through all the variables, but yes, modest improvement in adherence and really good improvement in mask resupply as you saw in the numbers, as well as you saw in the health of the patients. Lyanne, it's a good question. And like David's, it's complex, because there's 140 countries all adopting digital health at different rates, and all having different sort of national rules around retail and restaurants as well as how you get back to life and back to health care as well. Healthcare has proved pretty resilient, I think, because people know, it's an essential industry. And the data that I shared earlier around truly life and death decision of using your CPAP or not for treating sleep apnea. I mean, it's incredible to have those data in the hands of our physicians worldwide as they are driving adherence. It's one thing to be doing a digital telemedicine call with a patient over a zoom or secure network, it's another one to say, listen, using this device will save your life, as well as improve your quality of life. And so the numbers of plus or minus 10% anyway, and that's why the ranges are so broad. But look, here the US key market is somewhere between 70 to 90% of pre-COVID patient flow as best we can measure it by at the link air usage by essence 10 sort of air solutions, activations of new devices and reactivations of resupply devices. And it's not perfect data. And it's different in all the 50 states just in the country that I'm living in here, between California, Massachusetts, and Florida, very different areas of opening up of their whole economies on local and state regulation. But that range is pretty broad, but it's pretty accurate in terms of the patient flow through. And that's why I think you've seen people really participating in masks and accessory resupply programs, but a slowdown, obviously a new patient starts. And as you pointed out the kinetics of it. Yes, true from the September quarter, I think we moved up sort of somewhere between 5% and 10% in each of the key markets, I talked about US, China and Germany as examples for Americas, Europe and Asia. So that's 5%, 10% 500 basis points, plus improvement in the quarter it's not this V shape, we're back to 100%, December 2019. Again, but it's a slow, steady sort of U-shaped improvement in the flow of patients, which we think does then over time flow through with all the systems and all the restrictions and portfolio of 140 countries through to patients getting set up and started on a lifetime of therapy on sleep apnea or COPD therapy. Thank you, thanks for the question. So I'll have a little bit of a go at it. And then hand to Rob Douglas, our COO beside me here to provide more detail. Look as I said, there was some modest sales of ventilators in western and northern Europe during the quarter that'll flow into the devices number at plus 10% constant currency, and then the masks at plus 12% constant currency. Again, this is Europe, Asia, and the whole entire rest of worlds, and so we're talking 135 plus countries. And so, Rob, do you want to have a go at summarizing that is for sale singly. Thanks for the question, Matt. I think the payer community and it varies. Take the example of the United States where it's probably 25% government reimbursement and 75% if you like in our sleep PAP but seems like sleep apnea sales of private payers, they were very supportive of both in lab and in home with apnea testing. And if you look at this country pre-COVID was probably about 45% home sleep apnea testing versus 55% in lab. I think that's moved up very significantly during COVID. Obviously, during the peak of the lockdowns it went very high. And it will probably level out somewhere in that 50%, 55%, 60% range of the diagnoses being home sleep apnea testing. Plus often have deltas of anything you can vary from $250 for home sleep apnea test and $750 - $800 for in lab test, just relative to the cost over there. Obviously, for the payer they would want if it's clinically equivalent patient and good sensitivity, specificity of the data and good patient outcomes, and patient satisfaction as well the payers care about, they would flow towards home sleep apnea testing, where they can go. But look I'll hand over David Pendarvis to add any further color on that dynamic. Brett, let's see it. Yes, Sean, it's a great question. And yes, you're right, look at what Propeller that acquisition is about 24 months old so that what that allowed us to do is to get to patients much earlier in the COPD development cycle. It's really stage one, COPD, where you have that shortness of breath, climbing a flight of stairs, and you go to see the primary care diagnosis and find out that you do have some lung dysfunction. And this broad category called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; you get put in that bucket. And there are many different types of therapies that the doctor can go to, but a lot of them are those pharmaceutical therapies up front. And those inhalers are not used as prescribed when they just given a prescription. The sign is when a pill is prescribed for high cholesterol or low blood pressure the adherence rates are very low in the general population 50% plus or minus. And with Propeller Health we are able to drive those adherence rates up double digits on a relative basis and drive to incredible adherence rates that the pharma industry just hasn't seen in respiratory medicine. And so Propeller technology is really exciting. It's really new. We have major global pharmaceutical companies partnering with us in major markets driving that. Early days but we think that allows us to get to stage one stage two patients in a very significant, scalable way to get them on that sort of end-to-end, digital health journey in COPD. As they progress to stage two, stage three, they sometimes get prescriptions for high-flow therapy, oxygen and ventilation, right. And so with it with non-invasive ventilation, and life support ventilation, which is really stage three, stage four, and in that sort of crossover phase from the pharmaceuticals to the ventilator, both oxygen and high flow therapy used. High-flow therapy is newer and more scaling. And we think more related to our core business and the core devices we make. And it allows us to treat the patients and take care of the patients. And so PSC just became an additional one that wasn't as important in that end-to-end journey, and certainly didn't have the sort of margin profile or the growth profile with the changes in reimbursement to allow us to have the same growth opportunity that we have in non-invasive ventilation and life support ventilation. So that's sort of it in a nutshell. Thanks for the question, Gretel. I'll hand that to the President of our Global Sleep and Respiratory Care Business. Jim, over to you. Yes, thanks for the question. David, and clearly Brightree had strong growth driven by the strength of our home medical equipment, customers and their ability to pivot their businesses to mask and resupply, and the great adoption of Brightree resupply sort of our core resupply software there. But also the Snap Technologies acquisition that we closed almost exactly a year ago, we were doing due diligence a year ago and closed it sort of later on during this March quarter. And so those two technologies have been very well adopted. But look, in addition to that our Brightree team it's a significant double-digit percent of their revenues in R&D, they've delivered a whole bunch of innovation, some COVID related management opportunities for their HME customers, as well as other innovative ways to grow their business. And so that's allowed the Brightree business to support HMEs and really help them survive and thrive in the early stages, and later stages of COVID-19. And it's great help to the industry. And I'm really proud that ResMed and Brightree are able to deliver that. On the MatrixCare side, yes, it's a tougher story, because the verticals that they operate in will more severely affected skilled nursing facility, census was down high double digits the peak of the crisis and still is down year-on-year on the number of patients in skilled nursing facility operations, and that impacts MatrixCare census rights and ability to grow. In addition, hospice affected similarly, on the other hand home health has been a growth light within the MatrixCare area, and the addition of our MatrixCare branded, but it's healthcare first Brightree and MatrixCare technologies, all combined under the MatrixCare brand has been growing really well. And the Glen and his team who is the VP who's driving that has seen incredible growth in home health and hospice. And I think if you look across that portfolio, what sort of a guy that we deal with because it's you can go through all the verticals in detail is that we think that weighted average market growth rate is needed to have loading in single digits right now. You saw we grew 6% in the quarter. So we're growing a little bit ahead of market taking a little - some of those verticals. But as the weighted average market growth rate goes to mid-single digits, we're going to look to meet and do that. And then when it gets back to high single digits, as the flow of patients from hospitals, and ambulatory surgery centers, picks up, we will then see skilled nursing facilities, hospice and all the verticals, pick up their census rights and get us back to those sorts of growth rates and beyond the time. So, David, it's really sort of part related to the whole recovery of the economy, and that really related to the hospital what people are calling elective surgeries. And I think if you need a heart valve, or a new hip, it's hardly elective when the pain or the probability of death starts going up. And I think healthcare systems are really starting to address that and get their patients back into care. So we should start to see those recoveries over time. Thanks for the question, Mike. Like I'll - I said, what I said in the prepared remarks and the question before, maybe I'll hand to Jim Hollings for any further detail. I mean we have the end-to-end play with all that we have in, our core capabilities of Propeller, high-flow therapy, non-invasive ventilation and lots of ventilation. But Jim any further detail you want to share from Mike. Thanks for your question, Chris. And look, it's a really exciting new area for us, obviously, with further down the road on Propeller Health and it's starting to move into stage one stage two area. During COVID-19, there were uses of high-flow therapy for patients with low oxygen and it's always been an area that has been looked at. We're interested in, ResMed's 90% of our revenues are in the home, we're really interested in home care, and the idea of high-flow therapy in the home we think has a lot of future. There's not a lot of reimbursement, in fact, virtually zero anywhere around the world. So it's a new development area. But we think, given some of the clinical data that are coming out, and some of the research we're doing with providers around the world, there is an opportunity to get patients out of the hospital and into the home with high-flow therapy treatment, and as a stepping stone on the pathway to our non-invasive ventilators and life support ventilators and in combination with our drug delivery system. So it's very early days, Chris, not at all material to our business, but it provides that sort of bridge portfolio, if you like, from Propeller through to the ventilation side, and we think was validated somewhat during COVID-19. And some clinical data that we are working with people with around the world says that as we look towards 2025, we think this will be a good part of our homecare portfolio of taking care of patients with high-flow therapy. No, Chris, I think we'd want to see our reimbursement models developed because that's how change happens, right? I mean, it's both the Hippocratic Oath and Adam Smith, if you like that are required to move some areas of healthcare. We've seen that in digital health where we had amazing solutions for over a decade in the field of liberating data to the cloud and driving up adherence and so on. But it was when we started to see models in the US and France and Japan and now Germany, where digital health started to be reimbursed because it is providing care that is of value and then reflecting that for the doctors and the providers and reimbursing in that. So I think reimbursement is a very important part of developing the home care market for high-flow therapy. So obviously, our research and partnerships with payers, providers and IDNs will be along those lines. Thanks, Suraj. I'll hand the first question to Jim around replacement rates around masks during COVID and stickiness of that beyond. And then the second part around global manufacturing to Rob Douglas. So Jim you first? Thanks, Shentel. And thanks again to all our shareholders for joining us on today's call. I'd like to once again take the opportunity to thank the 7,500 ResMedians, almost all of them are our shareholders for their dedication and hard work helping people sleep better, breathe better, and live better lives outside the hospital in over 140 countries. Thanks for all that you do today and every day. Thanks especially to our ResMed heroes on the front lines, production, distribution, tech service, customer service, talking to customers and delivering product every day. I look forward to talking with all of our stakeholders here again in 90 days. Thank you, Amy, over to you."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.\n I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin. \nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Cheryl. Hello, everyone, and welcome to ResMed's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Call. Thanks for joining us. As Cheryl said, this webcast -- this call is being webcast live and the replay along with a copy of the earnings press release and the quarterly results presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today.\n On the call today to discuss our quarterly results are our CEO Mick Farrell and CFO Brett Sandercock. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion following our prepared remarks.\n During today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, please review the notes to today's earnings release and earnings presentation. As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions; however, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today.\n And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Mick. \nMichael Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you all for joining us today. Since this COVID-19 pandemic began in January, ResMed has produced hundreds of thousands of ventilators, providing the gift of breath to people in need in 140 countries worldwide. We continue to support frontline respiratory medical professionals, health care providers, patients and our teammates, ResMedians, so they are all safe and healthy. We also continue to provide ventilators as local state and national health care providers are facing second and third waves of COVID-19 cases and associated hospitalizations. Thankfully, the magnitude of these hospitalization waves and thus, the need for emergency ventilators is decreasing over time.\n In our core markets, the patient diagnosis trends in sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and beyond are steadily increasing as well as prescription therapy flow from those diagnoses. Growing numbers of people are returning to health care systems, including primary care as well as specialist care. We are seeing more health care systems come back online through telehealth and in-person visits. Overall treatment capacity as well as capacity utilization rates of those systems are both increasing. We have seen a steady sequential, what we would call U-shape recovery of patient flow to primary care physicians as well as then to specialist physicians across the 140 countries that we serve. This is just as we forecast 90 days ago on our Q4 earnings call. We expect this same patient flow growth trend to continue throughout fiscal year 2021.\n In my remarks today, I'll provide a high-level overview of our Q1 business results, and then I'll hand over to Brett to walk us through further detail. I will also review progress towards our ResMed 2025 strategic goals, including execution highlights against our quarterly as well as our annual operating priorities.\n Today, we have reported high single-digit growth in top line revenue and strong double-digit growth in both net operating profit as well as earnings per share. These results speak to our team's ability to nimbly pivot to meet short-term needs for emergency ventilators, while also investing for the long-term growth in our core markets of sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and out-of-hospital medical software.\n Our investments in research and development for digital health technology have accelerated these last 9 months as we see increasing demand from patients, physicians, providers as well as health care systems as they embrace digital health through remote patient engagement as well as population health management technology.\n During the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we generated over $144 million of cash, allowing us to return $57 million of cash as dividends to our shareholders. At the same time, though, we have increased our research and development investments at double-digit rates, including investments in digital health clinical research as well as hardware and software innovation across both our med tech and our Software as a Service businesses. We have a very full pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium and long-term value for customers with an industry-leading intellectual property portfolio of over 6,000 patents and designs.\n Our digital health ecosystem is an important competitive advantage for ResMed that offers integrated care to drive superior clinical outcomes, to drive better patient experiences and to drive lower total health care system costs. We now have over 7 billion nights of respiratory medical data in our cloud-based Air Solutions platform. We've provided over 12.5 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices to customers, and we have over 14 million patients enrolled in our AirView software solution.\n During our last earnings call, I discussed how COVID-19 has accelerated the rapid adoption of digital health technology around the world, including a recognition of the value of remote patient monitoring, virtual diagnosis and the rapid evolution of digital reimbursement models. We have seen much greater collaboration between the med tech industry and governments globally, not just in ventilators but well beyond. An encouraging example of this was just a few days ago when the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services or CMS announced that it will be maintaining current reimbursement rates in our product categories in January 2021. This is great news. And in part, it is due to industry feedback that it was inappropriate to make unnecessary changes, particularly during an ongoing COVID-19 public health emergency, and really importantly, that current rates were appropriate for the services being provided.\n We've also seen governments in Germany, France, Japan and across the U.S. adopt models to facilitate digital health and remote care that will be important, not only during this pandemic but well beyond. This is better health care at lower costs, leveraging technology. These trends support ResMed's 2025 strategy, and we believe that the accelerated adoption of digital health solutions represents a significant medium and long-term tailwind for our business.\n These 3 trends: one, the increased importance of respiratory medicine; two, the increased importance of digital health; and three, the increased importance of out-of-hospital health care, will all help ResMed meet and beat our goal of growing volume at double digits from 2020 through 2025 and improving over 250 million lives by 2025.\n Let me now highlight a few examples of innovation and execution in support of our strategic priorities. Just a recap of our strategy priorities: a, to grow and differentiate our sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses; b, to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices and digital health solutions; and c, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered away from the hospital.\n In our core market of sleep apnea, we introduced our latest mask innovation in September. It's called the AirTouch N20. This innovation is the first nasal mask with a memory foam cushion. As a patient myself, I'm happy to say that this is ResMed's softest nasal mask ever. The memory foam technology of the AirTouch N20 adapts to the curves and contours of the person's face, creating a personalized fit that is designed to increase comfort and to make it easier for the patient to adhere to sleep apnea therapy. The adherence rates for ResMed solutions are the best in the industry. And it is innovation and technology like this new AirTouch N20 that helps get us there.\n Our mask portfolio is crafted to offer physicians market-leading options for prescribing for each patient. To enable home care providers to successfully fit the patient the first time every time and to satisfy the desires of the ultimate customer. That's the person who suffocates each night with sleep apnea. Our focus on innovation to meet customer needs will never end. We are innovating with smaller, quieter, more comfortable, more connected and more intelligent solutions every day. We have an exciting pipeline ahead.\n Let me now turn to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to deliver better care for COPD and asthma patients worldwide. During the June quarter, we launched in Europe an upgraded version of our AirView cloud-based remote monitoring software, specifically designed for our ventilation solutions. This solution called AirView for ventilation provides remote monitoring capability, allowing clinicians to quickly access clinical data from ResMed ventilation devices wherever they are and to allow them to more easily triage and prioritize both chronic needs and acute needs for ventilated patients. This completely reimagined platform transforms the management of ventilated patients, allowing doctors, nurses and all clinicians and care providers to ascertain powerful patient insights from huge respiratory medical data sets. Adoption of the AirView for ventilation solution has been rapid and strong.\n Our team was really thrilled to deliver for our customers during the COVID emergency with this solution, but the value that is being provided by AirView for ventilation is ongoing for physicians and health care systems. We are making digital health part of the standard of care. During the quarter, we expanded the reach of our market-leading Propeller Health technology, specifically through our partnership with pharmaceutical company, Novartis. During the quarter, Novartis announced the launch of 2 new once-daily medications to treat uncontrolled asthma in Japan. These products are called Enerzair and Atectura Breezhaler. In this market, patients using either the Enerzair or the Breezhaler manage their uncontrolled asthma will be able to acquire a Propeller technology sensor from physicians and then enroll in our Propeller digital health platform. The benefits of the platform are tremendous. The offering is a simple and convenient way to better live with sleep apnea with a fully integrated digital experience, with no incremental cost to the patient. It's great to see our Novartis partnership expanding to include now both Europe and Japan, leveraging our world-leading Propeller technology.\n Let me now briefly review our out-of-hospital Software as a Service business. During the quarter, our SaaS business grew in the mid-single digits year-on-year, driven by continued strong uptake of our HME resupply solutions. The COVID-19 market dynamics continue to impact the patient census volumes, particularly at skilled nursing facilities and new patient admissions have remained under pressure. We are maintaining our forecast that the SaaS market growth rate will be in the mid-single-digit range for the portfolio of verticals that we serve for fiscal 2021. We expect the portfolio to return to high single-digit growth as hospital and other outpatient surgery center discharge rates return to normal.\n We continue to invest in research and development for our SaaS businesses, so that we continuously improve on our market-leading solutions in home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice as well as private duty home care and life plan communities. As this portfolio of SaaS verticals returns to high single-digit growth, ResMed will continue to be there with our R&D resulting in leading Brightree and MatrixCare branded technology solutions, allowing us to better serve customers and therefore, to not just meet but to beat that market growth rate.\n A year ago, we announced that ResMed would begin collaborating with Cerner Corporation to help clinicians make more informed treatment decisions to control costs and to deliver seamless care across health care systems, from the hospital to the home. We have now integrated our MatrixCare branded home health and hospice platform with the electronic health record or EHR system from Cerner. I'm excited to let you know that we've expanded our relationship with Cerner to new offerings and have now entered into a new value-added reseller arrangement with Cerner. This establishes our Brightree technology as the preferred solution for Cerner's home medical equipment, pharmacy and home infusion customers. This development is the next step in the ResMed-Cerner relationship and will lead to better interoperability, it will lead to enhanced provider capabilities and it will lead to an improved patient experience. Overall, this partnership is performing above expectations for both ResMed and Cerner. We anticipate opportunities to deepen and expand this collaboration to involve our core markets of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma disease management over time. Stay tuned.\n In summary, the SaaS portfolio is performing well and remains an important driver of our digital transformation of health care in settings outside the hospital.\n 2020 has been an unprecedented year for companies across every industry. The fundamentals of our ResMed business, however, remains strong, and we've maintained growth through this crisis through breakthrough innovation, through investments in recurring revenue businesses and effective execution in our operating excellence programs. COVID-19 has accelerated digital health adoption as well as awareness of respiratory hygiene and respiratory health. The importance of respiratory medicine, the importance of digital health and the importance of health care delivered away from a hospital. These trends are present during COVID, but they're here to stay.\n Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to once again express my sincere thanks to more than 7,500 ResMedians, who -- that's what we call ourselves around the world for their perseverance and strength, hard work and dedication during unique once-in-a-century circumstances. You have allowed hundreds of thousands of people around the world to get emergency ventilators and to have the gift of breath, while also keeping focus on making sure we have the best technology and solutions now and in the future for sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and all those who need world-class care outside the hospital and preferably in their own home. Thank you all.\n With that, I'll hand the call now over to Brett in Sydney, and then we'll go to Q&A. Brett, over to you. \nBrett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and some remarks on our FY '21 outlook.\n As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the September quarter was $752 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 9% compared to the prior year quarter. Revenues for the first quarter were favorably impacted by continued demand for ventilator devices and accessories. We estimate that the incremental revenue benefit from ventilator devices and related accessories derived from COVID-19 demand was approximately $40 million in the first quarter. Additionally, we experienced strong mask revenue growth in both our domestic and international markets. However, we did observe continuing headwinds in the sleep device market.\n Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries were $403 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $257 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter or an increase of 10% in constant currency terms.\n By product segment, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $197 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $206 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales totaled $176 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an 11% increase. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $81 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 8%. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other sales increased by 11% over the prior year quarter.\n Software as a Service revenue for the first quarter was $92 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, SaaS revenue increased by 4%.\n During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, the purchase accounting fair value adjustment to MatrixCare deferred revenue and the fair value adjustment of equity investments. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release.\n Our non-GAAP gross margin improved by 30 basis points to 59.9% in the September quarter compared to 59.6% in the same quarter last year. The increase is predominantly attributable to favorable product mix and foreign exchange rate movements, partially offset by increased costs associated with logistics and procurement costs, together with typical declines in average selling prices. The cost increases largely reflect the impact of COVID-19 and our rapid ramp-up of ventilator production.\n We saw elevated airfreight costs relative to the prior year, but these are tracking sequentially lower, particularly as we rebalance from air freight to sea freight.\n Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the first quarter were $159 million, a decrease of 5% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses decreased by 7% compared to the prior year period. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 21.1% compared to 24.6% we reported in the prior year quarter, benefiting from cost management and reduced travel as we work through the uncertain COVID-19 environment. Looking forward, we expect SG&A expenses in Q2 to be broadly consistent with the prior year period and then in the second half of FY '21 to increase in the low single digits relative to the prior year period.\n R&D expenses for the quarter were $55 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter, or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 12%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.3% compared to 7.1% in the prior year. We continue to prioritize our investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology and product development will deliver a sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses to continue to grow year-over-year in the high single digits to low double digits, reflecting our commitment to innovation through the economic cycles.\n Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $20 million for the quarter, and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $16 million.\n Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $237 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong top line growth, expansion of gross margin and well-managed operating expenses.\n On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 17.4%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.5%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2021 will be in the range of 17% to 19%.\n Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $185 million, an increase of 37% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.27, an increase of 37% over the prior year quarter. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.22.\n Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $144 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by increases in working capital.\n Capital expenditure for the quarter was $14 million. Depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $39 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $57 million.\n We recorded equity losses of $2.3 million in our income statement in the September quarter associated with the Verily joint venture. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $3 million in Q2 and approximately $5 million per quarter in the second half of FY '21 associated with the joint venture operation.\n We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $421 million. At September 30, we had $1.1 billion in gross debt and $635 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. And at September 30, we had a further $1.2 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. However, I also want to highlight that in these times of uncertainty, we are maintaining a disciplined approach, and we are tightly managing expenses, cash flow and liquidity.\n Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, reflecting the Board's confidence in our strong liquidity position and operating performance.\n Turning now to our FY '21 outlook. At a high level, we are now seeing a minimal COVID-19-generated demand for our ventilators and do not expect any incremental benefit in Q2 and beyond. Additionally, we expect to see a continued year-on-year headwind for sleep devices in Q2 in response to temporary reduction in the diagnosis of new patients. However, at this time, we continue to forecast a sequential improvement in sleep devices through the course of FY '21.\n Masks and accessories have continued to demonstrate resilience and growth over the past 3 months, reflecting the insulating value of the large patient installed base. We expect to see continued year-on-year growth of our mask portfolio in FY '21. Of course, like many other companies, we continue to experience significant uncertainty in the current environment. And as a result, our forecast and possible future revenue outcomes remain dynamic.\n And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. \nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Brett. Let's now turn to the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Cheryl, let's go ahead and start the Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Chris Cooper of Goldman Sachs. \nChris Cooper: Could you please -- I mean you mentioned at the start, the announcement from CMS this week. Could you just confirm your interpretation of where we stand with competitive bidding now? I mean the wording seem to suggest to us that the structure of the bid as a current standard is not working as they intended. Is your expectation at this stage that we just move on for the next 3-year cycle with competitive bidding? Or do you think they'll try and rerun it ahead of that? \nMichael Farrell: Thanks for the question, Chris. And look, the one thing we know is that January 1, 2021, the rates will remain where they are. And that -- it was great that CMS listened to feedback from the industry. And it wasn't just around COVID, it was really around the fact that reimbursement rates currently as they are fit for the need. And if you read through the detail, the CMS actually said that through the process, they found that they weren't going to have any savings as they put it, which meant from my perspective that we've reached sort of market equilibrium in terms of where things are at. Now that's my interpretation. But Dave Pendarvis studies this far more detail than I do. Dave, do you want to give some more color and thoughts around the CMS announcement these last few days? \nDavid Pendarvis: Sure. So Chris, yes, our view of the probable outcome here is you've got a 3-year run at least until January 1, 2024, of these current rates, plus inflation adjustments on January 1 on each of those years. Those are in the competitive bid areas. In addition to that, CMS has got a proposed rule-out, which if they finalize, would add a continuation of the 50-50 blended rate in rural areas. Those are both really good outcomes for our industry. They provide stability, they provide rates that these folks can count on, and they allow for any willing provider to be able to provide in the markets.\n Now you can always find legislative opportunities for the administration to do different things, to come in earlier, to change things up a little bit. That -- so is it possible? Sure. Is it likely? We don't think so. So we're going to be basing our plans on a continuation of these rates going forward with the caveat that governments can always do things that are unexpected and subject to their own control. \nChris Cooper: Is there any risk that the commercial payers begin to take things into their own hands slowly and move ahead of Medicare? \nMichael Farrell: So Chris, the private payers were already ahead of CMS on this and had been sort of on a mark-to-market basis doing things at their own rates before competitive bidding started back in the mid-2000s during and after. And so I don't think it's a risk. It's a guarantee that private payers are looking for market rates. I think what's great about this one because it's so public versus those sort of private negotiations that happen is that we've seen a public statement of an equilibrium reached between the bids that came in and the fair price that is appropriate for the provision of these services in the statement. So that's something that's new as part of it. But look, it's a complex web. We sell in 140 countries worldwide, not just one. We watch CMS, but we also watch the rest of the world, and we want to make sure that reimbursement rates are there for our channel, but really importantly, that we get to the 936 million people worldwide who suffer from sleep apnea. \nOperator: Your next question is from Sean Laaman of Morgan Stanley. \nSean Laaman: I'd like to just ask about the sustainability and that suppression in SG&A growth. It seems like a very good outcome. If you could talk us through that? I know we've got guidance for fiscal '21, but if you could talk us through that, that would be really useful, Mick. \nMichael Farrell: Yes. Thanks, Sean. I'll start, and I'll hand over to Brett for some more detail. Yes, look, excellent control. Obviously, travel costs are incredibly down. We have 75%, 80% of all the ResMedians worldwide selling in 140 countries working from home. And we've had a really smooth transition to 4,000, 5,000 people working from home and feeling comfortable doing so. And we are opening up our offices as appropriate in Europe, Asia and the Americas as cities, states and so on allow us to.\n Look, when we get to the other side of this pandemic, and that's a long time potentially with a vaccine and treatments that are efficacious, I do see some of those costs starting to go back up again, but they will be also concomitant with opening of health care systems that will be associated with the opening up of those economies. And so I think we've done a really good job in bringing expenses down on SG&A, 7% reduction year-on-year for the quarter to $159 million for the September quarter.\n But if you look closely, we also increased our R&D spend. We increased by 12%, constant currency, our R&D spend. And that's $54.5 million for the quarter. You annualize that, that's a really good $200-plus million that we're going to put into digital health technology, artificial intelligence, machine learning, improvements in smaller, quiet and more comfortable, more connected and more intelligent systems that can keep people breathing out of hospital and well taken care of. And so we are going to continue the investments in R&D and drive those through this crisis, and we are going to take the savings on SG&A now and be ready to reinvest in marketing and sales and growth in that SG&A as appropriate when the revenues start to come back. I hope that all makes sense, Sean. It's not just a one portfolio play, it's all part of a larger piece. \nSean Laaman: No. That makes a lot of sense. Great results. \nOperator: Your next question... \nBrett Sandercock: Sean, it's Brett. The only thing I'd add to add to that, it's a good summary from Mick, there's not too much more to add there. But I mean, clearly, we're not going to have negative SG&A every quarter. And we have -- I've got in the back half to kind of low double digits. And for that low double digits, mid-single digits is probably what we've consistently done. Really, our aim is we want to leverage SG&A relative to revenue growth. So that hasn't gone away, but we want to continue to do that in the medium to long term as well. \nOperator: Your next question is from Gretel Janu of Credit Suisse. \nGretel Janu: So just at the last results, I think you mentioned that in July, you saw low single-digit revenue growth. This does then imply quite a sharp acceleration growth in August and September. So can you give us some more color on the incremental performance on a month-to-month basis as well as to how you performed into October? \nMichael Farrell: Thanks, Gretel. It's a great question as we sort of model the kinetics of the recovery across our 140 countries. And as we look at it, and we -- obviously, I look at daily numbers, not just month-to-month and beyond, but there's a lot of sort of noise when you go down to a lower level of distraction. \n You pull back and you look at sort of that quarter-on-quarter trend, what we're seeing is sequential growth across the group. And let's look at some -- look at 3 big countries. And I think I talked about this 90 days ago, Gretel, but Germany is sort of, I would say, our leading country in terms of how they're opening up their economy. \n We are seeing at 85%, 90-plus percent of the pre-COVID patient flow and in some parts, 90% to 95% of the pre-COVID patient flow. It's through telehealth, it's through digital medicine, it's also through some in-person visits and in-lab tests. And so we're really at a very high point of recovery. \n And even with Angela Merkel closing restaurants and bars here in November, we do expect health systems to remain fully open during not just November, but on an ongoing basis because people need to get their primary care, people need to get their respiratory care. If they're suffocating, they need treatment for their sleep apnea. If they have trouble breathing, they need help for their COPD. And so we're seeing that in a really good case in Germany.\n If you take China, another big market we talked about last quarter, sort of at the 50% of pre-COVID levels. This quarter, China is now already at 70% of pre-COVID patient flow across a very large country, but that portfolio of different cities and states is now at 70% of pre-COVID, so a significant improvement from last quarter. And here in the United States, it's really a story of 50 different states and their approaches, but they vary from 60% to 80% if you think about it of the pre-COVID patient flow. And so on average of around 70% here in our biggest market in the United States. So you take that all and you see, yes, there is pretty strong sequential improvement. It's not a dramatic sort of V shape we're back to January 1 or December 31, 2019. But the -- every week, it does get better. Every month, it does get better across the portfolio of countries. Even with the second and third waves of Northern Hemisphere, with the coming flu period, we expect to see sequential improvement in the flow of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patients into our system. \nOperator: Your next question is from Margaret Kaczor of William Blair. \nMargaret Kaczor: I just wanted to follow-up a little bit about the drivers like you said of new patient adds and mostly improvements that you're seeing. I understand the 90%, 70%, 70% are pre-COVID levels. But how much of that is being driven by clinics, sleep clinics reopening relative to home sleep testing? Meaning is home sleep testing accelerating? And would that be a more sustainable trend as we go forward 2, 3 years from now that PCPs are adopting this and you can get a steady trend of new patient adds from there? \nMichael Farrell: Yes, Margaret, it's a really good question. I'm going to hand to Jim for some further detail on this way. Across the world, we're seeing home sleep test -- home sleep apnea testing picked up over time. COVID-19 has been an accelerator for that because it was the only choice during the severe lockdowns. And as we get to the other side, it is lower cost and has equivalent sensitivity and specificity from the technology that's out there. But Jim, what further color do you have on that? \nJames Hollingshead: Yes. Thanks, Mick, and thanks, Margaret. It's a great question and it's a very insightful question. We don't have perfect data on this. But the data we do have and both the concrete data we have from sort of looking at our own devices that are used and also anecdotal data from the market very strongly suggests that home sleep testing across most of our markets has become a much higher percentage of testing. And to your point, I do think that that is sustainable. I think what we're seeing is a shift in practice. Patients certainly prefer it. And I think a number of clinicians are seeing that it's an easier way for them to diagnose, and they're certainly using home sleep testing and remote testing to serve their short-term patient needs. But as it gets adopted, I think we will see that practice remain very sustainable. And so in a market like France, we are already at something like 90% home sleep testing. We don't have perfect insight, as I said, but we do think home sleep test in the U.S. market has hit a very high percentage of tests, and we think that that will stick in the future. \nMichael Farrell: The one bit of color I'll add on there, just to tag onto what Jim said, Margaret, is Germany, where there was actually quite a strong resistance from some sleep physicians to adopt home sleep apnea testing. They were skeptical of the efficacy, the practicality and could they really make it work. And because of the shutdowns were very strong in Germany during the peak of the crisis in March, April, it was the only way they could diagnose. The doctors then got used to it. And to Jim's point, I think on the other side of this, France will move up a little bit, but Germany will move up significantly in the percentage of patients with home sleep apnea testing as those doctors found that it was not only -- had high sensitivity and specificity on the clinical level, but it also had good outcomes at lower costs. \nOperator: Your next question is from David Low of JPMorgan. \nMichael Farrell: David, you may be on mute. \nDavid Low: Yes. No, no. I was just getting the mute off. If I could just go back to the ventilators, I mean what I understood from was said that there was a $40 billion boost coming through there, and that we really should expect that that's pretty much done now. So that normalizes. And if we adjust for that, it would imply that the device sales growth was significantly lower. Just wondering how you think we should think about the recovery from here? I mean are we at the point now where device sales ex-ventilators can start to grow given how strong the recovery seems to have been through the quarter? \nMichael Farrell: Yes, David, it's a really good question. I'll hand to Brett for some further detail on it after my remarks. But look, we've seen -- we saw incredible sort of $30 million in the March quarter, triple-digit millions of dollars in the June quarter, and as you noted, $40 million in the September quarter of what I would call emergency ventilator sales as part of the crisis. It may not go to precisely 0 this quarter, but it won't be as high in the December quarter as it was in the September quarter. And hopefully, as we're seeing the second and third waves, the magnitude, as I said in the prepared remarks, is lower of the second and third waves in terms of the impact on hospitalizations and reaching that sort of peak, ICU peak ventilator capacity. And so on a humanitarian basis, I hope we're right in that prediction that it goes very quickly down.\n We are seeing sequentially, from the June quarter to the September quarter, improvements in the number of patients coming through, the prescriptions coming through, and therefore, the devices that we are selling on the sleep side. We expect that improvement to continue through the December quarter. And so as you look through the fiscal year and you think about sort of modeling how that's going to happen, I think you can model a steady increase in the sleep apnea devices. And the sort of, what I will call a secular uptick in masks and accessories sales that was driven by, I think, respiratory hygiene and the importance of getting a clean mask, was not a onetime thing for the March or June quarter. You saw it was sustainable. As we predicted, it was sustainable here through the September quarter. And I think it's sustainable through the December quarter.\n I'm a patient and I know how important it is and how exciting it is, frankly, to get that new mask, to get that new cushion and to establish it up. It's like a brand-new cast mill and you get addicted to saying, \"Wow, respiratory health is important,\" and that is one thing through the suffering of COVID-19. It's almost a blessing that we've seen people realize that sleep apnea, COPD and asthma, respiratory health is incredibly important and keeping your device clean and keeping your mask clean is incredibly important as well as accessing data digitally has been incredibly important. So we think all of that will be there, and that's why we talk about this strong sequential increase, steady sequential increase throughout fiscal 2021. Brett, any further color? \nBrett Sandercock: Yes. Thanks, Mick. I mean that's good now. I mean, Dave, you're right. I mean, obviously, year-on-year, we saw declines in sleep devices. But we saw a pretty strong sequential improvement from Q4 to Q1. And then going forward, as Mick said, we will -- we still think we'll see that sequential improvement. Now where does that end up in Q2, Q3, increase or decrease, we won't -- time will tell. But certainly, we're seeing that nice sequential increase week-to-week, month-to-month, which gives us, I think, a lot of confidence of sleep devices improving throughout FY '21. I think that's the main thing we're looking at. It's that nice strong financial increase, I think, that will give us a lot of confidence. \nDavid Low: Just on topic, I know I don't want to ask the second question. But I mean, I take $40 million of devices, actually, negative 1.6% growth for the quarter. So it looks pretty close to flat there. And I presume that's indicative of where CPAPs at relative to the same time last year. \nMichael Farrell: Yes, there will be some -- yes, I mean, there's constant currency adjustments, things like that, but certainly decreased, single-digit decreases. \nOperator: Your next question is with Lyanne Harrison of Bank of America. \nLyanne Harrison: Just following on from Margaret Kaczor's question. Thinking about the initiatives that have been put in place as a result of coronavirus, including telehealth, home sleep testing, can you give us some indication of how the reimbursement works for that? With home sleep testing, for example, are patients more likely to be out of pocket? And do you think that the reimbursement with the likes of telehealth will remain post coronavirus? \nMichael Farrell: Lyanne, it's a great question, and it talks to how sustainable is what we're talking about earlier, Jim and I around home sleep apnea testing being adopted. In general, the costs for home sleep apnea testing are significantly below for the payer, the employer and the ultimate payer is the person who works for that company or pays the taxes in that country. So the numbers of the costs are significantly lower, often in order of magnitude lower. And so therefore, the copayments, if you're part of, say, U.S. plan like I'm, we have copayments, the copayment is proportional to the cost. And so therefore, an order of magnitude lower. So it is lower cost.\n And the question that physicians always had is, is it better care or at least as good care at lower cost. And I think what we saw through COVID-19, where people who hadn't adopted home sleep apnea testing as well, were forced to adopt it because it was the only way they could diagnose patients. They found well, the sensitivity and specificity from that clinical peer-reviewed article does happen in my practice, in my state, in my city. And so lower cost, as good outcomes, we saw great adoption. And I think that drives ongoing growth of it on a sustainable basis. As Jim was talking to earlier, I think countries that were x move to y, where y is above x, and we can't predict exactly what that permanent change is going to be. We just know it's going to move up because the momentum of economics and good clinical care just drive it that way. So I don't know, Jim, if you have any further color to provide on that from your last response on home sleep apnea testing. \nJames Hollingshead: I just would completely reiterate what you said. And as a reminder, if you're on a, let's say, U.S. market, if you're a consumer and you have a health plan, you have a 20% copay. If a typical lab test is $1,500 or $1,800, that you're out of pocket on that at 20%. If the typical home sleep test is reimbursed at, say, $250, $200, you're much lower out of pocket. And so for consumers, the barrier is much lower to do a home sleep test here. Most consumers would prefer a home sleep test. And so that's why I think we'll see it remain sticky.\n Now to telehealth, which I think was the second part of your question, some of those reimbursements have been done on sort of an emergency basis. The question is how? Will they persist after the emergency situations are declared nonemergency? There are a number of reasons to think that they will. I think that they've been very successful. And of course, the industry is lobbying very hard to put some of the things in place, both with government payers and with commercial payers. And so I think that most payers have seen telehealth to be pretty successful in terms of driving coverage and also driving down cost of care. So we can be optimistic about that. And I think the whole industry is working on it. \nMichael Farrell: Yes. And this has actually been a sort of public-private partnership during COVID-19 as we all made the ventilators and partnered with the governments to do so that we have partnered on digital health, bringing -- as Jim said, bringing the emergency user authorization capability for that. \n There were actually codes that CMS had for digital health that were being underutilized in 2019. They brought them out early, I believe, in 2019. And even in 2018, we're doing some trials with them, and they were actually upset at CMS that the digital health codes weren't being utilized enough. \n COVID-19 drove an acceleration of that. And I think it will allow, again, the same thing as home sleep apnea testing applies to telehealth and all remote patient care, it's better during COVID times that you not go to that clinic because you won't get as exposed, not to that hospital, you won't get as exposed. \n It's also better during normal times, if you can do stuff at lower cost with better outcomes and not having to go to that hospital, not having to go to that clinic, if you can do it from the comfort of your own home. And as Jim said, the consumer prefers lower cost and at their own home, and that's all of ResMed's strategies to give that health care way you want it. \nOperator: Next question is from Matthew Mishan of KeyBanc. \nMatt Mishan: Mick, I'll keep this one simple. Can you just give us a sense of when Propeller Health can become more meaningful to the P&L? \nMichael Farrell: Thanks, Matthew. Good question. Propeller Health is early phase in terms of the technology. It's certainly having a huge impact in getting a major multi-hundred billion-dollar pharma companies to adopt it with their brand-new prescribable drugs, particularly in the asthma space in Europe and Japan. As to when it becomes a material part of ResMed's P&L and I'm breaking it out on a quarterly basis, it's going to be a while for that. And so it won't be in here in fiscal 2021. But as we look to our 2025 strategy over these next 5 years, I do expect that that type of digital health solution is going to be a double-digit part of ResMed's delivery, and I will be talking about it on a quarterly basis, not just through milestones of pharmaceutical company releases with lead products and brand-new not generics, but high-end prescribable products. I think that we will see this go well beyond where it started just here in asthma. It will go across COPD. And there are literally billions -- tens of billions of dollars that could be saved in keeping COPD patients out of hospital with better adherence to their drugs.\n Our work has shown that we can improve adherence rates by up to 58% and lower total cost of emergency visits and emergency costs by 25%. But look, it's a great question, Matthew. I'm not going to predict the exact quarter and timing, but I can tell you that over the next 20 quarters, it will become a significant part. We will be calling it out because it works. And pharmaceutical companies know how to do things at scale. And when they start to see that it improves the outcomes for their patients, that their doctors are happier and most importantly, that the patients are happier and out of hospital, lower cost, better outcomes, it's going to take off very quickly, exponentially. \nOperator: Your next question is from Saul Hadassin of UBS. \nSaul Hadassin: Mick, can I just ask you, I don't think it was in your prepared remarks, but you did preview the Lumis HFT device at the ERS Conference this quarter. Can you talk to, I guess, a bit more detail as to where you see that device sitting in within the portfolio of the ResMed offering and when we might expect to see that device commercialized? \nMichael Farrell: Yes. I'll provide just a little overview, and then I'll hand to Rob Douglas, our COO, to provide further. Look, what we've seen during COVID-19 is a variety of different products and solutions that have been used for patients from oxygen to high-flow therapy, to full noninvasive ventilation and then full invasive intubated ventilation. So I think there was some good exposure to what high-flow therapy can do with COVID because it can provide some of the particles to move around hospitals and so on. HFT did not get as frontline on its therapy as fully intubated ventilators. But we think it gave some good exposure and has accelerated a little bit. Yes, this is very early days with high-flow therapy, but it's a technology that we've put together on some of our existing platforms with great intellectual property and great opportunities for growth over time. But Rob, do you want to provide some further detail on what we're doing with Lumis HFT? \nRobert Douglas: Yes, sure. Thanks, Mick. So yes, we think HFT is clearly a valid treatment and got some very interesting use cases. We -- again, you know our strategy is out of hospital, and it hasn't been strongly studied in those types of environments. So really, it's more part of a long-term play to see how HFT might fit in with our long-term strategy. It's a trial that will take its time to enroll patients. These respiratory device trials in the home setting are generally pretty tough to do and so -- and take a time. So we won't be reporting out of that super quickly, but it's certainly a very interesting area for us, and we think we've got some good solutions. \nOperator: Your next question is from Suraj Kalia of Oppenheimer. \nSuraj Kalia: Mick, one question from my side. The SaaS unit is now growing at single digits. Can you help us understand the structural dynamics that could possibly push the segment back to double-digit growth? Is there price elasticity of demand? Are you looking at OUS adoption? Are acquisitions the key? Just help us frame this segment, in particular, for the next 12, 24 months. \nMichael Farrell: Thanks, Suraj. It's a great question. So Software as a Service, our SaaS division, is 12% of our revenues. It's a really important part of our long-term growth to apply our digital health technology capability outside the hospital and in the 7 verticals we're in where we're a market leader in the top 1 or 2 of each of those categories. Yes, as I noted in the prep remarks, Suraj, we've seen a slowdown of the flow of patients into hospitals and therefore, out of hospitals to skilled nursing facilities, in particular, as well as nursing homes and others. And we do expect that that, sort of, if you like, recovery will take some time. And that's why I sort of said that the markets that we serve as a weighted average portfolio growth will grow in those sort of mid-single digits throughout this fiscal year. We expect to meet that and beat that where we can.\n And then as we get to beyond the sort of 12-month time frame, I do think there's opportunities for those markets to get to the high single-digit growth. And with inorganic plays, there are opportunities to get to low double-digit growth across that portfolio. Look, we never accept market growth. \n We want to meet it and beat it. One thing we are doing in that division as well as in our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma groups is we're investing in innovation. We have great -- in the beauty of Software as a Service innovation is you're talking weeks between sprints and then getting an MVP out there to provide a solution to customers. \n And so we have seen some really good innovation come into play to help people deal with COVID-19 that have helped them sort of through this crisis. And we think that when we get back to the sort of normal flow through hospitals and ASCs of patients getting discharged into the out-of-hospital post-acute network, we will start to see the centers pick up and therefore, the revenues pick up as the number of patients in that setting picks up over time. \n And so yes, look, we have a leading position. We're going to do well in the mid-single digits. We'll do well in the high single digits. And over time, as we add inorganically, we can push even beyond that. \nOperator: Your next question is from David Bailey of Macquarie. \nDavid Bailey: Mick, you sort of touched on the resupply coming through, expecting that to continue into the second quarter. Just wondering if you can talk a little bit about how you're seeing that opportunity over the medium to longer term? Do you think there's further opportunities on the resupply? And then within that mask and accessories as well, just whether you think some of the new product launches are driving increased share for ResMed? That would be great. \nMichael Farrell: Thanks, David. Yes, that's a 2-part question. So I'll have a go. Actually, you know, I'm going to hand the whole question to Jim Hollingshead rather than do half of it. Over to you, Jim. \nJames Hollingshead: Thank you for the question, David. I mean we think -- we've been obviously quite pleased with the dynamics of resupply through Q1. We expect it to continue in Q2. And actually, I do think what's going on, especially, probably, globally, but the dynamics of resupply are really a specific to U.S. market where reimbursed. And we think what's going on is that, a, patients want new clean equipment, they're more synthesized to that because of the pandemic; and b, our HME provider customers have realized that that's an avenue that's both better for the patients and better for patient care, but also better for their own business. So we think that dynamic should stay.\n One thing -- we had a question earlier about competitive bidding. One of the good results at a competitive bidding being delayed for some period of time is that it won't change mask reimbursement. And so we think that with the competitive bidding reannouncement, it maintains the economics of resupply that exist in the U.S. market, which is our biggest resupply market. And that's one of the reasons we think that the dynamics for that part of the market will persist through, I think, at least in the fiscal year. I think that it will remain robust. So we've got a change in customer behavior, change in patient behavior, both of which tend to resupply and then stability and reimbursement. And I think those are really key points.\n On market share, we have the broadest and most effective portfolio of masks and accessories on the market. We can -- with our range of products now and with our latest launch of the AirTouch N20, our line is complete across our range of masks, and we can provide a certain fit for every patient with the right mask every time. None of our competitors come even close to what we offer in the market, and we feel really good about our share and position and our ongoing innovation. \nOperator: Your next question is from Andrew Goodsall of MST Marquee. \nAndrew Goodsall: Just thinking about the quarter, just wondering if you saw any DME restocking effect in the quarter. And also if I could just ask you to talk to oxygen, whether that's still getting us some tailwind with COVID? \nMichael Farrell: So the first question about restocking, second one about POCs. Look, Brett, do you want to take something with regard to the restocking and talk about inventory levels from Q-on-Q? And then, Rob, do you want to have a go at the oxygen question. Over to you, Brett, first? \nBrett Sandercock: Yes, sure, Mick. I mean typically on the whole DME, they don't hold too much inventory. So I guess they've got -- they typically buy pretty regularly. I'm not sure. I mean, as volumes have come up and patient flows come back. Obviously, there's orders coming in the system to support the patient flow coming back, and we're seeing that sequentially, but I'm not sure they're really restocking like huge orders. They'll restock as the patient flow comes back in a pretty orderly fashion. And obviously, we're seeing that throughout our revenues and sequentially what's happening there. But I wouldn't say it is characterized by significant restocking orders. I think that's a bit more steady flow that we're seeing coming through it. \nAndrew Goodsall: Okay. So I got a reasonable match up with the sort of return of patients to return of orders? \nBrett Sandercock: Yes, I think so because they don't like holding a lot of inventory. So they all typically do -- they can get inventory quite quickly from the manufacturers, and they'll typically operate -- obviously, they need enough inventory. And -- but I think the patient flow will drive their order patterns. \nAndrew Goodsall: That's great. And then just on POC. \nRobert Douglas: Andrew, yes, our POC program sort of just continues as we have -- we continue to learn. We've still got our products in their sort of product launch, process and post that. And we continue to learn, and we're sort of still making adjustments and experiments of how to get the right patients to the right providers for the right treatment there. So it's pretty much a sort of a long-term thing for us on that. \nAndrew Goodsall: No particular call out on COVID around that? \nRobert Douglas: No. Not that material to our overall business. \nOperator: Your next question is from Anthony Petrone of Jefferies. \nAnthony Petrone: Maybe just a couple on math questions on vents and NIVs and just comments in relation to COVID cases and NIVs going forward. And so when we back out the $40 million from devices and you sort of bake in patient flows in core sleep, I'm just wondering, again, the math doesn't quite get there to low single digits. So I'm wondering if pricing, in particular, firmed up in the quarter that can kind of get you there or other respiratory was better.\n And then again, the comment on NIVs going forward, potentially not being a driver. Just wondering why that would be considering where the case counts are going? \nMichael Farrell: Thanks, Anthony. Yes, look, it's a complex equation, and there are so many moving pieces with second and third waves as regards to the global pandemic. So all we know about every prediction that's been made in the last 9 months is they're wrong. So we don't know precisely what the needs are going to be through the second and third waves. And last quarter, we were a bit muted about what we thought would happen this quarter and then we had $40 million worth of sales in the September quarter. But look, our best projections of the sort of epidemiology and sort of humanitarian model that we put together at the flow of COVID-19 around 140 countries that we treat in within the big countries, specifically in some cities and states that we're looking at, we don't think we're going to reach a state where there's going to be hospitalizations like we had early January, February in Wuhan, and then March -- February, March in Milan and then March, April in New York, where you reached 100% capacity and literally ran out of ventilators and ran out of ICU beds for those ventilators.\n Our best models show that the magnitude of the second and third waves are actually reduced in cities in China, that we've seen second and third waves, across Singapore, where we've seen them in in some parts of Europe, where we're already seeing them. And so we're just being realistic that we don't expect sort of those emergency use ventilators to be at the sort of magnitude. And you can actually see that it went from a triple-digit millions in the June quarter, down to $40 million in the September quarter. It will be significantly reduced here in the December quarter. I'm not saying it will necessarily be de minimis, but it might be. And look, our job is to focus on our core market and the coming back of that. And what we're seeing is our investments in digital health, we've made these last 5 years and how we're the market leader there, have incredibly well set us up for the growth in that.\n And so I think as you start to look at modeling ResMed looking at a year-on-year is going to be a very difficult and complex equation, which I'm not sure you'll ever get to the right answer until, even us until the numbers are in on it. What we can look at is Q-on-Q, quarter-on-quarter sequential sleep apnea, COPD, across those devices portfolio, across those masks portfolio, from Q1 to Q2, Q2 to Q3 and Q3 to Q4. We're going to see sequential increase in the sleep devices. We're going to see increase in the sleep and COPD masks and accessories as we go through that quarter.\n So complex equation, yes, down sort of in the single digits year-on-year in devices, but hugely complex equation with tailwinds and headwinds. Look at Q-on-Q, when you start to see the positive trend of what's happening as we're opening up and as economies are working out how to run digital health and home sleep apnea testing and remote COPD diagnosis and prescriptions for asthma and getting patients on to the platforms like Propeller, like AirView for ventilation, like AirSense 10 and its Air Solutions platform. And that's where we're investing, and that's where, frankly, our technology will win. \nOperator: Your last question will come from David Low of JPMorgan. \nDavid Low: Thought I'd cancel that one. But just one last question. We've got some reports that some of ResMed's masks were in back orders through the quarter. Just wondering if you could talk to that, what might have caused it? How significant it was? And I guess I'm trying to understand whether it was demand driven or whether there was any supply issues there, please? \nMichael Farrell: Thanks, David. Yes, yes, I believe it was demand driven, as you saw, we had really good numbers in the quarter. But Jim, do you know any details of -- across the sleep business? \nJames Hollingshead: Yes, without trying to go math by math... \nMichael Farrell: Right. \nJames Hollingshead: Most of the back orders that we faced were demand driven. There were some logistical issues as well in the supply chain. We've had also some domestic shipping issues. Little things here and there that have been an issue, but it's almost all demand driven. \nOperator: We are now at the 75 minute mark, so I will turn the call over to Mick Farrell. \nMichael Farrell: Thanks, Cheryl, and thanks again to all of our shareholders for joining us on this call. I'd like to take the opportunity here at the end to thank the 7,500 ResMedians, many of whom, almost all of whom are shareholders as well for their dedication, hard work, helping people sleep better, breathe better and live better lives outside the hospital in 140 countries. Thanks for what you do today and every day. Thanks especially to our ResMed heroes who are going to our plants and production plants, our distribution plants, our tech services centers, and actually, because you have to touch physical product not being able to work from home. Thank you for following all safety procedures and doing that really well through this crisis. I look forward to talking to all of our shareholders here in around 90 days. Amy, I hand over to you to close out. \nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Mick. Thank you all again for joining us today. If you do have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to Investor Relations or to me directly. As previously mentioned, all of the documents, along with the transcript and a replay of our call today will be available on our website later. Cheryl, you may now go ahead and close our call. \nOperator: This concludes ResMed's first quarter of fiscal year 2021 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brett Sandercock",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and some remarks on our FY '21 outlook.\n As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the September quarter was $752 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 9% compared to the prior year quarter. Revenues for the first quarter were favorably impacted by continued demand for ventilator devices and accessories. We estimate that the incremental revenue benefit from ventilator devices and related accessories derived from COVID-19 demand was approximately $40 million in the first quarter. Additionally, we experienced strong mask revenue growth in both our domestic and international markets. However, we did observe continuing headwinds in the sleep device market.\n Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries were $403 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $257 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter or an increase of 10% in constant currency terms.\n By product segment, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $197 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $206 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales totaled $176 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an 11% increase. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $81 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 8%. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other sales increased by 11% over the prior year quarter.\n Software as a Service revenue for the first quarter was $92 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, SaaS revenue increased by 4%.\n During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, the purchase accounting fair value adjustment to MatrixCare deferred revenue and the fair value adjustment of equity investments. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release.\n Our non-GAAP gross margin improved by 30 basis points to 59.9% in the September quarter compared to 59.6% in the same quarter last year. The increase is predominantly attributable to favorable product mix and foreign exchange rate movements, partially offset by increased costs associated with logistics and procurement costs, together with typical declines in average selling prices. The cost increases largely reflect the impact of COVID-19 and our rapid ramp-up of ventilator production.\n We saw elevated airfreight costs relative to the prior year, but these are tracking sequentially lower, particularly as we rebalance from air freight to sea freight.\n Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the first quarter were $159 million, a decrease of 5% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses decreased by 7% compared to the prior year period. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 21.1% compared to 24.6% we reported in the prior year quarter, benefiting from cost management and reduced travel as we work through the uncertain COVID-19 environment. Looking forward, we expect SG&A expenses in Q2 to be broadly consistent with the prior year period and then in the second half of FY '21 to increase in the low single digits relative to the prior year period.\n R&D expenses for the quarter were $55 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter, or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 12%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.3% compared to 7.1% in the prior year. We continue to prioritize our investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology and product development will deliver a sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses to continue to grow year-over-year in the high single digits to low double digits, reflecting our commitment to innovation through the economic cycles.\n Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $20 million for the quarter, and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $16 million.\n Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $237 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong top line growth, expansion of gross margin and well-managed operating expenses.\n On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 17.4%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.5%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2021 will be in the range of 17% to 19%.\n Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $185 million, an increase of 37% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.27, an increase of 37% over the prior year quarter. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.22.\n Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $144 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by increases in working capital.\n Capital expenditure for the quarter was $14 million. Depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $39 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $57 million.\n We recorded equity losses of $2.3 million in our income statement in the September quarter associated with the Verily joint venture. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $3 million in Q2 and approximately $5 million per quarter in the second half of FY '21 associated with the joint venture operation.\n We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $421 million. At September 30, we had $1.1 billion in gross debt and $635 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. And at September 30, we had a further $1.2 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. However, I also want to highlight that in these times of uncertainty, we are maintaining a disciplined approach, and we are tightly managing expenses, cash flow and liquidity.\n Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, reflecting the Board's confidence in our strong liquidity position and operating performance.\n Turning now to our FY '21 outlook. At a high level, we are now seeing a minimal COVID-19-generated demand for our ventilators and do not expect any incremental benefit in Q2 and beyond. Additionally, we expect to see a continued year-on-year headwind for sleep devices in Q2 in response to temporary reduction in the diagnosis of new patients. However, at this time, we continue to forecast a sequential improvement in sleep devices through the course of FY '21.\n Masks and accessories have continued to demonstrate resilience and growth over the past 3 months, reflecting the insulating value of the large patient installed base. We expect to see continued year-on-year growth of our mask portfolio in FY '21. Of course, like many other companies, we continue to experience significant uncertainty in the current environment. And as a result, our forecast and possible future revenue outcomes remain dynamic.\n And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. Sean, it's Brett. The only thing I'd add to add to that, it's a good summary from Mick, there's not too much more to add there. But I mean, clearly, we're not going to have negative SG&A every quarter. And we have -- I've got in the back half to kind of low double digits. And for that low double digits, mid-single digits is probably what we've consistently done. Really, our aim is we want to leverage SG&A relative to revenue growth. So that hasn't gone away, but we want to continue to do that in the medium to long term as well. Yes. Thanks, Mick. I mean that's good now. I mean, Dave, you're right. I mean, obviously, year-on-year, we saw declines in sleep devices. But we saw a pretty strong sequential improvement from Q4 to Q1. And then going forward, as Mick said, we will -- we still think we'll see that sequential improvement. Now where does that end up in Q2, Q3, increase or decrease, we won't -- time will tell. But certainly, we're seeing that nice sequential increase week-to-week, month-to-month, which gives us, I think, a lot of confidence of sleep devices improving throughout FY '21. I think that's the main thing we're looking at. It's that nice strong financial increase, I think, that will give us a lot of confidence. Yes, sure, Mick. I mean typically on the whole DME, they don't hold too much inventory. So I guess they've got -- they typically buy pretty regularly. I'm not sure. I mean, as volumes have come up and patient flows come back. Obviously, there's orders coming in the system to support the patient flow coming back, and we're seeing that sequentially, but I'm not sure they're really restocking like huge orders. They'll restock as the patient flow comes back in a pretty orderly fashion. And obviously, we're seeing that throughout our revenues and sequentially what's happening there. But I wouldn't say it is characterized by significant restocking orders. I think that's a bit more steady flow that we're seeing coming through it. Yes, I think so because they don't like holding a lot of inventory. So they all typically do -- they can get inventory quite quickly from the manufacturers, and they'll typically operate -- obviously, they need enough inventory. And -- but I think the patient flow will drive their order patterns."

            "name": "James Hollingshead",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Mick, and thanks, Margaret. It's a great question and it's a very insightful question. We don't have perfect data on this. But the data we do have and both the concrete data we have from sort of looking at our own devices that are used and also anecdotal data from the market very strongly suggests that home sleep testing across most of our markets has become a much higher percentage of testing. And to your point, I do think that that is sustainable. I think what we're seeing is a shift in practice. Patients certainly prefer it. And I think a number of clinicians are seeing that it's an easier way for them to diagnose, and they're certainly using home sleep testing and remote testing to serve their short-term patient needs. But as it gets adopted, I think we will see that practice remain very sustainable. And so in a market like France, we are already at something like 90% home sleep testing. We don't have perfect insight, as I said, but we do think home sleep test in the U.S. market has hit a very high percentage of tests, and we think that that will stick in the future. I just would completely reiterate what you said. And as a reminder, if you're on a, let's say, U.S. market, if you're a consumer and you have a health plan, you have a 20% copay. If a typical lab test is $1,500 or $1,800, that you're out of pocket on that at 20%. If the typical home sleep test is reimbursed at, say, $250, $200, you're much lower out of pocket. And so for consumers, the barrier is much lower to do a home sleep test here. Most consumers would prefer a home sleep test. And so that's why I think we'll see it remain sticky.\n Now to telehealth, which I think was the second part of your question, some of those reimbursements have been done on sort of an emergency basis. The question is how? Will they persist after the emergency situations are declared nonemergency? There are a number of reasons to think that they will. I think that they've been very successful. And of course, the industry is lobbying very hard to put some of the things in place, both with government payers and with commercial payers. And so I think that most payers have seen telehealth to be pretty successful in terms of driving coverage and also driving down cost of care. So we can be optimistic about that. And I think the whole industry is working on it. Thank you for the question, David. I mean we think -- we've been obviously quite pleased with the dynamics of resupply through Q1. We expect it to continue in Q2. And actually, I do think what's going on, especially, probably, globally, but the dynamics of resupply are really a specific to U.S. market where reimbursed. And we think what's going on is that, a, patients want new clean equipment, they're more synthesized to that because of the pandemic; and b, our HME provider customers have realized that that's an avenue that's both better for the patients and better for patient care, but also better for their own business. So we think that dynamic should stay.\n One thing -- we had a question earlier about competitive bidding. One of the good results at a competitive bidding being delayed for some period of time is that it won't change mask reimbursement. And so we think that with the competitive bidding reannouncement, it maintains the economics of resupply that exist in the U.S. market, which is our biggest resupply market. And that's one of the reasons we think that the dynamics for that part of the market will persist through, I think, at least in the fiscal year. I think that it will remain robust. So we've got a change in customer behavior, change in patient behavior, both of which tend to resupply and then stability and reimbursement. And I think those are really key points.\n On market share, we have the broadest and most effective portfolio of masks and accessories on the market. We can -- with our range of products now and with our latest launch of the AirTouch N20, our line is complete across our range of masks, and we can provide a certain fit for every patient with the right mask every time. None of our competitors come even close to what we offer in the market, and we feel really good about our share and position and our ongoing innovation. Yes, without trying to go math by math... Most of the back orders that we faced were demand driven. There were some logistical issues as well in the supply chain. We've had also some domestic shipping issues. Little things here and there that have been an issue, but it's almost all demand driven."

            "name": "Michael Farrell",
            "content": "Thanks, Amy, and thank you all for joining us today. Since this COVID-19 pandemic began in January, ResMed has produced hundreds of thousands of ventilators, providing the gift of breath to people in need in 140 countries worldwide. We continue to support frontline respiratory medical professionals, health care providers, patients and our teammates, ResMedians, so they are all safe and healthy. We also continue to provide ventilators as local state and national health care providers are facing second and third waves of COVID-19 cases and associated hospitalizations. Thankfully, the magnitude of these hospitalization waves and thus, the need for emergency ventilators is decreasing over time.\n In our core markets, the patient diagnosis trends in sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and beyond are steadily increasing as well as prescription therapy flow from those diagnoses. Growing numbers of people are returning to health care systems, including primary care as well as specialist care. We are seeing more health care systems come back online through telehealth and in-person visits. Overall treatment capacity as well as capacity utilization rates of those systems are both increasing. We have seen a steady sequential, what we would call U-shape recovery of patient flow to primary care physicians as well as then to specialist physicians across the 140 countries that we serve. This is just as we forecast 90 days ago on our Q4 earnings call. We expect this same patient flow growth trend to continue throughout fiscal year 2021.\n In my remarks today, I'll provide a high-level overview of our Q1 business results, and then I'll hand over to Brett to walk us through further detail. I will also review progress towards our ResMed 2025 strategic goals, including execution highlights against our quarterly as well as our annual operating priorities.\n Today, we have reported high single-digit growth in top line revenue and strong double-digit growth in both net operating profit as well as earnings per share. These results speak to our team's ability to nimbly pivot to meet short-term needs for emergency ventilators, while also investing for the long-term growth in our core markets of sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and out-of-hospital medical software.\n Our investments in research and development for digital health technology have accelerated these last 9 months as we see increasing demand from patients, physicians, providers as well as health care systems as they embrace digital health through remote patient engagement as well as population health management technology.\n During the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we generated over $144 million of cash, allowing us to return $57 million of cash as dividends to our shareholders. At the same time, though, we have increased our research and development investments at double-digit rates, including investments in digital health clinical research as well as hardware and software innovation across both our med tech and our Software as a Service businesses. We have a very full pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium and long-term value for customers with an industry-leading intellectual property portfolio of over 6,000 patents and designs.\n Our digital health ecosystem is an important competitive advantage for ResMed that offers integrated care to drive superior clinical outcomes, to drive better patient experiences and to drive lower total health care system costs. We now have over 7 billion nights of respiratory medical data in our cloud-based Air Solutions platform. We've provided over 12.5 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices to customers, and we have over 14 million patients enrolled in our AirView software solution.\n During our last earnings call, I discussed how COVID-19 has accelerated the rapid adoption of digital health technology around the world, including a recognition of the value of remote patient monitoring, virtual diagnosis and the rapid evolution of digital reimbursement models. We have seen much greater collaboration between the med tech industry and governments globally, not just in ventilators but well beyond. An encouraging example of this was just a few days ago when the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services or CMS announced that it will be maintaining current reimbursement rates in our product categories in January 2021. This is great news. And in part, it is due to industry feedback that it was inappropriate to make unnecessary changes, particularly during an ongoing COVID-19 public health emergency, and really importantly, that current rates were appropriate for the services being provided.\n We've also seen governments in Germany, France, Japan and across the U.S. adopt models to facilitate digital health and remote care that will be important, not only during this pandemic but well beyond. This is better health care at lower costs, leveraging technology. These trends support ResMed's 2025 strategy, and we believe that the accelerated adoption of digital health solutions represents a significant medium and long-term tailwind for our business.\n These 3 trends: one, the increased importance of respiratory medicine; two, the increased importance of digital health; and three, the increased importance of out-of-hospital health care, will all help ResMed meet and beat our goal of growing volume at double digits from 2020 through 2025 and improving over 250 million lives by 2025.\n Let me now highlight a few examples of innovation and execution in support of our strategic priorities. Just a recap of our strategy priorities: a, to grow and differentiate our sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses; b, to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices and digital health solutions; and c, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered away from the hospital.\n In our core market of sleep apnea, we introduced our latest mask innovation in September. It's called the AirTouch N20. This innovation is the first nasal mask with a memory foam cushion. As a patient myself, I'm happy to say that this is ResMed's softest nasal mask ever. The memory foam technology of the AirTouch N20 adapts to the curves and contours of the person's face, creating a personalized fit that is designed to increase comfort and to make it easier for the patient to adhere to sleep apnea therapy. The adherence rates for ResMed solutions are the best in the industry. And it is innovation and technology like this new AirTouch N20 that helps get us there.\n Our mask portfolio is crafted to offer physicians market-leading options for prescribing for each patient. To enable home care providers to successfully fit the patient the first time every time and to satisfy the desires of the ultimate customer. That's the person who suffocates each night with sleep apnea. Our focus on innovation to meet customer needs will never end. We are innovating with smaller, quieter, more comfortable, more connected and more intelligent solutions every day. We have an exciting pipeline ahead.\n Let me now turn to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to deliver better care for COPD and asthma patients worldwide. During the June quarter, we launched in Europe an upgraded version of our AirView cloud-based remote monitoring software, specifically designed for our ventilation solutions. This solution called AirView for ventilation provides remote monitoring capability, allowing clinicians to quickly access clinical data from ResMed ventilation devices wherever they are and to allow them to more easily triage and prioritize both chronic needs and acute needs for ventilated patients. This completely reimagined platform transforms the management of ventilated patients, allowing doctors, nurses and all clinicians and care providers to ascertain powerful patient insights from huge respiratory medical data sets. Adoption of the AirView for ventilation solution has been rapid and strong.\n Our team was really thrilled to deliver for our customers during the COVID emergency with this solution, but the value that is being provided by AirView for ventilation is ongoing for physicians and health care systems. We are making digital health part of the standard of care. During the quarter, we expanded the reach of our market-leading Propeller Health technology, specifically through our partnership with pharmaceutical company, Novartis. During the quarter, Novartis announced the launch of 2 new once-daily medications to treat uncontrolled asthma in Japan. These products are called Enerzair and Atectura Breezhaler. In this market, patients using either the Enerzair or the Breezhaler manage their uncontrolled asthma will be able to acquire a Propeller technology sensor from physicians and then enroll in our Propeller digital health platform. The benefits of the platform are tremendous. The offering is a simple and convenient way to better live with sleep apnea with a fully integrated digital experience, with no incremental cost to the patient. It's great to see our Novartis partnership expanding to include now both Europe and Japan, leveraging our world-leading Propeller technology.\n Let me now briefly review our out-of-hospital Software as a Service business. During the quarter, our SaaS business grew in the mid-single digits year-on-year, driven by continued strong uptake of our HME resupply solutions. The COVID-19 market dynamics continue to impact the patient census volumes, particularly at skilled nursing facilities and new patient admissions have remained under pressure. We are maintaining our forecast that the SaaS market growth rate will be in the mid-single-digit range for the portfolio of verticals that we serve for fiscal 2021. We expect the portfolio to return to high single-digit growth as hospital and other outpatient surgery center discharge rates return to normal.\n We continue to invest in research and development for our SaaS businesses, so that we continuously improve on our market-leading solutions in home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice as well as private duty home care and life plan communities. As this portfolio of SaaS verticals returns to high single-digit growth, ResMed will continue to be there with our R&D resulting in leading Brightree and MatrixCare branded technology solutions, allowing us to better serve customers and therefore, to not just meet but to beat that market growth rate.\n A year ago, we announced that ResMed would begin collaborating with Cerner Corporation to help clinicians make more informed treatment decisions to control costs and to deliver seamless care across health care systems, from the hospital to the home. We have now integrated our MatrixCare branded home health and hospice platform with the electronic health record or EHR system from Cerner. I'm excited to let you know that we've expanded our relationship with Cerner to new offerings and have now entered into a new value-added reseller arrangement with Cerner. This establishes our Brightree technology as the preferred solution for Cerner's home medical equipment, pharmacy and home infusion customers. This development is the next step in the ResMed-Cerner relationship and will lead to better interoperability, it will lead to enhanced provider capabilities and it will lead to an improved patient experience. Overall, this partnership is performing above expectations for both ResMed and Cerner. We anticipate opportunities to deepen and expand this collaboration to involve our core markets of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma disease management over time. Stay tuned.\n In summary, the SaaS portfolio is performing well and remains an important driver of our digital transformation of health care in settings outside the hospital.\n 2020 has been an unprecedented year for companies across every industry. The fundamentals of our ResMed business, however, remains strong, and we've maintained growth through this crisis through breakthrough innovation, through investments in recurring revenue businesses and effective execution in our operating excellence programs. COVID-19 has accelerated digital health adoption as well as awareness of respiratory hygiene and respiratory health. The importance of respiratory medicine, the importance of digital health and the importance of health care delivered away from a hospital. These trends are present during COVID, but they're here to stay.\n Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to once again express my sincere thanks to more than 7,500 ResMedians, who -- that's what we call ourselves around the world for their perseverance and strength, hard work and dedication during unique once-in-a-century circumstances. You have allowed hundreds of thousands of people around the world to get emergency ventilators and to have the gift of breath, while also keeping focus on making sure we have the best technology and solutions now and in the future for sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and all those who need world-class care outside the hospital and preferably in their own home. Thank you all.\n With that, I'll hand the call now over to Brett in Sydney, and then we'll go to Q&A. Brett, over to you. Thanks for the question, Chris. And look, the one thing we know is that January 1, 2021, the rates will remain where they are. And that -- it was great that CMS listened to feedback from the industry. And it wasn't just around COVID, it was really around the fact that reimbursement rates currently as they are fit for the need. And if you read through the detail, the CMS actually said that through the process, they found that they weren't going to have any savings as they put it, which meant from my perspective that we've reached sort of market equilibrium in terms of where things are at. Now that's my interpretation. But Dave Pendarvis studies this far more detail than I do. Dave, do you want to give some more color and thoughts around the CMS announcement these last few days? So Chris, the private payers were already ahead of CMS on this and had been sort of on a mark-to-market basis doing things at their own rates before competitive bidding started back in the mid-2000s during and after. And so I don't think it's a risk. It's a guarantee that private payers are looking for market rates. I think what's great about this one because it's so public versus those sort of private negotiations that happen is that we've seen a public statement of an equilibrium reached between the bids that came in and the fair price that is appropriate for the provision of these services in the statement. So that's something that's new as part of it. But look, it's a complex web. We sell in 140 countries worldwide, not just one. We watch CMS, but we also watch the rest of the world, and we want to make sure that reimbursement rates are there for our channel, but really importantly, that we get to the 936 million people worldwide who suffer from sleep apnea. Yes. Thanks, Sean. I'll start, and I'll hand over to Brett for some more detail. Yes, look, excellent control. Obviously, travel costs are incredibly down. We have 75%, 80% of all the ResMedians worldwide selling in 140 countries working from home. And we've had a really smooth transition to 4,000, 5,000 people working from home and feeling comfortable doing so. And we are opening up our offices as appropriate in Europe, Asia and the Americas as cities, states and so on allow us to.\n Look, when we get to the other side of this pandemic, and that's a long time potentially with a vaccine and treatments that are efficacious, I do see some of those costs starting to go back up again, but they will be also concomitant with opening of health care systems that will be associated with the opening up of those economies. And so I think we've done a really good job in bringing expenses down on SG&A, 7% reduction year-on-year for the quarter to $159 million for the September quarter.\n But if you look closely, we also increased our R&D spend. We increased by 12%, constant currency, our R&D spend. And that's $54.5 million for the quarter. You annualize that, that's a really good $200-plus million that we're going to put into digital health technology, artificial intelligence, machine learning, improvements in smaller, quiet and more comfortable, more connected and more intelligent systems that can keep people breathing out of hospital and well taken care of. And so we are going to continue the investments in R&D and drive those through this crisis, and we are going to take the savings on SG&A now and be ready to reinvest in marketing and sales and growth in that SG&A as appropriate when the revenues start to come back. I hope that all makes sense, Sean. It's not just a one portfolio play, it's all part of a larger piece. Thanks, Gretel. It's a great question as we sort of model the kinetics of the recovery across our 140 countries. And as we look at it, and we -- obviously, I look at daily numbers, not just month-to-month and beyond, but there's a lot of sort of noise when you go down to a lower level of distraction. \n You pull back and you look at sort of that quarter-on-quarter trend, what we're seeing is sequential growth across the group. And let's look at some -- look at 3 big countries. And I think I talked about this 90 days ago, Gretel, but Germany is sort of, I would say, our leading country in terms of how they're opening up their economy. \n We are seeing at 85%, 90-plus percent of the pre-COVID patient flow and in some parts, 90% to 95% of the pre-COVID patient flow. It's through telehealth, it's through digital medicine, it's also through some in-person visits and in-lab tests. And so we're really at a very high point of recovery. \n And even with Angela Merkel closing restaurants and bars here in November, we do expect health systems to remain fully open during not just November, but on an ongoing basis because people need to get their primary care, people need to get their respiratory care. If they're suffocating, they need treatment for their sleep apnea. If they have trouble breathing, they need help for their COPD. And so we're seeing that in a really good case in Germany.\n If you take China, another big market we talked about last quarter, sort of at the 50% of pre-COVID levels. This quarter, China is now already at 70% of pre-COVID patient flow across a very large country, but that portfolio of different cities and states is now at 70% of pre-COVID, so a significant improvement from last quarter. And here in the United States, it's really a story of 50 different states and their approaches, but they vary from 60% to 80% if you think about it of the pre-COVID patient flow. And so on average of around 70% here in our biggest market in the United States. So you take that all and you see, yes, there is pretty strong sequential improvement. It's not a dramatic sort of V shape we're back to January 1 or December 31, 2019. But the -- every week, it does get better. Every month, it does get better across the portfolio of countries. Even with the second and third waves of Northern Hemisphere, with the coming flu period, we expect to see sequential improvement in the flow of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patients into our system. Yes, Margaret, it's a really good question. I'm going to hand to Jim for some further detail on this way. Across the world, we're seeing home sleep test -- home sleep apnea testing picked up over time. COVID-19 has been an accelerator for that because it was the only choice during the severe lockdowns. And as we get to the other side, it is lower cost and has equivalent sensitivity and specificity from the technology that's out there. But Jim, what further color do you have on that? The one bit of color I'll add on there, just to tag onto what Jim said, Margaret, is Germany, where there was actually quite a strong resistance from some sleep physicians to adopt home sleep apnea testing. They were skeptical of the efficacy, the practicality and could they really make it work. And because of the shutdowns were very strong in Germany during the peak of the crisis in March, April, it was the only way they could diagnose. The doctors then got used to it. And to Jim's point, I think on the other side of this, France will move up a little bit, but Germany will move up significantly in the percentage of patients with home sleep apnea testing as those doctors found that it was not only -- had high sensitivity and specificity on the clinical level, but it also had good outcomes at lower costs. David, you may be on mute. Yes, David, it's a really good question. I'll hand to Brett for some further detail on it after my remarks. But look, we've seen -- we saw incredible sort of $30 million in the March quarter, triple-digit millions of dollars in the June quarter, and as you noted, $40 million in the September quarter of what I would call emergency ventilator sales as part of the crisis. It may not go to precisely 0 this quarter, but it won't be as high in the December quarter as it was in the September quarter. And hopefully, as we're seeing the second and third waves, the magnitude, as I said in the prepared remarks, is lower of the second and third waves in terms of the impact on hospitalizations and reaching that sort of peak, ICU peak ventilator capacity. And so on a humanitarian basis, I hope we're right in that prediction that it goes very quickly down.\n We are seeing sequentially, from the June quarter to the September quarter, improvements in the number of patients coming through, the prescriptions coming through, and therefore, the devices that we are selling on the sleep side. We expect that improvement to continue through the December quarter. And so as you look through the fiscal year and you think about sort of modeling how that's going to happen, I think you can model a steady increase in the sleep apnea devices. And the sort of, what I will call a secular uptick in masks and accessories sales that was driven by, I think, respiratory hygiene and the importance of getting a clean mask, was not a onetime thing for the March or June quarter. You saw it was sustainable. As we predicted, it was sustainable here through the September quarter. And I think it's sustainable through the December quarter.\n I'm a patient and I know how important it is and how exciting it is, frankly, to get that new mask, to get that new cushion and to establish it up. It's like a brand-new cast mill and you get addicted to saying, \"Wow, respiratory health is important,\" and that is one thing through the suffering of COVID-19. It's almost a blessing that we've seen people realize that sleep apnea, COPD and asthma, respiratory health is incredibly important and keeping your device clean and keeping your mask clean is incredibly important as well as accessing data digitally has been incredibly important. So we think all of that will be there, and that's why we talk about this strong sequential increase, steady sequential increase throughout fiscal 2021. Brett, any further color? Yes, there will be some -- yes, I mean, there's constant currency adjustments, things like that, but certainly decreased, single-digit decreases. Lyanne, it's a great question, and it talks to how sustainable is what we're talking about earlier, Jim and I around home sleep apnea testing being adopted. In general, the costs for home sleep apnea testing are significantly below for the payer, the employer and the ultimate payer is the person who works for that company or pays the taxes in that country. So the numbers of the costs are significantly lower, often in order of magnitude lower. And so therefore, the copayments, if you're part of, say, U.S. plan like I'm, we have copayments, the copayment is proportional to the cost. And so therefore, an order of magnitude lower. So it is lower cost.\n And the question that physicians always had is, is it better care or at least as good care at lower cost. And I think what we saw through COVID-19, where people who hadn't adopted home sleep apnea testing as well, were forced to adopt it because it was the only way they could diagnose patients. They found well, the sensitivity and specificity from that clinical peer-reviewed article does happen in my practice, in my state, in my city. And so lower cost, as good outcomes, we saw great adoption. And I think that drives ongoing growth of it on a sustainable basis. As Jim was talking to earlier, I think countries that were x move to y, where y is above x, and we can't predict exactly what that permanent change is going to be. We just know it's going to move up because the momentum of economics and good clinical care just drive it that way. So I don't know, Jim, if you have any further color to provide on that from your last response on home sleep apnea testing. Yes. And this has actually been a sort of public-private partnership during COVID-19 as we all made the ventilators and partnered with the governments to do so that we have partnered on digital health, bringing -- as Jim said, bringing the emergency user authorization capability for that. \n There were actually codes that CMS had for digital health that were being underutilized in 2019. They brought them out early, I believe, in 2019. And even in 2018, we're doing some trials with them, and they were actually upset at CMS that the digital health codes weren't being utilized enough. \n COVID-19 drove an acceleration of that. And I think it will allow, again, the same thing as home sleep apnea testing applies to telehealth and all remote patient care, it's better during COVID times that you not go to that clinic because you won't get as exposed, not to that hospital, you won't get as exposed. \n It's also better during normal times, if you can do stuff at lower cost with better outcomes and not having to go to that hospital, not having to go to that clinic, if you can do it from the comfort of your own home. And as Jim said, the consumer prefers lower cost and at their own home, and that's all of ResMed's strategies to give that health care way you want it. Thanks, Matthew. Good question. Propeller Health is early phase in terms of the technology. It's certainly having a huge impact in getting a major multi-hundred billion-dollar pharma companies to adopt it with their brand-new prescribable drugs, particularly in the asthma space in Europe and Japan. As to when it becomes a material part of ResMed's P&L and I'm breaking it out on a quarterly basis, it's going to be a while for that. And so it won't be in here in fiscal 2021. But as we look to our 2025 strategy over these next 5 years, I do expect that that type of digital health solution is going to be a double-digit part of ResMed's delivery, and I will be talking about it on a quarterly basis, not just through milestones of pharmaceutical company releases with lead products and brand-new not generics, but high-end prescribable products. I think that we will see this go well beyond where it started just here in asthma. It will go across COPD. And there are literally billions -- tens of billions of dollars that could be saved in keeping COPD patients out of hospital with better adherence to their drugs.\n Our work has shown that we can improve adherence rates by up to 58% and lower total cost of emergency visits and emergency costs by 25%. But look, it's a great question, Matthew. I'm not going to predict the exact quarter and timing, but I can tell you that over the next 20 quarters, it will become a significant part. We will be calling it out because it works. And pharmaceutical companies know how to do things at scale. And when they start to see that it improves the outcomes for their patients, that their doctors are happier and most importantly, that the patients are happier and out of hospital, lower cost, better outcomes, it's going to take off very quickly, exponentially. Yes. I'll provide just a little overview, and then I'll hand to Rob Douglas, our COO, to provide further. Look, what we've seen during COVID-19 is a variety of different products and solutions that have been used for patients from oxygen to high-flow therapy, to full noninvasive ventilation and then full invasive intubated ventilation. So I think there was some good exposure to what high-flow therapy can do with COVID because it can provide some of the particles to move around hospitals and so on. HFT did not get as frontline on its therapy as fully intubated ventilators. But we think it gave some good exposure and has accelerated a little bit. Yes, this is very early days with high-flow therapy, but it's a technology that we've put together on some of our existing platforms with great intellectual property and great opportunities for growth over time. But Rob, do you want to provide some further detail on what we're doing with Lumis HFT? Thanks, Suraj. It's a great question. So Software as a Service, our SaaS division, is 12% of our revenues. It's a really important part of our long-term growth to apply our digital health technology capability outside the hospital and in the 7 verticals we're in where we're a market leader in the top 1 or 2 of each of those categories. Yes, as I noted in the prep remarks, Suraj, we've seen a slowdown of the flow of patients into hospitals and therefore, out of hospitals to skilled nursing facilities, in particular, as well as nursing homes and others. And we do expect that that, sort of, if you like, recovery will take some time. And that's why I sort of said that the markets that we serve as a weighted average portfolio growth will grow in those sort of mid-single digits throughout this fiscal year. We expect to meet that and beat that where we can.\n And then as we get to beyond the sort of 12-month time frame, I do think there's opportunities for those markets to get to the high single-digit growth. And with inorganic plays, there are opportunities to get to low double-digit growth across that portfolio. Look, we never accept market growth. \n We want to meet it and beat it. One thing we are doing in that division as well as in our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma groups is we're investing in innovation. We have great -- in the beauty of Software as a Service innovation is you're talking weeks between sprints and then getting an MVP out there to provide a solution to customers. \n And so we have seen some really good innovation come into play to help people deal with COVID-19 that have helped them sort of through this crisis. And we think that when we get back to the sort of normal flow through hospitals and ASCs of patients getting discharged into the out-of-hospital post-acute network, we will start to see the centers pick up and therefore, the revenues pick up as the number of patients in that setting picks up over time. \n And so yes, look, we have a leading position. We're going to do well in the mid-single digits. We'll do well in the high single digits. And over time, as we add inorganically, we can push even beyond that. Thanks, David. Yes, that's a 2-part question. So I'll have a go. Actually, you know, I'm going to hand the whole question to Jim Hollingshead rather than do half of it. Over to you, Jim. So the first question about restocking, second one about POCs. Look, Brett, do you want to take something with regard to the restocking and talk about inventory levels from Q-on-Q? And then, Rob, do you want to have a go at the oxygen question. Over to you, Brett, first? Thanks, Anthony. Yes, look, it's a complex equation, and there are so many moving pieces with second and third waves as regards to the global pandemic. So all we know about every prediction that's been made in the last 9 months is they're wrong. So we don't know precisely what the needs are going to be through the second and third waves. And last quarter, we were a bit muted about what we thought would happen this quarter and then we had $40 million worth of sales in the September quarter. But look, our best projections of the sort of epidemiology and sort of humanitarian model that we put together at the flow of COVID-19 around 140 countries that we treat in within the big countries, specifically in some cities and states that we're looking at, we don't think we're going to reach a state where there's going to be hospitalizations like we had early January, February in Wuhan, and then March -- February, March in Milan and then March, April in New York, where you reached 100% capacity and literally ran out of ventilators and ran out of ICU beds for those ventilators.\n Our best models show that the magnitude of the second and third waves are actually reduced in cities in China, that we've seen second and third waves, across Singapore, where we've seen them in in some parts of Europe, where we're already seeing them. And so we're just being realistic that we don't expect sort of those emergency use ventilators to be at the sort of magnitude. And you can actually see that it went from a triple-digit millions in the June quarter, down to $40 million in the September quarter. It will be significantly reduced here in the December quarter. I'm not saying it will necessarily be de minimis, but it might be. And look, our job is to focus on our core market and the coming back of that. And what we're seeing is our investments in digital health, we've made these last 5 years and how we're the market leader there, have incredibly well set us up for the growth in that.\n And so I think as you start to look at modeling ResMed looking at a year-on-year is going to be a very difficult and complex equation, which I'm not sure you'll ever get to the right answer until, even us until the numbers are in on it. What we can look at is Q-on-Q, quarter-on-quarter sequential sleep apnea, COPD, across those devices portfolio, across those masks portfolio, from Q1 to Q2, Q2 to Q3 and Q3 to Q4. We're going to see sequential increase in the sleep devices. We're going to see increase in the sleep and COPD masks and accessories as we go through that quarter.\n So complex equation, yes, down sort of in the single digits year-on-year in devices, but hugely complex equation with tailwinds and headwinds. Look at Q-on-Q, when you start to see the positive trend of what's happening as we're opening up and as economies are working out how to run digital health and home sleep apnea testing and remote COPD diagnosis and prescriptions for asthma and getting patients on to the platforms like Propeller, like AirView for ventilation, like AirSense 10 and its Air Solutions platform. And that's where we're investing, and that's where, frankly, our technology will win. Thanks, David. Yes, yes, I believe it was demand driven, as you saw, we had really good numbers in the quarter. But Jim, do you know any details of -- across the sleep business? Right. Thanks, Cheryl, and thanks again to all of our shareholders for joining us on this call. I'd like to take the opportunity here at the end to thank the 7,500 ResMedians, many of whom, almost all of whom are shareholders as well for their dedication, hard work, helping people sleep better, breathe better and live better lives outside the hospital in 140 countries. Thanks for what you do today and every day. Thanks especially to our ResMed heroes who are going to our plants and production plants, our distribution plants, our tech services centers, and actually, because you have to touch physical product not being able to work from home. Thank you for following all safety procedures and doing that really well through this crisis. I look forward to talking to all of our shareholders here in around 90 days. Amy, I hand over to you to close out."

            "content": "Sure. So Chris, yes, our view of the probable outcome here is you've got a 3-year run at least until January 1, 2024, of these current rates, plus inflation adjustments on January 1 on each of those years. Those are in the competitive bid areas. In addition to that, CMS has got a proposed rule-out, which if they finalize, would add a continuation of the 50-50 blended rate in rural areas. Those are both really good outcomes for our industry. They provide stability, they provide rates that these folks can count on, and they allow for any willing provider to be able to provide in the markets.\n Now you can always find legislative opportunities for the administration to do different things, to come in earlier, to change things up a little bit. That -- so is it possible? Sure. Is it likely? We don't think so. So we're going to be basing our plans on a continuation of these rates going forward with the caveat that governments can always do things that are unexpected and subject to their own control."

We -- again, you know our strategy is out of hospital, and it hasn't been strongly studied in those types of environments. So really, it's more part of a long-term play to see how HFT might fit in with our long-term strategy. It's a trial that will take its time to enroll patients. These respiratory device trials in the home setting are generally pretty tough to do and so -- and take a time. So we won't be reporting out of that super quickly, but it's certainly a very interesting area for us, and we think we've got some good solutions. Andrew, yes, our POC program sort of just continues as we have -- we continue to learn. We've still got our products in their sort of product launch, process and post that. And we continue to learn, and we're sort of still making adjustments and experiments of how to get the right patients to the right providers for the right treatment there. So it's pretty much a sort of a long-term thing for us on that. No. Not that material to our overall business."

Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Kevin, and hi, everyone. Welcome to ResMed's Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. We thank you for joining us. This call is being webcast live, and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today, along with a copy of our earnings release and the presentation, both of which are available now. Joining me on the call today are our Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. Following our prepared remarks, we will host a Q&A session, and Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; and David Pendarvis, Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release. And as a reminder, our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future operating and financial performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now go ahead and turn the call over to Mick.\nMichael Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you all for joining us today as we review the results for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2022 ended June 30. On today's call, I will provide a brief high-level overview of our financial results. I'll then review progress towards our ResMed 2025 strategic goals, and then discuss our actions to navigate through ongoing industry and supply chain challenges. Brett will then join the call to review our financial results in more detail. Okay. Let's jump right in. Our fourth quarter results reflect strong performance across our business with high single-digit revenue growth in both our sleep and respiratory care business segment as well as in our Software-as-a-Service business segment. Our ongoing growth reflects our global team's relentless focus to solve very complex supply chain problems and find alternate design and engineering solutions to address the incredible industry challenges that we have faced over the past year and beyond. The global supply chain environment remains very much in flux across multiple industries. We are starting to see indications that the macro environment is improving, particularly semiconductor availability. However, we're mindful that even as macro trends start to improve, we still need our supplier partners to prioritize med tech component needs over other nonlife-sustaining industries. Demand in the market remains very strong. We've been able to mitigate some of the electronic component bottlenecks with the launch of our redesigned card to cloud AirSense 10 devices introduced to the market midway through our fourth quarter. As you can imagine, clearing one bottleneck simply brings the next rate-limiting step to the forefront. Our team is actively working to clear as many bottlenecks as they can as quickly as possible. On the positive news side, the redesign, reengineering and launch of the card to cloud device greatly improved our ability to meet the incredible demand that we see in the marketplace. During the last month of the quarter, during June, we were able to allocate more products to our customers than in recent months and in recent quarters. We're not out of the woods yet, but the compass is pointing to true north and we are on top of it. Throughout this crisis of demand and supply, our established ResMed guiding principles remain the same: that is that we will give priority to the production and delivery of devices to meet the needs of the highest-acuity patients first. As we discussed last quarter, we are still facing a challenging freight environment. The key challenges of sea freight and airfreight are due to reduced availability and elevated prices. These forces are impacting our ability to efficiently get components into our factories and then to get the finished goods out of those factories and ship to warehouses and ultimately to customers. We continue to do everything that we can to secure additional supply to ultimately further increase production of our devices. As highlighted on previous calls, this includes a combination of 5 concurrent work streams in supply chain. One, we are locking in the flow of our existing parts from existing suppliers. Two, we are establishing flow of existing parts from new suppliers. Three, we're validating and verifying new parts from existing suppliers. And four, we're validating and verifying new parts from new suppliers. And then finally, five, we're reengineering designs to mitigate the major supply bottlenecks. In summary, we're making good progress with these 5 lines of work, and we've been able to offset some of the impacts of the component shortages to best support patients, providers, physicians and beyond. In addition to the successful launch of our redesigned card to cloud device last quarter, we also continue to support our customers with our market-leading mask portfolio. The supply -- despite the challenges we faced with reduced new patient setups due to a competitor recall, we continue to see strong uptake of our mask solutions as our customers want the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable, the easiest to fit and the most highly patient-rated masks in the market, and those come from ResMed. Peer-reviewed and published studies have clearly shown that patients that are on a ReSupply program are much more likely to remain on sleep apnea treatment adherent for the long term than those that aren't on a ReSupply program. Our home care provider customers not only want to put new patients on therapy, they want to keep those new patients and all of their existing patients on therapy over the long term. And the ultimate goal there is to improve patient outcomes to lower total health care system costs as well as to drive their own recurring revenue streams. We recognize that this demand outstripping supply situation remains a very difficult temporary state for all customers, including physicians, home medical equipment providers, payers, health care systems as well as the most important customer of all, the patient. We continue to work across the industry to be the best partner and the best solutions provider for all customers. We expect demand to be greater than supply for at least 12 more months, driven by the recall of one of our competitors primarily. The net result is that every device that we here at ResMed make during these next 12 months, we will sell as it leaves the production line to a warehouse and is shipped to a customer. We are looking at every angle to maximize supply and address this incredible demand these next 12 months. As a company, we are learning every day. And as an industry, we will get through this challenge stronger than ever. Our goal is to ensure that every person gets the care that they need, where they need it, when they need it, and we won't stop until we achieve that goal. Let's now briefly review the COVID-related market impacts on our industry. Most of the 140 countries that we operate in are now above 100% of pre-COVID levels of patient flow. It is noted that in some regions and some countries, we see ongoing surges of new COVID variants with some select governments continuing to impose COVID restrictions. In these areas, patient flow remains below pre-COVID levels. But across the board, we are seeing ongoing adoption of digital health solutions for screening, for diagnosis and for remote patient setup and monitoring as well as well-established COVID cleaning protocols at sleep labs and physician offices. These trends continue to minimize the impact of new variants and diminish the absolute impact of COVID on our industry over time. Let's now step back a little and review ResMed's top 3 strategic priorities: number one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses; number two, to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and number three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care that is delivered outside the hospital and especially in the home. The launch of our next-generation device platform called the AirSense 11 continues to go very well. It remains somewhat difficult to differentiate the success of the launch from previous generations with the incredibly high demand we're seeing around the world. Every Air 11 we make is sold immediately as it leaves the manufacturing floor. However, when we drill into patient feedback data, we see that patients are very excited about the platform, including the Air 11 device itself and the myAir software solutions surrounding it. During the fourth quarter, we introduced the AirSense 11 into several new countries outside the United States where we first launched the platform, including France, Switzerland and across the Nordic countries of Northern Europe. We look forward to further expansion into additional countries as we progress through our fiscal year 2023. One area that we are closely watching is patient adoption of digital health solutions. And to that point, adoption rates of the myAir app by new patients set up on therapy with the AirSense 11 continue to be more than double that of the AirSense 10. This is because the AirSense 11 platform is designed to enable and encourage patients to engage directly with their own health care. The bottom line is that people want personal care. They want their own data on their own app on their own phone. And they love the coaching and personal engagement of our ecosystem. They are voting with their digital presence, and repeat usage of the myAir app is stronger than ever. More patients on myAir means more patients are fully engaging with ResMed's software technology. This has led us to now passing over 12 billion nights of sleep apnea and respiratory care medical data in the cloud. Our software solutions, including myAir and AirView, are delivering a better patient experience, better efficiencies for home care providers and physicians, and most importantly, greater long-term adherence to therapy for the patient. Another key aspect of our long-term growth strategy is driving awareness and increasing the flow of patients through the top of the sleep apnea diagnosis funnel. COVID-19 has advanced awareness, adoption and acceptance of digital health. For our industry, this is specifically seen in the increased usage of home-based sleep apnea tests. Although new patient demand gen is clearly not a top priority in the immediate term given the current supply-demand imbalance, we are maintaining our focus in this area and our long-term investments so that we are ready when conditions improve and we can pivot and fire up our portfolio of demand-gen models and thereby ensure sustainable long-term pipelines of new patients for our industry. With over 1 billion people suffocating every night with sleep apnea worldwide, we see this work as an opportunity, but also an obligation as the market leader in the field. We are innovating with health care system partners and all of our customers to create an even more efficient and effective approach to sleep apnea patient identification, screening, diagnosis, treatment and management. We will continue to invest in technology that enables an end-to-end, seamless, digital experience for patients and their caregivers. As we consider opportunities to address the wider sleep market, we are investing in opportunities to address another major sleep disorder epidemic, that of insomnia. Insomnia has been shown in clinical research to occur in combination with sleep apnea, and that's a deadly combination. To this medical need and this medical opportunity, just last week, we announced the acquisition of a company called mementor. This is a German and Swiss digital health start-up that develops and sells digital medical products in the field of sleep medicine and beyond. mementor offers the first and so far the only permanently listed digital health application in the field of sleep medicine that is reimbursed by the statutory insurances in Germany. The acronym for these German digital health apps is DIGA, D-I-G-A. This acquisition furthers our efforts to diversify and accelerate growth of our ResMed business in Germany and the potential opportunity with DIGA to expand this offering into other markets around Europe and around the world. There's an unmet need in diagnosing and treating people with sleep problems, such as sleep apnea and insomnia, the 2 biggest sleep problems on the planet and especially when there's an overlap of these chronic conditions. This acquisition of mementor broadens our focus in this vertical from a sleep apnea therapy company to a true sleep therapy company. More to come as we pursue growth in this exciting space in Germany and beyond. Growth trends in the global sleep apnea market are in a state of flux in the short term given the market supply-demand dynamics that we talked about and the recall from one of our competitors. Long term, we estimate the underlying growth trends in the global sleep apnea market to be very strong; in the mid-single-digit range for devices and the high single-digit range for masks. As always, our goal is to drive market demand and to meet or beat market growth through generation of new patients and sales of our market-leading therapy solutions and the introduction of new innovations and alternative treatment pathways that enable us to address even more patients with undiagnosed sleep apnea. Current industry dynamics indicate that we have a multiyear opportunity to drive even greater ongoing acceptance and adoption of our solutions to further solidify our market leadership position. I've challenged our global ResMed team to strive for even stronger growth in the coming months and quarters and the fiscal year and beyond. I'm telling them to go get the share, to go lock in that share with digital health with value that speaks for itself with lower costs, better outcomes for patients and increased efficiencies for the health care system. Turning to a discussion of our respiratory care business. I want to focus on our strategy to better serve the 380 million people worldwide with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, with many others with neuromuscular diseases and respiratory insufficiency and the 330 million patients that suffer from asthma worldwide. Our goal is to reach hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including noninvasive ventilation as well as life support ventilation; as well as newer therapeutic areas, such as our cloud-connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions from our Propeller team; and high-flow therapy offerings that we are conducting clinical trials on right now, including our product platform called Lumis HFT. Demand for our core noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for COPD and neuromuscular disease and beyond remains solid throughout the quarter. Ventilation solution demand was supported by the continued success, adoption and scaling of our AirView for ventilation software platform by customers as they experience the benefits of remote monitoring to better manage their ventilated patient populations through remote access to clinical data as well as customizable physician notifications. Let me now review our Software-as-a-Service business for outside hospital care. Our SaaS business achieved another quarter of high single-digit growth year-on-year across our portfolio of verticals, including home medical equipment as well as facilities-based and home-based care settings. Our SaaS customers recognize the need for technology solutions to solve their challenges with efficiency and scale, and our software, services and solutions help them achieve both. The continued growth of home-based care is providing tailwinds for HME solutions as well as home health solutions. We continue to grow with our customers as they increase their utilization of our software and our data solutions to improve and optimize their business efficiencies and their patient care, including Brightree and Snap ReSupply offerings. As businesses continue to open up, we've been able to visit customers more and more in person as well as attend trade shows, host conferences, where the interest in our Brightree, MatrixCare, HEALTHCAREfirst and Citus offerings remain very strong. Earlier this week, I personally attended the Inspire 2022 Conference in Austin, Texas. This is MatrixCare's annual customer summit, and it was in person for the first time since 2019. I had the pleasure and the opportunity of presenting and engaging in person with over 600 customers and partners from home health, skilled nursing, senior living, private-duty home care, life plan community verticals and beyond. The passion for caring for each patient that was involved in every conversation I had this week, the openness, the sharing and the ability for us as a community to move patients to lower-cost, lower-acuity and higher-quality outcome cares, those settings was palpable at Inspire 2022. I came away from that conference even more energized and excited about the opportunities that we have to support customers across the care settings with our digital health and our software solutions. The ultimate goal is that customers of our Brightree- and MatrixCare-branded solutions can provide better care for the people that they serve. Given the passion of our customers and the service levels that we're providing and the product pipeline that was discussed at this conference, I expect we'll continue to not only take share from our competitors across the portfolio, but even drive growth with more tech solutions being adopted by customers across care settings. The COVID-19 pandemic has been and remains challenging for facility-based verticals in our SaaS business, particularly skilled nursing and to a lesser extent hospice, where patient census rates below -- remain below pre-pandemic levels. As COVID restrictions continue to ease and our customers improve their line of sight to better conditions and better cleaning, we are seeing pent-up demand for technology investments in these facility-based areas. This provides opportunities for us to sell more services and more tech solutions to existing customers as well as to increase our new customer pipeline. One MatrixCare customer at Inspire 2022 grabbed me at the conference, and he described what he called a rocket ship acceleration of demand at skilled nursing tech solutions for those skilled nursing customers. This is a really welcome sign for sustainable growth across our SaaS portfolio. So as we look at our portfolio of solutions across care settings, we expect our SaaS group revenue to maintain high single-digit growth throughout fiscal year 2023. As always, our goal is to meet or beat market growth rates, and we will continue to invest and innovate to grow the market and to take share. Our growth in SaaS will come through organic and inorganic growth. We've long talked about our desire to expand our SaaS offerings internationally if and when we found the right opportunity for ResMed. In early June, we announced the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, the leading provider of end-to-end software solutions for home health and for nursing home providers in Germany. We've been closely watching the evolution of the German digital health system and the associated outside hospital health care system for many years. And we've actually been closely watching MEDIFOX DAN for a number of years. This is our first investment in a pure-play SaaS business in Europe, and it's a great opportunity to expand our reach in this business globally. We're starting in Germany as it is not only a market where we're vertically integrated in our core business of sleep and respiratory care, it's also one of our largest markets globally and a country where the government is investing in digital health reimbursement. We're excited about the opportunity to accelerate innovation and recurring revenue business models through this acquisition in Germany. As we discussed on the acquisition call that we had in June, MEDIFOX DAN will be immediately accretive to ResMed at close. Progress towards closing this acquisition is moving ahead as expected. We remain on track to close by the end of December 2022 in our fiscal 2023 second quarter. We are the leading strategic provider of SaaS solutions for outside hospital care globally, and we provide mission-critical software across a broad set of very attractive markets. We are well positioned, and we have created a differentiated value for our customers and for ResMed with our SaaS business investments. I'm excited about the future of our SaaS business. And Bobby Ghoshal and the excitement that he had on Inspire 2022 with the crowd for both MatrixCare and Brightree was an inspiration for me as the CEO of the parent company but also for the whole team there. It's an important part of ResMed's future growth, and I see a lot of opportunities to invest in lower-cost, lower-acuity settings of care. We believe that this is the future of health care delivery, and that's where ResMed competes and it's where ResMed wins. To bring it all together, our strategic focus remains on personal care that is patient-centric, physician-centric and provider-centric. This triple-pronged approach, combined with our unique ResMed culture, means that we are very well positioned to continue winning in the vastly underserved medical markets of sleep apnea, COPD, neuromuscular disease, asthma, insomnia and beyond.  We are transforming outside hospital care at scale. We're leading the market in digital health technology with over 12 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and nearly 18 million cloud-connectable medical devices on people's bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are unlocking value by using de-identified data to help patients, providers, physicians, payers and entire health care systems. We have invested in the cybersecurity, the privacy, the cloud ops, the data analytics, the AI/ML capabilities to do this at scale, unmatched by any competitor. And we are increasing our investments and our lead each and every day. Our 2 key global customer-facing software products, AirView and myAir, are 100% in the cloud. Our devices are both cloud-connected and cloud-enabled, making ResMed itself a market-leading cloud-connected and cloud-enabled digital health company. Our mission and goal to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025 drives and motivates ResMedians every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal this last fiscal year 2022. We changed nearly 141 million lives these last 12 months with our devices, our mask systems, our software solutions, helping people sleep better, breathe better and live higher-quality lives with outside hospital care. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude and thanks to more than 8,000 ResMedians helping their customers in 140 countries. Your perseverance, hard work and dedication has been impeccable. Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we'll open up for Q&A. Brett, over to you.\nBrett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. We had solid financial performance in Q4 despite the headwinds we faced due to significant ongoing supply chain constraints in a challenging freight environment. Group revenue for the June quarter was $915 million, an increase of 4%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 8%. Revenue growth reflects increased demand for our sleep products across our portfolio and increased device demand generated by our competitor's ongoing product recall. We did not derive incremental revenue from COVID-19-related demand during the June quarter compared to $20 million in the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we expect negligible revenue from COVID-19-related demand. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related demand in the prior year, revenue increased by 10% on a constant currency basis. In relation to the impact of our competitor's recall, we estimate that we generated incremental device revenue in the range of $60 million to $70 million in the June quarter. Note, this is consistent with the estimated $60 million to $70 million incremental device revenue in the prior year quarter. For fiscal year '22, this brings the total estimated incremental revenue in the range of $230 million to $250 million associated with our competitor's recall. While we continue to experience ongoing challenges in securing sufficient production components to meet market demand, we are now seeing a stable to improving supply chain environment. This has given us more confidence around our expectation of increasing device production in fiscal year '23 relative to fiscal year '22. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries increased by 12%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 1% in constant currency terms. By product segment globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 6%, while masks and other sales increased by 11%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 11% as we benefited from incremental revenue due to our competitor's recall. Masks and other sales increased by 13%, reflecting solid resupply revenue and achieved despite the challenging device supply environment, which continues to limit new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales decreased by 2% in constant currency terms or excluding the impact of COVID-19-related sales in the prior year increased by 7% in the current -- in constant currency terms. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 7% in constant currency terms or excluding COVID-19-related sales in the prior year increased by 9% in constant currency terms. Software-as-a-Service revenue increased by 8% in the June quarter. We saw a strong performance from our HME segment as customers continue to utilize our SaaS solutions to streamline and more efficiently run their businesses. And we are seeing stability in the skilled nursing care segment despite the continuing challenges of COVID-19. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release. Gross margin increased by 50 basis points to 57.8% in the June quarter. The increase is predominantly attributable to improvement in average selling prices and a positive product mix, partially offset by higher freight component and manufacturing costs, negative geographic mix and unfavorable foreign currency movements. Moving on to operating expenses. We are seeing a more normalized expenditure profile as COVID-19 impacts subside compared to the low comparable growth rate we experienced in Q4 last year. SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter increased by 6%, or in constant currency terms, increased by 11%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related costs and T&E expenses. SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue at 21.1% remained broadly consistent with the 20.7% we recorded in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% during fiscal year '23. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 7%, or in constant currency terms increased by 11%. The R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7% compared to 6.8% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% in fiscal year '23. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 4%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 17.6% compared to the prior year quarter rate of 21.5%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year '23 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the quarter increased by 10%, and our diluted earnings per share for the quarter also increased by 10%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $79 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings, offset by higher levels of working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $29 million; depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $37 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends to shareholders totaling $61 million. We recorded equity losses of $2.5 million in our income statement in the June quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $3 million per quarter in fiscal year '23 associated with the joint venture operation. We ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $274 million. At June 30, we had $780 million in gross debt and $500 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. At June 30, we had approximately $1.4 billion available for drawdown under our revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share, representing an increase of 5% over the previous quarterly dividend and reflecting the Board's confidence in our operating performance. Our solid cash flow and low leverage provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. We recently announced the MEDIFOX DAN acquisition and expect to close this transaction before the end of the calendar year pending regulatory clearances. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D and also expect to continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions, such as the recently announced acquisition of mementor, a German pioneer and health tech start-up that develops and distributes digital medical products in the field of sleep medicine and related areas. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Brett, and thanks, Mick. Kevin, I'll now turn the call over to you to provide instructions and manage the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Craig Wong-Pan from Royal Bank of Canada.\nCraig Wong-Pan: Mick, you mentioned at the start that you were seeing some improvement in the global supply chain. I just wanted to understand the details around what you meant by that improvement, and when that could start to see improvements to your manufacturing volumes.\nMichael Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Craig. And what we've seen over the last 2, 3, 4 quarters was a really deteriorating supply situation, where we were getting decommits, a word I'd never heard of in supply chain, including my time at BHP and other companies that just -- you never heard of that sort of supply even in commodity industries, and to get it in specialty industries was so unusual. What we're seeing is that sort of noise is starting to go away. And what I'd say is it's a stable to improving component supply environment and that's what we're seeing. But I don't know, Rob, if you want to provide any further color on the supply chain and how we're -- for the details on how we're seeing a supply that's stable to improving on components.\nRobert Douglas: Sure. Yes, Mick. Craig, one of the sort of fundamental things of supply chain management is ongoing risk management and having sort of the ability to foresee problems and to react through all of that. And then you also manage your risk through inventories and that type of thing. We've over recent months put in place a lot of forward orders, working a lot on relationships with key suppliers. We suspect that sort of global demand on these suppliers is moderating a little bit. And then as Mick says, that means that they're sticking with their commitments at a higher level than what we have seen recently. There are always problems to overcome. And as Mick said earlier, there are other bottlenecks. Once we close one bottleneck, we have to go and work on the next. But overall, I'd say we're feeling better about the forward outlook that we have, and we've got a little more clarity. It's not perfect. There still will be challenges and undoubtedly unexpected things that we'll have to manage through, but the net of it all is that we should see our volumes continue to increase from here.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs.\nChris Cooper: So I noticed, Mick and Brett, no specific guidance on the recall tailwind in fiscal '23. Obviously, I understand the prudence. But I guess just given the importance of the debate, perhaps you can just share your latest thoughts on how you see that dynamic playing out this year.\nMichael Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris, and it's a really good one. But as you know, we've annualized the impact of that competitor recall. And for us now, as I said in my prepared remarks, for the next 12 months, I do not believe there'll be really in the new patient market given the consent decree work they've got to do, the remediation work they've got to do in responding to that and the observations. And so what that means for us is basically demand that is incredible for these next 12 months, and that every device we make will be solved as it comes through the manufacturing line. And so the rate-limiting step on that, as Rob said, will be a bunch of bottlenecks that we'll work our way through. And it's like a game of Whac-A-Mole. We just keep -- find a problem, solve it; find the next problem, solve it. And ResMed is exceptional at that continuous improvement process. Our supply chain teams, our manufacturing teams, our distribution teams have been heroic in the ventilator crisis in 2020 and then the supply chain crisis of '21-'22. And so that gives us confidence to say sequentially every quarter through fiscal '23, we're going to see those volumes improve. And we've got line of sight to that, and we've got interactions with suppliers on that, and we think it's going to go up every quarter. I don't look at this as incremental or temporal taking of share now. This is permanent share taking. We're going to go in, we're going to get the share, we're going to lock it in with digital health solutions. And when somebody uses something that lowers their labor costs by 50%, that improves the adherence rate of the end customer, the patient, to 87%, 9 out of 10 patients getting adherent at day 9 and beyond, that's where we can lock it in. So that's sort of some extra color for you, Chris, but great question.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley.\nSean Laaman: Mick, my question is around the card to cloud devices. And is there anything that you note with respect to either compliance rates or resupply potential with card to cloud versus direct cloud connectivity? And is there a view that maybe you get patients that are on card to cloud devices back to the fully charged AirSense 11 at some point?\nMichael Farrell: Thanks, Sean. Two questions. Card to cloud AirSense 10 is really new. I mean we just really launched it midway through and really in the month of June in the quarter. So it's early days on that. But we've got a lot of experience with card to cloud. I mean think about the S8 and then the S9 with its little SD chip in the back of S9. The product -- when I was running the sleep business, we launched that back in '09 and '10. And we -- so we have a lot of experience with card to cloud. And it's primarily -- the card to cloud, primarily volume has been in the U.S. And that's where we had a very strong digital health system and engagement with our HME partners in a card to cloud environment. So we don't have sort of adherence exact numbers delta between AS 10 C2C versus AS 11.  I think it will be higher, the adherence on the AirSense 11 just because we're getting double the rate of myAir uptake, and that digital health engagement drives higher adherence. And I can tell you as soon as we get clearance on line of sight to those comms chips picking up supply, we'll move everybody to AirSense 11 as soon as we have it.  Probably, we won't go back and retrofit the groups that are there, just because people when they get therapy, they're happy. And the data will go to the cloud, they just won't go to the cloud every day. It will go when the SD card is uploaded on day 30, 60 or 90, and when they see the home care provider and the physician. And so they're not lost patients, they're not lost data. They're still part of the ecosystem, it's just not quite as efficient as it could be. So we're going to get back to AS 11 and really ramping that as fast as possible. But given the supply demand crisis, I was amazed and thrilled that our team was able to pivot in June, get there. And we're going to be able to do that through September and December quarters here as well and beyond. But thanks for your question, Sean.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair.\nMargarate Boeye: This is Maggie Boeye on for Margaret today. I wanted to ask one on ReSupply, just the trends you're seeing this quarter and if you're continuing to see incremental and permanent share gains within that market as well.\nMichael Farrell: Yes. Thanks, Maggie. Great question, allows us to talk about masks. Despite that competitor not being there for new patient setups where we had a lot of adoption of ResMed masks on their platform as well as ours and then it's not in the market. We saw mask growth rates at 11% constant currency globally. We saw 13% constant currency growth in the quarter on masks in the U.S. And we saw a pretty strong 7% constant currency growth on masks in Europe, Middle East and other markets. And so I actually think that the team and all the work we've done with Brightree and Snap ReSupply in the U.S. and all the work our European and Middle East teams and our Asia teams have done around engaging patients digitally through either myAir or other marketing and adherence programs have performed really well. And despite the headwind of lower new patient setups, we're achieving at or above market growth rates. And to the second part of your question, yes, I do think we're taking share across categories. And I think we're creating new categories by some of our innovations in the different types of comfort and design of the masks, the minimalist masks, the fun comfort masks, the over-the-head masks and -- so creating new segments, taking share in those and being able to lock in that share. Because when a patient gets happy on their mask, like I am with my AirFit P10, they tend to stick with it for life. And it's a great thing for us to be able to do on that. So really excited about it, and I look forward to more mask innovation coming out and more share taking and locking it in over time.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc.\nMatthew Mishan: I guess I wanted to ask a question on the gross margins. Do you have a sense of kind of what the supply issues, FX, retrofitting, all of this is having on your productivity and kind of gross margins in FY '22?\nMichael Farrell: That's a great question, Matthew. I'm going to hand that to Brett. Any color on GM there for Matthew?\nBrett Sandercock: Yes. Matthew, I mean it is because we're just trying to maximize the devices out the door with the components that we have. So as you think through that, in terms of manufacturing optimization, that's -- we've really struggled with that. So I do think as we get further through this and some of the supply issues abate, then I think we do have some opportunities there on for manufacturing, think around manufacturing recoveries to significantly improve from where we are. So I do think that's an opportunity for us. It's not immediate, but if you look through the medium term, there is definitely opportunity for us to optimize there.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden.\nSteven Wheen: You can hear me here, yes?\nMichael Farrell: Yes. Got you loud and clear, Steve.\nSteven Wheen: Yes. Great. Also, just on the gross margin for Brett. We're seeing in freight costs spot prices for shipping and for airfreight coming down by about 30% at the moment from its peak in March. I just wonder when we might start to see that appearing in the gross margin and if there's any changes with regards to semiconductor chip pricing that is worth calling out in more recently.\nBrett Sandercock: Yes. Steve, it's Brett. The -- Yes, I mean you're sort of seeing some of that or you're seeing some of these freight costs definitely moderate -- some cost reductions, but certainly not manifesting our numbers at the moment. I think we'll get some of that benefit, I would say, in our second half, where we'll probably see some of that coming through. But at this stage, I'd say, look, it's not even in our margin at the moment. But we do have some potential on freight in the second half, both on rates, and I think also we'll skew a little more -- start putting a little more on sea freight as we get through the back of the year as well, and that will certainly help us on our overall freight costs. So again, just kind of that environment where you're seeing some moderation or stabilization. And then I'm seeing as we get through fiscal year '23, some opportunities could be at manufacturing, be on the freight side as well. But we're not seeing that just yet in our numbers.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from David Low from JPMorgan.\nDavid Low: Maybe just continuing on the cost around gross margins. Can I get, perhaps you, Brett, to talk about the impact of inflation, what you're seeing on costs, and what you expect or what we should be looking out for in terms of margins and the impact there for?\nBrett Sandercock: Yes. Thanks, Dave. I mean we've seen component inflation, component cost increases. We've certainly seen that in electronic components. We've talked -- we've clearly talked about the freight and the increases that we have seen there. So that's all been built in, if you like, to our cost base at the moment. Going forward, I think we'll still see some of those increases, but I think that's manageable. And then what we've done, as you know, is we've done a little bit on our pricing to customers as well to help offset some of that. So we put through the device surcharge, for example. And we're also planning some modest price increases from July 1 as well. So some of this is going to offset some of that. And -- but I would say, yes, we saw that -- is it accelerating? No, but we're still seeing some cost and component increases coming through. Probably -- I would expect to see that probably for the next little while. But it's not -- we're not seeing any acceleration in that, which I think is good. So I think that there's some offsets there on the gross margin, headwinds on components. I guess some tailwind on ASPs will be benefit for margin going forward.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Gretel Janu from Credit Suisse.\nGretel Janu: So just moving back to revenue. How much revenue did the card to cloud contribute in the fourth quarter? And then I guess going forward, do you expect it to be meaningful in FY '23?\nMichael Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Gretel, and it's a really good one. For competitive reasons, I don't want to go into too much detail around it, other than to say that, that pivot of the team during the quarter was incredible. To redesign, reengineer and requalify, validate and verify a device with a new model of card to cloud and get it to market and get it in customers' hands in June was fantastic. So all credit to the team. It was material to our growth in the quarter, and it will be material to our growth up to and when we get those comms chip supply back to the levels that we need it to meet the incredible demand of the marketplace.  So it was material. It was strong, not going to quantify it down to the nth level of detail here. But it provided great additional growth for us in that last quarter and will for the coming quarters. I look forward to the point where I can say we are no longer selling AirSense 10 card to cloud because that means that we've got AirSense 11 connectivity and AirSense 10 connectivity back up to where we need it with that component no longer being a bottleneck for us. But that may be 3, 6, 9, 12 months out there with this incredible demand we're seeing in the market.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey Capital.\nSaul Hadassin: Mick, just following up on that card to cloud commentary. Can you just confirm or give us some color as to what happens to those machines once the chip alleviation is completed and you start to get better access to comms chips? Is the intention to bring those devices back and put those chips in? Or if you buy -- if you get issued a card to cloud device, do you effectively keep that device for the next sort of 5 years and then upgrade at some point in the future?\nMichael Farrell: Yes. So it's a really good question. I think it will probably be the latter part of your question -- or the answer to your question that you gave, which is it will probably be -- when somebody receives a device, it becomes a very personal, very intimate part. It sits on their bedside table. It gives them the gift of breath, the gift of sleep, and it changes their life. And the fact that they may have to take an SD card to the doctor, to their HME provider or have it mailed back and forth won't stop them from having that personal and intimate relationship. So there will be some very savvy patients who will see that and want to upgrade in less than that 3-year -- depending on insurance, 3- to 5-year time horizon. But I think the vast majority of those will remain there permanently. And our job will be to provide the great services around AirView and the engagement that we provide through some of our VoIP. And we do e-mail, text and interactions with patients that go well above just the cloud connectivity from the device itself that we've had in place on our Air Solutions ecosystem for a long time. So I'm very confident we're going to get very high adherence from the AirSense 10 card to cloud people with the ecosystem we have. It will be better with Air 11. So as soon as those components are back there, we'll do that. But I think there'll be a small group of people that will look to upgrade their device before insurance provides it in certain socioeconomic groups in certain countries. Just to be clear, we're really focusing card to cloud right now in the U.S., and that's where we've got a really good ecosystem of home care providers who know how to use card readers and get the data to the cloud and get it into AirView and get it to doctors and engage their patients to drive ReSupply through other means, Brightree, Snap and whole Air Solutions ecosystem. Great questions, Saul. But I think it will be mostly the latter, answer to your own question there.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST Marquee.\nDan Hurren: Mick, you've been quite specific in the past about these streams of engineering efforts to overcome supply chain shortages, and I guess, including the AirSense 11 range with parts alternate suppliers. So the card to cloud device clearly had a big impact. But do you have any update on the timing of these other initiatives? And will that be a calendar year '22 feature?\nMichael Farrell: Yes. Dan, it's a really good question. And we have our Chief Operating Officer on the line here who's closer to the other 4 work streams. The fifth one is that reengineering for C2C and beyond. Rob, any color for Dan on all that work we're doing in the supply chain and the reengineering we're doing to -- the streams of engineering work we're doing to increase supply over the fiscal year?\nRobert Douglas: Yes, Dan. I mean one of the key areas, obviously, is in the columns is around getting access to some of the 5G protocols that are being rolled out. And we're seeing them get rolled out pretty nicely in some markets. And some of our validation, some of those streams are getting access to those types of chips, including we're getting access to earlier-gen protocols as well. And we'll be deploying both of those. I don't think we can give you granularity over it. And it's not without risk in some of the timing. But what we will be doing is as soon as we can deploy and validate and have access to those chip volumes, we'll switch to that as quickly as possible. So it won't actually be a single overnight switch of now, all of a sudden, everything has gone to some new protocol or something; they'll be targeted to markets in specific volumes, and we'll keep doing work on that. As I said earlier, the outlook in terms of the overall demand for these chips from other parts of industries, obviously, cars and phones, may be looking a little better for us. And certainly, people are less likely to allocate away from us. So we're expecting to be able to plan a little more certainty, but we won't be able to sort of publicly give out the exact dates and things like that on those deployments.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from David Bailey from Macquarie.\nDavid Bailey: My question is just around consumables and masks and accessories. Are we expecting increased device output over fiscal '23? Just interested in your thoughts on the impact of that on masks and accessories volumes and what that might mean to masks and accessories revenues. And then also, do you think the attachment rates on market share, that those incremental revenues would be higher than you may have seen in the past?\nMichael Farrell: Yes. Thanks, David. It's a really good question. And I mean, as you saw in the quarter, 11% CC global and 13% CC in the U.S. in Q4, right, where we're only just starting to ramp up AirSense 10 card to cloud to meet that -- some of that incremental demand gap.  Yes, as we talked about every quarter during fiscal '23, we plan to see incremental growth in our volume delivery across the portfolio of AirSense 10 comms, AirSense 11 card to cloud and AirSense 11 comms. And as Rob just described, all those streams that are going to mean we're going to have increased volume every quarter sequentially throughout fiscal '23. And to your question specifically, that does mean that masks and consumables attached to those new patients will add on.  As you know, a very large double-digit percentage of any quarter's revenue on masks and accessories is ReSupply and recurring revenue of the installed base of patients. And so that installed base has been incredibly strong. The engagement of people post COVID in respiratory health, respiratory hygiene and making sure that a clean mask, clean humidifier, clean tubing, it's just been full front with everyone wearing masks for COVID and understanding communicable respiratory diseases like COVID makes them think about respiratory health and hygiene. So that's a permanent change we've seen over the last 12, 24 months in sort of secular demand on the installed base. And then you add to that, that sort of lower double-digit number of the new patients coming in, which is picking up as supply goes.  So I know you guys have all got models on this, David. You've got a good model. You'll start to see that mask and consumable rate pick up. It won't be like a step change jumping up, but there will be a sort of second derivative change, if you like, a little bit of increase in the rate of increase for a while on masks and accessories throughout fiscal year as we get the supply of devices closer and closer to the demand that is out there for these next 12 months, way ahead of where we can get to. But it means every device we make, we sell.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Mike Matson from Needham Company.\nMichael Matson: I was curious if the card to cloud units are helping your gross margin at all by taking out those -- the other chipsets. I mean is that resulting in some savings that's having material impact on your margins? Or is it not really the case?\nMichael Farrell: Brett, you want to answer Mike's question?\nBrett Sandercock: Sure, Mick. Yes, Mike. Yes, so the card to cloud, I mean, obviously, doesn't have the comms module in it, so there is some savings there. So it is positive for our margin, but it would really might just be around the edges. It wouldn't -- like it wouldn't be material.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer.\nSuraj Kalia: Mick, I'll throw in a two part question, if I could, Mick. For the card to cloud, how much of this shift is tactical and how much of it is strategic? Because the market growth -- you've always referenced 5% to 8% growth for the market. Maybe if you can just parse out how the shift long term would help ResMed's overall device growth.  And if I could quickly, Brett, if I take SG&A in FY '22, right, 8% to 9% year-over-year, and that approximate to about 20% to 22% of revs, my math is around $3.6 billion to $4 billion for FY '23. Is that the right way to think about it? Sorry, gentlemen, for squeezing in the second question.\nMichael Farrell: Yes. Very cheeky, Suraj, but we'll go at it. I'll go briefly at the first one, then hand to Brett for the second part of your 2-part one question. So the card to cloud, look, it is tactical. It's based on the fact that -- for a very important thing. We have people suffocating out there. They get all the way through the health care system, screen, diagnosed and then get a prescription, and they're waiting for a device. And we said we're not going to have our strategy, which is 100% connectivity in every device through comms chips, get in the way of the patient needs. So it's a tactical pivot based upon the comms chips being in a rate-limiting bottleneck of our supply that we're going to do the AirSense 10 C2C. As soon as that supply moves, we go straight back to 100% connectivity AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 devices. So it's tactical, temporal, and we're going to go back to it.  We're going to do the best we can for those patients, and they're going to get incredible adherence, just won't have all the tech of the daily feedback that you get on those devices with Air 11 and the double myAir uptake that you get with AirSense 11. And that's why I want everyone to get an AirSense 11 as soon as we get the components. And our supply chain team knows that, our customers know that, and we're ready to ramp up over the fiscal year. So a tactical shift. Brett, I'll just quickly say on that -- the second part of the question, I think our competitor put out some numbers that they think the market is today and in 2025. And I think they underestimated the actual market today and the market in 2025 by 25%, 30%, even 35%. I think they were talking about $2.1 billion device market in 2025. For me, it's north of $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion, $2.7 billion, even more than that in 2025, if we get our demand gen and drive it. And we're going to get the lion's share of that. But Brett, any thoughts?\nBrett Sandercock: Sure. Yes. Suraj, I mean given some broad guidance, I guess, on the SG&A as a percentage of revenue, I wouldn't get drawn into kind of strict revenue guidance. I'd just reiterate what we said before. We're expecting an increase in production volumes, and that should definitely support sequential revenue growth through FY '23.\nOperator: Our final question today is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America.\nLyanne Harrison: I was hoping if you could help us understand the softer device sales in rest of the world a little bit better. Obviously, understanding that you're having that cloud -- card to cloud push in the United States. But can you give us a sense of what the market's like in rest of the world, and what you're seeing from competitors other than Philips in that market?\nMichael Farrell: Yes. Thanks, Lyanne. It's a good question, and it's pretty simple, the answer, in that in Q4 of our fiscal '21, we had $20 million of COVID-related ventilator sales in India. And if we can all remember 12 months ago, there was a huge surge of the COVID variant in India, and we sold $20 million of ventilators to Delhi, Bangalore and across the country to save lives. And it was incredible, the way we pivoted and got those $20 million worth of sales out. Justin Leon and his team did a great job of getting to India. So if you subtract that $20 million of COVID sales out there, you actually see a positive growth -- a good positive growth in devices in Europe, Asia and rest of world. And what you're seeing, to the broader part of your question, is actually in countries where they don't have these, I would say, now illogical COVID lockdowns that are happening in a couple of geographies, China and a couple of other countries are sticking with these lockdowns, we're seeing well over 100% rates of patient flow.  And so incredible demand for our products, both on the ventilation side and on the device side, back to where we were, which is mid-single-digit device growth in the device side and high single-digit growth on the masks and accessories. And we're getting even higher than that, as you saw in the numbers, because we're driving share, we're driving demand and we're getting patients out there. So that's what it all is. But yes -- no, that Europe, Asia, Rest of the world was really just associated with those ventilator sales.\nOperator: We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further closing comments.\nMichael Farrell: Thanks, Kevin, and thanks again to all our shareholders for joining us on the call today. I'd like to once again take the opportunity to thank all 8,000 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders. And thank you for your hard work, your dedication, helping over 141 million people sleep better, breathe better and live better lives outside the country in over 140 countries worldwide. Thanks for what you do today and every day. I look forward to talking with all of our stakeholders here on our earnings call in about 90 days, plus or minus. And with that, I'll hand over to Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Mick, and thanks, everybody. We do appreciate your time and your interest. And if you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out directly to Investor Relations. This does conclude our fourth quarter fiscal year 2022 conference call. Kevin, I'll turn it back to you to close things out.\nOperator: Certainly. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Brett Sandercock",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. We had solid financial performance in Q4 despite the headwinds we faced due to significant ongoing supply chain constraints in a challenging freight environment. Group revenue for the June quarter was $915 million, an increase of 4%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 8%. Revenue growth reflects increased demand for our sleep products across our portfolio and increased device demand generated by our competitor's ongoing product recall. We did not derive incremental revenue from COVID-19-related demand during the June quarter compared to $20 million in the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we expect negligible revenue from COVID-19-related demand. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related demand in the prior year, revenue increased by 10% on a constant currency basis. In relation to the impact of our competitor's recall, we estimate that we generated incremental device revenue in the range of $60 million to $70 million in the June quarter. Note, this is consistent with the estimated $60 million to $70 million incremental device revenue in the prior year quarter. For fiscal year '22, this brings the total estimated incremental revenue in the range of $230 million to $250 million associated with our competitor's recall. While we continue to experience ongoing challenges in securing sufficient production components to meet market demand, we are now seeing a stable to improving supply chain environment. This has given us more confidence around our expectation of increasing device production in fiscal year '23 relative to fiscal year '22. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries increased by 12%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 1% in constant currency terms. By product segment globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 6%, while masks and other sales increased by 11%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 11% as we benefited from incremental revenue due to our competitor's recall. Masks and other sales increased by 13%, reflecting solid resupply revenue and achieved despite the challenging device supply environment, which continues to limit new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales decreased by 2% in constant currency terms or excluding the impact of COVID-19-related sales in the prior year increased by 7% in the current -- in constant currency terms. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 7% in constant currency terms or excluding COVID-19-related sales in the prior year increased by 9% in constant currency terms. Software-as-a-Service revenue increased by 8% in the June quarter. We saw a strong performance from our HME segment as customers continue to utilize our SaaS solutions to streamline and more efficiently run their businesses. And we are seeing stability in the skilled nursing care segment despite the continuing challenges of COVID-19. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release. Gross margin increased by 50 basis points to 57.8% in the June quarter. The increase is predominantly attributable to improvement in average selling prices and a positive product mix, partially offset by higher freight component and manufacturing costs, negative geographic mix and unfavorable foreign currency movements. Moving on to operating expenses. We are seeing a more normalized expenditure profile as COVID-19 impacts subside compared to the low comparable growth rate we experienced in Q4 last year. SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter increased by 6%, or in constant currency terms, increased by 11%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related costs and T&E expenses. SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue at 21.1% remained broadly consistent with the 20.7% we recorded in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% during fiscal year '23. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 7%, or in constant currency terms increased by 11%. The R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7% compared to 6.8% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% in fiscal year '23. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 4%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 17.6% compared to the prior year quarter rate of 21.5%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year '23 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the quarter increased by 10%, and our diluted earnings per share for the quarter also increased by 10%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $79 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings, offset by higher levels of working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $29 million; depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $37 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends to shareholders totaling $61 million. We recorded equity losses of $2.5 million in our income statement in the June quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $3 million per quarter in fiscal year '23 associated with the joint venture operation. We ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $274 million. At June 30, we had $780 million in gross debt and $500 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. At June 30, we had approximately $1.4 billion available for drawdown under our revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share, representing an increase of 5% over the previous quarterly dividend and reflecting the Board's confidence in our operating performance. Our solid cash flow and low leverage provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. We recently announced the MEDIFOX DAN acquisition and expect to close this transaction before the end of the calendar year pending regulatory clearances. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D and also expect to continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions, such as the recently announced acquisition of mementor, a German pioneer and health tech start-up that develops and distributes digital medical products in the field of sleep medicine and related areas. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. Yes. Matthew, I mean it is because we're just trying to maximize the devices out the door with the components that we have. So as you think through that, in terms of manufacturing optimization, that's -- we've really struggled with that. So I do think as we get further through this and some of the supply issues abate, then I think we do have some opportunities there on for manufacturing, think around manufacturing recoveries to significantly improve from where we are. So I do think that's an opportunity for us. It's not immediate, but if you look through the medium term, there is definitely opportunity for us to optimize there. Yes. Steve, it's Brett. The -- Yes, I mean you're sort of seeing some of that or you're seeing some of these freight costs definitely moderate -- some cost reductions, but certainly not manifesting our numbers at the moment. I think we'll get some of that benefit, I would say, in our second half, where we'll probably see some of that coming through. But at this stage, I'd say, look, it's not even in our margin at the moment. But we do have some potential on freight in the second half, both on rates, and I think also we'll skew a little more -- start putting a little more on sea freight as we get through the back of the year as well, and that will certainly help us on our overall freight costs. So again, just kind of that environment where you're seeing some moderation or stabilization. And then I'm seeing as we get through fiscal year '23, some opportunities could be at manufacturing, be on the freight side as well. But we're not seeing that just yet in our numbers. Yes. Thanks, Dave. I mean we've seen component inflation, component cost increases. We've certainly seen that in electronic components. We've talked -- we've clearly talked about the freight and the increases that we have seen there. So that's all been built in, if you like, to our cost base at the moment. Going forward, I think we'll still see some of those increases, but I think that's manageable. And then what we've done, as you know, is we've done a little bit on our pricing to customers as well to help offset some of that. So we put through the device surcharge, for example. And we're also planning some modest price increases from July 1 as well. So some of this is going to offset some of that. And -- but I would say, yes, we saw that -- is it accelerating? No, but we're still seeing some cost and component increases coming through. Probably -- I would expect to see that probably for the next little while. But it's not -- we're not seeing any acceleration in that, which I think is good. So I think that there's some offsets there on the gross margin, headwinds on components. I guess some tailwind on ASPs will be benefit for margin going forward. Sure, Mick. Yes, Mike. Yes, so the card to cloud, I mean, obviously, doesn't have the comms module in it, so there is some savings there. So it is positive for our margin, but it would really might just be around the edges. It wouldn't -- like it wouldn't be material. Sure. Yes. Suraj, I mean given some broad guidance, I guess, on the SG&A as a percentage of revenue, I wouldn't get drawn into kind of strict revenue guidance. I'd just reiterate what we said before. We're expecting an increase in production volumes, and that should definitely support sequential revenue growth through FY '23."

            "name": "Michael Farrell",
            "content": "Thanks, Amy, and thank you all for joining us today as we review the results for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2022 ended June 30. On today's call, I will provide a brief high-level overview of our financial results. I'll then review progress towards our ResMed 2025 strategic goals, and then discuss our actions to navigate through ongoing industry and supply chain challenges. Brett will then join the call to review our financial results in more detail. Okay. Let's jump right in. Our fourth quarter results reflect strong performance across our business with high single-digit revenue growth in both our sleep and respiratory care business segment as well as in our Software-as-a-Service business segment. Our ongoing growth reflects our global team's relentless focus to solve very complex supply chain problems and find alternate design and engineering solutions to address the incredible industry challenges that we have faced over the past year and beyond. The global supply chain environment remains very much in flux across multiple industries. We are starting to see indications that the macro environment is improving, particularly semiconductor availability. However, we're mindful that even as macro trends start to improve, we still need our supplier partners to prioritize med tech component needs over other nonlife-sustaining industries. Demand in the market remains very strong. We've been able to mitigate some of the electronic component bottlenecks with the launch of our redesigned card to cloud AirSense 10 devices introduced to the market midway through our fourth quarter. As you can imagine, clearing one bottleneck simply brings the next rate-limiting step to the forefront. Our team is actively working to clear as many bottlenecks as they can as quickly as possible. On the positive news side, the redesign, reengineering and launch of the card to cloud device greatly improved our ability to meet the incredible demand that we see in the marketplace. During the last month of the quarter, during June, we were able to allocate more products to our customers than in recent months and in recent quarters. We're not out of the woods yet, but the compass is pointing to true north and we are on top of it. Throughout this crisis of demand and supply, our established ResMed guiding principles remain the same: that is that we will give priority to the production and delivery of devices to meet the needs of the highest-acuity patients first. As we discussed last quarter, we are still facing a challenging freight environment. The key challenges of sea freight and airfreight are due to reduced availability and elevated prices. These forces are impacting our ability to efficiently get components into our factories and then to get the finished goods out of those factories and ship to warehouses and ultimately to customers. We continue to do everything that we can to secure additional supply to ultimately further increase production of our devices. As highlighted on previous calls, this includes a combination of 5 concurrent work streams in supply chain. One, we are locking in the flow of our existing parts from existing suppliers. Two, we are establishing flow of existing parts from new suppliers. Three, we're validating and verifying new parts from existing suppliers. And four, we're validating and verifying new parts from new suppliers. And then finally, five, we're reengineering designs to mitigate the major supply bottlenecks. In summary, we're making good progress with these 5 lines of work, and we've been able to offset some of the impacts of the component shortages to best support patients, providers, physicians and beyond. In addition to the successful launch of our redesigned card to cloud device last quarter, we also continue to support our customers with our market-leading mask portfolio. The supply -- despite the challenges we faced with reduced new patient setups due to a competitor recall, we continue to see strong uptake of our mask solutions as our customers want the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable, the easiest to fit and the most highly patient-rated masks in the market, and those come from ResMed. Peer-reviewed and published studies have clearly shown that patients that are on a ReSupply program are much more likely to remain on sleep apnea treatment adherent for the long term than those that aren't on a ReSupply program. Our home care provider customers not only want to put new patients on therapy, they want to keep those new patients and all of their existing patients on therapy over the long term. And the ultimate goal there is to improve patient outcomes to lower total health care system costs as well as to drive their own recurring revenue streams. We recognize that this demand outstripping supply situation remains a very difficult temporary state for all customers, including physicians, home medical equipment providers, payers, health care systems as well as the most important customer of all, the patient. We continue to work across the industry to be the best partner and the best solutions provider for all customers. We expect demand to be greater than supply for at least 12 more months, driven by the recall of one of our competitors primarily. The net result is that every device that we here at ResMed make during these next 12 months, we will sell as it leaves the production line to a warehouse and is shipped to a customer. We are looking at every angle to maximize supply and address this incredible demand these next 12 months. As a company, we are learning every day. And as an industry, we will get through this challenge stronger than ever. Our goal is to ensure that every person gets the care that they need, where they need it, when they need it, and we won't stop until we achieve that goal. Let's now briefly review the COVID-related market impacts on our industry. Most of the 140 countries that we operate in are now above 100% of pre-COVID levels of patient flow. It is noted that in some regions and some countries, we see ongoing surges of new COVID variants with some select governments continuing to impose COVID restrictions. In these areas, patient flow remains below pre-COVID levels. But across the board, we are seeing ongoing adoption of digital health solutions for screening, for diagnosis and for remote patient setup and monitoring as well as well-established COVID cleaning protocols at sleep labs and physician offices. These trends continue to minimize the impact of new variants and diminish the absolute impact of COVID on our industry over time. Let's now step back a little and review ResMed's top 3 strategic priorities: number one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses; number two, to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and number three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care that is delivered outside the hospital and especially in the home. The launch of our next-generation device platform called the AirSense 11 continues to go very well. It remains somewhat difficult to differentiate the success of the launch from previous generations with the incredibly high demand we're seeing around the world. Every Air 11 we make is sold immediately as it leaves the manufacturing floor. However, when we drill into patient feedback data, we see that patients are very excited about the platform, including the Air 11 device itself and the myAir software solutions surrounding it. During the fourth quarter, we introduced the AirSense 11 into several new countries outside the United States where we first launched the platform, including France, Switzerland and across the Nordic countries of Northern Europe. We look forward to further expansion into additional countries as we progress through our fiscal year 2023. One area that we are closely watching is patient adoption of digital health solutions. And to that point, adoption rates of the myAir app by new patients set up on therapy with the AirSense 11 continue to be more than double that of the AirSense 10. This is because the AirSense 11 platform is designed to enable and encourage patients to engage directly with their own health care. The bottom line is that people want personal care. They want their own data on their own app on their own phone. And they love the coaching and personal engagement of our ecosystem. They are voting with their digital presence, and repeat usage of the myAir app is stronger than ever. More patients on myAir means more patients are fully engaging with ResMed's software technology. This has led us to now passing over 12 billion nights of sleep apnea and respiratory care medical data in the cloud. Our software solutions, including myAir and AirView, are delivering a better patient experience, better efficiencies for home care providers and physicians, and most importantly, greater long-term adherence to therapy for the patient. Another key aspect of our long-term growth strategy is driving awareness and increasing the flow of patients through the top of the sleep apnea diagnosis funnel. COVID-19 has advanced awareness, adoption and acceptance of digital health. For our industry, this is specifically seen in the increased usage of home-based sleep apnea tests. Although new patient demand gen is clearly not a top priority in the immediate term given the current supply-demand imbalance, we are maintaining our focus in this area and our long-term investments so that we are ready when conditions improve and we can pivot and fire up our portfolio of demand-gen models and thereby ensure sustainable long-term pipelines of new patients for our industry. With over 1 billion people suffocating every night with sleep apnea worldwide, we see this work as an opportunity, but also an obligation as the market leader in the field. We are innovating with health care system partners and all of our customers to create an even more efficient and effective approach to sleep apnea patient identification, screening, diagnosis, treatment and management. We will continue to invest in technology that enables an end-to-end, seamless, digital experience for patients and their caregivers. As we consider opportunities to address the wider sleep market, we are investing in opportunities to address another major sleep disorder epidemic, that of insomnia. Insomnia has been shown in clinical research to occur in combination with sleep apnea, and that's a deadly combination. To this medical need and this medical opportunity, just last week, we announced the acquisition of a company called mementor. This is a German and Swiss digital health start-up that develops and sells digital medical products in the field of sleep medicine and beyond. mementor offers the first and so far the only permanently listed digital health application in the field of sleep medicine that is reimbursed by the statutory insurances in Germany. The acronym for these German digital health apps is DIGA, D-I-G-A. This acquisition furthers our efforts to diversify and accelerate growth of our ResMed business in Germany and the potential opportunity with DIGA to expand this offering into other markets around Europe and around the world. There's an unmet need in diagnosing and treating people with sleep problems, such as sleep apnea and insomnia, the 2 biggest sleep problems on the planet and especially when there's an overlap of these chronic conditions. This acquisition of mementor broadens our focus in this vertical from a sleep apnea therapy company to a true sleep therapy company. More to come as we pursue growth in this exciting space in Germany and beyond. Growth trends in the global sleep apnea market are in a state of flux in the short term given the market supply-demand dynamics that we talked about and the recall from one of our competitors. Long term, we estimate the underlying growth trends in the global sleep apnea market to be very strong; in the mid-single-digit range for devices and the high single-digit range for masks. As always, our goal is to drive market demand and to meet or beat market growth through generation of new patients and sales of our market-leading therapy solutions and the introduction of new innovations and alternative treatment pathways that enable us to address even more patients with undiagnosed sleep apnea. Current industry dynamics indicate that we have a multiyear opportunity to drive even greater ongoing acceptance and adoption of our solutions to further solidify our market leadership position. I've challenged our global ResMed team to strive for even stronger growth in the coming months and quarters and the fiscal year and beyond. I'm telling them to go get the share, to go lock in that share with digital health with value that speaks for itself with lower costs, better outcomes for patients and increased efficiencies for the health care system. Turning to a discussion of our respiratory care business. I want to focus on our strategy to better serve the 380 million people worldwide with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, with many others with neuromuscular diseases and respiratory insufficiency and the 330 million patients that suffer from asthma worldwide. Our goal is to reach hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including noninvasive ventilation as well as life support ventilation; as well as newer therapeutic areas, such as our cloud-connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions from our Propeller team; and high-flow therapy offerings that we are conducting clinical trials on right now, including our product platform called Lumis HFT. Demand for our core noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for COPD and neuromuscular disease and beyond remains solid throughout the quarter. Ventilation solution demand was supported by the continued success, adoption and scaling of our AirView for ventilation software platform by customers as they experience the benefits of remote monitoring to better manage their ventilated patient populations through remote access to clinical data as well as customizable physician notifications. Let me now review our Software-as-a-Service business for outside hospital care. Our SaaS business achieved another quarter of high single-digit growth year-on-year across our portfolio of verticals, including home medical equipment as well as facilities-based and home-based care settings. Our SaaS customers recognize the need for technology solutions to solve their challenges with efficiency and scale, and our software, services and solutions help them achieve both. The continued growth of home-based care is providing tailwinds for HME solutions as well as home health solutions. We continue to grow with our customers as they increase their utilization of our software and our data solutions to improve and optimize their business efficiencies and their patient care, including Brightree and Snap ReSupply offerings. As businesses continue to open up, we've been able to visit customers more and more in person as well as attend trade shows, host conferences, where the interest in our Brightree, MatrixCare, HEALTHCAREfirst and Citus offerings remain very strong. Earlier this week, I personally attended the Inspire 2022 Conference in Austin, Texas. This is MatrixCare's annual customer summit, and it was in person for the first time since 2019. I had the pleasure and the opportunity of presenting and engaging in person with over 600 customers and partners from home health, skilled nursing, senior living, private-duty home care, life plan community verticals and beyond. The passion for caring for each patient that was involved in every conversation I had this week, the openness, the sharing and the ability for us as a community to move patients to lower-cost, lower-acuity and higher-quality outcome cares, those settings was palpable at Inspire 2022. I came away from that conference even more energized and excited about the opportunities that we have to support customers across the care settings with our digital health and our software solutions. The ultimate goal is that customers of our Brightree- and MatrixCare-branded solutions can provide better care for the people that they serve. Given the passion of our customers and the service levels that we're providing and the product pipeline that was discussed at this conference, I expect we'll continue to not only take share from our competitors across the portfolio, but even drive growth with more tech solutions being adopted by customers across care settings. The COVID-19 pandemic has been and remains challenging for facility-based verticals in our SaaS business, particularly skilled nursing and to a lesser extent hospice, where patient census rates below -- remain below pre-pandemic levels. As COVID restrictions continue to ease and our customers improve their line of sight to better conditions and better cleaning, we are seeing pent-up demand for technology investments in these facility-based areas. This provides opportunities for us to sell more services and more tech solutions to existing customers as well as to increase our new customer pipeline. One MatrixCare customer at Inspire 2022 grabbed me at the conference, and he described what he called a rocket ship acceleration of demand at skilled nursing tech solutions for those skilled nursing customers. This is a really welcome sign for sustainable growth across our SaaS portfolio. So as we look at our portfolio of solutions across care settings, we expect our SaaS group revenue to maintain high single-digit growth throughout fiscal year 2023. As always, our goal is to meet or beat market growth rates, and we will continue to invest and innovate to grow the market and to take share. Our growth in SaaS will come through organic and inorganic growth. We've long talked about our desire to expand our SaaS offerings internationally if and when we found the right opportunity for ResMed. In early June, we announced the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, the leading provider of end-to-end software solutions for home health and for nursing home providers in Germany. We've been closely watching the evolution of the German digital health system and the associated outside hospital health care system for many years. And we've actually been closely watching MEDIFOX DAN for a number of years. This is our first investment in a pure-play SaaS business in Europe, and it's a great opportunity to expand our reach in this business globally. We're starting in Germany as it is not only a market where we're vertically integrated in our core business of sleep and respiratory care, it's also one of our largest markets globally and a country where the government is investing in digital health reimbursement. We're excited about the opportunity to accelerate innovation and recurring revenue business models through this acquisition in Germany. As we discussed on the acquisition call that we had in June, MEDIFOX DAN will be immediately accretive to ResMed at close. Progress towards closing this acquisition is moving ahead as expected. We remain on track to close by the end of December 2022 in our fiscal 2023 second quarter. We are the leading strategic provider of SaaS solutions for outside hospital care globally, and we provide mission-critical software across a broad set of very attractive markets. We are well positioned, and we have created a differentiated value for our customers and for ResMed with our SaaS business investments. I'm excited about the future of our SaaS business. And Bobby Ghoshal and the excitement that he had on Inspire 2022 with the crowd for both MatrixCare and Brightree was an inspiration for me as the CEO of the parent company but also for the whole team there. It's an important part of ResMed's future growth, and I see a lot of opportunities to invest in lower-cost, lower-acuity settings of care. We believe that this is the future of health care delivery, and that's where ResMed competes and it's where ResMed wins. To bring it all together, our strategic focus remains on personal care that is patient-centric, physician-centric and provider-centric. This triple-pronged approach, combined with our unique ResMed culture, means that we are very well positioned to continue winning in the vastly underserved medical markets of sleep apnea, COPD, neuromuscular disease, asthma, insomnia and beyond.  We are transforming outside hospital care at scale. We're leading the market in digital health technology with over 12 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and nearly 18 million cloud-connectable medical devices on people's bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are unlocking value by using de-identified data to help patients, providers, physicians, payers and entire health care systems. We have invested in the cybersecurity, the privacy, the cloud ops, the data analytics, the AI/ML capabilities to do this at scale, unmatched by any competitor. And we are increasing our investments and our lead each and every day. Our 2 key global customer-facing software products, AirView and myAir, are 100% in the cloud. Our devices are both cloud-connected and cloud-enabled, making ResMed itself a market-leading cloud-connected and cloud-enabled digital health company. Our mission and goal to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025 drives and motivates ResMedians every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal this last fiscal year 2022. We changed nearly 141 million lives these last 12 months with our devices, our mask systems, our software solutions, helping people sleep better, breathe better and live higher-quality lives with outside hospital care. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude and thanks to more than 8,000 ResMedians helping their customers in 140 countries. Your perseverance, hard work and dedication has been impeccable. Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we'll open up for Q&A. Brett, over to you. Yes. Thanks for the question, Craig. And what we've seen over the last 2, 3, 4 quarters was a really deteriorating supply situation, where we were getting decommits, a word I'd never heard of in supply chain, including my time at BHP and other companies that just -- you never heard of that sort of supply even in commodity industries, and to get it in specialty industries was so unusual. What we're seeing is that sort of noise is starting to go away. And what I'd say is it's a stable to improving component supply environment and that's what we're seeing. But I don't know, Rob, if you want to provide any further color on the supply chain and how we're -- for the details on how we're seeing a supply that's stable to improving on components. Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris, and it's a really good one. But as you know, we've annualized the impact of that competitor recall. And for us now, as I said in my prepared remarks, for the next 12 months, I do not believe there'll be really in the new patient market given the consent decree work they've got to do, the remediation work they've got to do in responding to that and the observations. And so what that means for us is basically demand that is incredible for these next 12 months, and that every device we make will be solved as it comes through the manufacturing line. And so the rate-limiting step on that, as Rob said, will be a bunch of bottlenecks that we'll work our way through. And it's like a game of Whac-A-Mole. We just keep -- find a problem, solve it; find the next problem, solve it. And ResMed is exceptional at that continuous improvement process. Our supply chain teams, our manufacturing teams, our distribution teams have been heroic in the ventilator crisis in 2020 and then the supply chain crisis of '21-'22. And so that gives us confidence to say sequentially every quarter through fiscal '23, we're going to see those volumes improve. And we've got line of sight to that, and we've got interactions with suppliers on that, and we think it's going to go up every quarter. I don't look at this as incremental or temporal taking of share now. This is permanent share taking. We're going to go in, we're going to get the share, we're going to lock it in with digital health solutions. And when somebody uses something that lowers their labor costs by 50%, that improves the adherence rate of the end customer, the patient, to 87%, 9 out of 10 patients getting adherent at day 9 and beyond, that's where we can lock it in. So that's sort of some extra color for you, Chris, but great question. Thanks, Sean. Two questions. Card to cloud AirSense 10 is really new. I mean we just really launched it midway through and really in the month of June in the quarter. So it's early days on that. But we've got a lot of experience with card to cloud. I mean think about the S8 and then the S9 with its little SD chip in the back of S9. The product -- when I was running the sleep business, we launched that back in '09 and '10. And we -- so we have a lot of experience with card to cloud. And it's primarily -- the card to cloud, primarily volume has been in the U.S. And that's where we had a very strong digital health system and engagement with our HME partners in a card to cloud environment. So we don't have sort of adherence exact numbers delta between AS 10 C2C versus AS 11.  I think it will be higher, the adherence on the AirSense 11 just because we're getting double the rate of myAir uptake, and that digital health engagement drives higher adherence. And I can tell you as soon as we get clearance on line of sight to those comms chips picking up supply, we'll move everybody to AirSense 11 as soon as we have it.  Probably, we won't go back and retrofit the groups that are there, just because people when they get therapy, they're happy. And the data will go to the cloud, they just won't go to the cloud every day. It will go when the SD card is uploaded on day 30, 60 or 90, and when they see the home care provider and the physician. And so they're not lost patients, they're not lost data. They're still part of the ecosystem, it's just not quite as efficient as it could be. So we're going to get back to AS 11 and really ramping that as fast as possible. But given the supply demand crisis, I was amazed and thrilled that our team was able to pivot in June, get there. And we're going to be able to do that through September and December quarters here as well and beyond. But thanks for your question, Sean. Yes. Thanks, Maggie. Great question, allows us to talk about masks. Despite that competitor not being there for new patient setups where we had a lot of adoption of ResMed masks on their platform as well as ours and then it's not in the market. We saw mask growth rates at 11% constant currency globally. We saw 13% constant currency growth in the quarter on masks in the U.S. And we saw a pretty strong 7% constant currency growth on masks in Europe, Middle East and other markets. And so I actually think that the team and all the work we've done with Brightree and Snap ReSupply in the U.S. and all the work our European and Middle East teams and our Asia teams have done around engaging patients digitally through either myAir or other marketing and adherence programs have performed really well. And despite the headwind of lower new patient setups, we're achieving at or above market growth rates. And to the second part of your question, yes, I do think we're taking share across categories. And I think we're creating new categories by some of our innovations in the different types of comfort and design of the masks, the minimalist masks, the fun comfort masks, the over-the-head masks and -- so creating new segments, taking share in those and being able to lock in that share. Because when a patient gets happy on their mask, like I am with my AirFit P10, they tend to stick with it for life. And it's a great thing for us to be able to do on that. So really excited about it, and I look forward to more mask innovation coming out and more share taking and locking it in over time. That's a great question, Matthew. I'm going to hand that to Brett. Any color on GM there for Matthew? Yes. Got you loud and clear, Steve. Yes. Thanks for the question, Gretel, and it's a really good one. For competitive reasons, I don't want to go into too much detail around it, other than to say that, that pivot of the team during the quarter was incredible. To redesign, reengineer and requalify, validate and verify a device with a new model of card to cloud and get it to market and get it in customers' hands in June was fantastic. So all credit to the team. It was material to our growth in the quarter, and it will be material to our growth up to and when we get those comms chip supply back to the levels that we need it to meet the incredible demand of the marketplace.  So it was material. It was strong, not going to quantify it down to the nth level of detail here. But it provided great additional growth for us in that last quarter and will for the coming quarters. I look forward to the point where I can say we are no longer selling AirSense 10 card to cloud because that means that we've got AirSense 11 connectivity and AirSense 10 connectivity back up to where we need it with that component no longer being a bottleneck for us. But that may be 3, 6, 9, 12 months out there with this incredible demand we're seeing in the market. Yes. So it's a really good question. I think it will probably be the latter part of your question -- or the answer to your question that you gave, which is it will probably be -- when somebody receives a device, it becomes a very personal, very intimate part. It sits on their bedside table. It gives them the gift of breath, the gift of sleep, and it changes their life. And the fact that they may have to take an SD card to the doctor, to their HME provider or have it mailed back and forth won't stop them from having that personal and intimate relationship. So there will be some very savvy patients who will see that and want to upgrade in less than that 3-year -- depending on insurance, 3- to 5-year time horizon. But I think the vast majority of those will remain there permanently. And our job will be to provide the great services around AirView and the engagement that we provide through some of our VoIP. And we do e-mail, text and interactions with patients that go well above just the cloud connectivity from the device itself that we've had in place on our Air Solutions ecosystem for a long time. So I'm very confident we're going to get very high adherence from the AirSense 10 card to cloud people with the ecosystem we have. It will be better with Air 11. So as soon as those components are back there, we'll do that. But I think there'll be a small group of people that will look to upgrade their device before insurance provides it in certain socioeconomic groups in certain countries. Just to be clear, we're really focusing card to cloud right now in the U.S., and that's where we've got a really good ecosystem of home care providers who know how to use card readers and get the data to the cloud and get it into AirView and get it to doctors and engage their patients to drive ReSupply through other means, Brightree, Snap and whole Air Solutions ecosystem. Great questions, Saul. But I think it will be mostly the latter, answer to your own question there. Yes. Dan, it's a really good question. And we have our Chief Operating Officer on the line here who's closer to the other 4 work streams. The fifth one is that reengineering for C2C and beyond. Rob, any color for Dan on all that work we're doing in the supply chain and the reengineering we're doing to -- the streams of engineering work we're doing to increase supply over the fiscal year? Yes. Thanks, David. It's a really good question. And I mean, as you saw in the quarter, 11% CC global and 13% CC in the U.S. in Q4, right, where we're only just starting to ramp up AirSense 10 card to cloud to meet that -- some of that incremental demand gap.  Yes, as we talked about every quarter during fiscal '23, we plan to see incremental growth in our volume delivery across the portfolio of AirSense 10 comms, AirSense 11 card to cloud and AirSense 11 comms. And as Rob just described, all those streams that are going to mean we're going to have increased volume every quarter sequentially throughout fiscal '23. And to your question specifically, that does mean that masks and consumables attached to those new patients will add on.  As you know, a very large double-digit percentage of any quarter's revenue on masks and accessories is ReSupply and recurring revenue of the installed base of patients. And so that installed base has been incredibly strong. The engagement of people post COVID in respiratory health, respiratory hygiene and making sure that a clean mask, clean humidifier, clean tubing, it's just been full front with everyone wearing masks for COVID and understanding communicable respiratory diseases like COVID makes them think about respiratory health and hygiene. So that's a permanent change we've seen over the last 12, 24 months in sort of secular demand on the installed base. And then you add to that, that sort of lower double-digit number of the new patients coming in, which is picking up as supply goes.  So I know you guys have all got models on this, David. You've got a good model. You'll start to see that mask and consumable rate pick up. It won't be like a step change jumping up, but there will be a sort of second derivative change, if you like, a little bit of increase in the rate of increase for a while on masks and accessories throughout fiscal year as we get the supply of devices closer and closer to the demand that is out there for these next 12 months, way ahead of where we can get to. But it means every device we make, we sell. Brett, you want to answer Mike's question? Yes. Very cheeky, Suraj, but we'll go at it. I'll go briefly at the first one, then hand to Brett for the second part of your 2-part one question. So the card to cloud, look, it is tactical. It's based on the fact that -- for a very important thing. We have people suffocating out there. They get all the way through the health care system, screen, diagnosed and then get a prescription, and they're waiting for a device. And we said we're not going to have our strategy, which is 100% connectivity in every device through comms chips, get in the way of the patient needs. So it's a tactical pivot based upon the comms chips being in a rate-limiting bottleneck of our supply that we're going to do the AirSense 10 C2C. As soon as that supply moves, we go straight back to 100% connectivity AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 devices. So it's tactical, temporal, and we're going to go back to it.  We're going to do the best we can for those patients, and they're going to get incredible adherence, just won't have all the tech of the daily feedback that you get on those devices with Air 11 and the double myAir uptake that you get with AirSense 11. And that's why I want everyone to get an AirSense 11 as soon as we get the components. And our supply chain team knows that, our customers know that, and we're ready to ramp up over the fiscal year. So a tactical shift. Brett, I'll just quickly say on that -- the second part of the question, I think our competitor put out some numbers that they think the market is today and in 2025. And I think they underestimated the actual market today and the market in 2025 by 25%, 30%, even 35%. I think they were talking about $2.1 billion device market in 2025. For me, it's north of $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion, $2.7 billion, even more than that in 2025, if we get our demand gen and drive it. And we're going to get the lion's share of that. But Brett, any thoughts? Yes. Thanks, Lyanne. It's a good question, and it's pretty simple, the answer, in that in Q4 of our fiscal '21, we had $20 million of COVID-related ventilator sales in India. And if we can all remember 12 months ago, there was a huge surge of the COVID variant in India, and we sold $20 million of ventilators to Delhi, Bangalore and across the country to save lives. And it was incredible, the way we pivoted and got those $20 million worth of sales out. Justin Leon and his team did a great job of getting to India. So if you subtract that $20 million of COVID sales out there, you actually see a positive growth -- a good positive growth in devices in Europe, Asia and rest of world. And what you're seeing, to the broader part of your question, is actually in countries where they don't have these, I would say, now illogical COVID lockdowns that are happening in a couple of geographies, China and a couple of other countries are sticking with these lockdowns, we're seeing well over 100% rates of patient flow.  And so incredible demand for our products, both on the ventilation side and on the device side, back to where we were, which is mid-single-digit device growth in the device side and high single-digit growth on the masks and accessories. And we're getting even higher than that, as you saw in the numbers, because we're driving share, we're driving demand and we're getting patients out there. So that's what it all is. But yes -- no, that Europe, Asia, Rest of the world was really just associated with those ventilator sales. Thanks, Kevin, and thanks again to all our shareholders for joining us on the call today. I'd like to once again take the opportunity to thank all 8,000 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders. And thank you for your hard work, your dedication, helping over 141 million people sleep better, breathe better and live better lives outside the country in over 140 countries worldwide. Thanks for what you do today and every day. I look forward to talking with all of our stakeholders here on our earnings call in about 90 days, plus or minus. And with that, I'll hand over to Amy."

            "name": "Robert Douglas",
            "content": "Sure. Yes, Mick. Craig, one of the sort of fundamental things of supply chain management is ongoing risk management and having sort of the ability to foresee problems and to react through all of that. And then you also manage your risk through inventories and that type of thing. We've over recent months put in place a lot of forward orders, working a lot on relationships with key suppliers. We suspect that sort of global demand on these suppliers is moderating a little bit. And then as Mick says, that means that they're sticking with their commitments at a higher level than what we have seen recently. There are always problems to overcome. And as Mick said earlier, there are other bottlenecks. Once we close one bottleneck, we have to go and work on the next. But overall, I'd say we're feeling better about the forward outlook that we have, and we've got a little more clarity. It's not perfect. There still will be challenges and undoubtedly unexpected things that we'll have to manage through, but the net of it all is that we should see our volumes continue to increase from here. Yes, Dan. I mean one of the key areas, obviously, is in the columns is around getting access to some of the 5G protocols that are being rolled out. And we're seeing them get rolled out pretty nicely in some markets. And some of our validation, some of those streams are getting access to those types of chips, including we're getting access to earlier-gen protocols as well. And we'll be deploying both of those. I don't think we can give you granularity over it. And it's not without risk in some of the timing. But what we will be doing is as soon as we can deploy and validate and have access to those chip volumes, we'll switch to that as quickly as possible. So it won't actually be a single overnight switch of now, all of a sudden, everything has gone to some new protocol or something; they'll be targeted to markets in specific volumes, and we'll keep doing work on that. As I said earlier, the outlook in terms of the overall demand for these chips from other parts of industries, obviously, cars and phones, may be looking a little better for us. And certainly, people are less likely to allocate away from us. So we're expecting to be able to plan a little more certainty, but we won't be able to sort of publicly give out the exact dates and things like that on those deployments."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you Kevin. Hi everyone and welcome to ResMed\u2019s third quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call. We appreciate you joining us. This call is being webcast live, and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today, along with a copy of our earnings press release and presentation, which are both available now. With me on the call today are ResMed\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. During the Q&A portion of our call, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; Jim Hollingshead, President-Sleep and Respiratory Care; and David Pendarvis, our Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures.

You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements that are made today. I'd like to now turn the conference call over to Mick.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Amy and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review results for the third quarter of our fiscal year 2022 ended March 31. Our third quarter results reflect strong performance across our business with double-digit revenue growth in our sleep and respiratory care business, and high single digit growth in our software as a service segment. Our growth is the direct result of our global team's ability to pivot and drive for results, even as we continue to manage through several external challenges that are impacting our business, including one, on-going supply chain disruptions; two, COVID restrictions in parts of the world, three, recovering post-COVID Peak patient flow, and four unprecedented demand from a competitor recall, which will keep them out of the market at least through the end of the calendar year. The global supply chain environment remains very challenging across multiple industries. I'm very proud of our team growing double-digits this quarter year-on-year with an astounding 30% growth this quarter for devices in U.S. Canada, and Latin America. Even with this incredible growth, the demand in the market was even greater. As with almost all customers in the global components industry, we remain on allocation from our suppliers, particularly for electronic components, with our number one bottleneck being semiconductor chips. This allocation impacts our ability to meet the incredible demand that we see in our marketplace. And we are forced intern to allocate ResMed products to our customers. We have established guiding principles for allocation, giving priority to the production and delivery of devices to meet the needs of the highest acuity patients first. Additionally, the on-going challenges of sea freights and air freight due to reduced availability and increased prices are impacting our ability to efficiently get components into and finished goods out of our factories worldwide. We are working closely with our global supply chain partners doing everything that we can to secure additional supply to further increase production of our devices. This work includes a combination of a number of workstreams. One, shoring up the flow of existing parts from existing suppliers, two establishing flow of existing parts from new suppliers, three validating new parts from existing suppliers, and four validating and verifying new parts from new suppliers as we review and redesign across key devices in our portfolio. In addition, we have fifth line of work. So it's five lines of work and that fifth line is reengineering designs to eliminate and or mitigate the top bottlenecks to achieve greater flow through our supply chain. The most significant example of a project in this fifth line of work is our newly released AirSense 10 Card-to-cloud device. This device eliminates the number one bottleneck of the 3G, 4G comms chip, while facilitating secure data upload to our cloud based software platform called AirView so that providers and physicians can access the data and better manage the patient. We've already begun to offer AirSense 10 Card-to-cloud devices in select markets to some customers, and we will be ramping up from there. With these five lines of work continuing in parallel, we have been able to offset some of the impact of continuing component shortages and de-commits to help us better support patients, providers and physicians. We recognize that this is a very difficult situation for all of our customers, including physicians who feel the pressure from their patients, home medical equipment providers who see this every day in their businesses, but also payers and entire healthcare systems and especially the most important customer, the patient themselves. We are partnering across the industry to be the solutions provider to these problems. We expect a significant backlog of patients diagnosed and coming through the system to be present for at least the next 12 to 18 months with incredible associated demand. We are working to address this demand with these portfolios of supply projects and beyond, and we will get through this time stronger than ever as an industry and as a company. Our number one priority will always be patients, doing our best to help those who suffer from sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and other key chronic respiratory insufficiency diseases, as well as those who benefit from our out of the hospital care software as a service solutions. Our goal is to ensure that every person gets the care that they need, where they need it, and when they need it. Let's now briefly discuss the other broad market conditions in our industry. We continue to see steady on-going recovery of patient flow and demand through the diagnostic channel across the countries that we operate in. In fact, many countries are above 100% of pre-COVID levels of patient flow. However on-going surges, variance, and government restrictions continue to impact a few countries which will remain below pre-COVID diagnostic levels. China is a case in point right now with severe shutdowns in Shanghai and beyond. But across our portfolio, our global portfolio, we're in 140 countries that we serve, I expect that these metrics will steadily improve to pre-COVID patient levels and beyond. As vaccines and boosters roll out globally, and people remain focused on their personal respiratory health and hygiene that's been a big learning through COVID. With the adoption of digital health solutions for screening, diagnosis, and remote patient setup, and remote patient monitoring, as well as established COVID cleaning protocols, sleep labs and other facilities, I expect the impact of new variants to diminish in absolute impact each and every time. Let me now update you on our top three strategic priorities. Number one, which is to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma businesses. Number two, to design, develop and deliver world leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally. And number three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care that is delivered outside the hospital where people live, and especially in the home. The U.S. launch of our next generation device platform called AirSense 11 continues to go very well. Although it is challenging to differentiate on-going positive customer sentiment and feedback from the incredibly high demand in the U.S. market and beyond. The AirSense 11 has provided much needed additional product supply as we face all time high demand for ResMed devices, and it couldn't have launched at a better time for that purpose to help us mitigate on-going component shortages. We will introduce the AirSense 11 into additional countries in the fourth quarter that we're in right now here at fiscal year 2022 and throughout fiscal 2023. In parallel, we will continue to sell our globally available market leading platform the AirSense 10, which is second in customer preference only to the AirSense 11 including the new Card-to-cloud AirSense 10 as we seek to maximize the total volume of CPAP APAP and bi-levels [ph] available for all of our customers. With our digital health technology ecosystem, we are engaging patients in their therapy in a digitally native environment like never before in the industry. We are also making it easier and more efficient for our home medical equipment and homecare provider customers to manage their patient populations using our full suite of software solutions, including myAir for patients. AirView for physicians and providers, and Brightree for HME providers. When customers use these digital health technology solutions, they have increased efficiencies, lower costs, and together with us we achieve improved outcomes for patients and their physicians. With the latest technology built into the AirSense 11 platform, we are driving higher adoption rates of the myAir app by patients higher than ever before. Right now, we are seeing more than double the myAir adoption rate as patients engage directly in their own health care. People want personal care. They want their own data on their own app on their own phone. And they liked the coaching and the personal engagement of our digital ecosystem. This means more patients are signing up onto myAir every day and fully engaging with ResMed\u2019s software technology, helping us to now pass over 11.5 billion nights of respiratory medical data in the cloud. Ultimately these software solutions, these big data deliver a better patient experience. They deliver better efficiencies for homecare providers, and most importantly, they deliver greater long term adherence to therapy by patients. Let me spend just a couple of minutes outlining some real world evidence showing that greater therapy adherence leads to lower hospitalizations, lower mortality, and better clinical outcomes through mitigation of chronic disease. We are demonstrating better patient outcomes and lowering costs for the healthcare system at a scale not seen before in the industry. These are critical components of the ResMed 2025 strategy. The latest example is a study recently published in the landmark American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine Journal, also known in the industry as the Blue Journal. This article demonstrates that patients with obstructive sleep apnea and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who were adherent to CPAP therapy versus non-adherence to CPAP therapy, and it showed significant year one and year two reduction of clinical use by over 30% and reduction of inpatient hospitalizations by nearly 50%. It showed a 20% reduction in year one and year two total healthcare resource cost, which included a 25% reduction in emergency room costs and a 52% reduction in inpatient hospitalizations. These are important metrics for the whole healthcare system. Another key aspect of our long term growth strategy is driving awareness and increasing the flow of patients through the top of the sleep apnea diagnostic funnel. COVID-19 has advanced awareness, adoption and acceptance of digital health and respiratory health, including telehealth tools, and specifically home-based sleep apnea tests. Although driving demand generation is not a priority in the immediate term, given the supply shortage and incredible demand we're facing, we are maintaining our long term focus and investments in this diagnostic channel so that we are ready when conditions improve to ensure sustainable, long term pipelines of new patients coming through the channel. With 1.6 billion people worldwide suffering from sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma. It's also our duty to do this. We are innovating with partners and our customers to create even more efficient and effective approaches to sleep apnea, patient identification, screening, diagnostics, treatment, and management. We will continue to invest in technology that enable what we call an end-to-end seamless digital experience for patients. One example we recently rolled out is the next generation of our remote mask selector tool that makes mask selection and sizing easier and more effective by creating personalized mask recommendations based on a patient's health, sleep attributes and their own facial measurements. Choosing the right mask is challenging to do remotely. But getting the right mask fit is crucial to patient comfort and long term adherence. The technology MaskSelector is a web based tool that solves this problem by prompting the patient to answer a few simple questions and follow a few easy steps with their camera enabled smartphone to capture a digital facial scan. Based on the answers and the digital facial measurements, MaskSelector then provides a recommended mask and sizing. Whether a patient is then being set up at home remotely, or preparing for a face-to-face interaction with a respiratory therapist and clinical staff at a provider's office MaskSelector helps the patient quickly get to the right mask for their unique needs. Turning to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million patients with COPD worldwide, and the 330 million patients that suffer from asthma worldwide. Our goal is to reach many hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including non-invasive ventilation, and life support ventilation, as well as newer therapeutic areas such as our cloud connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions from our Propeller technology, and the high flow therapy offerings, such as our product platform called Lumis HFT. Demand for our core, non-invasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for COPD and other respiratory insufficiency patients remain strong throughout the quarter, especially in markets outside the U.S. where providers shifted focus to supporting the most severe and highest acuity patients. This demand and the work of providers is aligned with the ResMed guiding principles of our allocation process, specifically to give the highest priority to manufacturing life support ventilation. As I speak, we are not component constrained on our life support ventilator called Astral. Let me now review our software as a service business for out of hospital care. During the quarter, our SaaS business achieved high single digit growth year-on-year across our portfolio of SaaS markets, including home medical equipment, as well as facilities based and home based care settings. Our SaaS customers recognize the need for technology solutions to solve their challenges with efficiency and scale, and our software services and solutions help them achieve both. The continued growth of home based care is providing tailwinds for our home medical equipment and our home health products. And we continue to grow with our customers as they increase their utilization of our software and data solutions to improve and optimize business efficiencies and patient care, including our landmark Brightree and SNAP ReSupply products. As businesses continue to open up, we've been able to visit customers in person, as well as to attend SaaS trade shows where interest in our Brightree, MatrixCare and Citus offerings to name a few remain very strong. We have a very solid pipeline in SaaS. The COVID-19 pandemic has been and remains challenging for some verticals in our SaaS business, particularly skilled nursing facilities, where headwinds have kept patients census rates below pre-pandemic levels. But as COVID restrictions continue to ease and our customers improve their line of sight to better conditions, we expect to see pent up demand for technology investments, which provide opportunities for us to sell more services and more solutions to existing customers, as well as to increase our new customer pipeline. As we look at our portfolio of solutions across care settings, we expect our SaaS group revenue growth to maintain high single digit growth as we exit this fiscal year, and well into the next fiscal year and beyond. As always, our goal is to meet or beat that market growth rate as we continue to innovate, and we expect to grow the market and take market share. We are the leading, strategic provider of SaaS solutions for outside hospital care. And we provide mission critical software across a broad range of very attractive vertical markets. We are well positioned and we have created differentiated value for customers and for ResMed with our SaaS businesses. I'm excited about the future of our SaaS business. It's an important part of ResMeds future growth and I see a lot of opportunities to innovate in lower cost, lower acuity settings of care. It's the future of healthcare delivery with strong organic and inorganic growth in ahead for ResMed. Our focus is on personal care that is patient centric, physician centric and provider centric. This approach combined with our unique ResMed culture means that we are positioned to continue winning in the vastly underserved medical markets of sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and beyond. We are transforming out of hospital health care at scale, leading the market in digital health technology. As I said earlier, we have over 11.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud. And we have over 17 million cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are unlocking value by using de identified data to help patients directly, but also to help providers, physicians, payers, and entire healthcare systems. We have invested in the cyber security, the privacy, cloud operations, as well as data analytics, including artificial intelligence machine learning capabilities to do this at a scale unmatched by our competitors. And we are increasing our lead each and every day. Our two key software, customer facing products, AirView and myAir are now 100% managed in the cloud. So not only are our devices cloud connected and our software cloud enabled, we here at ResMed as a company, are cloud connected and cloud enabled. Infact, we are a leading digital health company globally. Our mission and goal to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025 drives and motivates me and ResMedians around the world every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal during the last quarter. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks. I want to again express my sincere gratitude to the more than 8000 ResMedians worldwide for their perseverance their hard work and their dedication during these on-going and unprecedented times. Thank you for all that you do. With that, I will hand the call over to Brett and Sydney [ph] and then we will move to open the lines for Q&A. Over to you, Brett.\nBrett Sandercock: Great, thanks Mick. I'll provide an overview of our results of the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. Unless noted, all comparisons out of the prior year quarter. We had solid financial performance in Q3 despite the headwinds we faced as a result and significant on-going supply chain constraints and a challenging freight environment. Group revenue for the March quarter was $865 million, an increase of 12%. In constant currency terms revenue increased by 14%. Revenue growth reflects increased demand for our sleep and respiratory care products across our portfolio driven by recovering market conditions and by increased device demand in response to the on-going product recall by one of our competitors. In the March quarter, we recorded immaterial incremental revenue from COVID-19 related demand consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we expect negligible revenue from COVID-19 related demand. In relation to the impact of our competitors recall, we estimate that we generated incremental device revenue in the range of $35 million to $45 million in the March quarter. For the first three quarters of FY 22, this reflects incremental revenue in the range of $170 million to $190 million. We continue to experience challenges in securing sufficient components and this has hampered our ability to materially increase our supply of devices. We expect our fiscal fourth quarter to remain supply constraints and similar to our recent fiscal quarters, therefore limiting incremental revenue during the fourth quarter. We now expect a total incremental device revenue opportunity for fiscal year 2022 will fall somewhere between $200 million and $250 million. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 18%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 11% in constant currency terms. Of that segment, globally in constant current terms, device sales increased by 21%, while masks and other sales increased by 9%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 30%, as we've benefited from incremental revenue due to a competitor's recall and favorable product mix as we sold an increased proportion of higher acuity devices. This is consistent with our guiding principles for product allocation, namely that we are giving priority to the production and delivery of our devices to meet the needs of the high acuity patients first. Masks and other sales in the U.S. Canada and Latin America increased by 7%, reflecting solid resupply revenue achieved despite the challenging device supply environment, which continues to limit new patient\u2019s setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets device sales increased by 10% in constant currency terms. Mask and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 13% in constant currency terms. Software-as-a-service revenue increased by 8% in the March quarter. We saw strong performance out of the HME segment as customers continue to utilize our SaaS solutions to streamline and more efficiently run their businesses. And we are seeing some stability in the skilled nursing care segment as it continues to emerge from the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin declined by 150 basis points to 58.1% in the March quarter. The decrease is predominantly attributable to higher freight, component, and manufacturing costs, partially offset by a positive product mix, due to strong growth in our higher acuity devices and improvement in average selling prices following the introduction of the device surcharge. Moving on to operating expenses. We are seeing a more normalized expenditure profile as COVID-19 impacts subside compared to the low comparable and negative price rates we experienced in Q3 last year. SG&A expenses for the third quarter increased by 14%, or in constant currency terms increased by 17%. The increase was probably attributed to an increase in employee related expenses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue at 21% remained broadly consistent with the 20.9% we reported in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the balance of FY 22. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 19% or in constant currency terms increased by 22%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.7% compared to 7.3% in the prior-year quarter. We continue to make significant investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product, and solutions development will deliver sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the second half of FY 2022. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter increased by 5%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by the contraction of our gross margin and higher operating expenses. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 21.1%, compared to the prior year quarter non-GAAP tax rate of 19.4%. Looking forward, we estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rates for the full fiscal year 22 will be in the range of 19% to 20%. Our non-GAAP net income for the quarter increased by 2% and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter also increased by 2%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $117 million reflecting robust underlying earnings partially offset by higher levels of working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $48 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $42 million. During the quarter we pay dividends to shareholders totaling $61 million. We recorded equity losses of $2.6 million in our income statement in the March quarter associated with the premise on a joint venture with Verily, We expect to record equity losses of approximately $2 million to $3 million per quarter, the balance of fiscal year 22 and into FY 23 associated with a joint venture operation. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $202 million. At March 31, we had $681 million in gross debt, and $479 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. And at March 31, we had approximately $1.6 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, reflecting the board's confidence in our operating performance. Our solid cash flow and low leverage provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. Going forward, we plan to continue to invest for growth through R&D. We also expect to continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Brett. Kevin, I'd like to ask you to come back on the line. I'll turn the call over to you to provide instructions and to manage the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from David Low from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nDavid Low: Thanks very much. If I could just start with a question on the guidance from the benefit from the field free call. So it's fallen $100 million short of where you are projecting a year or so ago. Just wondering how you are now thinking about that opportunity set as we move into the new financial year?\nMick Farrell: Hey, David, yes, it's Mick here. That's a good question. And, clearly as we in the second half of the year now we're readjusting that expectation for FY 22 now in total to be 200 to 250. You look I'll just be very open, very specifically a contract from 12 months ago with a particular I will not name them. But a particular semiconductor supplier had a very significant double-digit de-commit in these last months, weeks, and there's a commitment from 12 months ago, that had some very strong supply and it went down double-digits. And so with that as a headwind into us all the tail winds of our work, the five projects, five lines of projects going on in our supply chain allowed us to sort of, take two steps forward and two steps back versus two steps forward and one step back. And that didn't allow us to achieve that that extra 100 million of incremental revenue that we thought that we would achieve here through fiscal 22 for the first half. And so that's going to be tougher and as things a little bit further back. Having said that some of these projects coming to market such as the Card-to-cloud AirSense 10 device, where we eliminate that bottleneck or the number one bottleneck, which is the 3G, 4G comms chip. And we allow, the next bottleneck, which is another electronic components to become the one, we can then speed up some production to make up some of that difference. And that's allowed us to achieve the 30% year-on-year growth that we saw in devices in U.S., Canada, and Latin America and the 10% year-on-year growth that we achieved this quarter for Europe, Asia and rest of the world. Look, it's not perfect sailing ahead. When you get de-commits. I'd never heard that word de-commit. We're offering you got a signed contract, you're offering money, very good margins, long term contracts, and people just can't supply. Often force majeure and other aspects coming into play. But I can tell you that all the work that we've been doing these hard works by supply chain have allowed us to actually to achieve these results despite that headwind. We're not planning on giving guidance for FY 23 around this. We are saying that this is what I'll say. What we're doing is going to strive for sequential growth every quarter as we go ahead. So sequential growth from March to June, June to September, September to December throughout this fiscal year. That's what we're going for. And I actually think as you start to look towards the second half of the calendar year, you look at the December quarter, there are a number of other projects that don't involve necessarily the risk of an externality of other de-commit from someone else's enough projects. And enough, I would say, new suppliers, new components, new designs and new engineering reengineering that we're doing around both the hardware and the software to give us a strong confidence in supply of product ahead. So I think that supply chain have done amazingly. And, if you look at what we would have achieved, 14% growth, constant currency year-on-year, yes, we could have, we could have got to 20% or 25%, if we'd had unlimited supply, de-commits, and changes in supply chain in global semiconductor and other electronic components have been a headwind. But I think with all the work we've got, we're going to power through this, we got a strong ship, there are waves ahead, but we're going to power through it stronger than ever. And I think our team has done a great job in the supply that we're going to get throughout this calendar year will be a great opportunity for sequential growth as we go through.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Gretel Janu from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.\nGretel Janu: Thanks. Good morning, Mick. Just one question on the backlog of patients. So you did mention in your prepared remarks, just trying to see if you can quantify how large the backlog is currently? And how long are patients waiting to get on to treatment? Is there something that ResMed can do to keep these patients engaged? Or is there a risk that they potentially fall out of the system? If they don't get onto product, in a in a short period of time?\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Gretel. It's a great question. And yes, as you know that I talked about at least 12 to 18 months of a backlog, which is, in many industries you say fantastic to have a backlog, but these are patients waiting therapy and to the specific party a question Gretel, how long will any individual patient wait? It's not like a patient gets a diagnosis, and they have to wait 12 to 18 months. It depends on the geography and the environment. It might be eight days or eight weeks, depending on the geography and our flow of products. But an individual patient is not sitting out there told, Oh, you've got this life threatening disease, we'll take care of you next April. They're being told look, it's going to take for four weeks. And they're not happy with that. I mean, they've been told they suffocate maybe 100 times per night, maybe 50 times per hour, if they've got very severe sleep apnea. And they're suffocating. They want therapy, and so that that pressure is there, and the desire is there. We're watching very carefully. I mean, obviously we're involved in the substitute therapies. We sell a dental divides all across western and northern Europe with a number one provider, with novel our technology. We're not seeing this huge movement over to dental and the 100 muscle nerve stem that we're investing through in Astella [Ph]. We're not seeing a huge movement over to those substitutes. So they're being told by the doctor, it's eight days or it's eight weeks, and they're accepting that and they're sitting there in that pipeline. What I mean by the 12 to 18 month backlog is if you look at the net of the industry, this is building up because the number two player here is out. As they said earlier this week, they said at least through the end of this calendar year. I think they said that only be 90% done with their [Indiscernible] by the end of this calendar year. So that means the rest of us have to step up and ResMed is the number one player and we're stepping up the most and we're stepping up incredibly well. And I think we'll do that through it. But even when they come back online, it's not like the backlog goes away the day they come on. That's there and it's for all of us to drive. I think the share that we've gained is going to be entrenched because of the digital solutions we have and we'll go and gain from there. But the patients are there and I think it's awful that somebody might have to wait four weeks, or eight weeks. I don't want them to wait more than 4 hours to 8 hours. But right in the moment we're in this situation will be that way for a period of time given these unprecedented circumstances.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nLyanne Harrison: And good morning all. Thank you for taking my question. Can we just talk a little bit about the device and mass dynamics in both Americas and rest of the world? Obviously, Americans had softer devices, but sorry, had Americans had stronger device growth, but much softer mass growth there. Can you I guess, share what your thoughts are around to the extent that's driven by fewer devices in the market as opposed to resupply, and then vice versa for the rest of the world.\nMick Farrell: Thanks Lyanne for the question. Yes, as you mentioned, very strong device growth in the U.S., Canada, Latin America, 30%. And very solid growth in devices in Europe, Asia, elsewhere at 10% netting out at 21% cc across that sector. In the math side actually, if you go back to 2019, Lyanne when we were talking about market growth, right, we were talking then about devices, mid-single digits and masks being high single digits, I look at our global mask growth rate at 9% constant currency with the headwind of new diagnoses downward or competitive being out for new patient stops. And the U.S. Canada, Latin America at 7% constant currency as pretty reasonable growth, new patients are down but what we're actually doing there is working with resupply with Brightree resupply, with SNAP technology ReSupply in the U.S. and around the world with some of our models are working with patients directly in markets like Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and our western and northern European teams working with hospitals and care delivery systems to achieve that 13% constant currency growth in Europe, Asia and America. And I think, I'll hand to Jim Hollingshead the President of our global sleep business, but Jim, I think we're actually taking share in some of those categories again in the quarter.\nJim Hollingshead: So thanks, Mick. And thanks, Lyanne it\u2019s a great question. I think this is one of those weird circumstances for us where the numbers don't actually very clearly convey the underlying dynamics. And the reason for that is the volumes and the revenue growth we're producing in different markets is almost completely contingent on which SKUs we can produce, right. So it's a little bit, it's a little bit complicated. But we can, when we can produce devices that have sell chips that can go into certain European markets, and we have those components, then we get more growth for that period of time as we ship those products. And then sometimes those specific SKUs get constrained. And so the dynamic is actually pretty constant across all geographies, which is very, very high demand for our devices. Very, very high demand for our masks. There is a headwind on masks, because new patient starts are down because the market is under supplied. But really across all geographies there are tailwinds for masks because in the U.S., we have very resilient resupply and in other European markets, we have very really resilient resupply in markets like France and Northern Europe. And so the number the differences you've seen in the groceries is actually driven by component supply and not by demand dynamics, if that makes sense. So it continues to be really almost unlimited demand for our products across the board. With devices obviously, in the U.S., we introduced AirSense 11. That freed up a lot of capacity for us. That's why we got such outsized growth relative to the other markets in the U.S. market this quarter. And the mask growth is pretty steady across all the markets.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today is from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey. Your line is now live.\nSaul Hadassin: Good morning, Mick. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one on the guidance you've provided for the full year for the Philips share gains and that revenue contribution. The other companies obviously, what do you think is the underlying growth rate of the base business excluding that share gains? I guess, in other words, what were you expecting to grow the business by? How do you come up with that 200 to 250 million? And I guess, the question really is what do you expect of the base business to be able to grow up considering the supply constraints that are in the market at the moment? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Yes, Saul thanks, thanks for the question. And in looking at these estimates started about six months ago. I'll probably get Brett to give a little bit of detail around how we actually came up with the details of the calculations of the 300 to 350 and the 200 and 250. I'll give you the CEOs perspective first, and the CFO will come in and give more quantitative detail in a moment. But the way I looked at it, about six, eight months ago, it was I guess it was June, mid June when the competitor announced this. There were estimates on the sell side from 50 million of incremental revenue for ResMed during the fiscal year, up to 950 million from some of the sell side analysts and we thought that that range is just too broad. We generally don't get guidance we leave that to the job of the very smart people on the sell side and the buy side to do so. But that that variance was too big. And so we said, let's calculate it, let's take our forecast that we had at that time, eight, nine months ago for the fiscal year 22. And then look at what we think we can achieve based upon parts and components we can get into our factories and product we can make to take care of what is a seemingly infinite demand. So we'll just be rate limited on the parts and pieces. And we looked at mostly comms chips and some other electronic components would be rate limiting. And so we said, Okay, let's see how high we can ramp those with our great work from our ops team looking at ResMed 2030, 2035 and a brand new plant in Singapore, we actually weren't limited and aren't limited on manufacturing capacity, it was just about supply. And we estimated 300 million to 350 million in incremental revenue above our forecast growth. We didn't actually give a public number of what our forecast growth was. We just talked about that incremental revenue being there, letting sell side models for their forecast, add on to that in the 300 to 350. We've adjusted that to 200 to 250. So on top of whatever that growth was, we think it'll be 200 to 250. And that's really getting down to these. This last quarter Q4 gives a bit more detail on that. Brett, any further quantitative info, you want to give on that to Saul\u2019s question there?\nBrett Sandercock: Yes, thanks, Mick. I think we got that right. We saw really what we did is we looked at our pre-recorded forecasts, and it's very much an estimate on what we think that incremental demand was. And to your question kind of what would the underlying growth be? I mean, if you backed out that incremental revenue you'd get, you'd probably get Circa 10% growth on devices. So pretty, pretty strong.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST. Your line is now live.\nDan Hurren: I just wanted to ask in regards to you mentioned the Astral, the Astral was not an allocation is unlimited or sorry, is not constrained. And you just talked about how that part is traveling and competitive and the competitive market with Philips being in our market and their products.\nMick Farrell: Yes Dan, thanks for the question. And yes, you're right. As I said in the prep remarks, we -- was our guiding principle that we take care of the sickest patients first and the highest security devices first. And the Astral is that and so we've done a great job. Our ops team supply chain team manufacturing team has done a great job. We are not supply constrained on that. And we are going head-to-head with the trilogy and Eva. And what I see, as regular leases of recalls and issues with our competitor in that space. And so not just our brand reputation and the amazing technology that's in the Astral, it's incredibly reliable and very high quality. And I believe we've been taking share there for a number of quarters. But Jim, you want to give detail on the Astral and how well that's doing U.S. and rest of the world?\nJim Hollingshead: Yes, thanks, Mick. Thanks, Dan. The Astral\u2019s performing really, really well from a competitive point of view. We've taken share with the Astral it\u2019s very very strong device offering. We've made a number of improvements to that platform over the last couple of years. And also remember that the Astral can be connected to an attachable modem, which can then allow patients using an Astral to be monitored in the cloud. And we have we have that capability now in our AirView platform worldwide. And so we've had a lot of a lot of adoption of monitoring ventilated patients in our AirView platform, especially a very strong growth in Europe with that offering. So Astral continues to perform extremely well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Your line is now live.\nMatthew Mishan: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Just going back to the de-commit. Did you get a sense of why your orders were from over a year ago? We're de-committed and just how do you how did the semiconductor supply chain you know get unlocked over like the next three to six months? Like what are they telling you needs to happen incrementally so that you can get a steady or supply moving forward?\nMick Farrell: That's a great, great, great question. I'll talk a little bit about what our supply chain is doing. I'll hand over to Rob Douglas, our CFO to go through the incredible work that Andrew Price and Linda Laidlaw our President of Global ops and the head of our supply chain are doing there. I can tell you what they're getting me to do. They're getting me to work with the CEOs of these of these companies and their heads of production. And you know, we're working and providing information to show the importance and how these technologies that they're providing and going into lifesaving medical devices. I actually created a video for the investors and the internal employees at one of our major electronic components suppliers to talk to them about how every chip they give us gives the gift of breath to a person who's suffocating and to really get that message through, I mean, I think you know in the huge demand for electric cars and, and cloud connected to consumer devices and an across the board demand is up across industries. And so it can be hard if you're a component maker to differentiate, industry A from B from C and and know where it's going. When they know firstly that we pay high margins that we have long term contracts that we\u2019re recession resistant industries we showed through the global financial crisis. And the benefit for employees looking for purpose that, hey, this chip doesn't just go into a car that goes from A to B, or, or give cloud connectivity to a refrigerator. This thing literally keeps someone breathing and allows them and their doctor to see that breath and then improvement of incomes, reduction of costs and reduction in mortality. So getting that message through is really strong. We've been working very strongly since the starting gun sort of went off on this June last year, and we're getting better and better. But across the industry, Rob it's a tough environment for supply.\nRob Douglas: Yes, it is tough, Matt. And the way the electronics and semiconductor industry works is like any other industries, a number of players have gotten long term forecasts, which they need to have because the capital investments in order to build capacity takes a long time to develop. But I've really only got short term clarity on what the demand levels are going to be. And the actually the electronic industry has always been feast or famine for particular components. Like that this is just a worse than usual version of the usual situation. There was so much excess demand around the COVID environment. So many new dynamics, like as Mick mentioned, electric vehicles, taking up demand and consumer electronics and all that. And then the, the key suppliers have all their own inputs that have those sort of same investment issues coming. So they're also an allocation for their raw materials, as well. And then they have a number of contracts. And as Mick gets to it as if we can manage the priorities that these people have. And by the way, whenever we talked to almost anyone in any industry, we end up talking to somebody who either has sleep apnea, or their loved ones have sleep apnea, or their good friends have sleep apnea, so we can get a really strong message through as to why it should be a priority. But sometimes they've got contracts, and they need to be able to call force majeure on those contracts before they can supply us. So it's a very complex, complex project, we keep working on it. As Mick mentioned, we've got these other longer term projects that are really designing around the constraints and putting in options so that we can have what would traditionally single source components, we'd have options to multiple source components. We have many different communication modules that can operate in the, into the units now and different protocols. And we'll keep working on that. But it's not going to clear short term. And now we're going to need this great sort of agile performance from our supply team to really try and predict the areas of de-commit so that we can inform our engineering teams of what they should be designing around and get started on those key areas before they become problems. But these are tough problems to solve but we're working on it.\nMick Farrell: Yes. And in short, our goal will be with all that work that Rob just talked about to make sure we take three steps forward, so that when you do get the two steps back of this and that component, we're still moving forward sequentially every quarter throughout the year, and then really freeing up as Rob said, the long term stuff starts to come into fruition over the next 3, 6, 9 months and beyond. Thanks for the question, Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Bailey from Macquarie. Your line is now live.\nDavid Bailey: Thanks very much. Good morning, Mick I might just follow up on those numbers, five areas of work. You mentioned sourcing validation and reengineering. Just wondering where progress sits relative to your plans? If there have been any benefit to date? And when do you think, these projects are expected to complete such that you do start to see the most benefits coming through?\nMick Farrell: David, it's a great, great question. And it's and it's really complex. And I'll probably hand to Rob to maybe give some of the detail on it. But those five lines of work have multiple projects within each of them. I tried to term like, new parts from new suppliers. That means our R&D team is reengineering, a new part validating, verifying, putting through all the quality tests, we're seeing in our market, how incredibly important that is, and we will not compromise on quality. And then you've got to validate and verify a new supplier and get them through. And so just one of those five lines of work is an incredible amount of work for our quality, regulatory, R&D, engineering, production and manufacturing teams. And so these aren't overnight. It's not like we're just having a cell phone here or a comms chip in a consumer device. This thing a life support then has to be working all day every day. A CPAP has to work every night and we are I think able to with all that work I mean as you saw, we got 200 million, 250 million this just this fiscal year ahead of incredible growth and our supply chain pivoted to all of that. If there hadn't been this competitive recall, we as an industry ResMed would have been absolutely able to do with every single supply chain constraint that had happened throughout this. And that's just speaks to the flex and the ability to go. We have these projects that have been going nine months, I actually think they're doing well. It's hard to say, even if I gave you on each of those five lines of work, the key milestones on it, there are probably five projects within each of those. So its sort of a 5 by 5, 25 point matrix. Rob's looking at this, Jim's looking at this on a daily basis. I get the updates every second or third day. As a CEO, I used to focus all my time just on customers talking to customers talking to health insurers and showing the benefit of our therapy, spending a lot more time with supply chain than I want to but right now, that's where the urgent need is. And for the next, 3, 6, 9, 12 months is where we're going to be focused. But at the same time, we're investing in demand gen. So that as the price starts to come back, and it will, and as a competitor comes back along, we can turn that demand gen back on securing all the share gains we've got through the digital entrenchment, and then drive for future growth. But Rob, how do you summarize all the other work we're doing for David succinctly here?\nRob Douglas: Yes, we David, we wouldn't break down all the individual projects. But no, I mentioned having multiple columns, protocols, multiple chips, multiple sources of chips. And to mix point, our issue around quality and patient safety is just so important. So we can't really take any undue risk or give any give on the quality of the validation processes. And making sure we're doing the right thing through all of that. So you can't just throw in a new component and say, let's see if it works. We've got to really do all the proper life testing and check through. So that's why it doesn't happen overnight. But the teams are working on it. And they said they're thinking about how to forecast the right areas, so that we can get on the front foot on these. Another important area is our ability to burst demand and burst supply, when we do get solutions come in, and you actually will see our inventory levels have increased. And that's interesting in a time, when really every product we make immediately delivered to customers and sold. And that's because we're working hard on making sure we've got all the raw material inventories, including longer term commitment with the suppliers, which actually we've had to do in order to guarantee short term supply. And so we've got very strong inventories of nearly everything, but a few that are short, but when those few ones shorts that were short come in, rather put them quickly into production and quickly get them on to patients.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live.\nMike Matson: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about this character cloud device, sorry, Card-to-cloud device. Can you maybe comment on how that works? I assume that the collected data on the card and then has to be uploaded somehow. But and then, is there any kind of long term repercussions from having these out there in your installed base in terms of lost data over time or anything like that?\nMick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Mike. And I'll hand to Jim to walk through some further detail on it. I can tell you look from ResMed, when we really first got into digital health in 2002, we had paging devices on experimental parts of our devices and 2005, we started to with the AirSense launch in 2006, 2007 I had some SD cards that were in those devices. And so we've sort of had this, this world of card-to-cloud at ResMed for well over a decade, 10 years, 15 years that we've had had the ability to do that type of technology. Obviously, with the AirSense 10, we changed the whole market. We did the sort of reverse Amazon play where we said 100% connectivity in the AirSense 10 through the comms chip. And then you take it seamlessly. And it's and it's taken to go there. Look, this is humanitarian emergency right now. We have a competitor out of the market, and there's not enough comms chips to go around the world. And we looked at this and said, well, look, why don't we go to where we were before, which is a great technology of Card-to-cloud. The differentiator for us is AirView that the doctors use, myAir that the patients use and the whole ecosystem of data. And so I think it's far more efficient and appropriate, then it goes straight in a secure end to end encrypted from the device there. But in this time of emergency for a period of time, who longs knows how long it will last, these AirSense 10 Card-to- clouds, a whole lot better patient getting that technology than one of the competitors out there that has some -- solution that may or may not be encrypted, who knows how it works, and the device not might not be as reliable. So the AirSense 10 is the second best device on the market, second only to the AirSense 11. So Card-to-cloud is out there. But Jim, you know, it's early days. How's it going?\nJim Hollingshead: It's very early days and we'll be bringing and we'll be bringing it to more and more geographies but you know to midpoint, we really just want to make sure patients get on therapy. I mean, that's, that's the driving rationale for launching. And this device is Card-to-cloud version residents. And it's basically in AirSense 10 without the cell chip. And so to, the process question Mike you asked is about, the devices all have SD cards in them. The SD card has to get to the provider. The provider uploads the data into the cloud. We've actually just re-launched or launched a renewed and better version of the process for doing that for the software that allows the upload into the cloud. And the great advantage of the whole system is that the patients still can be managed in AirView. And AirView is the best, patient management system on the market, we know that it has the strongest preference, the strongest performance, it's secure. It's encrypted and protects privacy, and, importantly, all have our customers using AirView right now in their workflows. And so that what the, the Card-to-cloud device is missing one step, which is the daily cloud uploaded data and via the system, the data will come into the system into the cloud, when the SD card gets uploaded by the provider. So and that I don't think anybody will do that on a daily basis, they'll do it relatively infrequently. The data is all there in the SD card. The device stores the data for months, so no data is lost. It's just the frequency of upload. And again, the main rationale behind it is we want to make sure patients get on therapy, there's a growing patient backlog, we can produce these devices at volume. And it gets around our biggest constraint, which is the communication.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is now live.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys, this is Maggie on for Margaret. Thanks for taking our questions. I wanted to ask the incremental benefit guidance question a little bit of a different way. So obviously, supply constraints here are not allowing you to service all the patients out there. So you're reducing it by 100 million. So as the pie improves, and when it does, do you think that you will be able to recover that full 100 million in the next fiscal year, and even more than that? Thanks so much.\nMick Farrell: Thanks for your question, Maggie. I mean, the short answer is yes, absolutely. Through not just the technology, Jim was talking about the essence, Card-to-cloud but all the other projects, Rob's been talking about the 5 by 5 25 plus matrix of incredible projects that are going through are going to free up supply. And sequentially as we go through this year, we're going to get growth and growth and growth. And so, just to be clear, it was on top of, as Brett said, strong sort of 10% forecast growth, we then had, in addition to that 300 million to 350 million of incremental, that incremental was reduced to 200 to 250, as we as we said today, for this fiscal year that we're in. But that incremental growth, those patients will be there. And we will be in the back when we will get to them in fiscal 23 and more as we continue to grow throughout the fiscal year 2023. It's not like this is an overnight success. And one of the 25 projects works tomorrow. We're all perfect. It's incremental, continuous improvement, step by step improvement of an amazing ops and supply chain team, and an amazing sales and delivery team working with customers on this allocation and understanding how to bring that product to market and understanding on the marketing side to just get ready for the demand gen that's going to need to happen to get all the backlog in and new patients in as we go in, throughout fiscal year 23 and beyond. But the short answer is Maggie. Yes, we will get to that increment and more throughout the coming 12, 18 months.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.\nSuraj Kalia: Good afternoon everyone. Hey Mick a lot of questions have been answered. Mick, if we layer a recessionary environment on top of an inflationary environment, can you just give us some guidance in terms of new order flow-through, patient behaviour, resupply orders, especially, it almost seems inevitable that there's another complicating factor on the horizon. Thank you.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Suraj. Yes, look, I mean, clearly inflation is high. And as you've seen, that's been hitting, some of our areas of cost. We have some price mitigation on the AirSense 11. And on global surcharge, and some sort of skews across the range to deal with inflation and to share some of the pain of that that we are seeing from our suppliers with the channel. But so that's, that's how we're sort of mitigating the impacts of inflation. Your question about a future recession who knows we haven't a long bull market. One thing I know that ResMed and I was here through I was actually running the global sleep business through \u201908, \u201909 and \u201810. And I just taken over it the year before and ResMed is remarkably resistant to that global, that global financial crisis. And in recessionary environment, people may forego that extra Tesla, that extra phone for $2,000, but they will not forego that extra CPAP for $1,000 as much. And so we were very recession resistant through that last global financial crisis had a bull bull run here, globally for 10, 12 years, it is possible. Suraj, you're probably better at predicting the timing, or when a recession may come in the next 12, 24, 36 months, I don't know. But I know that as opposed to other consumer industries and automotive industries and fast moving consumer goods, medtech, and particularly consumer driven medtech, like ResMed and sleep apnea. We've been very recession resistant are a very strong player throughout that and give us a competitive advantage, I think of some of the other players fighting for the dollars available. But look, who knows what the timing of any of that would be. But we've got mitigation plans in for inflation. I think very good experience and capabilities to deal with downturns and or, and or recessions. But thanks for the question Suraj.\nOperator: Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further closing comments.\nMick Farrell: Well thanks Kevin, for hanging the phone back. And thanks again to all of our shareholders for joining us on this call. I'd like to once again thank the 8000 ResMedians, many of you are also shareholders through our ESPP. So thank you for that for your dedication and your hard work helping people breathe better, sleep better, and live better lives outside the hospital in 140 countries worldwide. Thanks for what you do today and every day. I look forward to talking to you and all of our stakeholders here again in 90 days. Thank you, and we can now close the call.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Mick. To echo and thank you, everyone. We appreciate your interest and your time. As a reminder, if you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to our Investor Relations team directly. This does conclude our third quarter 2022 conference call. Kevin I'll turn it back to you to close things out.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. Simply disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.

            "name": "Jim Hollingshead",
            "content": "So thanks, Mick. And thanks, Lyanne it's a great question. I think this is one of those weird circumstances for us where the numbers don't actually very clearly convey the underlying dynamics. And the reason for that is the volumes and the revenue growth we're producing in different markets is almost completely contingent on which SKUs we can produce, right. So it's a little bit, it's a little bit complicated. But we can, when we can produce devices that have sell chips that can go into certain European markets, and we have those components, then we get more growth for that period of time as we ship those products. And then sometimes those specific SKUs get constrained. And so the dynamic is actually pretty constant across all geographies, which is very, very high demand for our devices. Very, very high demand for our masks. There is a headwind on masks, because new patient starts are down because the market is under supplied. But really across all geographies there are tailwinds for masks because in the U.S., we have very resilient resupply and in other European markets, we have very really resilient resupply in markets like France and Northern Europe. And so the number the differences you've seen in the groceries is actually driven by component supply and not by demand dynamics, if that makes sense. So it continues to be really almost unlimited demand for our products across the board. With devices obviously, in the U.S., we introduced AirSense 11. That freed up a lot of capacity for us. That's why we got such outsized growth relative to the other markets in the U.S. market this quarter. And the mask growth is pretty steady across all the markets. Yes, thanks, Mick. Thanks, Dan. The Astral's performing really, really well from a competitive point of view. We've taken share with the Astral it's very very strong device offering. We've made a number of improvements to that platform over the last couple of years. And also remember that the Astral can be connected to an attachable modem, which can then allow patients using an Astral to be monitored in the cloud. And we have we have that capability now in our AirView platform worldwide. And so we've had a lot of a lot of adoption of monitoring ventilated patients in our AirView platform, especially a very strong growth in Europe with that offering. So Astral continues to perform extremely well. It's very early days and we'll be bringing and we'll be bringing it to more and more geographies but you know to midpoint, we really just want to make sure patients get on therapy. I mean, that's, that's the driving rationale for launching. And this device is Card-to-cloud version residents. And it's basically in AirSense 10 without the cell chip.

            "name": "Brett Sandercock",
            "content": "Great, thanks Mick. I'll provide an overview of our results of the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. Unless noted, all comparisons out of the prior year quarter. We had solid financial performance in Q3 despite the headwinds we faced as a result and significant on-going supply chain constraints and a challenging freight environment. Group revenue for the March quarter was $865 million, an increase of 12%. In constant currency terms revenue increased by 14%. Revenue growth reflects increased demand for our sleep and respiratory care products across our portfolio driven by recovering market conditions and by increased device demand in response to the on-going product recall by one of our competitors. In the March quarter, we recorded immaterial incremental revenue from COVID-19 related demand consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we expect negligible revenue from COVID-19 related demand. In relation to the impact of our competitors recall, we estimate that we generated incremental device revenue in the range of $35 million to $45 million in the March quarter. For the first three quarters of FY 22, this reflects incremental revenue in the range of $170 million to $190 million. We continue to experience challenges in securing sufficient components and this has hampered our ability to materially increase our supply of devices. We expect our fiscal fourth quarter to remain supply constraints and similar to our recent fiscal quarters, therefore limiting incremental revenue during the fourth quarter. We now expect a total incremental device revenue opportunity for fiscal year 2022 will fall somewhere between $200 million and $250 million. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 18%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 11% in constant currency terms. Of that segment, globally in constant current terms, device sales increased by 21%, while masks and other sales increased by 9%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 30%, as we've benefited from incremental revenue due to a competitor's recall and favorable product mix as we sold an increased proportion of higher acuity devices. This is consistent with our guiding principles for product allocation, namely that we are giving priority to the production and delivery of our devices to meet the needs of the high acuity patients first. Masks and other sales in the U.S. Canada and Latin America increased by 7%, reflecting solid resupply revenue achieved despite the challenging device supply environment, which continues to limit new patient's setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets device sales increased by 10% in constant currency terms. Mask and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 13% in constant currency terms. Software-as-a-service revenue increased by 8% in the March quarter. We saw strong performance out of the HME segment as customers continue to utilize our SaaS solutions to streamline and more efficiently run their businesses. And we are seeing some stability in the skilled nursing care segment as it continues to emerge from the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin declined by 150 basis points to 58.1% in the March quarter. The decrease is predominantly attributable to higher freight, component, and manufacturing costs, partially offset by a positive product mix, due to strong growth in our higher acuity devices and improvement in average selling prices following the introduction of the device surcharge. Moving on to operating expenses. We are seeing a more normalized expenditure profile as COVID-19 impacts subside compared to the low comparable and negative price rates we experienced in Q3 last year. SG&A expenses for the third quarter increased by 14%, or in constant currency terms increased by 17%. The increase was probably attributed to an increase in employee related expenses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue at 21% remained broadly consistent with the 20.9% we reported in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the balance of FY 22. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 19% or in constant currency terms increased by 22%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.7% compared to 7.3% in the prior-year quarter. We continue to make significant investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product, and solutions development will deliver sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the second half of FY 2022. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter increased by 5%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by the contraction of our gross margin and higher operating expenses. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 21.1%, compared to the prior year quarter non-GAAP tax rate of 19.4%. Looking forward, we estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rates for the full fiscal year 22 will be in the range of 19% to 20%. Our non-GAAP net income for the quarter increased by 2% and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter also increased by 2%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $117 million reflecting robust underlying earnings partially offset by higher levels of working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $48 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $42 million. During the quarter we pay dividends to shareholders totaling $61 million. We recorded equity losses of $2.6 million in our income statement in the March quarter associated with the premise on a joint venture with Verily, We expect to record equity losses of approximately $2 million to $3 million per quarter, the balance of fiscal year 22 and into FY 23 associated with a joint venture operation. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $202 million. At March 31, we had $681 million in gross debt, and $479 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. And at March 31, we had approximately $1.6 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, reflecting the board's confidence in our operating performance. Our solid cash flow and low leverage provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. Going forward, we plan to continue to invest for growth through R&D. We also expect to continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy. Yes, thanks, Mick. I think we got that right. We saw really what we did is we looked at our pre-recorded forecasts, and it's very much an estimate on what we think that incremental demand was. And to your question kind of what would the underlying growth be? I mean, if you backed out that incremental revenue you'd get, you'd probably get Circa 10% growth on devices. So pretty, pretty strong."

            "name": "Rob Douglas",
            "content": "Yes, it is tough, Matt. And the way the electronics and semiconductor industry works is like any other industries, a number of players have gotten long term forecasts, which they need to have because the capital investments in order to build capacity takes a long time to develop. But I've really only got short term clarity on what the demand levels are going to be. And the actually the electronic industry has always been feast or famine for particular components. Like that this is just a worse than usual version of the usual situation. There was so much excess demand around the COVID environment. So many new dynamics, like as Mick mentioned, electric vehicles, taking up demand and consumer electronics and all that. And then the, the key suppliers have all their own inputs that have those sort of same investment issues coming. So they're also an allocation for their raw materials, as well. And then they have a number of contracts. And as Mick gets to it as if we can manage the priorities that these people have. And by the way, whenever we talked to almost anyone in any industry, we end up talking to somebody who either has sleep apnea, or their loved ones have sleep apnea, or their good friends have sleep apnea, so we can get a really strong message through as to why it should be a priority. But sometimes they've got contracts, and they need to be able to call force majeure on those contracts before they can supply us. So it's a very complex, complex project, we keep working on it. As Mick mentioned, we've got these other longer term projects that are really designing around the constraints and putting in options so that we can have what would traditionally single source components, we'd have options to multiple source components. We have many different communication modules that can operate in the, into the units now and different protocols. And we'll keep working on that. But it's not going to clear short term. And now we're going to need this great sort of agile performance from our supply team to really try and predict the areas of de-commit so that we can inform our engineering teams of what they should be designing around and get started on those key areas before they become problems. But these are tough problems to solve but we're working on it. Yes, we David, we wouldn't break down all the individual projects. But no, I mentioned having multiple columns, protocols, multiple chips, multiple sources of chips. And to mix point, our issue around quality and patient safety is just so important. So we can't really take any undue risk or give any give on the quality of the validation processes. And making sure we're doing the right thing through all of that. So you can't just throw in a new component and say, let's see if it works. We've got to really do all the proper life testing and check through. So that's why it doesn't happen overnight. But the teams are working on it. And they said they're thinking about how to forecast the right areas, so that we can get on the front foot on these.

            "name": "Mick Farrell",
            "content": "Thanks, Amy and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review results for the third quarter of our fiscal year 2022 ended March 31. Our third quarter results reflect strong performance across our business with double-digit revenue growth in our sleep and respiratory care business, and high single digit growth in our software as a service segment. Our growth is the direct result of our global team's ability to pivot and drive for results, even as we continue to manage through several external challenges that are impacting our business, including one, on-going supply chain disruptions; two, COVID restrictions in parts of the world, three, recovering post-COVID Peak patient flow, and four unprecedented demand from a competitor recall, which will keep them out of the market at least through the end of the calendar year. The global supply chain environment remains very challenging across multiple industries. I'm very proud of our team growing double-digits this quarter year-on-year with an astounding 30% growth this quarter for devices in U.S. Canada, and Latin America. Even with this incredible growth, the demand in the market was even greater. As with almost all customers in the global components industry, we remain on allocation from our suppliers, particularly for electronic components, with our number one bottleneck being semiconductor chips. This allocation impacts our ability to meet the incredible demand that we see in our marketplace. And we are forced intern to allocate ResMed products to our customers. We have established guiding principles for allocation, giving priority to the production and delivery of devices to meet the needs of the highest acuity patients first. Additionally, the on-going challenges of sea freights and air freight due to reduced availability and increased prices are impacting our ability to efficiently get components into and finished goods out of our factories worldwide. We are working closely with our global supply chain partners doing everything that we can to secure additional supply to further increase production of our devices. This work includes a combination of a number of workstreams. One, shoring up the flow of existing parts from existing suppliers, two establishing flow of existing parts from new suppliers, three validating new parts from existing suppliers, and four validating and verifying new parts from new suppliers as we review and redesign across key devices in our portfolio. In addition, we have fifth line of work. So it's five lines of work and that fifth line is reengineering designs to eliminate and or mitigate the top bottlenecks to achieve greater flow through our supply chain. The most significant example of a project in this fifth line of work is our newly released AirSense 10 Card-to-cloud device. This device eliminates the number one bottleneck of the 3G, 4G comms chip, while facilitating secure data upload to our cloud based software platform called AirView so that providers and physicians can access the data and better manage the patient. We've already begun to offer AirSense 10 Card-to-cloud devices in select markets to some customers, and we will be ramping up from there. With these five lines of work continuing in parallel, we have been able to offset some of the impact of continuing component shortages and de-commits to help us better support patients, providers and physicians. We recognize that this is a very difficult situation for all of our customers, including physicians who feel the pressure from their patients, home medical equipment providers who see this every day in their businesses, but also payers and entire healthcare systems and especially the most important customer, the patient themselves. We are partnering across the industry to be the solutions provider to these problems. We expect a significant backlog of patients diagnosed and coming through the system to be present for at least the next 12 to 18 months with incredible associated demand. We are working to address this demand with these portfolios of supply projects and beyond, and we will get through this time stronger than ever as an industry and as a company. Our number one priority will always be patients, doing our best to help those who suffer from sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and other key chronic respiratory insufficiency diseases, as well as those who benefit from our out of the hospital care software as a service solutions. Our goal is to ensure that every person gets the care that they need, where they need it, and when they need it. Let's now briefly discuss the other broad market conditions in our industry. We continue to see steady on-going recovery of patient flow and demand through the diagnostic channel across the countries that we operate in. In fact, many countries are above 100% of pre-COVID levels of patient flow. However on-going surges, variance, and government restrictions continue to impact a few countries which will remain below pre-COVID diagnostic levels. China is a case in point right now with severe shutdowns in Shanghai and beyond. But across our portfolio, our global portfolio, we're in 140 countries that we serve, I expect that these metrics will steadily improve to pre-COVID patient levels and beyond. As vaccines and boosters roll out globally, and people remain focused on their personal respiratory health and hygiene that's been a big learning through COVID. With the adoption of digital health solutions for screening, diagnosis, and remote patient setup, and remote patient monitoring, as well as established COVID cleaning protocols, sleep labs and other facilities, I expect the impact of new variants to diminish in absolute impact each and every time. Let me now update you on our top three strategic priorities. Number one, which is to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma businesses. Number two, to design, develop and deliver world leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally. And number three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care that is delivered outside the hospital where people live, and especially in the home. The U.S. launch of our next generation device platform called AirSense 11 continues to go very well. Although it is challenging to differentiate on-going positive customer sentiment and feedback from the incredibly high demand in the U.S. market and beyond. The AirSense 11 has provided much needed additional product supply as we face all time high demand for ResMed devices, and it couldn't have launched at a better time for that purpose to help us mitigate on-going component shortages. We will introduce the AirSense 11 into additional countries in the fourth quarter that we're in right now here at fiscal year 2022 and throughout fiscal 2023. In parallel, we will continue to sell our globally available market leading platform the AirSense 10, which is second in customer preference only to the AirSense 11 including the new Card-to-cloud AirSense 10 as we seek to maximize the total volume of CPAP APAP and bi-levels [ph] available for all of our customers. With our digital health technology ecosystem, we are engaging patients in their therapy in a digitally native environment like never before in the industry. We are also making it easier and more efficient for our home medical equipment and homecare provider customers to manage their patient populations using our full suite of software solutions, including myAir for patients. AirView for physicians and providers, and Brightree for HME providers. When customers use these digital health technology solutions, they have increased efficiencies, lower costs, and together with us we achieve improved outcomes for patients and their physicians. With the latest technology built into the AirSense 11 platform, we are driving higher adoption rates of the myAir app by patients higher than ever before. Right now, we are seeing more than double the myAir adoption rate as patients engage directly in their own health care. People want personal care. They want their own data on their own app on their own phone. And they liked the coaching and the personal engagement of our digital ecosystem. This means more patients are signing up onto myAir every day and fully engaging with ResMed's software technology, helping us to now pass over 11.5 billion nights of respiratory medical data in the cloud. Ultimately these software solutions, these big data deliver a better patient experience. They deliver better efficiencies for homecare providers, and most importantly, they deliver greater long term adherence to therapy by patients. Let me spend just a couple of minutes outlining some real world evidence showing that greater therapy adherence leads to lower hospitalizations, lower mortality, and better clinical outcomes through mitigation of chronic disease. We are demonstrating better patient outcomes and lowering costs for the healthcare system at a scale not seen before in the industry. These are critical components of the ResMed 2025 strategy. The latest example is a study recently published in the landmark American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine Journal, also known in the industry as the Blue Journal. This article demonstrates that patients with obstructive sleep apnea and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who were adherent to CPAP therapy versus non-adherence to CPAP therapy, and it showed significant year one and year two reduction of clinical use by over 30% and reduction of inpatient hospitalizations by nearly 50%. It showed a 20% reduction in year one and year two total healthcare resource cost, which included a 25% reduction in emergency room costs and a 52% reduction in inpatient hospitalizations. These are important metrics for the whole healthcare system. Another key aspect of our long term growth strategy is driving awareness and increasing the flow of patients through the top of the sleep apnea diagnostic funnel. COVID-19 has advanced awareness, adoption and acceptance of digital health and respiratory health, including telehealth tools, and specifically home-based sleep apnea tests. Although driving demand generation is not a priority in the immediate term, given the supply shortage and incredible demand we're facing, we are maintaining our long term focus and investments in this diagnostic channel so that we are ready when conditions improve to ensure sustainable, long term pipelines of new patients coming through the channel. With 1.6 billion people worldwide suffering from sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma. It's also our duty to do this. We are innovating with partners and our customers to create even more efficient and effective approaches to sleep apnea, patient identification, screening, diagnostics, treatment, and management. We will continue to invest in technology that enable what we call an end-to-end seamless digital experience for patients. One example we recently rolled out is the next generation of our remote mask selector tool that makes mask selection and sizing easier and more effective by creating personalized mask recommendations based on a patient's health, sleep attributes and their own facial measurements. Choosing the right mask is challenging to do remotely. But getting the right mask fit is crucial to patient comfort and long term adherence. The technology MaskSelector is a web based tool that solves this problem by prompting the patient to answer a few simple questions and follow a few easy steps with their camera enabled smartphone to capture a digital facial scan. Based on the answers and the digital facial measurements, MaskSelector then provides a recommended mask and sizing. Whether a patient is then being set up at home remotely, or preparing for a face-to-face interaction with a respiratory therapist and clinical staff at a provider's office MaskSelector helps the patient quickly get to the right mask for their unique needs. Turning to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million patients with COPD worldwide, and the 330 million patients that suffer from asthma worldwide. Our goal is to reach many hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including non-invasive ventilation, and life support ventilation, as well as newer therapeutic areas such as our cloud connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions from our Propeller technology, and the high flow therapy offerings, such as our product platform called Lumis HFT. Demand for our core, non-invasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for COPD and other respiratory insufficiency patients remain strong throughout the quarter, especially in markets outside the U.S. where providers shifted focus to supporting the most severe and highest acuity patients. This demand and the work of providers is aligned with the ResMed guiding principles of our allocation process, specifically to give the highest priority to manufacturing life support ventilation. As I speak, we are not component constrained on our life support ventilator called Astral. Let me now review our software as a service business for out of hospital care. During the quarter, our SaaS business achieved high single digit growth year-on-year across our portfolio of SaaS markets, including home medical equipment, as well as facilities based and home based care settings. Our SaaS customers recognize the need for technology solutions to solve their challenges with efficiency and scale, and our software services and solutions help them achieve both. The continued growth of home based care is providing tailwinds for our home medical equipment and our home health products. And we continue to grow with our customers as they increase their utilization of our software and data solutions to improve and optimize business efficiencies and patient care, including our landmark Brightree and SNAP ReSupply products. As businesses continue to open up, we've been able to visit customers in person, as well as to attend SaaS trade shows where interest in our Brightree, MatrixCare and Citus offerings to name a few remain very strong. We have a very solid pipeline in SaaS. The COVID-19 pandemic has been and remains challenging for some verticals in our SaaS business, particularly skilled nursing facilities, where headwinds have kept patients census rates below pre-pandemic levels. But as COVID restrictions continue to ease and our customers improve their line of sight to better conditions, we expect to see pent up demand for technology investments, which provide opportunities for us to sell more services and more solutions to existing customers, as well as to increase our new customer pipeline. As we look at our portfolio of solutions across care settings, we expect our SaaS group revenue growth to maintain high single digit growth as we exit this fiscal year, and well into the next fiscal year and beyond. As always, our goal is to meet or beat that market growth rate as we continue to innovate, and we expect to grow the market and take market share. We are the leading, strategic provider of SaaS solutions for outside hospital care. And we provide mission critical software across a broad range of very attractive vertical markets. We are well positioned and we have created differentiated value for customers and for ResMed with our SaaS businesses. I'm excited about the future of our SaaS business. It's an important part of ResMeds future growth and I see a lot of opportunities to innovate in lower cost, lower acuity settings of care. It's the future of healthcare delivery with strong organic and inorganic growth in ahead for ResMed. Our focus is on personal care that is patient centric, physician centric and provider centric. This approach combined with our unique ResMed culture means that we are positioned to continue winning in the vastly underserved medical markets of sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and beyond. We are transforming out of hospital health care at scale, leading the market in digital health technology. As I said earlier, we have over 11.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud. And we have over 17 million cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are unlocking value by using de identified data to help patients directly, but also to help providers, physicians, payers, and entire healthcare systems. We have invested in the cyber security, the privacy, cloud operations, as well as data analytics, including artificial intelligence machine learning capabilities to do this at a scale unmatched by our competitors. And we are increasing our lead each and every day. Our two key software, customer facing products, AirView and myAir are now 100% managed in the cloud. So not only are our devices cloud connected and our software cloud enabled, we here at ResMed as a company, are cloud connected and cloud enabled. Infact, we are a leading digital health company globally. Our mission and goal to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025 drives and motivates me and ResMedians around the world every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal during the last quarter. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks. I want to again express my sincere gratitude to the more than 8000 ResMedians worldwide for their perseverance their hard work and their dedication during these on-going and unprecedented times. Thank you for all that you do. With that, I will hand the call over to Brett and Sydney [ph] and then we will move to open the lines for Q&A. Over to you, Brett. Hey, David, yes, it's Mick here. That's a good question. And, clearly as we in the second half of the year now we're readjusting that expectation for FY 22 now in total to be 200 to 250. You look I'll just be very open, very specifically a contract from 12 months ago with a particular I will not name them. But a particular semiconductor supplier had a very significant double-digit de-commit in these last months, weeks, and there's a commitment from 12 months ago, that had some very strong supply and it went down double-digits. And so with that as a headwind into us all the tail winds of our work, the five projects, five lines of projects going on in our supply chain allowed us to sort of, take two steps forward and two steps back versus two steps forward and one step back. And that didn't allow us to achieve that that extra 100 million of incremental revenue that we thought that we would achieve here through fiscal 22 for the first half. And so that's going to be tougher and as things a little bit further back. Having said that some of these projects coming to market such as the Card-to-cloud AirSense 10 device, where we eliminate that bottleneck or the number one bottleneck, which is the 3G, 4G comms chip. And we allow, the next bottleneck, which is another electronic components to become the one, we can then speed up some production to make up some of that difference. And that's allowed us to achieve the 30% year-on-year growth that we saw in devices in U.S., Canada, and Latin America and the 10% year-on-year growth that we achieved this quarter for Europe, Asia and rest of the world. Look, it's not perfect sailing ahead. When you get de-commits. I'd never heard that word de-commit. We're offering you got a signed contract, you're offering money, very good margins, long term contracts, and people just can't supply. Often force majeure and other aspects coming into play. But I can tell you that all the work that we've been doing these hard works by supply chain have allowed us to actually to achieve these results despite that headwind. We're not planning on giving guidance for FY 23 around this. We are saying that this is what I'll say. What we're doing is going to strive for sequential growth every quarter as we go ahead. So sequential growth from March to June, June to September, September to December throughout this fiscal year. That's what we're going for. And I actually think as you start to look towards the second half of the calendar year, you look at the December quarter, there are a number of other projects that don't involve necessarily the risk of an externality of other de-commit from someone else's enough projects. And enough, I would say, new suppliers, new components, new designs and new engineering reengineering that we're doing around both the hardware and the software to give us a strong confidence in supply of product ahead. So I think that supply chain have done amazingly. And, if you look at what we would have achieved, 14% growth, constant currency year-on-year, yes, we could have, we could have got to 20% or 25%, if we'd had unlimited supply, de-commits, and changes in supply chain in global semiconductor and other electronic components have been a headwind. But I think with all the work we've got, we're going to power through this, we got a strong ship, there are waves ahead, but we're going to power through it stronger than ever. And I think our team has done a great job in the supply that we're going to get throughout this calendar year will be a great opportunity for sequential growth as we go through. Thanks, Gretel. It's a great question. And yes, as you know that I talked about at least 12 to 18 months of a backlog, which is, in many industries you say fantastic to have a backlog, but these are patients waiting therapy and to the specific party a question Gretel, how long will any individual patient wait? It's not like a patient gets a diagnosis, and they have to wait 12 to 18 months. It depends on the geography and the environment. It might be eight days or eight weeks, depending on the geography and our flow of products. But an individual patient is not sitting out there told, Oh, you've got this life threatening disease, we'll take care of you next April. They're being told look, it's going to take for four weeks. And they're not happy with that. I mean, they've been told they suffocate maybe 100 times per night, maybe 50 times per hour, if they've got very severe sleep apnea. And they're suffocating. They want therapy, and so that that pressure is there, and the desire is there. We're watching very carefully. I mean, obviously we're involved in the substitute therapies. We sell a dental divides all across western and northern Europe with a number one provider, with novel our technology. We're not seeing this huge movement over to dental and the 100 muscle nerve stem that we're investing through in Astella [Ph]. We're not seeing a huge movement over to those substitutes. So they're being told by the doctor, it's eight days or it's eight weeks, and they're accepting that and they're sitting there in that pipeline. What I mean by the 12 to 18 month backlog is if you look at the net of the industry, this is building up because the number two player here is out. As they said earlier this week, they said at least through the end of this calendar year. I think they said that only be 90% done with their [Indiscernible] by the end of this calendar year. So that means the rest of us have to step up and ResMed is the number one player and we're stepping up the most and we're stepping up incredibly well. And I think we'll do that through it. But even when they come back online, it's not like the backlog goes away the day they come on. That's there and it's for all of us to drive. I think the share that we've gained is going to be entrenched because of the digital solutions we have and we'll go and gain from there. But the patients are there and I think it's awful that somebody might have to wait four weeks, or eight weeks. I don't want them to wait more than 4 hours to 8 hours. But right in the moment we're in this situation will be that way for a period of time given these unprecedented circumstances. Thanks Lyanne for the question. Yes, as you mentioned, very strong device growth in the U.S., Canada, Latin America, 30%. And very solid growth in devices in Europe, Asia, elsewhere at 10% netting out at 21% cc across that sector. In the math side actually, if you go back to 2019, Lyanne when we were talking about market growth, right, we were talking then about devices, mid-single digits and masks being high single digits, I look at our global mask growth rate at 9% constant currency with the headwind of new diagnoses downward or competitive being out for new patient stops. And the U.S. Canada, Latin America at 7% constant currency as pretty reasonable growth, new patients are down but what we're actually doing there is working with resupply with Brightree resupply, with SNAP technology ReSupply in the U.S. and around the world with some of our models are working with patients directly in markets like Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and our western and northern European teams working with hospitals and care delivery systems to achieve that 13% constant currency growth in Europe, Asia and America. And I think, I'll hand to Jim Hollingshead the President of our global sleep business, but Jim, I think we're actually taking share in some of those categories again in the quarter. Yes, Saul thanks, thanks for the question. And in looking at these estimates started about six months ago. I'll probably get Brett to give a little bit of detail around how we actually came up with the details of the calculations of the 300 to 350 and the 200 and 250. I'll give you the CEOs perspective first, and the CFO will come in and give more quantitative detail in a moment. But the way I looked at it, about six, eight months ago, it was I guess it was June, mid June when the competitor announced this. There were estimates on the sell side from 50 million of incremental revenue for ResMed during the fiscal year, up to 950 million from some of the sell side analysts and we thought that that range is just too broad. We generally don't get guidance we leave that to the job of the very smart people on the sell side and the buy side to do so. But that that variance was too big. And so we said, let's calculate it, let's take our forecast that we had at that time, eight, nine months ago for the fiscal year 22. And then look at what we think we can achieve based upon parts and components we can get into our factories and product we can make to take care of what is a seemingly infinite demand. So we'll just be rate limited on the parts and pieces. And we looked at mostly comms chips and some other electronic components would be rate limiting. And so we said, Okay, let's see how high we can ramp those with our great work from our ops team looking at ResMed 2030, 2035 and a brand new plant in Singapore, we actually weren't limited and aren't limited on manufacturing capacity, it was just about supply. And we estimated 300 million to 350 million in incremental revenue above our forecast growth. We didn't actually give a public number of what our forecast growth was. We just talked about that incremental revenue being there, letting sell side models for their forecast, add on to that in the 300 to 350. We've adjusted that to 200 to 250. So on top of whatever that growth was, we think it'll be 200 to 250. And that's really getting down to these. This last quarter Q4 gives a bit more detail on that. Brett, any further quantitative info, you want to give on that to Saul's question there? Yes Dan, thanks for the question. And yes, you're right. As I said in the prep remarks, we -- was our guiding principle that we take care of the sickest patients first and the highest security devices first. And the Astral is that and so we've done a great job. Our ops team supply chain team manufacturing team has done a great job. We are not supply constrained on that. And we are going head-to-head with the trilogy and Eva. And what I see, as regular leases of recalls and issues with our competitor in that space. And so not just our brand reputation and the amazing technology that's in the Astral, it's incredibly reliable and very high quality. And I believe we've been taking share there for a number of quarters. But Jim, you want to give detail on the Astral and how well that's doing U.S. and rest of the world? That's a great, great, great question. I'll talk a little bit about what our supply chain is doing. I'll hand over to Rob Douglas, our CFO to go through the incredible work that Andrew Price and Linda Laidlaw our President of Global ops and the head of our supply chain are doing there. I can tell you what they're getting me to do. They're getting me to work with the CEOs of these of these companies and their heads of production. And you know, we're working and providing information to show the importance and how these technologies that they're providing and going into lifesaving medical devices. I actually created a video for the investors and the internal employees at one of our major electronic components suppliers to talk to them about how every chip they give us gives the gift of breath to a person who's suffocating and to really get that message through, I mean, I think you know in the huge demand for electric cars and, and cloud connected to consumer devices and an across the board demand is up across industries. And so it can be hard if you're a component maker to differentiate, industry A from B from C and and know where it's going. When they know firstly that we pay high margins that we have long term contracts that we're recession resistant industries we showed through the global financial crisis. And the benefit for employees looking for purpose that, hey, this chip doesn't just go into a car that goes from A to B, or, or give cloud connectivity to a refrigerator. This thing literally keeps someone breathing and allows them and their doctor to see that breath and then improvement of incomes, reduction of costs and reduction in mortality. So getting that message through is really strong. We've been working very strongly since the starting gun sort of went off on this June last year, and we're getting better and better. But across the industry, Rob it's a tough environment for supply. Yes. And in short, our goal will be with all that work that Rob just talked about to make sure we take three steps forward, so that when you do get the two steps back of this and that component, we're still moving forward sequentially every quarter throughout the year, and then really freeing up as Rob said, the long term stuff starts to come into fruition over the next 3, 6, 9 months and beyond. Thanks for the question, Matt. David, it's a great, great question. And it's and it's really complex. And I'll probably hand to Rob to maybe give some of the detail on it. But those five lines of work have multiple projects within each of them. I tried to term like, new parts from new suppliers. That means our R&D team is reengineering, a new part validating, verifying, putting through all the quality tests, we're seeing in our market, how incredibly important that is, and we will not compromise on quality. And then you've got to validate and verify a new supplier and get them through. And so just one of those five lines of work is an incredible amount of work for our quality, regulatory, R&D, engineering, production and manufacturing teams. And so these aren't overnight. It's not like we're just having a cell phone here or a comms chip in a consumer device. This thing a life support then has to be working all day every day. A CPAP has to work every night and we are I think able to with all that work I mean as you saw, we got 200 million, 250 million this just this fiscal year ahead of incredible growth and our supply chain pivoted to all of that. If there hadn't been this competitive recall, we as an industry ResMed would have been absolutely able to do with every single supply chain constraint that had happened throughout this. And that's just speaks to the flex and the ability to go. We have these projects that have been going nine months, I actually think they're doing well. It's hard to say, even if I gave you on each of those five lines of work, the key milestones on it, there are probably five projects within each of those. So its sort of a 5 by 5, 25 point matrix. Rob's looking at this, Jim's looking at this on a daily basis. I get the updates every second or third day. As a CEO, I used to focus all my time just on customers talking to customers talking to health insurers and showing the benefit of our therapy, spending a lot more time with supply chain than I want to but right now, that's where the urgent need is. And for the next, 3, 6, 9, 12 months is where we're going to be focused. But at the same time, we're investing in demand gen. So that as the price starts to come back, and it will, and as a competitor comes back along, we can turn that demand gen back on securing all the share gains we've got through the digital entrenchment, and then drive for future growth. But Rob, how do you summarize all the other work we're doing for David succinctly here? Thanks for the question, Mike. And I'll hand to Jim to walk through some further detail on it. I can tell you look from ResMed, when we really first got into digital health in 2002, we had paging devices on experimental parts of our devices and 2005, we started to with the AirSense launch in 2006, 2007 I had some SD cards that were in those devices. And so we've sort of had this, this world of card-to-cloud at ResMed for well over a decade, 10 years, 15 years that we've had had the ability to do that type of technology. Obviously, with the AirSense 10, we changed the whole market. We did the sort of reverse Amazon play where we said 100% connectivity in the AirSense 10 through the comms chip. And then you take it seamlessly. And it's and it's taken to go there. Look, this is humanitarian emergency right now. We have a competitor out of the market, and there's not enough comms chips to go around the world. And we looked at this and said, well, look, why don't we go to where we were before, which is a great technology of Card-to-cloud. The differentiator for us is AirView that the doctors use, myAir that the patients use and the whole ecosystem of data. And so I think it's far more efficient and appropriate, then it goes straight in a secure end to end encrypted from the device there. But in this time of emergency for a period of time, who longs knows how long it will last, these AirSense 10 Card-to- clouds, a whole lot better patient getting that technology than one of the competitors out there that has some -- solution that may or may not be encrypted, who knows how it works, and the device not might not be as reliable. So the AirSense 10 is the second best device on the market, second only to the AirSense 11. So Card-to-cloud is out there. But Jim, you know, it's early days. How's it going? Thanks for your question, Maggie. I mean, the short answer is yes, absolutely. Through not just the technology, Jim was talking about the essence, Card-to-cloud but all the other projects, Rob's been talking about the 5 by 5 25 plus matrix of incredible projects that are going through are going to free up supply. And sequentially as we go through this year, we're going to get growth and growth and growth. And so, just to be clear, it was on top of, as Brett said, strong sort of 10% forecast growth, we then had, in addition to that 300 million to 350 million of incremental, that incremental was reduced to 200 to 250, as we as we said today, for this fiscal year that we're in. But that incremental growth, those patients will be there. And we will be in the back when we will get to them in fiscal 23 and more as we continue to grow throughout the fiscal year 2023. It's not like this is an overnight success. And one of the 25 projects works tomorrow. We're all perfect. It's incremental, continuous improvement, step by step improvement of an amazing ops and supply chain team, and an amazing sales and delivery team working with customers on this allocation and understanding how to bring that product to market and understanding on the marketing side to just get ready for the demand gen that's going to need to happen to get all the backlog in and new patients in as we go in, throughout fiscal year 23 and beyond. But the short answer is Maggie. Yes, we will get to that increment and more throughout the coming 12, 18 months. Thanks, Suraj. Yes, look, I mean, clearly inflation is high. And as you've seen, that's been hitting, some of our areas of cost. We have some price mitigation on the AirSense 11. And on global surcharge, and some sort of skews across the range to deal with inflation and to share some of the pain of that that we are seeing from our suppliers with the channel. But so that's, that's how we're sort of mitigating the impacts of inflation. Your question about a future recession who knows we haven't a long bull market. One thing I know that ResMed and I was here through I was actually running the global sleep business through '08, '09 and \u201810. And I just taken over it the year before and ResMed is remarkably resistant to that global, that global financial crisis. And in recessionary environment, people may forego that extra Tesla, that extra phone for $2,000, but they will not forego that extra CPAP for $1,000 as much. And so we were very recession resistant through that last global financial crisis had a bull bull run here, globally for 10, 12 years, it is possible. Suraj, you're probably better at predicting the timing, or when a recession may come in the next 12, 24, 36 months, I don't know. But I know that as opposed to other consumer industries and automotive industries and fast moving consumer goods, medtech, and particularly consumer driven medtech, like ResMed and sleep apnea. We've been very recession resistant are a very strong player throughout that and give us a competitive advantage, I think of some of the other players fighting for the dollars available. But look, who knows what the timing of any of that would be. But we've got mitigation plans in for inflation. I think very good experience and capabilities to deal with downturns and or, and or recessions. But thanks for the question Suraj. Well thanks Kevin, for hanging the phone back. And thanks again to all of our shareholders for joining us on this call. I'd like to once again thank the 8000 ResMedians, many of you are also shareholders through our ESPP. So thank you for that for your dedication and your hard work helping people breathe better, sleep better, and live better lives outside the hospital in 140 countries worldwide. Thanks for what you do today and every day. I look forward to talking to you and all of our stakeholders here again in 90 days. Thank you, and we can now close the call."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's my pleasure to turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Kevin, and hi, everyone. Welcome to ResMed\u2019s second quarter of fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call. We thank you for joining us. This call is being webcast live, and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today, along with a copy of the earnings press release and presentation, which are both available now. With me on the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. During the Q&A portion of our call, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Jim Hollingshead, our President-Sleep and Respiratory Care; and David Pendarvis, our Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel. As a reminder, on today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please review the notes in today's earnings press release or the appendix of the earnings presentation. Our discussion today may also include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed\u2019s future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements that are made today. I'll now turn the call over to Mick.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review results for the December quarter, the second quarter of our fiscal year 2022. Our second quarter results continue to demonstrate the strong performance across our business, benefiting from the ongoing extremely high demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices, as well as the steady recovery of markets from the peaks of COVID-19 impacts. We achieved double-digit growth in our business as we navigate three major externalities. On, the recovery of patient flow post the COVID maximum peaks; two, global supply chain constraints, particularly in electronic components; and three, the almost unlimited demand associated with a competitor recall that has actually extended further in terms of volumes of their devices that were impacted and the duration of their repair and replace process. The bottom line is we have at least 12 more months of this incredible demand for ResMed products. I'm very proud of 8,000 ResMedians serving patients in 140 countries worldwide. Our global teams are finding ways to deliver products and solutions to home care providers, physicians and healthcare systems, and ultimately into the hands of patients who need them most. Clearly, the global supply chain environment remains very challenging across multiple industries and we are not immune to its impact. During the quarter, despite growing double-digits year-on-year, we were not able to meet all the demand available in the market. We are being allocated components from our suppliers, particularly electronic components and even more specifically, semiconductor chips. And we are thus being forced to allocate our outbound products to our customers. We have established an allocation process with clear guiding principles that give priority to the production and delivery of devices to meet the needs of the highest acuity patients first. In addition to component supply issues, the ongoing challenges of sea freight and air freight are impacting our ability to respond as rapidly as we would like to the demand for ResMed products. Freight costs are increasing across the board on inbound components from suppliers and on outbound products to our distribution centers and for ultimate delivery to our customers. As a result of these increased costs, we implemented a surcharge on our products starting in January to share some of the burden of these increased costs with customers. Given all the increase in prices from commodities to special \u2013 specialty products across multiple industries around the world, the necessity of this surcharge has been understood and accepted by our customers. We are working closely with our global supply chain partners, doing everything that we can to gain access to additional supply of the critical components that we need to further increase production of our medical devices. We are also re-engineering designs, validating new parts, pieces, suppliers and accelerating new product launch and development to further catch up with the demand. We understand that this is a difficult situation for all of our customers, including physicians, home medical equipment providers, payers, health care systems and the most important customer, the patient. Our number one priority will always be patients, doing our best to help those who suffer from sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and other respiratory chronic diseases, as well as those who benefit from our out-of-hospital health care software solutions. To grow and differentiate our sleep and respiratory care business, we will develop, design and deliver world-leading therapy solutions that can be scaled globally. And we're going to deliver the world's leading out-of-hospital software solutions to empower each person's health care wherever they are. Our goal is to ensure that every person gets the care that they need, where they need it and when they need it. Let me step back to discuss the broad market conditions in our industry. We're seeing steady ongoing recovery of demand across the countries that we operate in. We are still seeing a divergence in the total patient flow from 85% to 100% of pre-COVID levels in most countries, and about 100% of pre-COVID levels in a few locations. These metrics will continue to steadily increase towards pre-COVID levels and beyond as vaccines and boosters roll out globally. Each new COVID variant has an impact. But with the adoption of digital health solutions for screening, diagnosis, and remote patient setup, and remote patient monitoring, as well as established and well-established processes for COVID cleaning protocols at sleep labs, we expect the impact of new variants to diminish in absolute impact each time. Our global ResMed team remains committed to working with national, state, and city governments, as well as local health care systems, hospitals, and health care providers to supply ventilators, masks, and training for acute care, and the important transition home as needed. Given the steadily decreasing severity of each impact on the hospitalizations and severe disease from COVID, the demand for ventilators is now consistent with pre-COVID levels. Let me now update you on our top three strategic priorities. Number one is to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma businesses. Number two is to design, develop, and deliver world leading medical devices, as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally. And number three is to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital, and especially in the home. The US launch of our next generation device platform called AirSense 11 continues to go very well. This new platform has provided much needed additional product supply as we face all-time high demand for ResMed devices. We expect to introduce AirSense 11 platform into additional countries throughout calendar year 2022. In parallel, we will continue to sell our globally available market leading platform the AirSense 10 to maximize the total volume of CPAP, APAP and bilevels [ph] available for sale. In fact, the only product that the AirSense 10 is inferior to is the AirSense 11. As you saw in our results, with double digit growth this quarter, the ongoing adoption of both the AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 platforms remains very, very strong. With the AirSense 11 platform and our digital health technology ecosystem, we are engaging patients in their therapy digitally like never before in the industry. We are also making it easier and more efficient for our customers to manage their patient populations using our full suite of software solutions, including myAir for patients, AirView for physicians and Brightree for home medical equipment providers. When customers use these digital health technology solutions, they have increased efficiencies, lower costs and we achieve improved outcomes for patients and their physicians. We have peer reviewed published evidence showing that combining AirSense platform with myAir software and AirView software, we see over 87% adherence to positive airway pressure therapy. This was in a study with over 85,000 patients. On our latest and greatest platform, AirSense 11, we are driving even higher adoption rates of the myAir than ever before. In fact, we are seeing more than double the uptake of patients signing up to myAir and fully engaging with ResMed software technology. The net result is that this delivers a better patient experience, better efficiency for the homecare providers and more importantly greater long term adherence to therapy. We saw this demonstrated in the Alaska study in partnership with the French healthcare systems where we showed in a study with over 176 patients that those patients who adhered to CPAP therapy had a 39% relative reduction in mortality rates versus control. Demonstrating these types of better patient outcomes and lower costs for the healthcare system at a scale not seen before in the industry are critical components of the ResMed 2025 strategy. Another key aspect of our long-term growth strategy is driving awareness and increasing the flow of patients through the top of the sleep apnea diagnosis funnel. COVID-19 has advanced awareness, adoption and acceptance of respiratory health and respiratory hygiene, but also adoption acceptance of digital health and telehealth tools including home-based sleep apnea tests. Although increasing demand is not as important in the immediate short term giving the ongoing competitor recall, we have a long term focus and we're always focused on that long-term demand gen opportunity. We are innovating with partners and our customers to create an even more efficient and effective approach to sleep apnea patient identification, screening, diagnostics, treatment and management. We will continue to invest in technology that enables an end to end seamless digital experience for patients. As we mentioned in our October call, during the second quarter, we acquired Ectosense, a leading provider of cloud connected home sleep apnea testing technology worldwide. We believe Ectosense\u2019s digital and easy to use solutions in the hands of physicians, sleep lab technicians, as well as consumers can help significantly increase both diagnostic and screening rates can help significantly increase both diagnostic and screening rights as well as general sleep apnea awareness. Let me now turn to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD worldwide and the 330 million patients that suffer from asthma worldwide. Our goal is to reach hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation, as well as newer therapeutic areas, such as cloud connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions from our Propeller technology and high flow therapy offerings, such as our product platform called Lumis HFT. Demand for our core noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions was strong throughout the quarter, especially in markets outside the US where providers shifted focus to support the most severe highest acuity patients. This demand is aligned with the guiding principles of our allocation process, namely, to give the highest priority to manufacturing life support ventilation and noninvasive ventilation devices, including by levels that meet the needs of these highest acuity patients first. Adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe a little over a year ago remains solid, and we continue to expand this technology to regions around the world. AirView for ventilation has provided value by helping physicians and the health care systems they operate in to manage high risk patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. But it is also increasingly being used on an ongoing basis to enhance quality of care through early and proactive intervention at the first sign of respiratory medical issues to help reduce the risk of hospitalization. We see a world where We see a world where AirView ventilation is standard of care for COPD, the way that our core sleep apnea AirView platform is now standard of care for sleep apnea treatment. Let me now review our software as a service business for out-of-hospital care. During the quarter, our SaaS business showed improved sequential growth. We achieved high single digit growth year-on-year across our portfolio of SaaS markets including home medical equipment as well as facilities based and home based care settings. The continued growth of home based care is providing tailwinds for our home medical equipment as well as our home health and hospice products and we continue to grow with customers as they increase their utilization of our software and data solutions to improve and optimize business efficiencies and patient care, including Brightree and SNAP ReSupply. The COVID-19 pandemic has been and remains challenging for some of the verticals in our SaaS business, particularly skilled nursing facilities as the effects of the highly contagious Omicron variant remains a headwind for patient volumes in these settings. We will continue to watch this closely as COVID rates peak and then decline with this latest variant as has happened in many regions around the country and around the world. As COVID restrictions continue to ease and our customers improve their line of sight to better conditions, we expect to see pent-up demand for technology investments, which provides opportunities for us to sell more and more services and solutions to existing customers, as well as to increase our new customer pipeline. As we look at our portfolio of solutions across care settings, we expect our SaaS group revenue to growth to accelerate, achieving sustainable high single digit growth as we exit this fiscal year. As always, our growth, our goal is to meet or beat that market growth rate as we continue to innovate and continue to take market share from competitors. We are the leading strategic provider of SaaS solutions for out-of-hospital care and we provide mission critical software across a broad set of very attractive markets. Our latest and greatest SaaS solutions address the number one issue reported across our customer base which is staffing challenges. Our SaaS customers expect this problem to persist and they recognize the need for technology solutions to help solve their challenges with efficiency and scale and our software services and solutions help them achieve both of these outcomes. We are well-positioned and we have created differentiated value for our customers and for ResMed within our SaaS business. Looking at the broader portfolio of ResMed's businesses across sleep and respiratory care, as well as our SaaS solutions, we remain confident in our long term strategy and our pipeline of innovative solutions. Our sleep and respiratory care solutions treat the most prevalent and highest cost chronic conditions and our SaaS solutions support the care settings where people face these and other chronic conditions. With this combination, we can fundamentally transform out of hospital healthcare at a scale that no other company can match. And we have set up for sustainable growth through ongoing investments in R&D to the tune of 7% of our revenues, commercial excellence in partnerships with CVS verily and beyond, as well as future acceleration through strategic M&A as well as tuck-in M&A as we move forward. Our patient centric \u2212 physician centric and provider centric approach combined with our unique ResMed culture means that we are positioned to continue winning in the vastly underserved medical markets of sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and beyond. We are transforming out-of-hospital healthcare at scale, leading the market in digital health technology with over 10.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 16 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are unlocking value by using de-identified data to help patients, providers, physicians, payers, and entire health care systems. We have invested in the privacy, cloud operations and AI and ML-driven data or analytics capabilities to do this at a scale that is unmatched by competitors, and we are increasing our lead every day. Our mission to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025 drives and motivates ResMedians every day. We again made excellent progress toward that inspiring goal during this last quarter. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude to more than 8,000 residents for their perseverance, hard work, and dedication during these ongoing, unprecedented times. Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we will move to the group for Q&A. Brett, over to you.\nBrett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, unless noted, all comparisons out of the prior year quarter. We're pleased with our financial performance in Q2, despite the headwinds we faced as a result of significant ongoing supply chain constraints and the challenging freight environment. Group revenue for the December quarter was $895 million, an increase of 12%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 13%. Revenue growth reflects increased demand for our sleep and rest free care products across our portfolio, driven by recovering market conditions and by increased device demand in response to the ongoing product recall by one of our competitors. In the December quarter, we recorded immaterial incremental revenue from our COVID-19 related demand, consistent with revenue from our COVID-19-related demand, consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we expect negligible revenue from COVID-19-related demand. However, we will continue to estimate it for you as appropriate. In relation to the impact of our competitor\u2019s recall, we estimate that we generated incremental device revenue in the range of $45 million to $55 million in the December quarter. For the first half of our FY 2022, this reflects incremental revenue in the range of $125 million to $145 million. We continue to expect component supply constraints will limit the total incremental device revenue opportunity to somewhere between $300 million and $350 million for the full fiscal year 2022. As we shared last quarter, we expect our fiscal third quarter to remain supply constrained, similar to our fiscal second quarter, therefore limiting incremental revenue during the third quarter. We see supply challenges to some extent easing in our fiscal fourth quarter and into fiscal year 2023. Looking at geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our software-as-a-service business, sales in the US, Canada and Latin America countries increased by 14%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 12% in constant currency terms. By products segment, globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 16%, while masks and other sales increased by 10%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the US, Canada and Latin America increased by 19% as we benefited from incremental revenue due to a competitor's recall and favorable product mix as we sold an increased proportion of higher acuity devices. This is consistent with our guiding principles for product allocation, namely that we are giving priority to the production and delivery of our devices to meet the needs of the highest acuity patients first. Mask and other sales increased by 9%, Masks and other sales increased by 9%,, reflecting solid resupply revenue and achieved despite the challenging device supply environment, which continues to limit new patient set ups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales increased by 13% in constant currency terms, again reflecting the benefit from incremental revenue due to a competitive recall. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets benefited from improved patient flow relative to the prior year and increased by 11% in constant currency terms. Overall, our Asian operations in particular delivered a strong quarter. Software-as-a-service revenue increased by 8% in the December quarter. We saw strong performance of the HME segment as customers continue to utilize our SaaS solutions to streamline and more efficiently run their businesses. And we are seeing some stability in the skilled nursing care segment as it continues to emerge from the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the second half of fiscal year 2022, we expect to continue to benefit from our competitors\u2019 inability to supply new patients and from the global fleet markets general recovery from COVID-19 impacts. However, as we have said in the last few quarters, while we are working hard to increase device output, we will not be able to meet all expected demand resulting from our competitors\u2019 recall, primarily because of significant and ongoing supply constraints for electronic components. We are operating a very dynamic supply chain environment. As I stated earlier, we continue to expect component supply constraints will limit the incremental device revenue resulting from our competitors recall to somewhere between $300 million and $350 million for fiscal year 2022. This includes the device revenue we were able to generate in the first half of fiscal year 2022. We expect Q3 to remain challenging but Q4 to be better. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin declined by 230 basis points to 57.6% in the December quarter. The decrease is predominantly attributable to higher freight, component, and manufacturing costs and unfavorable currency movements, partially offset by a positive product mix, particularly in relation to strong growth of our higher acuity devices. Moving on to operating expenses, during Q2, we maintained a disciplined approach in our ongoing spend to support our operations. But we are seeing a more normalized expenditure profile as COVID-19 impacts subside. SG&A expenses for the second quarter increased by 9% or, in constant currency terms, increased by 10%. The increase was predominantly attributable to an increase in employee-related expenses. Importantly, SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue improved to 20.7% compared to 21.2% in the prior-year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the second half of FY 2022. R&D expenses for the quarter increased 14% on both a headline and a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue of 7% compared to 6.9% in the prior-year quarter. We continue to make significant investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product, and solutions development will deliver sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward and subject currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of 7% for the second half of FY 2022. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter increased by 5%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by the contraction of our gross margin. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 15% while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.6% compared to the prior year quarter of 15.2%. The relatively low tax rate in Q2 in both the current quarter and prior year quarter reflects a favorable tax benefit associated with employee equity vesting that typically occurs in the second quarter. Looking forward, we estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2022 will be in the range of 19% to 20%. Our non-GAAP net income for the quarter increased by 5% and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter increased by 4%. Now cash flow from operations for the quarter was $220 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by higher working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $13 million, depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $41 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends to shareholders totaling $61 million. We recorded equity losses of $1.9 million in our income statement in the December quarter associated with the premise on joint venture with Verily. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $2 million per quarter through the balance of fiscal year 2022 associated with the joint venture operation. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $109.4 million. At December 31, we had $680 million gross debt and $496 million net debt. Our debt levels remain modest and at December 31, we had approximately $1.6 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, reflecting the board's confidence in our operating performance. As our cash flow and low leverage provide flexibility in how we allocate capital going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest for growth through R&D. We also expect to continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions, such as Citus Health and Ectosense, an acquisition we completed on October 1. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Brett, and thanks, Mick. Kevin, let's go ahead and now turn the call over to you to provide instructions and then run the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nChris Cooper: Afternoon. Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Mick, can you just remind us, please, of the specific measures you're employing to mitigate the component supplier challenges? And I guess where you're seeing more and less success.\nMick Farrell: Yeah. Chris, thanks. It's a very pertinent question, obviously, and we're pursuing multiple paths, as I outlined in the prep remarks we're focusing on \u2013 the first thing we're doing is going to our existing suppliers and existing supply chains and really imploring them to prioritize medical devices over the other aspects. They have choices to give to electric cars, cellular phones, consumer devices and medical devices. And we are working with them directly on that. We're seeing some benefit on that, certainly at the level of maintaining the sort of double-digit growth that you saw during this quarter. In addition to that, we are redesigning parts and pieces and components within our existing platforms, and we're bringing new platforms to market faster. So we're working on our Air 10 designs and Air 11 designs. We're also re-engineering our supply chains to validate and verify new suppliers to be able to get there. And so that whole combination gives us a lot more confidence that as we look to March quarter to get better than December but then June quarter to get significantly better than March. And then as we go through September and December of this calendar year, we really start to free up a lot of those projects come into play and we're seeing a lot of confidence with them. But you know, over that portfolio, Rob, do you have any more information to provide maybe Chris, around what we're doing with supply chain and parts?\nRob Douglas: Maybe only also, Chris, this has sort of been going on for a year now and we knew these shortages were going to be coming. So our teams have been working on all those activities that Nick's been talking about throughout the year, starting to bear fruit. It does take time and that's why we're talking about sort of, you know, things don't fix immediately. We're talking about its continuing to be challenging for this coming quarter and starting to see improvement further out. That said, you know, it's a very dynamic situation and things do change on a weekly basis and so our teams have to be extremely agile and we've got \u2212 we're actually putting a lot of resources into it, got a really strong team of engineers and commercial relationship people with the suppliers and our product teams are all really focused on this as we work through these challenging times.\nChris Cooper: So can, I mean, relative to the update you were providing in the last quarter results in October. Are you now more or less confident that the deficits that you're currently seeing in components can be addressed by the fourth quarter?\nMick Farrell: Yeah, it's a good question, Chris. I'm actually precisely where I was in October that, you know, I think we said in October it's going to be tough in December, it's going to be tough in March and really start to open up in June and then as we go out throughout the calendar year. So, I stand by that and I stand as Brett said earlier, looking at fiscal 2022 the $300 million to $350 million of incremental product. Look at the December quarter, 16% growth year-on-year in devices amongst a global supply chain crisis, COVID-19 recovery, all the challenges that are here. That\u2019s really strong. But we\u2019re going to get stronger than that as we go throughout the fiscal and as we go throughout the calendar year. This seemingly infinite demand is going to be with us for the whole of this calendar year and potentially beyond that. And so we \u2013 all the projects that Rob talked about, if the starting gun went off sort of June 14, when the competitor put this recall notice in field safety, notices globally out, our team have done a pretty darn good job getting to 16% year-on-year in this crisis on the December quarter. I think it will get \u2013 as I said in October, I think it will get better in March and then December and significantly better in June and then really start to free up as we hit September and December. And with almost infinite demand, you never quite catch up to that. But we're going to get faster and faster and grow more year-on-year as we go throughout the calendar year.\nChris Cooper: Thanks very much.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST Marquee. Your line is now live.\nDan Hurren: Good morning, everyone. Thanks very much. Mick, you mentioned that ventilation demand is back at pre-COVID levels, but I presume you're talking about the hospital events or hospital patients. So, I was hoping you can give us some color detail on ventilation into the home healthcare market and specifically how the Astral product has performed whilst the explosion of rains [ph] over the last couple of quarters.\nMick Farrell: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Dan. I'll have a first stab at it and then hand to Jim Hollingshead, who's our President of Sleep and Respiratory Care. Yeah. So what I\u2019ve said in the prep remarks is that what we're seeing is that the demand for ventilators is really around that COPD neuromuscular disease, respiratory insufficiency markets are where they were pre-COVID-19 pandemic. So that we're seeing that flow of sick patients finding their way through digital health solutions, telehealth monitoring, digital work with their pulmonary and/or COVID cleaning particles in labs for their pulmonary physicians. We\u2019re getting the prescription for those products. The vast majority of our revenues, 90-plus percent globally on respiratory care are out-of-hospital respiratory care. So even Astral and Astellas and WSTs [ph], FTAs, FTs and AFEs, they\u2019re used for ventilation outside the hospital. So those seem to be back in terms of patient flow. Jim, any further color to provide Dan on that?\nJim Hollingshead: Yeah. The only thing I would add to what Nick said is that our Astrals product is performing really well in the market. It's got very sophisticated algorithms that can treat a wide range of patients, and demand for it has been really strong. And so, in general, the Astrals have been very well accepted and some of the algorithms we've added over the last several months have driven demand upward. It's also benefiting from the for what is for us to tailwind from the Philips recall. And so, there's a bit of incremental demand for Astral in that context as well.\nDan Hurren: Thanks a lot. Thank you.\nOperator: Guys, your next question is coming from Sean Gorman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nSean Laaman: Dave Pendarvis, do you have any to \u2013 Good morning, Mick and team. Hope you're all right. Well, Mick, I'm hoping we could get an update on the new RTM cuts from CMS and how that might be influencing our Propeller.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Sean. It's a great question, and as you know, Propeller technology is for those who may not know a cloud connected pharmaceutical delivery product for both COPD and asthma, and a lot of those are in pilot stage and the partnerships with governments in Europe and private payers in the United States. And so, we are \u2013 do have some commercial models going. They're not material to the global business, but, Dave Pendarvis, do you have any data about RTM codes that we've got through reimbursement and any impacts on those for Propeller and across the business?\nRob Douglas: Yeah. Well, generally, we're happy to see coding and reimbursement flow towards more remote monitoring type activity. That's a positive. At the same time, Propeller is working both to have physician adoption of those codes, and we're working to see the funding come through with that, and nothing changes quickly in terms of medical practice and Propeller is also working with health care systems and other system-wide bases to try to adopt to Propeller system. So, I'd say we're encouraging, but it's still a little early in the day for us to say we're seeing material uptake for Propeller as a result. But certainly, it improves the operating conditions. And we think this is a long-term trend that will benefit Propeller as well as the rest of the business and its remote patient monitoring in the long run.\nMick Farrell: Yeah.\nSean Laaman: Thanks, Dave. Thanks, Mick.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Your line is now live.\nMatthew Mishan: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. You saw a sequential improvement quarter over quarter in US masks. Can you give us a sense of what the drivers of that are and whether or not you expect continued sequential improvement moving forward?\nMick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Matt. And it's great to see US, Canada, Latin America, or the strong 9% constant currency growth on masks and Europe, Asia, rest of world at 11% year on year with a strong double-digit 10% growth. Well, one and as you said, that is up from last year. Look, I think I'll start in maybe hand to Jim for some more color. But at the broad level, COVID-19 has shown the importance of respiratory health and respiratory hygiene. And we said this in 2020 when we saw that sort of uptick of the growth of our masks and accessories business. And we just launched Snap and we have rightly resupply and a lot of people thought, well, this is the second was step up, it's just up. While people like, there were people with stockholdings and some commodity products. This is a stockholding issue. We said, no, this is sustainable. We\u2019re talking to patients. We\u2019re doing the net promoter score. We\u2019re analyzing data consumers want and always wanted to more health care. They've now seen the reason for respiratory health and respiratory hygiene. We\u2019re now two years into this and we are seeing sustained growth at the patient level demand for respiratory health, respiratory hygiene. We're adding to that the technology from SNAP, technology from Brightree but in other parts of the world with those technologies aren't there, we're partnering with our home care providers with patients directly and beyond to encourage and make that happen. But Jim, any further color on the sustainability of this, this strong margin?\nJim Hollingshead: I think the mix just listed a couple of tailwinds are related to, I do think patients have changed their behavior in the context of COVID and are much more keen to get clean, refreshed consumables and their experience. And I think our customers worldwide have gotten better at providing that and the US market in particular, there's a very strong push on resupply and has been for months. And so that's, that's a tailwind. There's always a Q2 cyclicality tailwind because of deductibles. So that's a normal cyclical thing but the other thing I think is really important to point out is that our mask portfolio is performing really, really well. We have the \u2013 we do have the widest range of masks available to fit really almost any patient experience. We continue to take share, I think, which is a really important dynamic for us. So not massive shocking movement but incrementally, we continue to take a bit of share over the last two or three quarters, we've taken, we've taken sequential share and so that's been really good. The only headwind on mask is the filter recall, because the filter recall is dampening new patient starts. And so that's, that's a tiny headwind against four or five tailwinds that we've just listed and we feel really confident about our mask portfolio going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Craig Wong-Pan from Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is now live.\nCraig Wong-Pan: Thanks. Just a question on US device sales. I was wondering if you could provide any comments on the split there between AirSense 11 and AirSense 10 and how that kind of proportion of sales between the two might compare to the first quarter?\nMick Farrell: Craig, it's a pertinent question but it's one we don't feel comfortable going into the details of. What I can tell you as an equal one personal user of this AirSense 11 platform is that the delivery is smaller, quieter, more comfortable, more connected. My wife actually asked me if it was on when I turned it on, it is that much smaller, quieter and better than our last generation already the leading platform. So, what I can tell you is it is taking off every single AirSense 11 we can make is sold that day. It comes out of the factory, it's already pre-sold and they are moving fast. And so it is increasing as a portion of our US sales. For competitive reasons we're not going to split out how quickly that S curve is coming up. But the points I made in the prep remarks are really strong. The AirSense 10 on its own is the second best product in the market after only the AirSense 11. So it is already there and every AirSense 10 we can get component for and then put through the production line get sold as well. So we\u2019re selling both in parallel and customers are demanding both and we'll take both over any of the competition. And so we're driving those out there. We're driving great growth of both and we will do throughout all calendar year 2022 as Philips recall will last at least that long in their update just this week. And so, you know, 90 days ago it was 12 months ending in September. We were ready for that scenario. They'll come back in September and get our great mask uptake as Jim was saying earlier. We're now ready for their new scenario which is December and we're ready to expand our components and our share on the device side and driving as much as that demand as is possible. So, we're ready for all the scenarios of all the above. But yeah, we're not going for all the scenarios that will be involved. But, yeah, we\u2019re not going to break down the exact AirSense 11 versus AirSense 10. I can tell you it\u2019s growing extraordinarily fast. The S-curve uptake is great, and patients are loving it. So, throughout calendar year, we will introduce it to other countries around the world, and we expect the same sort of level of uptake in those other countries.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Andrew Paine from CLSA. Your line is now live.\nAndrew Paine: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanting to get a bit more clarity on your ability to reengineer parts and redesign elements in your devices. How is that going to be achieved, and does this mean you won't be as exposed to chip shortages from 4Q and onwards? And when do you think these changes will allow you to be running at full capacity and, in essence, meeting current demand?\nMick Farrell: Yeah, Andrew, great three-part question. I'll start with it, and then maybe, Rob, you can cover anything I missed of Andrew's components there. But, look, yeah, the starting gun went on this project in April when they said there was a quality issue, June when they said there was a recall. We were already ready for the supply chain shortages that COVID-19 would drive, and if this recall from our competitor hadn't happened, we would be able to meet all the existing demand. As you saw, we grew 16% year-on-year in this quarter, and that would have been great growth, taking some good share in the core competitive market. But with that starting gun going off in June, we did start those reengineering projects. We said, look, we are not going to be able to just go back and ask for more supply. We know the supply chain constraints. We know the automotive industry, cellular comms, and others are all screaming for more products, too. And so we started those reengineering of components and parts. We started also reengineering these Six Sigma Black Belts, looking at our supply chain and analyzing different suppliers and revalidating and assuring that we could get them there. And so there's a bunch of projects going on. I run out of fingers looking at them. But when I look at that portfolio, it gives me strong confidence to say, we saw some good \u2013 some of them come to fruition in December some more in March. But in the June quarter, I think a bunch of these projects will free up supply and then you hit September and December and the portfolio projects that are going to get to market in terms of the new supply, a new piece and new redesign will get there. And that's what gives us that confidence in that, that recovery and the amount of share we're going to take through 2022. Rob, what did I miss there? Maybe just going to some of the sort of the reengineering processes. As you know these \u2013 Andrew, these products have hundreds of components in them. And if you're missing one, you can't build any of the products. So you'll actually see us as we build buffers around all of this, we will see our inventory levels of materials go up as we build buffers of these alternatives. Now some of the components they're easy to have as alternatives. You've got to revalidate them. And in the medical device world, you've got to have very rigorous revalidation alternate components. And that's often a lot of the engineering work. But some of the other components like the microcontrollers and things like that, they are a lot more complex. They interact with the embedded software on the systems, all of that type of thing, the design and validation processes for those are more complex and do take more time. We've got projects across all of those areas going on there. And as we make these alternatives, then we're scheduling, the longer term commitments, the relationships with the suppliers, building the inventories and making sure we have options. That said, keep coming back to the sector is a very variable situation. And just when you think you've got everything right, then you start seeing the other components be challenges. So I think as I said earlier, you have to be really agile and keep competing on \u2013 keep running really fast to track these issues.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Deakin-Bell from Citigroup. Your line is now live.\nJohn Deakin-Bell: Thank you. I'm just trying to get a bit more color around the underlying the underlying new patients, maybe between US and the rest of the world. And just give us a sense of where you think we\u2019re at in different markets and perhaps some \u2013 since when you think it might get back to the patient growth during the 2019?\nMick Farrell: Yeah, John it's a very complex question because as you know, we operate in 140 countries and all the different Greek letter variants of COVID flow through those 140 countries at different rates. One great thing because we have strong visibility and awareness into this as we talk to the pulmonary and critical care physicians and we watch hospitalization rates and ventilation usage rates and ICU usage rates as each variant seems to be \u2013 although more and more communicable less and less severe and the impact in terms of hospitalizations, severe need for ventilatory help and death. And so the work that we did in 2020 and 2021 establishing these digital protocols, home sleep apnea, testing protocols that pulmonary doctors who previously hadn't done telehealth visits are now doing them. Doctors who weren't embracing ApneaLink Air or some of the NOX digital diagnostics components have embraced them throughout 2020 out of necessity and then 2021 out of scale. So as we enter 2022 here, we're feeling very comfortable across those 140 countries. I gave you in prep remarks the sort of wide band, right? 85% to 100% of pre-COVID patient flow, depending on the country, the city, the location. There are some as I said in the prep remarks, there are some locations that are above 100%. And I won't go into detail -- North Rhine-Westphalia this quarter of Bavaria, Southern France, Southeast of the US this quarter, what we're seeing is as variants come down, those protocols go. We're hitting those \u2013 if you take 2019 as the base year, we're hitting those 100% triple digit rates in some locations. And so gives us a lot of confidence because we\u2019re \u2013 the beauty of, the beauty is we're in all 140 countries. So that portfolio, I feel every 90 days, we\u2019re seeing positive movement. Even though a particular location might go back two steps and one might go forward three steps, on aggregate, we\u2019re seeing sort of one step forward for ResMed as we look across that portfolio every 90 days. That's why we're able to see this great, strong 16% device growth across our region. It's not only share-taking. There's some good flow of patients coming through. What worries me a little bit, John, is actually some of the backlog that might be happening in the system due to our competitor just not being in the market for 18 months, right? In aggregate, according to their call this week, it would be 18 months from June 2021 through to December 2022. That backlog of patients, we can't get them all, right? We're ramping up, as Rob said, doing everything we can to ramp up. We're not going to get them all. And so that backlog of patients, even when our competitor comes back, is going to have to flow through the system. So this is not just an effect that's over the day our competitor is back. There's going to be a number of quarters where ResMed is going to grow, take share, and deal with this flow of patients through there. So although we're pushing very strong around our long-term demand gen, we're not turning up the dials yet on driving the top of the funnel because, frankly, the top of the funnel is full and growing and will do for the next 12 months.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Gretel Janu from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.\nGretel Janu: Thanks. Good morning, all. More of a medium-term question, Mick. So as the industry isn't able to meet the demands of new patients at the moment, what are you doing to ensure that patients don't fall off the waiting list? And I guess do you see any risk here that the industry will see slower growth in the medium term from all the disruption over this 12-, 24-month period? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Gretel. I'll have a first go at it and hand to Jim. I mean, the short answer to your question is absolutely not. I do not see any growth slowing down. In fact, the backlog, certainly for ResMed, I see incredible growth coming for our industry. And a lot of the demand gen stuff I talked about, and we talked about on our Investor Day with CVS partnerships on the brick and mortar side in the front line. And then on our Verily partnership premised, on the front line, we are not turning the dollars on that demand gen up and we don't need to through 2022. But we will start to put on the map in 2023. And I think what we'll see is the backlog will come in \u2013 and our demand gen will come in and we'll actually post-COVID see a faster growth rate of our industry because of all the learnings of digital health, home sleep apnea testing, seamless and digital end to end journeys for patients. It's got better for patients when they get into the system. The trouble is now competitor can't provide the therapy at the end and that does create a bit of a backlog. But I think on the other side of this, we'll actually see increased secular growth. That mid to high single digit growth for our industry might move up 50 basis points, 100 even more basis points because of the embracement of digital net net. But Jim, anything to go to Gretel\u2019s question around industry growth there?\nJim Hollingshead: Yeah, Gretel, I guess I would, I would just add a couple of things. The first one is we're working really hard with our channel partners to understand the dynamic of patient wait lists and working really hard with physicians on that. And so, we\u2019re \u2013 as you know we're prioritizing higher acuity patients, higher acuity conditions with our with our production. But we know that there are kind of straight OSA patients out there, they're facing longer waitlists and we're working with our customers to try to reduce those wait times and to better manage an understanding of when we can deliver product to which customers are so. So that's just sort of a general thing we're trying to do. I think the other thing that will help us to drive growth on an ongoing basis is we're working right now on programs that will allow us to capture patients who may be faced a long waitlist. And I don't want to go to great detail on that but our marketing teams in our main countries are working on those programs right now. And as we have more supply, we feel pretty confident we'll be able to run programs that will be able to reengage patients that maybe have, they're tired of waiting or something like that. So we think we'll be able to capture a big, big part of that backlog, which there is a backlog and we think there'll be an even bigger backlog, which I \u2013 if there is a backlog and we think there'll be an even bigger backlog as that goes forward. And the last thing I would add is, we're pretty active in developing new channels. And so, those are those are new and growing areas for us. But if you think about something like CVS Health hubs, there's a new channel that that continues to grow, CVS continues to invest there. That's a new way for patients to be reminded that they were diagnosed with OSA or to be reminded that they might need resupply. And CBS is just one example where we're working in new channels. We're doing that not just in the US, but in multiple markets around the world. So we're going to expand the ability to reach of different channels for patients to get treated. And we'll be \u2013 we're accelerating those now. We'll be accelerating those programs even more as production comes up to higher volumes and we're able to treat more patients.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey Capital. Your line is now live.\nSaul Hadassin: Good morning and good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just maybe one for Rob. Rob, just on the discussion around semiconductors and the shortages, can you talk to us about the line of sight you get as it relates to the inflow of those chips and then the manufacturability? In other words, is it still taking circa three months to process devices? And so, are you in a position now to know what your volume on flow generators is looking like into fourth quarter because you have these chips either sitting with you now or they're due to come in over the next few weeks? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Yeah. Actually, as I was saying earlier, we've actually had to greatly extend our forecast lead times for it to get the supply commitments that we want, actually multi-year. So at that level, we have a long, long view. The year \u2013 our cycle times are actually pretty short. The longest part of our cycle time and variable part of it is freight. And so, a lot of the challenges of forecasting sales on a weekly basis is what's happening to any freight that's stuck off Los Angeles or something like that. Now, we can mitigate that at a cost with air freight, and we do that, but we certainly can't do a 100% on freight. And so we're trying to balance up those sort of freight demands and that does create a variability. So the hardest thing for predicting what's going to \u2013 what we're forecasting over the next couple of weeks is actually those freight deliveries. Our internal systems around delivering them out of our warehouses are extremely slick and really run well, and we've got great teams in those warehouses. Our factory capacity, we typically run a policy of having significant burst capacity in these factories. And as we've said before, we\u2019ve just invested in a major new factory in Tuas in Singapore. We're \u2013 out of that factory, we would normally have the capacity to meet all of the industry demand. So we can actually push stuff through that system really quickly. The key issue is that variability and the propensity of the suppliers to meet their commitments. Now, they'll do everything they can to meet their commitments. But actually, some of those freight issues, they have the same issues. They have the same issues of allocation from their suppliers. And so we have to manage all the way through all of those layers to get there. So it's a long answer. But really, the main factor is the suppliers and the short-term variability of freight.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nLyanne Harrison: Yeah. Good morning, all. I guess you\u2019ve spoken about volume in detail, but can we talk about price and provide some color on the trends you're seeing in average device prices this quarter and perhaps with some reference to mix and discounting, if you can.\nMick Farrell: Yeah. Thanks, Lyanne. It's a good question. And traditionally we don't talk much about price at all. But one thing I will say is that we announced it in our prep remarks \u2013 my prep remarks here today that we have a surcharge now on all ResMed devices. There are such as with exactly with the last question from Sol [ph] where Rob was showing that increased air freight and sea freight costs of 5X or 10X what they were, air freight was always a significant factor of above sea freight and it's got more expensive too and so all of that has meant that we had to provide that surcharge to our patients. So we haven't done a price increase as some of our competitors have to the customers but we have put a \u2212 we have put a surcharge on devices starting in January. Our customers have accepted it. I mean, you know, the people running these companies go to a supermarket and see the price of milk or the price of whatever commodities that they're purchasing in their daily lives going up in price. And so a surcharge from us given the nature of this has made sense to them. And so, you know, your question was what's the levels of price discounting? There is no product discounting right now. In fact, we're taking away some of the early pay and some of the other factors that were there that were non price related but the impact is sort of cash flow there because it's very important in an environment like this to make sure that the costs are shared in a fair and equal way through the supply chain and we're doing that through a surcharge. But as I see it, you know, the mix side, the second part of your question. We're following our guiding principle on allocation here. If we have limited chips and parts and pieces, we will make an Astral before [ph] before an echo of STA and ST and ASP and so on down to an APAP and CPAP. And so the mix, you know, can lead to some sort of ASP mix increases on that but any individual like-for-like product we\u2019re keeping the prices where they are because we're in a steady, reimbursed environment, our customers we have relationships going back decades. We want them for decades for the future and we really value those relationships. And so we're really focused on this sort of temporary surcharges is going to be associated with those increased costs we have and any impact on ASP is really around mix towards those higher acuity products.\nOperator: Thank you. Our question today is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden Australia. Your line is now live.\nSteve Wheen: Yeah. Thanks very much. I've got a somewhat related question for Brett just with regards to the gross margin. So I was just wondering if you could help us sort of break into that number a little bit particularly from the point of view of the next few quarters. So I'm trying to put into context the surcharge as to what sort of effect that will have. And then there's obviously other drivers which all look quite positive like FX mix, maybe the [indiscernible] pricing. So if you could sort of maybe comment on any of that. And then lastly, maybe a headwind, is there any pricing pressure coming from the semiconductors suppliers to you guys ? So yeah, if you could help me unpackage that gross margin that would be great.\nMick Farrell: Yeah. Thanks. Steve. Now, let me try to unpack that a little bit here. On the gross margin, if you look at it year-on-year-year, pretty big decline and really freight was the big one and logistics costs. Some component cost increases coming in and also manufacturing because they really had to optimize on the manufacturing front. At the moment, we were just trying to make sure we can really maximize output rather than efficiencies. So that's playing out that played out year-on-year-year. If you look at it sequentially, not in quite good shape, a little bit of an increase there sequentially actually. If you go forward, we're still going to have freight and logistics costs coming through. I mean, that's still going to be, I think, a headwind for I think for the rest of this calendar. FX probably relatively neutral as we look forward and I think ASP declines won't \u2013we've typically had that but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see that going forward. We have the surcharge. It\u2019s only a small surcharge. And we're only \u2013 we're not recovering anywhere near our increasing cost there but we're \u2013 as Mick said we're looking to share that. So they're kind of \u2013 they're still with us. There are some headwinds there. We've got AirSense11 coming through, which is at a price premium but that's only in the US market at the moment. But taking the medium term view, that'll be supportive. But the other one to call out is as particularly in Q4, as we increase the output or the volumes from the supply constraints easing and we'll have higher revenue there. But in a relative sense, it'll be more of the kind of lower acuity in terms of that mix. So that one will be a little bit of a headwind, so the product mix won't be as beneficial as it has been. So there\u2019s puts and takes there. But that's how kind of how see it at the moment.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Bailey from Macquarie. Your line is live.\nDavid Bailey: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Mick and Brett. You sort of touched on this in part of your earlier remarks. But I just wanted to confirm that you're confident that some of the changes in relation to digital initiatives over the past couple of years will allow the system to deal with the backlog of new patients over the medium term.\nMick Farrell: Yes, David. It\u2019s a really pertinent question. And I feel very confident. And we've watched it. Before this recall was announced, through to June 2021, we saw great adoption for 18 months of all the digital solutions from doctors getting involved in telehealth to the adoption of identification, engagement, enrollment and diagnostic systems on a digital basis. In countries where, like in Germany, where it would obviously be interesting was less than 10% of the total diagnoses in 2019. It went to huge double digits throughout 2020 10% of the total diagnosis in 2019, it went to huge double digits throughout 2020, and it stayed quite high despite the reopening with COVID-cleaning particles of sleep labs throughout Germany. And so, I think as you look an aggregate, David, that adoption that happened in the last two years will be a huge impact, permanent adoption of digital health screening tools. And as Jim said, as we open up new channels, we're going to roll that digital end-to-end solution through multiple new funnels to get patients into the funnel through the early partnership with Prim [ph] through our CVS partnership. And they're the two public ones in the US, but we're doing, as Jim said, stuff in the other 140 countries that are more a partnership basis partnership basis with the UK government, with the NHS. Some great information from our UK team I was looking at over the last week, incredible work in our Northern Europe team. Our Western European team, the partnership with the French government. I talked about the ALASKA study that's just the peer reviewed, published evidence that's out there. We're doing stuff on the ground that we're not talking about publicly, but it has incredible adoption of digital health technologies in conjunction with the French Social Security system, supporting that through high reimbursement of cloud connected CPaaP versus non-cloud connected CPaaP. Because they see the results, they see high adherence, they see better outcomes, they see lower costs, not only death rate, lower death rate of those we'll see proper but lower hospitalization, so it saves lives and saves money. So, David, it's a permanent adoption. I think it will improve our efficiency as an industry, as we get into 2022, 2023 here and beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is now live.\nMargaret Kaczor: Hey. Good afternoon, and good morning to you, sir. I wanted to follow up a little bit on some of the math that you guys had implied from the benefit of the competitive recall. And if we sort of keep the fiscal Q3 benefits similar to what we saw in fiscal Q2, maybe pick it up a little bit, the fiscal Q4 benefit sounds the fiscal Q4 benefit sounds like it's going to be, $130 million, $140 million or so at the midpoint of your range. So as we think about that with Philips extending the timing of the impact of the recall, should we be using that $140 million as a base benefit as we go into the second half of the calendar year, especially given that it sounds like even at that range, the demand maybe isn't fully satisfied. And so, theoretically go higher especially with the underlying market improvements.\nMick Farrell: Yeah, Margaret it's a great question and I'm not going to get into sort of the detailed breakdown of the $350 million through the fiscal year. But as you said, look at it is, back end loaded in terms of Q4 is going to be the lion's share of that, of that because all the projects that Rob talked about earlier will come to fruition in June, September and December. And so the only guidance I think I've given in the last nine years as CEO was around this $350 million on the revenue side there for fiscal 2022. So I'm not going to go into 2023. We did that because the models were quite wide there on the benefit from this recall on the sell side for as low as $50 million to as high as $950 million. So we wanted to right set it at $300 million to $350 million. We're still comfortable with that for fiscal 2022. But as you look for fiscal 2023, look, I do think that the share that we're taking this year will be long term sustainable share. When we go in and take share, we don't just go into a competitive account and say, great, here's your product, good. We work with people who are adopting existing relationships with people who are adopting Maya for their patients, getting that 60%, 70% uptake that we've seen with AirSense 11. They're working with AirView. All their physicians are on the cloud platform, getting that efficiency. They\u2019re using Brightree and they're partnering up in the United States and beyond. So that digital end to end, it becomes a very sticky platform because the value is so strong. They lower their labor costs by 50%, setting up the device, they improve adherence to 87% for their patients and their physicians and it becomes permanent. So I do think that the share we're taking will be long term sustainable. do think that the share we're taking will be long-term sustainable. When our competitor comes back, they're going to have to go after the low-priced people first that don't have all that digitally end to end. When they try to come after us, we're going to be so far ahead with 18 months\u2019 worth of digital health innovation and all the work that we're doing to partner with physicians, patients, and providers. I look forward to it. We were winning this football game before we got the penalty kick. It's like we were the Kansas City Chiefs and we were up 42 to 0, and then we got a penalty kick, and then we're up 45 to 0. It doesn't \u2013 we didn't need the penalty kick to get there, so I still think we'll win on the other side of this. But having said that, we're not going to give guidance around 2023, but everyone will have their models. I think that certainly with that competitor being out for the calendar year, we're going to take incredible share this calendar year. I think as they come back, the nine brand will be different. They'll have to start from the ground up and we'll have a strong lead as we go through fiscal 2023 and beyond. The most important thing, we're not really looking back at our competition. We're looking forward as we're talking about it, Jim and I've been talking about it. It's about the digital health solutions getting patients into the funnel and finding new ways to get the 1 billion people worldwide who have sleep suffocation into the funnel and 80% to 90% of them are undiagnosed. That's what we're laser focused on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.\nSuraj Kalia: Good afternoon, everyone. Mick, one question from my side. And Mick, let me pose this as a hypothetical. Obviously, demand is not being met, right? Whether because of supply constraints or so forth, how do you ration between an organic ResMed patient that will be sticky long term versus, let's say, a Phillips patient that potentially could generate a higher ESP in short term? I guess, a subpart to that I'm also trying to understand, do you see mix and matches going out to the field, i.e., tubes and accessories with blowers being mixed and match just to meet demand? Thank you.\nMick Farrell: Raj, it's a good question. And look, we don't \u2013 and particularly in the United States market, we work with home care providers and we're really taking the human patient first model here first which is we start with the highest acuity patients and work our way down. With our partnerships with home care providers, we start with existing relationships, digital adoption and because it drives best efficiency for the system and best outcomes for patients. So we don't make priorities. I will choose this patient because it will be more profitable this system because it'll be there. We focus on that acuity first, those relationships and the adoption of digital, because the long term is what we're focused on. We don't want some short term revenues and short term gains that you just give up. What you\u2019re looking for transforming the health care system towards our 2025 goal. And so that's where our priorities are. Any further color, Jim, you'd like to provide on Raj\u2019s question?\nJim Hollingshead: Yeah. Thanks. Just a couple of things. I mean, first thing I\u2019d said, we're not making the decision about the patients. It's the provider that's making the decision about the patients. But we're driving our production mix for higher acuity so that we can able providers to meet the needs of the higher acuity patients first. That\u2019s the first thing I would say. Second thing, just as a reminder, I think we mentioned this. I think we mentioned it today, but we've certainly talked about this on previous calls. The way we're prioritizing product allocation is higher acuity patients, but we're also prioritizing, effectively prioritizing existing ResMed customer volumes, right? And that's a very explicit decision, right, because we could have said the alternative. We could have said we're going to take this opportunity to go take accounts that have favored Philips historically. But in fact, what we've done is we've done all of our allocations of product based upon the history we have with our customers. And the fact that that means is that its customers who are \u2013 have been more adopted of ResMed products who are getting more volume from us, right? And one of the opportunities for us as our volumes build, it\u2019s actually once we\u2019ve met the demand with those customers they actually take competitive share and in accounts that might have trended more towards Phillips historically. So that\u2019s and we have some questions on growth next year, I think that\u2019s a big opportunity for us for growth next year. And then the third thing on your question is it\u2019s always been the case that providers will mix and match one manufacturer\u2019s mask with one manufacturer\u2019s device or whatever. There's a little bit more of a tie to the device and the tube if it's a heated tube because those are lock and key, you know, are heated to work with our devices and not with others. But we have higher share. We have a higher attach rate for all the consumables in the market than our competitors do. So when there's mixing and matching, it's almost always to our benefit.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Polark from Baird. Your line is now live.\nMichael Polark: Hey. Good day. Thanks for taking the question. It's a US-centric one. And I'm curious, you know, Inspire as second line CPA P therapy in the US. The company has been running a fairly active marketing campaign with TV commercials. In 2021, they spent $50 million. That number is going to be a lot higher in 2022. And I think a regional campaign is going national. Inspire second line. So, you know, it goes without saying on that. But their commercials tend not to portray CPAP therapy in the best light. And I'm curious what you think about this and if there's any counter detailing efforts you can do to respectfully push back on some of the marketing runs that that Inspire is doing?\nMick Farrell: Yeah, thanks for your question, Michael. And it speaks to substitute therapies, which is something we look at very carefully because ResMed stands for respiratory medicine not CPAP manufacturer, right. And so we've been in alternative therapies for the sleep apnea therapy for decades. We have a dental 3-D printed dental device called Narval we\u2019re the number one provider of dental sleep apnea therapy in Western Europe, Northern Europe and many other countries around the world. And we've invested in the technology in this space of the company you mentioned, Inspire. Hypoglossal nerve stimulation is the category. We invested in a company called Nyxoah, N-Y-X-O-A-H, which is actually now listed on Nasdaq and on a European exchange, and they're in PMA trials here in the United States and an MDR work in Europe. And so that product will come to market in this segment. Look, yeah, we've seen some people do DTC advertising in this space. There was an oxygen delivery company that had a guy from Star Trek for a while. I think these things of demand gen in the old-school way is not the future for us. We're focused on social media. Our partnership with Google and Verily is around people typing in, my husband snores, I snore, and getting through a digital end-to-end pathway to identify, engage, and enroll people through. And we haven't really gone old-school media with demand gen, and we certainly don't need it in calendar 2022. To your point, you can't change \u2013 you can market however you want the industry, but you can't change clinical and economic realities. CPAP is the most economical and best noninvasive way to treat sleep apnea, period. Now, we make a sleep apnea device and a dental device, and we\u2019re invested in hypoglossal nerve stim. I say that on the clinical and economic reality. Talk to any pulmonary person. Even an ENT surgeon will say, no, you have to try CPAP. You have to try dental, and then you'll try the hypoglossal nerve stim. ResMed is going to be involved in all three categories. I think they'll all be valid. But I think they should be known. He\u2019s primary, he\u2019s secondary, and he\u2019s tertiary. And the economic reality is clear. You can Google the price. It's probably gone up a little on sleepapnea.com for a CPAP from those providers or EasyBreathe.com. They're probably $500 for the device, and trailing is, what, $100 on a mask every year. Compare that to a $25,000 surgery. I don't care what your high deductible health plan and health savings account is in the US. That's a lot of money for the individual and a boatload for the health system. So there'll be some economic realities of payers doing care management around this as it grows. Good category, long term. My opinion on the \u2013 that is any talk including the Wall Street Journal article this morning around 1 billion suffocating, 80%, 90% obviously that beyond diagnosed, any news about sleep apnea, sleep suffocation is good for ResMed and its demand gen. I preferred in 2023 than 2022 because we\u2019ve got enough demand to keep us going for 12 months. We\u2019ll be turning the knobs on our social media, our digital and our brick-and-mortar demand gen in 2023.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live.\nMike Matson: Yeah. Thanks. Thanks for fitting me in. Just want to ask about the surcharge. I don't know if you're willing to disclose, you know, roughly what percentage that is. And is that something that's being applied to all of your products, in other words, the devices and mask and accessories or just specific to devices? And then, finally, is this something that's, you know, intended to be temporary or something that, you know, you expect to be more permanent? And I have a follow-up as well on something else.\nMick Farrell: Yeah, Mike. Thanks. And we may not have time for your follow-up given we\u2019re 15 minutes over already. But, look, the surcharge, uncomfortable, I think there was a sell-side note that was public at around this. We \u2013 it's a $12 surcharge in the US and a \u20ac12 surcharge in Europe. And it's basically on all devices. It's not applying on the mask side. So that's the answer to those. To the question of how long will this last, obviously, we're in discussions with customers around the world. If you look at Rob's answer to the question or if you're reading the transcript, further up that transcript, it's a complex issue around sea freight, air freight, component costs, semiconductor, microchips, and we don't know how long those freight costs will be high. Those component costs will be high. So I will say the surcharge will be there as long as those are there. It's temporary, but it's as long as those are there. And you know, I think you've got many other stocks in your portfolio where they're talking, they are the semiconductor manufacturer or the others who give you further detail on how long they think they will have supply chain constraints and therefore higher costs to pass-through their customers. So that's \u2013 that'd be the way I'd answer your two questions, Mike. Thank you for bringing those through and thank you to everyone for staying an extra 15 minutes. There's a lot to go on this quarter. Look, thanks to all of our shareholders for joining us on the call. I\u2019d once again, I'd like to take the opportunity for the 8,000 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders who listen in here for your dedication and hard work, helping people breathe better, sleep better, live better lives outside the hospital in 140 countries. Thanks for all that you do today and every day. Thanks for surviving this COVIDness and the Zoom calls, and all the craziness. Thanks also to our frontline heroes who aren't on Zoom calls. They're doing patient care, technical care sales teams, visiting customers every day. I'd also like a special call out to the frontline supply chain team, management, procurement, distribution and our digital health teams working around the clock to keep up with every new launch of myAir, AirView, and Brightree, and MatrixCare. So thank you all. I look forward to talking to you all again in 90 days. Thank you. I'll hand you to Amy to close us out.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Mick. And to echo Mick's comments, thank you everyone for sticking with us extra 15 minutes. That enabled us to get through everybody in the call to queue. We do appreciate your interest in your time, and if you have any follow-up questions or additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly. This does conclude our second quarter 2022 call. Kevin, I'll turn it back to you to close things out.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may just connect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Jim Hollingshead",
            "content": "Yeah. The only thing I would add to what Nick said is that our Astrals product is performing really well in the market. It's got very sophisticated algorithms that can treat a wide range of patients, and demand for it has been really strong. And so, in general, the Astrals have been very well accepted and some of the algorithms we've added over the last several months have driven demand upward. It's also benefiting from the for what is for us to tailwind from the Philips recall. And so, there's a bit of incremental demand for Astral in that context as well. I think the mix just listed a couple of tailwinds are related to, I do think patients have changed their behavior in the context of COVID and are much more keen to get clean, refreshed consumables and their experience. And I think our customers worldwide have gotten better at providing that and the US market in particular, there's a very strong push on resupply and has been for months. And so that's, that's a tailwind. There's always a Q2 cyclicality tailwind because of deductibles. So that's a normal cyclical thing but the other thing I think is really important to point out is that our mask portfolio is performing really, really well. We have the \u2013 we do have the widest range of masks available to fit really almost any patient experience. We continue to take share, I think, which is a really important dynamic for us. So not massive shocking movement but incrementally, we continue to take a bit of share over the last two or three quarters, we've taken, we've taken sequential share and so that's been really good. The only headwind on mask is the filter recall, because the filter recall is dampening new patient starts. And so that's, that's a tiny headwind against four or five tailwinds that we've just listed and we feel really confident about our mask portfolio going forward. Yeah, Gretel, I guess I would, I would just add a couple of things. The first one is we're working really hard with our channel partners to understand the dynamic of patient wait lists and working really hard with physicians on that. And so, we're \u2013 as you know we're prioritizing higher acuity patients, higher acuity conditions with our with our production. But we know that there are kind of straight OSA patients out there, they're facing longer waitlists and we're working with our customers to try to reduce those wait times and to better manage an understanding of when we can deliver product to which customers are so. So that's just sort of a general thing we're trying to do. I think the other thing that will help us to drive growth on an ongoing basis is we're working right now on programs that will allow us to capture patients who may be faced a long waitlist. And I don't want to go to great detail on that but our marketing teams in our main countries are working on those programs right now. And as we have more supply, we feel pretty confident we'll be able to run programs that will be able to reengage patients that maybe have, they're tired of waiting or something like that. So we think we'll be able to capture a big, big part of that backlog, which there is a backlog and we think there'll be an even bigger backlog, which I \u2013 if there is a backlog and we think there'll be an even bigger backlog as that goes forward. And the last thing I would add is, we're pretty active in developing new channels. And so, those are those are new and growing areas for us. But if you think about something like CVS Health hubs, there's a new channel that that continues to grow, CVS continues to invest there. That's a new way for patients to be reminded that they were diagnosed with OSA or to be reminded that they might need resupply. And CBS is just one example where we're working in new channels. We're doing that not just in the US, but in multiple markets around the world. So we're going to expand the ability to reach of different channels for patients to get treated. And we'll be \u2013 we're accelerating those now. We'll be accelerating those programs even more as production comes up to higher volumes and we're able to treat more patients. Yeah. Thanks. Just a couple of things. I mean, first thing I'd said, we're not making the decision about the patients. It's the provider that's making the decision about the patients. But we're driving our production mix for higher acuity so that we can able providers to meet the needs of the higher acuity patients first. That's the first thing I would say. Second thing, just as a reminder, I think we mentioned this. I think we mentioned it today, but we've certainly talked about this on previous calls. The way we're prioritizing product allocation is higher acuity patients, but we're also prioritizing, effectively prioritizing existing ResMed customer volumes, right? And that's a very explicit decision, right, because we could have said the alternative. We could have said we're going to take this opportunity to go take accounts that have favored Philips historically. But in fact, what we've done is we've done all of our allocations of product based upon the history we have with our customers. And the fact that that means is that its customers who are \u2013 have been more adopted of ResMed products who are getting more volume from us, right? And one of the opportunities for us as our volumes build, it's actually once we've met the demand with those customers they actually take competitive share and in accounts that might have trended more towards Phillips historically. So that's and we have some questions on growth next year, I think that's a big opportunity for us for growth next year. And then the third thing on your question is it's always been the case that providers will mix and match one manufacturer's mask with one manufacturer's device or whatever. There's a little bit more of a tie to the device and the tube if it's a heated tube because those are lock and key, you know, are heated to work with our devices and not with others. But we have higher share. We have a higher attach rate for all the consumables in the market than our competitors do. So when there's mixing and matching, it's almost always to our benefit."

            "content": "Maybe only also, Chris, this has sort of been going on for a year now and we knew these shortages were going to be coming. So our teams have been working on all those activities that Nick's been talking about throughout the year, starting to bear fruit. It does take time and that's why we're talking about sort of, you know, things don't fix immediately. We're talking about its continuing to be challenging for this coming quarter and starting to see improvement further out. That said, you know, it's a very dynamic situation and things do change on a weekly basis and so our teams have to be extremely agile and we've got \u2212 we're actually putting a lot of resources into it, got a really strong team of engineers and commercial relationship people with the suppliers and our product teams are all really focused on this as we work through these challenging times. Yeah. Well, generally, we're happy to see coding and reimbursement flow towards more remote monitoring type activity. That's a positive. At the same time, Propeller is working both to have physician adoption of those codes, and we're working to see the funding come through with that, and nothing changes quickly in terms of medical practice and Propeller is also working with health care systems and other system-wide bases to try to adopt to Propeller system. So, I'd say we're encouraging, but it's still a little early in the day for us to say we're seeing material uptake for Propeller as a result. But certainly, it improves the operating conditions. And we think this is a long-term trend that will benefit Propeller as well as the rest of the business and its remote patient monitoring in the long run."

            "name": "Brett Sandercock",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, unless noted, all comparisons out of the prior year quarter. We're pleased with our financial performance in Q2, despite the headwinds we faced as a result of significant ongoing supply chain constraints and the challenging freight environment. Group revenue for the December quarter was $895 million, an increase of 12%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 13%. Revenue growth reflects increased demand for our sleep and rest free care products across our portfolio, driven by recovering market conditions and by increased device demand in response to the ongoing product recall by one of our competitors. In the December quarter, we recorded immaterial incremental revenue from our COVID-19 related demand, consistent with revenue from our COVID-19-related demand, consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we expect negligible revenue from COVID-19-related demand. However, we will continue to estimate it for you as appropriate. In relation to the impact of our competitor's recall, we estimate that we generated incremental device revenue in the range of $45 million to $55 million in the December quarter. For the first half of our FY 2022, this reflects incremental revenue in the range of $125 million to $145 million. We continue to expect component supply constraints will limit the total incremental device revenue opportunity to somewhere between $300 million and $350 million for the full fiscal year 2022. As we shared last quarter, we expect our fiscal third quarter to remain supply constrained, similar to our fiscal second quarter, therefore limiting incremental revenue during the third quarter. We see supply challenges to some extent easing in our fiscal fourth quarter and into fiscal year 2023. Looking at geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our software-as-a-service business, sales in the US, Canada and Latin America countries increased by 14%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 12% in constant currency terms. By products segment, globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 16%, while masks and other sales increased by 10%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the US, Canada and Latin America increased by 19% as we benefited from incremental revenue due to a competitor's recall and favorable product mix as we sold an increased proportion of higher acuity devices. This is consistent with our guiding principles for product allocation, namely that we are giving priority to the production and delivery of our devices to meet the needs of the highest acuity patients first. Mask and other sales increased by 9%, Masks and other sales increased by 9%,, reflecting solid resupply revenue and achieved despite the challenging device supply environment, which continues to limit new patient set ups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales increased by 13% in constant currency terms, again reflecting the benefit from incremental revenue due to a competitive recall. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets benefited from improved patient flow relative to the prior year and increased by 11% in constant currency terms. Overall, our Asian operations in particular delivered a strong quarter. Software-as-a-service revenue increased by 8% in the December quarter. We saw strong performance of the HME segment as customers continue to utilize our SaaS solutions to streamline and more efficiently run their businesses. And we are seeing some stability in the skilled nursing care segment as it continues to emerge from the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the second half of fiscal year 2022, we expect to continue to benefit from our competitors' inability to supply new patients and from the global fleet markets general recovery from COVID-19 impacts. However, as we have said in the last few quarters, while we are working hard to increase device output, we will not be able to meet all expected demand resulting from our competitors' recall, primarily because of significant and ongoing supply constraints for electronic components. We are operating a very dynamic supply chain environment. As I stated earlier, we continue to expect component supply constraints will limit the incremental device revenue resulting from our competitors recall to somewhere between $300 million and $350 million for fiscal year 2022. This includes the device revenue we were able to generate in the first half of fiscal year 2022. We expect Q3 to remain challenging but Q4 to be better. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin declined by 230 basis points to 57.6% in the December quarter. The decrease is predominantly attributable to higher freight, component, and manufacturing costs and unfavorable currency movements, partially offset by a positive product mix, particularly in relation to strong growth of our higher acuity devices. Moving on to operating expenses, during Q2, we maintained a disciplined approach in our ongoing spend to support our operations. But we are seeing a more normalized expenditure profile as COVID-19 impacts subside. SG&A expenses for the second quarter increased by 9% or, in constant currency terms, increased by 10%. The increase was predominantly attributable to an increase in employee-related expenses. Importantly, SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue improved to 20.7% compared to 21.2% in the prior-year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the second half of FY 2022. R&D expenses for the quarter increased 14% on both a headline and a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue of 7% compared to 6.9% in the prior-year quarter. We continue to make significant investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product, and solutions development will deliver sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward and subject currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of 7% for the second half of FY 2022. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter increased by 5%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by the contraction of our gross margin. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 15% while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.6% compared to the prior year quarter of 15.2%. The relatively low tax rate in Q2 in both the current quarter and prior year quarter reflects a favorable tax benefit associated with employee equity vesting that typically occurs in the second quarter. Looking forward, we estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2022 will be in the range of 19% to 20%. Our non-GAAP net income for the quarter increased by 5% and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter increased by 4%. Now cash flow from operations for the quarter was $220 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by higher working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $13 million, depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $41 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends to shareholders totaling $61 million. We recorded equity losses of $1.9 million in our income statement in the December quarter associated with the premise on joint venture with Verily. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $2 million per quarter through the balance of fiscal year 2022 associated with the joint venture operation. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $109.4 million. At December 31, we had $680 million gross debt and $496 million net debt. Our debt levels remain modest and at December 31, we had approximately $1.6 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, reflecting the board's confidence in our operating performance. As our cash flow and low leverage provide flexibility in how we allocate capital going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest for growth through R&D. We also expect to continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions, such as Citus Health and Ectosense, an acquisition we completed on October 1. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy."

            "name": "Mick Farrell",
            "content": "Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review results for the December quarter, the second quarter of our fiscal year 2022. Our second quarter results continue to demonstrate the strong performance across our business, benefiting from the ongoing extremely high demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices, as well as the steady recovery of markets from the peaks of COVID-19 impacts. We achieved double-digit growth in our business as we navigate three major externalities. On, the recovery of patient flow post the COVID maximum peaks; two, global supply chain constraints, particularly in electronic components; and three, the almost unlimited demand associated with a competitor recall that has actually extended further in terms of volumes of their devices that were impacted and the duration of their repair and replace process. The bottom line is we have at least 12 more months of this incredible demand for ResMed products. I'm very proud of 8,000 ResMedians serving patients in 140 countries worldwide. Our global teams are finding ways to deliver products and solutions to home care providers, physicians and healthcare systems, and ultimately into the hands of patients who need them most. Clearly, the global supply chain environment remains very challenging across multiple industries and we are not immune to its impact. During the quarter, despite growing double-digits year-on-year, we were not able to meet all the demand available in the market. We are being allocated components from our suppliers, particularly electronic components and even more specifically, semiconductor chips. And we are thus being forced to allocate our outbound products to our customers. We have established an allocation process with clear guiding principles that give priority to the production and delivery of devices to meet the needs of the highest acuity patients first. In addition to component supply issues, the ongoing challenges of sea freight and air freight are impacting our ability to respond as rapidly as we would like to the demand for ResMed products. Freight costs are increasing across the board on inbound components from suppliers and on outbound products to our distribution centers and for ultimate delivery to our customers. As a result of these increased costs, we implemented a surcharge on our products starting in January to share some of the burden of these increased costs with customers. Given all the increase in prices from commodities to special \u2013 specialty products across multiple industries around the world, the necessity of this surcharge has been understood and accepted by our customers. We are working closely with our global supply chain partners, doing everything that we can to gain access to additional supply of the critical components that we need to further increase production of our medical devices. We are also re-engineering designs, validating new parts, pieces, suppliers and accelerating new product launch and development to further catch up with the demand. We understand that this is a difficult situation for all of our customers, including physicians, home medical equipment providers, payers, health care systems and the most important customer, the patient. Our number one priority will always be patients, doing our best to help those who suffer from sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and other respiratory chronic diseases, as well as those who benefit from our out-of-hospital health care software solutions. To grow and differentiate our sleep and respiratory care business, we will develop, design and deliver world-leading therapy solutions that can be scaled globally. And we're going to deliver the world's leading out-of-hospital software solutions to empower each person's health care wherever they are. Our goal is to ensure that every person gets the care that they need, where they need it and when they need it. Let me step back to discuss the broad market conditions in our industry. We're seeing steady ongoing recovery of demand across the countries that we operate in. We are still seeing a divergence in the total patient flow from 85% to 100% of pre-COVID levels in most countries, and about 100% of pre-COVID levels in a few locations. These metrics will continue to steadily increase towards pre-COVID levels and beyond as vaccines and boosters roll out globally. Each new COVID variant has an impact. But with the adoption of digital health solutions for screening, diagnosis, and remote patient setup, and remote patient monitoring, as well as established and well-established processes for COVID cleaning protocols at sleep labs, we expect the impact of new variants to diminish in absolute impact each time. Our global ResMed team remains committed to working with national, state, and city governments, as well as local health care systems, hospitals, and health care providers to supply ventilators, masks, and training for acute care, and the important transition home as needed. Given the steadily decreasing severity of each impact on the hospitalizations and severe disease from COVID, the demand for ventilators is now consistent with pre-COVID levels. Let me now update you on our top three strategic priorities. Number one is to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma businesses. Number two is to design, develop, and deliver world leading medical devices, as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally. And number three is to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital, and especially in the home. The US launch of our next generation device platform called AirSense 11 continues to go very well. This new platform has provided much needed additional product supply as we face all-time high demand for ResMed devices. We expect to introduce AirSense 11 platform into additional countries throughout calendar year 2022. In parallel, we will continue to sell our globally available market leading platform the AirSense 10 to maximize the total volume of CPAP, APAP and bilevels [ph] available for sale. In fact, the only product that the AirSense 10 is inferior to is the AirSense 11. As you saw in our results, with double digit growth this quarter, the ongoing adoption of both the AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 platforms remains very, very strong. With the AirSense 11 platform and our digital health technology ecosystem, we are engaging patients in their therapy digitally like never before in the industry. We are also making it easier and more efficient for our customers to manage their patient populations using our full suite of software solutions, including myAir for patients, AirView for physicians and Brightree for home medical equipment providers. When customers use these digital health technology solutions, they have increased efficiencies, lower costs and we achieve improved outcomes for patients and their physicians. We have peer reviewed published evidence showing that combining AirSense platform with myAir software and AirView software, we see over 87% adherence to positive airway pressure therapy. This was in a study with over 85,000 patients. On our latest and greatest platform, AirSense 11, we are driving even higher adoption rates of the myAir than ever before. In fact, we are seeing more than double the uptake of patients signing up to myAir and fully engaging with ResMed software technology. The net result is that this delivers a better patient experience, better efficiency for the homecare providers and more importantly greater long term adherence to therapy. We saw this demonstrated in the Alaska study in partnership with the French healthcare systems where we showed in a study with over 176 patients that those patients who adhered to CPAP therapy had a 39% relative reduction in mortality rates versus control. Demonstrating these types of better patient outcomes and lower costs for the healthcare system at a scale not seen before in the industry are critical components of the ResMed 2025 strategy. Another key aspect of our long-term growth strategy is driving awareness and increasing the flow of patients through the top of the sleep apnea diagnosis funnel. COVID-19 has advanced awareness, adoption and acceptance of respiratory health and respiratory hygiene, but also adoption acceptance of digital health and telehealth tools including home-based sleep apnea tests. Although increasing demand is not as important in the immediate short term giving the ongoing competitor recall, we have a long term focus and we're always focused on that long-term demand gen opportunity. We are innovating with partners and our customers to create an even more efficient and effective approach to sleep apnea patient identification, screening, diagnostics, treatment and management. We will continue to invest in technology that enables an end to end seamless digital experience for patients. As we mentioned in our October call, during the second quarter, we acquired Ectosense, a leading provider of cloud connected home sleep apnea testing technology worldwide. We believe Ectosense's digital and easy to use solutions in the hands of physicians, sleep lab technicians, as well as consumers can help significantly increase both diagnostic and screening rates can help significantly increase both diagnostic and screening rights as well as general sleep apnea awareness. Let me now turn to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD worldwide and the 330 million patients that suffer from asthma worldwide. Our goal is to reach hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation, as well as newer therapeutic areas, such as cloud connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions from our Propeller technology and high flow therapy offerings, such as our product platform called Lumis HFT. Demand for our core noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions was strong throughout the quarter, especially in markets outside the US where providers shifted focus to support the most severe highest acuity patients. This demand is aligned with the guiding principles of our allocation process, namely, to give the highest priority to manufacturing life support ventilation and noninvasive ventilation devices, including by levels that meet the needs of these highest acuity patients first. Adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe a little over a year ago remains solid, and we continue to expand this technology to regions around the world. AirView for ventilation has provided value by helping physicians and the health care systems they operate in to manage high risk patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. But it is also increasingly being used on an ongoing basis to enhance quality of care through early and proactive intervention at the first sign of respiratory medical issues to help reduce the risk of hospitalization. We see a world where We see a world where AirView ventilation is standard of care for COPD, the way that our core sleep apnea AirView platform is now standard of care for sleep apnea treatment. Let me now review our software as a service business for out-of-hospital care. During the quarter, our SaaS business showed improved sequential growth. We achieved high single digit growth year-on-year across our portfolio of SaaS markets including home medical equipment as well as facilities based and home based care settings. The continued growth of home based care is providing tailwinds for our home medical equipment as well as our home health and hospice products and we continue to grow with customers as they increase their utilization of our software and data solutions to improve and optimize business efficiencies and patient care, including Brightree and SNAP ReSupply. The COVID-19 pandemic has been and remains challenging for some of the verticals in our SaaS business, particularly skilled nursing facilities as the effects of the highly contagious Omicron variant remains a headwind for patient volumes in these settings. We will continue to watch this closely as COVID rates peak and then decline with this latest variant as has happened in many regions around the country and around the world. As COVID restrictions continue to ease and our customers improve their line of sight to better conditions, we expect to see pent-up demand for technology investments, which provides opportunities for us to sell more and more services and solutions to existing customers, as well as to increase our new customer pipeline. As we look at our portfolio of solutions across care settings, we expect our SaaS group revenue to growth to accelerate, achieving sustainable high single digit growth as we exit this fiscal year. As always, our growth, our goal is to meet or beat that market growth rate as we continue to innovate and continue to take market share from competitors. We are the leading strategic provider of SaaS solutions for out-of-hospital care and we provide mission critical software across a broad set of very attractive markets. Our latest and greatest SaaS solutions address the number one issue reported across our customer base which is staffing challenges. Our SaaS customers expect this problem to persist and they recognize the need for technology solutions to help solve their challenges with efficiency and scale and our software services and solutions help them achieve both of these outcomes. We are well-positioned and we have created differentiated value for our customers and for ResMed within our SaaS business. Looking at the broader portfolio of ResMed's businesses across sleep and respiratory care, as well as our SaaS solutions, we remain confident in our long term strategy and our pipeline of innovative solutions. Our sleep and respiratory care solutions treat the most prevalent and highest cost chronic conditions and our SaaS solutions support the care settings where people face these and other chronic conditions. With this combination, we can fundamentally transform out of hospital healthcare at a scale that no other company can match. And we have set up for sustainable growth through ongoing investments in R&D to the tune of 7% of our revenues, commercial excellence in partnerships with CVS verily and beyond, as well as future acceleration through strategic M&A as well as tuck-in M&A as we move forward. Our patient centric \u2212 physician centric and provider centric approach combined with our unique ResMed culture means that we are positioned to continue winning in the vastly underserved medical markets of sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and beyond. We are transforming out-of-hospital healthcare at scale, leading the market in digital health technology with over 10.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 16 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are unlocking value by using de-identified data to help patients, providers, physicians, payers, and entire health care systems. We have invested in the privacy, cloud operations and AI and ML-driven data or analytics capabilities to do this at a scale that is unmatched by competitors, and we are increasing our lead every day. Our mission to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025 drives and motivates ResMedians every day. We again made excellent progress toward that inspiring goal during this last quarter. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude to more than 8,000 residents for their perseverance, hard work, and dedication during these ongoing, unprecedented times. Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we will move to the group for Q&A. Brett, over to you. Yeah. Chris, thanks. It's a very pertinent question, obviously, and we're pursuing multiple paths, as I outlined in the prep remarks we're focusing on \u2013 the first thing we're doing is going to our existing suppliers and existing supply chains and really imploring them to prioritize medical devices over the other aspects. They have choices to give to electric cars, cellular phones, consumer devices and medical devices. And we are working with them directly on that. We're seeing some benefit on that, certainly at the level of maintaining the sort of double-digit growth that you saw during this quarter. In addition to that, we are redesigning parts and pieces and components within our existing platforms, and we're bringing new platforms to market faster. So we're working on our Air 10 designs and Air 11 designs. We're also re-engineering our supply chains to validate and verify new suppliers to be able to get there. And so that whole combination gives us a lot more confidence that as we look to March quarter to get better than December but then June quarter to get significantly better than March. And then as we go through September and December of this calendar year, we really start to free up a lot of those projects come into play and we're seeing a lot of confidence with them. But you know, over that portfolio, Rob, do you have any more information to provide maybe Chris, around what we're doing with supply chain and parts? Yeah, it's a good question, Chris. I'm actually precisely where I was in October that, you know, I think we said in October it's going to be tough in December, it's going to be tough in March and really start to open up in June and then as we go out throughout the calendar year. So, I stand by that and I stand as Brett said earlier, looking at fiscal 2022 the $300 million to $350 million of incremental product. Look at the December quarter, 16% growth year-on-year in devices amongst a global supply chain crisis, COVID-19 recovery, all the challenges that are here. That's really strong. But we're going to get stronger than that as we go throughout the fiscal and as we go throughout the calendar year. This seemingly infinite demand is going to be with us for the whole of this calendar year and potentially beyond that. And so we \u2013 all the projects that Rob talked about, if the starting gun went off sort of June 14, when the competitor put this recall notice in field safety, notices globally out, our team have done a pretty darn good job getting to 16% year-on-year in this crisis on the December quarter. I think it will get \u2013 as I said in October, I think it will get better in March and then December and significantly better in June and then really start to free up as we hit September and December. And with almost infinite demand, you never quite catch up to that. But we're going to get faster and faster and grow more year-on-year as we go throughout the calendar year. Thanks, Chris. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Dan. I'll have a first stab at it and then hand to Jim Hollingshead, who's our President of Sleep and Respiratory Care. Yeah. So what I've said in the prep remarks is that what we're seeing is that the demand for ventilators is really around that COPD neuromuscular disease, respiratory insufficiency markets are where they were pre-COVID-19 pandemic. So that we're seeing that flow of sick patients finding their way through digital health solutions, telehealth monitoring, digital work with their pulmonary and/or COVID cleaning particles in labs for their pulmonary physicians. We're getting the prescription for those products. The vast majority of our revenues, 90-plus percent globally on respiratory care are out-of-hospital respiratory care. So even Astral and Astellas and WSTs [ph], FTAs, FTs and AFEs, they're used for ventilation outside the hospital. So those seem to be back in terms of patient flow. Jim, any further color to provide Dan on that? Thanks, Sean. It's a great question, and as you know, Propeller technology is for those who may not know a cloud connected pharmaceutical delivery product for both COPD and asthma, and a lot of those are in pilot stage and the partnerships with governments in Europe and private payers in the United States. And so, we are \u2013 do have some commercial models going. They're not material to the global business, but, Dave Pendarvis, do you have any data about RTM codes that we've got through reimbursement and any impacts on those for Propeller and across the business? Yeah. Thanks for the question, Matt. And it's great to see US, Canada, Latin America, or the strong 9% constant currency growth on masks and Europe, Asia, rest of world at 11% year on year with a strong double-digit 10% growth. Well, one and as you said, that is up from last year. Look, I think I'll start in maybe hand to Jim for some more color. But at the broad level, COVID-19 has shown the importance of respiratory health and respiratory hygiene. And we said this in 2020 when we saw that sort of uptick of the growth of our masks and accessories business. And we just launched Snap and we have rightly resupply and a lot of people thought, well, this is the second was step up, it's just up. While people like, there were people with stockholdings and some commodity products. This is a stockholding issue. We said, no, this is sustainable. We're talking to patients. We're doing the net promoter score. We're analyzing data consumers want and always wanted to more health care. They've now seen the reason for respiratory health and respiratory hygiene. We're now two years into this and we are seeing sustained growth at the patient level demand for respiratory health, respiratory hygiene. We're adding to that the technology from SNAP, technology from Brightree but in other parts of the world with those technologies aren't there, we're partnering with our home care providers with patients directly and beyond to encourage and make that happen. But Jim, any further color on the sustainability of this, this strong margin? Craig, it's a pertinent question but it's one we don't feel comfortable going into the details of. What I can tell you as an equal one personal user of this AirSense 11 platform is that the delivery is smaller, quieter, more comfortable, more connected. My wife actually asked me if it was on when I turned it on, it is that much smaller, quieter and better than our last generation already the leading platform. So, what I can tell you is it is taking off every single AirSense 11 we can make is sold that day. It comes out of the factory, it's already pre-sold and they are moving fast. And so it is increasing as a portion of our US sales. For competitive reasons we're not going to split out how quickly that S curve is coming up. But the points I made in the prep remarks are really strong. The AirSense 10 on its own is the second best product in the market after only the AirSense 11. So it is already there and every AirSense 10 we can get component for and then put through the production line get sold as well. So we're selling both in parallel and customers are demanding both and we'll take both over any of the competition. And so we're driving those out there. We're driving great growth of both and we will do throughout all calendar year 2022 as Philips recall will last at least that long in their update just this week. And so, you know, 90 days ago it was 12 months ending in September. We were ready for that scenario. They'll come back in September and get our great mask uptake as Jim was saying earlier. We're now ready for their new scenario which is December and we're ready to expand our components and our share on the device side and driving as much as that demand as is possible. So, we're ready for all the scenarios of all the above. But yeah, we're not going for all the scenarios that will be involved. But, yeah, we're not going to break down the exact AirSense 11 versus AirSense 10. I can tell you it's growing extraordinarily fast. The S-curve uptake is great, and patients are loving it. So, throughout calendar year, we will introduce it to other countries around the world, and we expect the same sort of level of uptake in those other countries. Yeah, Andrew, great three-part question. I'll start with it, and then maybe, Rob, you can cover anything I missed of Andrew's components there. But, look, yeah, the starting gun went on this project in April when they said there was a quality issue, June when they said there was a recall. We were already ready for the supply chain shortages that COVID-19 would drive, and if this recall from our competitor hadn't happened, we would be able to meet all the existing demand. As you saw, we grew 16% year-on-year in this quarter, and that would have been great growth, taking some good share in the core competitive market. But with that starting gun going off in June, we did start those reengineering projects. We said, look, we are not going to be able to just go back and ask for more supply. We know the supply chain constraints. We know the automotive industry, cellular comms, and others are all screaming for more products, too. And so we started those reengineering of components and parts. We started also reengineering these Six Sigma Black Belts, looking at our supply chain and analyzing different suppliers and revalidating and assuring that we could get them there. And so there's a bunch of projects going on. I run out of fingers looking at them. But when I look at that portfolio, it gives me strong confidence to say, we saw some good \u2013 some of them come to fruition in December some more in March. But in the June quarter, I think a bunch of these projects will free up supply and then you hit September and December and the portfolio projects that are going to get to market in terms of the new supply, a new piece and new redesign will get there. And that's what gives us that confidence in that, that recovery and the amount of share we're going to take through 2022. Rob, what did I miss there? Maybe just going to some of the sort of the reengineering processes. As you know these \u2013 Andrew, these products have hundreds of components in them. And if you're missing one, you can't build any of the products. So you'll actually see us as we build buffers around all of this, we will see our inventory levels of materials go up as we build buffers of these alternatives. Now some of the components they're easy to have as alternatives. You've got to revalidate them. And in the medical device world, you've got to have very rigorous revalidation alternate components. And that's often a lot of the engineering work. But some of the other components like the microcontrollers and things like that, they are a lot more complex. They interact with the embedded software on the systems, all of that type of thing, the design and validation processes for those are more complex and do take more time. We've got projects across all of those areas going on there. And as we make these alternatives, then we're scheduling, the longer term commitments, the relationships with the suppliers, building the inventories and making sure we have options. That said, keep coming back to the sector is a very variable situation. And just when you think you've got everything right, then you start seeing the other components be challenges. So I think as I said earlier, you have to be really agile and keep competing on \u2013 keep running really fast to track these issues. Yeah, John it's a very complex question because as you know, we operate in 140 countries and all the different Greek letter variants of COVID flow through those 140 countries at different rates. One great thing because we have strong visibility and awareness into this as we talk to the pulmonary and critical care physicians and we watch hospitalization rates and ventilation usage rates and ICU usage rates as each variant seems to be \u2013 although more and more communicable less and less severe and the impact in terms of hospitalizations, severe need for ventilatory help and death. And so the work that we did in 2020 and 2021 establishing these digital protocols, home sleep apnea, testing protocols that pulmonary doctors who previously hadn't done telehealth visits are now doing them. Doctors who weren't embracing ApneaLink Air or some of the NOX digital diagnostics components have embraced them throughout 2020 out of necessity and then 2021 out of scale. So as we enter 2022 here, we're feeling very comfortable across those 140 countries. I gave you in prep remarks the sort of wide band, right? 85% to 100% of pre-COVID patient flow, depending on the country, the city, the location. There are some as I said in the prep remarks, there are some locations that are above 100%. And I won't go into detail -- North Rhine-Westphalia this quarter of Bavaria, Southern France, Southeast of the US this quarter, what we're seeing is as variants come down, those protocols go. We're hitting those \u2013 if you take 2019 as the base year, we're hitting those 100% triple digit rates in some locations. And so gives us a lot of confidence because we're \u2013 the beauty of, the beauty is we're in all 140 countries. So that portfolio, I feel every 90 days, we're seeing positive movement. Even though a particular location might go back two steps and one might go forward three steps, on aggregate, we're seeing sort of one step forward for ResMed as we look across that portfolio every 90 days. That's why we're able to see this great, strong 16% device growth across our region. It's not only share-taking. There's some good flow of patients coming through. What worries me a little bit, John, is actually some of the backlog that might be happening in the system due to our competitor just not being in the market for 18 months, right? In aggregate, according to their call this week, it would be 18 months from June 2021 through to December 2022. That backlog of patients, we can't get them all, right? We're ramping up, as Rob said, doing everything we can to ramp up. We're not going to get them all. And so that backlog of patients, even when our competitor comes back, is going to have to flow through the system. So this is not just an effect that's over the day our competitor is back. There's going to be a number of quarters where ResMed is going to grow, take share, and deal with this flow of patients through there. So although we're pushing very strong around our long-term demand gen, we're not turning up the dials yet on driving the top of the funnel because, frankly, the top of the funnel is full and growing and will do for the next 12 months. Thanks, Gretel. I'll have a first go at it and hand to Jim. I mean, the short answer to your question is absolutely not. I do not see any growth slowing down. In fact, the backlog, certainly for ResMed, I see incredible growth coming for our industry. And a lot of the demand gen stuff I talked about, and we talked about on our Investor Day with CVS partnerships on the brick and mortar side in the front line. And then on our Verily partnership premised, on the front line, we are not turning the dollars on that demand gen up and we don't need to through 2022. But we will start to put on the map in 2023. And I think what we'll see is the backlog will come in \u2013 and our demand gen will come in and we'll actually post-COVID see a faster growth rate of our industry because of all the learnings of digital health, home sleep apnea testing, seamless and digital end to end journeys for patients. It's got better for patients when they get into the system. The trouble is now competitor can't provide the therapy at the end and that does create a bit of a backlog. But I think on the other side of this, we'll actually see increased secular growth. That mid to high single digit growth for our industry might move up 50 basis points, 100 even more basis points because of the embracement of digital net net. But Jim, anything to go to Gretel's question around industry growth there? Yeah. Actually, as I was saying earlier, we've actually had to greatly extend our forecast lead times for it to get the supply commitments that we want, actually multi-year. So at that level, we have a long, long view. The year \u2013 our cycle times are actually pretty short. The longest part of our cycle time and variable part of it is freight. And so, a lot of the challenges of forecasting sales on a weekly basis is what's happening to any freight that's stuck off Los Angeles or something like that. Now, we can mitigate that at a cost with air freight, and we do that, but we certainly can't do a 100% on freight. And so we're trying to balance up those sort of freight demands and that does create a variability. So the hardest thing for predicting what's going to \u2013 what we're forecasting over the next couple of weeks is actually those freight deliveries. Our internal systems around delivering them out of our warehouses are extremely slick and really run well, and we've got great teams in those warehouses. Our factory capacity, we typically run a policy of having significant burst capacity in these factories. And as we've said before, we've just invested in a major new factory in Tuas in Singapore. We're \u2013 out of that factory, we would normally have the capacity to meet all of the industry demand. So we can actually push stuff through that system really quickly. The key issue is that variability and the propensity of the suppliers to meet their commitments. Now, they'll do everything they can to meet their commitments. But actually, some of those freight issues, they have the same issues. They have the same issues of allocation from their suppliers. And so we have to manage all the way through all of those layers to get there. So it's a long answer. But really, the main factor is the suppliers and the short-term variability of freight. Yeah. Thanks, Lyanne. It's a good question. And traditionally we don't talk much about price at all. But one thing I will say is that we announced it in our prep remarks \u2013 my prep remarks here today that we have a surcharge now on all ResMed devices. There are such as with exactly with the last question from Sol [ph] where Rob was showing that increased air freight and sea freight costs of 5X or 10X what they were, air freight was always a significant factor of above sea freight and it's got more expensive too and so all of that has meant that we had to provide that surcharge to our patients. So we haven't done a price increase as some of our competitors have to the customers but we have put a \u2212 we have put a surcharge on devices starting in January. Our customers have accepted it. I mean, you know, the people running these companies go to a supermarket and see the price of milk or the price of whatever commodities that they're purchasing in their daily lives going up in price. And so a surcharge from us given the nature of this has made sense to them. And so, you know, your question was what's the levels of price discounting? There is no product discounting right now. In fact, we're taking away some of the early pay and some of the other factors that were there that were non price related but the impact is sort of cash flow there because it's very important in an environment like this to make sure that the costs are shared in a fair and equal way through the supply chain and we're doing that through a surcharge. But as I see it, you know, the mix side, the second part of your question. We're following our guiding principle on allocation here. If we have limited chips and parts and pieces, we will make an Astral before [ph] before an echo of STA and ST and ASP and so on down to an APAP and CPAP. And so the mix, you know, can lead to some sort of ASP mix increases on that but any individual like-for-like product we're keeping the prices where they are because we're in a steady, reimbursed environment, our customers we have relationships going back decades. We want them for decades for the future and we really value those relationships. And so we're really focused on this sort of temporary surcharges is going to be associated with those increased costs we have and any impact on ASP is really around mix towards those higher acuity products. Yeah. Thanks. Steve. Now, let me try to unpack that a little bit here. On the gross margin, if you look at it year-on-year-year, pretty big decline and really freight was the big one and logistics costs. Some component cost increases coming in and also manufacturing because they really had to optimize on the manufacturing front. At the moment, we were just trying to make sure we can really maximize output rather than efficiencies. So that's playing out that played out year-on-year-year. If you look at it sequentially, not in quite good shape, a little bit of an increase there sequentially actually. If you go forward, we're still going to have freight and logistics costs coming through. I mean, that's still going to be, I think, a headwind for I think for the rest of this calendar. FX probably relatively neutral as we look forward and I think ASP declines won't \u2013we've typically had that but I don't think we'll see that going forward. We have the surcharge. It's only a small surcharge. And we're only \u2013 we're not recovering anywhere near our increasing cost there but we're \u2013 as Mick said we're looking to share that. So they're kind of \u2013 they're still with us. There are some headwinds there. We've got AirSense11 coming through, which is at a price premium but that's only in the US market at the moment. But taking the medium term view, that'll be supportive. But the other one to call out is as particularly in Q4, as we increase the output or the volumes from the supply constraints easing and we'll have higher revenue there. But in a relative sense, it'll be more of the kind of lower acuity in terms of that mix. So that one will be a little bit of a headwind, so the product mix won't be as beneficial as it has been. So there's puts and takes there. But that's how kind of how see it at the moment. Yes, David. It's a really pertinent question. And I feel very confident. And we've watched it. Before this recall was announced, through to June 2021, we saw great adoption for 18 months of all the digital solutions from doctors getting involved in telehealth to the adoption of identification, engagement, enrollment and diagnostic systems on a digital basis. In countries where, like in Germany, where it would obviously be interesting was less than 10% of the total diagnoses in 2019. It went to huge double digits throughout 2020 10% of the total diagnosis in 2019, it went to huge double digits throughout 2020, and it stayed quite high despite the reopening with COVID-cleaning particles of sleep labs throughout Germany. And so, I think as you look an aggregate, David, that adoption that happened in the last two years will be a huge impact, permanent adoption of digital health screening tools. And as Jim said, as we open up new channels, we're going to roll that digital end-to-end solution through multiple new funnels to get patients into the funnel through the early partnership with Prim [ph] through our CVS partnership. And they're the two public ones in the US, but we're doing, as Jim said, stuff in the other 140 countries that are more a partnership basis partnership basis with the UK government, with the NHS. Some great information from our UK team I was looking at over the last week, incredible work in our Northern Europe team. Our Western European team, the partnership with the French government. I talked about the ALASKA study that's just the peer reviewed, published evidence that's out there. We're doing stuff on the ground that we're not talking about publicly, but it has incredible adoption of digital health technologies in conjunction with the French Social Security system, supporting that through high reimbursement of cloud connected CPaaP versus non-cloud connected CPaaP. Because they see the results, they see high adherence, they see better outcomes, they see lower costs, not only death rate, lower death rate of those we'll see proper but lower hospitalization, so it saves lives and saves money. So, David, it's a permanent adoption. I think it will improve our efficiency as an industry, as we get into 2022, 2023 here and beyond. Yeah, Margaret it's a great question and I'm not going to get into sort of the detailed breakdown of the $350 million through the fiscal year. But as you said, look at it is, back end loaded in terms of Q4 is going to be the lion's share of that, of that because all the projects that Rob talked about earlier will come to fruition in June, September and December. And so the only guidance I think I've given in the last nine years as CEO was around this $350 million on the revenue side there for fiscal 2022. So I'm not going to go into 2023. We did that because the models were quite wide there on the benefit from this recall on the sell side for as low as $50 million to as high as $950 million. So we wanted to right set it at $300 million to $350 million. We're still comfortable with that for fiscal 2022. But as you look for fiscal 2023, look, I do think that the share that we're taking this year will be long term sustainable share. When we go in and take share, we don't just go into a competitive account and say, great, here's your product, good. We work with people who are adopting existing relationships with people who are adopting Maya for their patients, getting that 60%, 70% uptake that we've seen with AirSense 11. They're working with AirView. All their physicians are on the cloud platform, getting that efficiency. They're using Brightree and they're partnering up in the United States and beyond. So that digital end to end, it becomes a very sticky platform because the value is so strong. They lower their labor costs by 50%, setting up the device, they improve adherence to 87% for their patients and their physicians and it becomes permanent. So I do think that the share we're taking will be long term sustainable. do think that the share we're taking will be long-term sustainable. When our competitor comes back, they're going to have to go after the low-priced people first that don't have all that digitally end to end. When they try to come after us, we're going to be so far ahead with 18 months' worth of digital health innovation and all the work that we're doing to partner with physicians, patients, and providers. I look forward to it. We were winning this football game before we got the penalty kick. It's like we were the Kansas City Chiefs and we were up 42 to 0, and then we got a penalty kick, and then we're up 45 to 0. It doesn't \u2013 we didn't need the penalty kick to get there, so I still think we'll win on the other side of this. But having said that, we're not going to give guidance around 2023, but everyone will have their models. I think that certainly with that competitor being out for the calendar year, we're going to take incredible share this calendar year. I think as they come back, the nine brand will be different. They'll have to start from the ground up and we'll have a strong lead as we go through fiscal 2023 and beyond. The most important thing, we're not really looking back at our competition. We're looking forward as we're talking about it, Jim and I've been talking about it. It's about the digital health solutions getting patients into the funnel and finding new ways to get the 1 billion people worldwide who have sleep suffocation into the funnel and 80% to 90% of them are undiagnosed. That's what we're laser focused on. Raj, it's a good question. And look, we don't \u2013 and particularly in the United States market, we work with home care providers and we're really taking the human patient first model here first which is we start with the highest acuity patients and work our way down. With our partnerships with home care providers, we start with existing relationships, digital adoption and because it drives best efficiency for the system and best outcomes for patients. So we don't make priorities. I will choose this patient because it will be more profitable this system because it'll be there. We focus on that acuity first, those relationships and the adoption of digital, because the long term is what we're focused on. We don't want some short term revenues and short term gains that you just give up. What you're looking for transforming the health care system towards our 2025 goal. And so that's where our priorities are. Any further color, Jim, you'd like to provide on Raj's question? Yeah, thanks for your question, Michael. And it speaks to substitute therapies, which is something we look at very carefully because ResMed stands for respiratory medicine not CPAP manufacturer, right. And so we've been in alternative therapies for the sleep apnea therapy for decades. We have a dental 3-D printed dental device called Narval we're the number one provider of dental sleep apnea therapy in Western Europe, Northern Europe and many other countries around the world. And we've invested in the technology in this space of the company you mentioned, Inspire. Hypoglossal nerve stimulation is the category. We invested in a company called Nyxoah, N-Y-X-O-A-H, which is actually now listed on Nasdaq and on a European exchange, and they're in PMA trials here in the United States and an MDR work in Europe. And so that product will come to market in this segment. Look, yeah, we've seen some people do DTC advertising in this space. There was an oxygen delivery company that had a guy from Star Trek for a while. I think these things of demand gen in the old-school way is not the future for us. We're focused on social media. Our partnership with Google and Verily is around people typing in, my husband snores, I snore, and getting through a digital end-to-end pathway to identify, engage, and enroll people through. And we haven't really gone old-school media with demand gen, and we certainly don't need it in calendar 2022. To your point, you can't change \u2013 you can market however you want the industry, but you can't change clinical and economic realities. CPAP is the most economical and best noninvasive way to treat sleep apnea, period. Now, we make a sleep apnea device and a dental device, and we're invested in hypoglossal nerve stim. I say that on the clinical and economic reality. Talk to any pulmonary person. Even an ENT surgeon will say, no, you have to try CPAP. You have to try dental, and then you'll try the hypoglossal nerve stim. ResMed is going to be involved in all three categories. I think they'll all be valid. But I think they should be known. He's primary, he's secondary, and he's tertiary. And the economic reality is clear. You can Google the price. It's probably gone up a little on sleepapnea.com for a CPAP from those providers or EasyBreathe.com. They're probably $500 for the device, and trailing is, what, $100 on a mask every year. Compare that to a $25,000 surgery. I don't care what your high deductible health plan and health savings account is in the US. That's a lot of money for the individual and a boatload for the health system. So there'll be some economic realities of payers doing care management around this as it grows. Good category, long term. My opinion on the \u2013 that is any talk including the Wall Street Journal article this morning around 1 billion suffocating, 80%, 90% obviously that beyond diagnosed, any news about sleep apnea, sleep suffocation is good for ResMed and its demand gen. I preferred in 2023 than 2022 because we've got enough demand to keep us going for 12 months. We'll be turning the knobs on our social media, our digital and our brick-and-mortar demand gen in 2023. Yeah, Mike. Thanks. And we may not have time for your follow-up given we're 15 minutes over already. But, look, the surcharge, uncomfortable, I think there was a sell-side note that was public at around this. We \u2013 it's a $12 surcharge in the US and a \u20ac12 surcharge in Europe. And it's basically on all devices. It's not applying on the mask side. So that's the answer to those. To the question of how long will this last, obviously, we're in discussions with customers around the world. If you look at Rob's answer to the question or if you're reading the transcript, further up that transcript, it's a complex issue around sea freight, air freight, component costs, semiconductor, microchips, and we don't know how long those freight costs will be high. Those component costs will be high. So I will say the surcharge will be there as long as those are there. It's temporary, but it's as long as those are there. And you know, I think you've got many other stocks in your portfolio where they're talking, they are the semiconductor manufacturer or the others who give you further detail on how long they think they will have supply chain constraints and therefore higher costs to pass-through their customers. So that's \u2013 that'd be the way I'd answer your two questions, Mike. Thank you for bringing those through and thank you to everyone for staying an extra 15 minutes. There's a lot to go on this quarter. Look, thanks to all of our shareholders for joining us on the call. I'd once again, I'd like to take the opportunity for the 8,000 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders who listen in here for your dedication and hard work, helping people breathe better, sleep better, live better lives outside the hospital in 140 countries. Thanks for all that you do today and every day. Thanks for surviving this COVIDness and the Zoom calls, and all the craziness. Thanks also to our frontline heroes who aren't on Zoom calls. They're doing patient care, technical care sales teams, visiting customers every day. I'd also like a special call out to the frontline supply chain team, management, procurement, distribution and our digital health teams working around the clock to keep up with every new launch of myAir, AirView, and Brightree, and MatrixCare. So thank you all. I look forward to talking to you all again in 90 days. Thank you. I'll hand you to Amy to close us out."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. We ask that you please ask one question then return to the queue during the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications for ResMed. Please go ahead, Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Kevin. Hello, everyone, and welcome to ResMed's first quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings call. We thank you for joining us. This call is being webcast live and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today, along with a copy of the earnings press release and presentation, which are both available now. With me on the call today are ResMed's Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. During the Q&A portion of our call, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Jim Hollingshead, the President of our Sleep & Respiratory Care business; and David Pendarvis, Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel. During today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please review the notes in today's earnings press release or the appendix of the earnings presentation. And as a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, however, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mick.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our stakeholders for joining us today as we review results for the September quarter, our first quarter of fiscal year 2022. Our first quarter results demonstrate strong performance across our business, buoyed by extremely high demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices as well as continuing recovery of many markets from COVID-19. We achieved double-digit growth at both the top and bottom line metrics of our business. I want to be clear that achieving these results has not been easy this quarter. We are dealing with an unprecedented what I would call perfect storm of elements, including the COVID recovery, but also including a competitor recall that's \u2013 a recall that's ten-fold higher than any in the industry to date, and supply chain constraints that are impacting not only our industry but multiple industries worldwide. I'm incredibly proud of ResMedians across our global teams, many of whom are working 24x7 to get our products and solutions into the hands of patients who need them most. Despite these extraordinary efforts, we know that we have not been able to meet all of the demand. As the market leader, our competitor, that is in the number two market share position, announced a recall mid-June that has created unprecedented dislocations in the market. In effect, we are facing the challenge of providing the volume for our own number one market share position and also trying to meet as much of their number two market share position as possible around the world. Given the supply chain crisis, our suppliers have been allocating components to us on the inbound side. We have, in turn, been forced to allocate our products on the outbound side to our customers. We have been clear on the guiding principles for that allocation of our products, namely that we are giving priority for production and delivery of our devices to meet the needs of the highest acuity patients first. The allocation conversations that I have with our customers are the same ones that I am having with my suppliers and their suppliers and so on up the supply chain. As an example, during the quarter, I was on a Zoom call with one of our suppliers, suppliers, suppliers, suppliers, suppliers, suppliers, and I'm not kidding. We achieved our goal with that manufacturer. And we received increased allocation from that manufacturer. But then we face the challenge and are still facing it of working with the five customers of theirs, all the way down that chain to get to us to ensure that the agreed upon increased allocation of that component actually gets to ResMed, gets manufactured into ResMed products and then sent to ResMed customers and ultimately to patients. That's just one example of a high degree of difficulty dive for our supply chain team. The supply chain analysis and negotiations are ongoing, and the situation is very fluid, changing day by day, week by week and month by month. We have an incredible Six Sigma Black Belt laden team of supply chain specialists working on these issues 24/7. In short, supply bottlenecks continue to restrict our access to critical electronic components, especially semiconductor chips that ultimately limit our net production output. In addition to component supply issues, the ongoing challenges of seafreight and airfreight from manufacturing facilities to distribution warehouses and ultimately, the customers are increasing our costs and further impacting our ability to respond as rapidly as we want to the huge demand for ResMed products. The combination of component shortages and transportation bottlenecks makes providing steady and smooth flow of products to the market very difficult. We are working incredibly closely with our global supply chain partners, doing everything we can to gain access to additional supply of the critical components that we need to further increase production of our medical devices. We will continue to coordinate with all stakeholders as the situation develops. We understand that this is a difficult situation for all of our customer groups, including physicians, home medical equipment providers, payers and the most important customer, the patient. Our number one priority will always be patients, doing our best to help those who need treatment for sleep apnea, for COPD, for asthma and for other chronic respiratory diseases as well as critical out-of-hospital care. Our goal is to ensure that patients get the therapy that they need, where they need it and when they need it. Let's now discuss the overall market conditions in our industry. We are seeing a steady ongoing recovery of demand in the countries that we operate in. They remain at various stages of the post-COVID peak recovery process in terms of new patient flow. We are still seeing a divergence in total patient flow and sleep lab capacity from 75% to 95% of pre-COVID levels in some countries, up to 100% plus of pre-COVID levels in others. These metrics will continue to ebb and flow as vaccines and boosters roll out globally and as new variants of the coronavirus arise and cause temporary perturbations. Our global ResMed team remains committed to working with national, state and city governments as well as local health systems, hospitals and health care providers to supply the ventilators, the masks and the training for acute care and the transition home for affected patients. Let me now update you on our three strategic priorities as we pivot back to grow our core business. These three are one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses; two, to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and especially in the home. In August, we launched our next-generation device platform that we call AirSense 11 into the United States market. In short, that launch has been very successful. We will be introducing the AirSense 11 into additional countries very soon. Our market-leading R&D team accelerated the launch of this amazing innovation. First, by expanding the controlled product launch to additional customers, and then accelerating to an earlier full product launch date to bring this product to market faster. Globally, we continue to sell our market-leading legacy platform, the AirSense 10, to maximize the total volume of CPAP, APAP and by levels available for customers. Clearly, the ongoing adoption of both the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11 platforms remains very, very strong. It's still early into the SirSense 11 launch, but initial customer feedback, combined with the detailed responses to our controlled product launch, tells me that the AirSense 11 is another success for ResMed. Physician, provider and patient feedback are all very positive. I was able to attend the California Sleep Society meeting in person, actually, during the quarter, and I was able to observe firsthand the responses to the latest innovations on the AirSense 11, such as personal therapy assistant, care check-in and the incredible rate of uptake of the patient-centric app called myAir, which has been upgraded for AirSense 11. And the uptake on that is almost double what it was for the myAir app than the AirSense 10. What's clear to me is that this platform, the AirSense 11, benefits not only patients and their bed partners, in addition, the device and software combination benefits physicians, it benefits providers and it benefits payers as well as entire healthcare systems with more data, more insights and better outcomes. As a 2-way digital health comms platform with many technical features that represent significant therapeutic advances, AirSense 11 is not only easy to set up and use, it also offers a very rich patient-centric experience. All AirSense 11 devices are 100% cloud connectable with upgraded digital health technology that is able to increase patient adherence to improve clinical outcomes and to deliver proven cost reductions within healthcare providers and physicians own health systems. We are engaging with patients in their therapy digitally like never before in the industry. This is a critical part of the ResMed 2025 strategy, as presented at our Investor Day, which we held virtually during this last quarter. Another key aspect of our long-term growth is linked to the awareness and the increasing flow of sleep apnea patients. With 936 million sleep apnea sufferers worldwide, this work is critical to our mission. COVID-19 has advanced awareness, adoption and acceptance of digital health and remote care, including home-based sleep apnea tests. We want to support seamless and cost-effective approaches to sleep diagnostics. We want to scale technology that in our consumer markets enables an easy-to-use device experience and technology that, in our reimbursed markets, can be a low-cost, clinically reliable, screening tool for sleep apnea. In this vein, on October 1, we closed a transaction to acquire EctoSense, a leader in cloud connected home sleep apnea testing technology from Belgium. We believe EctoSense's digital and easy-to-use solutions in the hands of both physicians and sleep lab technicians, as well as consumers can help significantly increase sleep apnea diagnosis rates, as well as general sleep awareness. EctoSense will operate within our sleep and respiratory care business unit, and we're excited to bring this innovative technology to more global markets as we move forward. Let me now turn to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million COPD patients and the 330 million asthma patients worldwide. Our long-term goal is to reach hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation as well as newer therapeutic areas such as cloud-connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions and high flow therapy offerings. Demand for our core noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for COPD and beyond was strong throughout the quarter, especially in markets outside the United States where physicians and providers shifted focus to support the most severe highest acuity patients. This demand is aligned with our strategy to ensure priority for manufacturing and delivery of the devices that meets the needs of those patients, specifically those that need life support ventilation or noninvasive ventilation, including by level support, first. We are balancing the growth in the respiratory care demand with the supply of ventilators that made it to market throughout the coronavirus pandemic as well as customers as they balance their inventory with ongoing acute and chronic ventilation patient needs. We continue to see rapid adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe a little over a year ago, and we continue to expand this technology to regions around the world. The value being provided through AirView for ventilation has been very helpful to physicians not only during COVID, but it is increasingly valuable on an ongoing basis for them and the health care systems that they operate in. In the not-too-distant future, I can see AirView becoming standard of care for patients on home-based ventilation protocols in many health care systems. Let me now review our Software as a Service business for out-of-hospital care. During the quarter, our SaaS business grew in the mid-single digits year-on-year across our portfolio of markets, including home medical equipment as well as facility-based and home-based care settings. The continued growth of home-based care is providing tailwinds for our home medical equipment and our home health products, and we continue to grow with customers as they utilize our software and data solutions, including Brightree and Snap ReSupply to improve and optimize business efficiencies and patient care. The COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging for some verticals in our SaaS business, particularly skilled nursing facilities. However, we are seeing positive trends as census rates of patients improve across SNFs and other facility-based care settings. We will continue to watch this closely as COVID cases ebb and flow at slower and slower rates around the country. We expect there to be pent-up demand for technology investments in these SaaS verticals, which provides opportunities for us to increase our new customer pipeline as COVID restrictions continue to ease. As we look at our portfolio of software solutions, we expect SaaS revenue to accelerate, increasing from mid single-digit growth to high single-digit growth by the back end of this fiscal year. As always, our goal is to meet or beat these market growth rates as we continue to innovate and take market share. We are the leading strategic provider of SaaS solutions for out-of-hospital care, and we provide mission-critical software across a broad set of very attractive markets. We are uniquely positioned, and we have created differentiated value for ResMed with our SaaS portfolio. We are set up for sustainable growth through ongoing innovation investments, commercial excellence partnerships and future acceleration through strategic M&A as well as selective tuck-in M&A opportunities. Looking at the portfolio of ResMed's business across sleep and respiratory care as well as our SaaS solutions, we remain confident in our long-term strategy and our pipeline of innovative solutions. Our patient-centric, physician-centric and provider-centric approach, combined with our unique ResMed culture, means that we are well positioned to continue winning in the vastly underserved respiratory medical markets of sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and other chronic diseases. We are transforming out-of-hospital care at scale. We are leading the market in digital health technology. With over 10 billion nights now, 10 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 15.5 million, 100% cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide, we are unlocking value from these data to help patients, providers, physicians, payers and entire health care systems. Our mission and goal to improve 250 million lives through better healthcare in 2025, drives and motivates me and ResMedians every day. We again made excellent progress toward that goal this quarter. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude and thanks to the more than 8,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication during these ongoing and unprecedented times. You, our ResMed team, have helped save the lives of many hundreds of thousands of people around the world with COVID-19, with those emergency needs these last 18 months. And you are now and you have now already pivoted back to provide ongoing support for all of our customers during some of the most challenging industry dynamics that we've seen in the industry. Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we'll open the call up for Q&A. Brett?\nBrett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. As noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. Group revenue for the September quarter was $904 million, an increase of 20%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 19%. Revenue growth reflected increased demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices, driven by both sleep patient flow recovering from the COVID-19 impacted reduced levels experienced in the prior year quarter and by increased demand in response to the recent product recall by one of our competitors. In the September quarter, we estimate the incremental revenue from COVID-19-related demand was approximately $4 million compared to $40 million estimated incremental revenue from COVID-19-related demand in the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related revenue in both the September 2021 and September 2020 quarters, our global revenue increased by 25% on a constant currency basis. Looking forward, we expect negligible revenue from COVID-19-related demand. In relation to the impact of our competitors' recall, we estimate that we generated incremental device revenue in the range of $80 million to $90 million in the September quarter. Taking a look at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business, our sales in US, Canada and Latin America countries were $491 million, an increase of 22%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $315 million, an increase of 23% and or an increase of 21% in constant currency terms. By product segment, US, Canada and Latin America device sales were $276 million, an increase of 40%. Masks and other sales were $215 million, an increase of 5%. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales totaled $218 million, an increase of 24% or in constant currency terms, a 22% increase. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $97 million, an increase of 21% or in constant currency terms, an 18% increase. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 31%, while masks and other sales increased by 8%. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related sales in both the current quarter and the prior year quarter, global device sales increased by 44% in constant currency terms, while masks and other sales increased by 10% in constant currency terms. Software as a Service revenue for the September quarter was $98 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. For the balance of fiscal year 2022, we expect several factors will drive demand, including the general recovery of the global sleep market from COVID-19 impacts, the ongoing launch of our next-generation AirSense 11 platform into additional markets and geographies and share gains during our competitors' recall. However, as reported last quarter, while we are working hard to increase manufacturing output, we will not be able to meet the expected demand resulting from our competitors' recall, primarily because of significant and ongoing supply constraints for electronic components. As Mick discussed earlier, we're operating in a very dynamic supply chain environment. Based on the latest information available, we continue to expect component supply constraints will limit the incremental device revenue resulting from our competitors' recall to somewhere between $300 million and $350 million for fiscal year 2022. This includes the device revenue we were able to generate in Q1. In particular, we now do not see any improvement in our component supply position until our fourth quarter of FY 2022. During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin decreased by 270 basis points to 57.2% in the September quarter compared to 59.9% in the same quarter last year. The decrease is predominantly attributable to higher manufacturing and freight costs, ASP declines and unfavorable currency movements, which has been partially offset by a positive product mix, particularly in relation to strong growth of our higher acuity devices. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the first quarter were $177 million, an increase of 11% or in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 10% compared to the prior year period. The increase was predominantly attributable to an increase in employee-related expenses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 19.5% compared to the 21.1% we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the balance of fiscal year 2022. R&D expenses for the quarter were $60 million, an increase of 10% on a constant currency basis, an increase of 9%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.6% compared to 7.3% in the prior year quarter. We continue to make significant investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product and solutions development will deliver a sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of 7% for the balance of fiscal year 2022. Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $19 million for the quarter, and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $17 million. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $281 million, an increase of 18%, underpinned by strong revenue growth. During the quarter, we finalized the deed of settlement with the Australian Taxation Office, or ATO, covering transit pricing audits for the years 2009 through 2018, and also agreed on transfer pricing principles for the future. In anticipation of this settlement, we had previously estimated and recorded an accounting tax reserve of $249 million, net of credits and deductions in our FY 2021 financial results. In relation to the conclusion of the settlement in the current quarter, we recorded an additional GAAP tax expense of $4 million associated with lower tax credits, which were driven by foreign currency movements. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 21.3%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%. Looking forward, we estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2022 will be in the range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $222 million, an increase of 20%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.51, an increase of 19%. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $204 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.39. We had negative cash flow from operations for the quarter of $66 million due to the payment of $285 million to the Australian Taxation Office associated with the deed of settlement. After adjusting for this payment, our operating cash flow for the quarter was $219 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by increases in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $27 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter September totaled $39 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $61.2 million. We recorded equity losses of $1.4 million in our income statement in the September quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. We expect to report equity losses of approximately $2 million per quarter through the balance of fiscal year 2022 associated with the joint venture operations. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $276 million. At September 30, we had $806 million gross debt and $530 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. And at September 30, we had almost $1.5 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, reflecting the Board's confidence in our operating performance. Our solid cash flow and low leverage provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest for growth through R&D. We will also likely continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions such as [indiscernible] Health and EctoSense, an acquisition we made on October 1. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Brett, and thanks, Mick. Kevin, I'd like to now turn the call back over to you to provide instructions and then run the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting your question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Your line is now live.\nMatthew Mishan: Good afternoon and I hope everyone is doing well. Mick, the first question is how do you ensure that your devices are going to new patient fits versus a replacement device for Phillips?\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Matthew. Well, it's easy in markets where we're fully vertically integrated, like Germany, South Korea, and other markets worldwide Australia, New Zealand and others and we're able to work directly with those patients and the doctors to make that happen. It is more difficult in other markets like France or the US where we've worked through providers. But it's been pretty clear from our competitor there that they want people to go and register the devices, and they're going to focus, they said 12 months on just replacing those devices. And frankly, that's theoretical and legal duty to go do that. And so they are laser-focused on that. And so our work is to make sure -- we see the demand from patients directly in those vertically integrated markets and through distributors. And we're pretty confident that the vast, vast, vast majority of our devices go to new patients. There may be some going to replacement patients who are going online or going through certain aspects to get around and go faster than the Philips process, but certainly, the vast majority are going to new patients. The challenge for us is that the demand of being the number one player and also covering as much of the demand of the number two players as possible. We've reached the capacity of those critical components coming in the front end. And so we're not even able to meet all of that new patient demand with -- due to those supply chain constraints.\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nChris Cooper: Thanks for taking my question. Look, Mick, I know when you set the guidance of $300 million to $350 million for the recall, you were sort of unable to quantify masks and reluctant to do so. I was just hoping for an update today on whether you are seeing, in fact, any associated benefit on your mask sales due to the significant increase in CPAP that you've seen in the quarter?\nMick Farrell: Yes. Thanks, Chris. It's a great question. And as you know, we don't provide detailed guidance and we sort of went further than we ever did because of the wide variety of sell-side estimates of what the incremental revenue could be. And we gave that last quarter. We gave that $300 million to $350 million device rough guidance, right? It's not perfect because we're predicting 12 months out in a very uncertain environment. And as Brett just reiterated, we're sticking with that, knowing that we actually had $80 million to $90 million during this quarter that comes out of that, right, and then we've got the remainder to go fight for those components and be able to deliver that over the next nine months. In the mask side, it's a very complicated story, and there's a number of moving factors, and we can get into this, and I can handle Jim Hollingshead, who runs our Sleep & Respiratory Care, can give further detail on this question or if there's a follow-up question on it. But what I can say on mask is we're not going to give public guidance around it, but there's a number of moving factors. You saw our mask growth during the quarter, it was globally at 8%, and the US market was around 5%. The headwinds we have is that, while our number two competitor is not serving as many new patients as they should, and we're not able to take all that demand, there are less new patients being set up. And ResMed -- no matter what the device was, ResMed had a very good, well above 50% uptake rate of those new masks on new devices, no matter who was the manufacturer. And so that's a headwind for our business if there's a new patient that's not getting any therapy. And then the tailwinds would be, which are not as high in volume, but the tailwinds would be that when it is a ResMed device, there is a higher probability because they're designed to work together, and they are working better together and a doctor who loves our devices often likes our masks and same with the sleep technician and the sleep therapist and a respiratory therapist, they often like the brands across the technology spectrum and ResMed's the leader in that we do get a very good uptake on that. So there's some upgrade on the adherence rate to a ResMed device, but there's a headwind of -- even with a competitor device, if there's no device out there, there is less mask sales happening. And thus, you have the sort of 5% growth in the US masks, while we're limited on the ability as an industry to take care of that upfront demand. I think that's about as much color as I can go into it without quantifying it for you. But I can tell you, it's a complex moving equation for us to model at a customer basis and a country level, so I can understand the difficulty for folks on the sell side as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Low from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nDavid Low: Thanks. Mick, if I could just get you to touch on the guidance, the $300 million to $350 million. I mean, given we've seen $80 million to $90 million come through this quarter. Could we just talk a little bit about how you expect this to be phased through the rest of the year, given the supply side constraints, please?\nMick Farrell: Yes. Thanks, David. And as I said in the prep remarks, there's a perfect storm hitting the industry. And so there's so many dynamics impacting us that I'm going to call this afternoon working on this. I'm shifting my attention, which usually focuses purely on customers and governments and making sure the demand is there for this is an amazing industry that we serve and sleep apnea and asthma, and I'm spending a lot more time with suppliers. So with that, our best reading of the future flow of components is that, you look at it, and as Brett said in the prepared remarks, that we actually had reasonably good flow, some through inventory and working through that in the quarter of $80 million to $90 million here in the first quarter. It's going to be very difficult here in the December quarter with component shortages and very difficult in the March quarter with component shortages. I do think the components, as we are getting some increased signals and actually doing some great engineering to work around different suppliers and to design in new components. I feel much more confident about the June quarter 2022, so our Q4 fiscal year 2022. And so that's sort of qualitative guidance to it. We're not modeling it out. We've got the $300 million to $350 million. You can subtract off the $80 million to $90 million and model it. But if I was looking at it, it would be tougher in December and tougher in March right now and then freeing up in the June quarter and then September quarter, even more so as some of our new designs and new components get to roll in and we get that flow going. But look, it's changing day by day, week by week. I'm looking forward to my call this afternoon to potentially impact that. But even if I get agreement with someone today, it takes quite a while, as I explained sort of with that example of the five levels deep in the supply chain to get that to flow through from a foundry, to a chip manufacturer, to our factory, to a product, to the warehouse to then be able to sell it to a customer. So I know that's not a specific quantitative guidance, David. It's probably the best I can give you in terms of color for fiscal year 2022. And the hope we have in Q4 and Q1 2023, as we start to see those components really start to free up.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.\nSuraj Kalia: Hi, Mick. I hope everyone is safe and healthy. Hey Mick, specifically, on the Philips recall, if I could, could you walks us through the dynamics in the U.S. versus OUS? How sticky are these share gains? And unless our math is wrong, it almost comes across like there is some sort of mix and match on the masks versus the devices. Just give us some additional color. And really what we are trying to understand is, okay, you get $350 million, $400 million, whatever million incremental, how sticky are these? And how do you all plan for this? Thank you for taking my questions.\nMick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Suraj. And since I've answered the first three, I'll just correct that our guidance was $300 million to $350 million, not $350 million to $400 million, what you just said, but $300 million to $350 million 0 for the fiscal year. But Jim Hollingshead, you run this business. Do you want to do you give as much as you can on the color to Suraj?\nJim Hollingshead: Sure. Thanks, Suraj, for the question. I think it's a very good question. And I'm just going to back up to what we're trying to do in the business, independent of the recall and then talk about the context of the recall. With the launch of AirSense 11, our aim is to put in place a product that once again significantly improves the patient experience and significantly improves workflows and lower costs for providers and also puts us in the position midterm, long-term to improve outcomes. So AirSense 11 is a device that we put on market anticipating long-term share gain. And we have internal goals for that number. And we don't talk about that number publicly, but our plan was to take share with that device. We're launching that device now into a situation where the number two player in the market is out of the market for new patients. And so obviously, we're going to take quite a lot of share, as we can put that product into the market. And we have the two best products on the market in AirSense 10 and AirSense11. So your question is how sticky will that share be? Our goal is to make it quite sticky. But obviously, we have good competitors in this market, and we don't anticipate landing at 100% share, when they recall clears, but we want to have a number that's higher than what it was before we launched AirSense 11, and we're pretty confident we can do that. And just to cap on that, the answer is probably already too long, but to cap on that, I will say that we've managed to take a few points of mass share during the recall as well, and our aim would be to keep some of that share as well. So I think we will emerge from this stronger, than when we entered it. And our offerings are clearly the best offerings on the market.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Gretel Janu from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is now live.\nGretel Janu: Thanks. Good morning everyone. Just on U.S. mask, I just wanted to touch a little bit more on that, given that it did disappoint slightly versus expectations. So has there been any change to the ReSupply dynamics in the U.S. market in the quarter?\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Gretel. I'll have a go and maybe Jim can join in as well. But I get the ReSupply is actually very strong. We have Brightree ReSupply. We also have Snap technology that has been incorporated into our Brightree platform that has driven incredible ReSupply. If you remember, that really was going strong throughout 2020. So we have some incredibly high comps when you look at the percentage growth rate of masks from this quarter a year ago, even despite COVID hitting this time a year ago, our mask ReSupply and maybe because of that somewhat with the HMEs focusing on it, our mask ReSupply was through the roof this time of a year ago. And even with those comps, we're still achieving some very good rates in ReSupply. As I said, there are headwinds in it when we're not taking care of all new patients and ResMed gets well over 50% of all marks, some new patients, no matter whose device it is in the global market. That's a headwind that we're dealing with while this recall continues. But the tailwinds of ReSupply are actually well incorporated into those figures. And I think if you look outside the U.S. market, look at Europe, Asia and the other 140 countries we operate in, you saw pretty strong 18% double-digit growth in masks in those areas and global growth of around 8%, which is very strong given the headwinds of new patient setups. But Jim, any further color on the U.S. or beyond?\nJim Hollingshead: Yeah. I would just say, probably end up repeating some of the key points, but we had a very large comp. And there was a tailwind created by COVID, which is patients, we've talked about this before over the last three or four quarters, but patients are more focused on having clean masks. I mean COVID has created a mentality, if I want a new mask; I want a fresh mask for patients. And then our HME customers in the U.S. have been focused on driving resupply into their installed base of patients. And I actually think that within the context of the Philips recall, driving revenue out of the installed base of patients has once again become quite an important emphasis for our HME customers. And then there are the headwinds. The headwinds of the whole market is not being served, so new patient starts are down. And because we had slower new patient starts during the span of COVID overall, because labs weren't open, there's a little bit of headwind on resupply, because the installed base didn't grow during that period the way we might have anticipated it to. So it balances out. The dynamic inside of the installed base is quite good. So the installed base of patients continue to be resupplied at a very healthy rate.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Craig Wong-Pan from RBC. Your line is now live.\nCraig Wong-Pan: Thanks. Just the question for me was on the different regions, which are trending below pre-COVID levels and which ones are above. Could you just give any color which different markets are and in which category? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Craig. I'll hand that to Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer.\nRob Douglas: Yes. Thanks, Craig. The issue really is that all of our markets are performing very strongly. The actual recall impacts it global. So we're seeing that really excess demand. And just with different dynamics, as Mick said before, you saw that very strong in the mask on all of it. I actually couldn't call out any particular region and saying it wasn't doing really well. There are specific countries, and sometimes it's local when there's a lockdown, there might be a shortage of diagnosis capacity, and you'll see that. But our teams really run through that and manage around that. And as I said, just to recap, the strong performance was across all countries.\nMick Farrell: Yes. And I'll add on maybe just a little bit of color there, Craig. I mean it's hard to say, because you said, what regions, and as Rob said, we can't say what regions. And even if you would ask a more specific question, what countries. It'd be difficult to say there, because in the U.S., there are 50 states with all different regulations, and some of them are 100% plus capacity and some are at 75%, 80% within the state level. And then cities going up and down, and China is not just there. It's different regions there as well. So there are ebbs and flows on a daily, weekly, monthly. But what we can say is on aggregate, it is getting better and better. And it's nice to see some cities, some states, some countries at 100% plus that they're getting through it, they're finding ways to embrace digital health, home sleep apnea testing and remote setup, so that we're able to get the flow of patients going through. Then the challenge we have right now is that we don't have the components of those patients with prescriptions come through to meet all that demand, which is the real critical rate limited right now as well. Thanks for your question, Craig.\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question today is coming from David Bailey from Macquarie. Your line is now live.\nDavid Bailey: Thanks very much. Good morning, Mick and Brett. Just as part of the recall, ResMed is going to be getting more exposure through the patient referral network. I'm just wondering if you've had any feedback or observations from physician, DMEs, patients in relation to RedMed's product offering. Just wondering if there's any observations from that group that may have used ResMed less frequently before.\nMick Farrell: Yes, David, it's a good question. I think everyone had exposure to ResMed products. We're the market leader, everyone knew the brand name. Everyone had tried it, and we get a large percentage of the prescriptions and actually the share in the 140 countries we operate in. But as you said, there are some doctors who liked a particular aspect or a technical aspect or an emotional aspect really or a workflow aspect of some of our competitors' devices or software systems. And to your question, they are getting, if you like, forced exposure, because it's the only one available for new patients, to ResMed's amazing innovation on the device, the software, the systems and the flow. And if they had some form of prejudice of device from the '90s that they tried or something and have been stuck with the brand, they're now trying a new brand. And I do think, to Jim's point earlier, that some of that brand-new share of somebody who was in another brand's componentry area says, wow, this actually is great. My prejudice was wrong. And I think we will get a lot of that share that we'll maintain forever. And I think certainly, the exposure of patients to the brands and to understand that has increased. I mean, the Net Promoter Score for ResMed amongst patients is rising, and the knowledge about the brands, for better or for worse, through this awful recall is, they're getting to know what device they have. And that awareness is actually good for the whole industry, because I think physicians and providers and technicians have always been aware of the brands and had prescription biases and others that we absolutely influence through our really strong commercial, clinical sales teams. And now we're getting that brand name to new customers as well. So I mean, the short answer to your question is, yes, we've got exposure to new consumers, new physicians, new providers. And we think a lot of that will be sticky because of the value we provide. The brand is the brand that represents 50% lower labor cost if you're setting up a patient when it represents three less clicks to get a report, when it reflects an API that can link into your Epic or your Cerner or your National Health Trust system, really efficiently, it becomes really part of your day-to-day workflow. And that's the type of share that we think is part of the ResMed brand and will maintain our strong growth for a long period to come through for this period.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is now live.\nMaggie Boeye: This is Maggie Boeye on for Margaret. I wanted to ask one on gross margins today. I would say that the gross margins for the quarter came in a little bit better than expected, although still contracting. Can you talk about some of the dynamics within that and how you are leveraging the increase in cost given the supply constraints and the freight issues today? And how you are looking at future gross margins specifically in the upcoming quarters? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Yes. Brett, I'll hand that question to you.\nBrett Sandercock: Yes. Thanks, Mick. Hi, Maggie. Yes, the gross margin is pretty consistent with where we were at Q4. And the big impact we're still seeing is on freight costs, that's been really significant. So we've been -- that's a big headwind for us. So that's in it, some FX impacts. I think we've had a deal with which is heading this quarter as well. We were -- we did have a little bit of benefit on product mix with the higher acuity devices. So I think of the level Astral sellers, ASV devices they helped the total product mix this quarter, which helps on the gross margin side. So that was a little bit of a tailwind for us. But having said all that, there's still challenges, still pressures on freight still pressures that will come through on component costs and so on as well. So we need to keep an eye on that, but product mix has been quite good for us and that's helped. Yes. So overall, pretty pleased with how the gross margin ended up for the quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nSean Laaman: Thank you. Good morning, Mick. Good morning team. Great set of numbers. Mick, I know you typically don't give sort of much discussion around what you've observed on price in the quarter or on product mix. But that said, you've talked to the supply constraints, yet you've delivered the device numbers that you have. How would you -- or could you help us characterize what you've observed on the price/volume mix somehow in the quarter? Thanks, Mick.\nMick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Sean. And you're right, we don't provide details around pricing. But look, clearly, this is -- these are unprecedented times, costs. As you saw, and even just in Brett's last answer there around gross margin and going up. Freight costs, I mean, sea freight, there are over 100 ships just two hours north of me here on the I5 stack outside Long Beach that can't get through. So the sea freight inventory sitting there. It's coming through higher cost than it's ever been. Air freight, we have literally chartered planes to fly from Singapore to L.A. and Singapore to Atlanta to get our products to market with this demand. And so those types of things increase costs dramatically. And we have to do that. They're actually consumer planes, but no consumers in them and literally just ResMed device is taking off the seats and overhead, and so that has impacted our costs. One thing we are doing is with AirSense 11, we are launching that with a price premium. It is excellent innovation. It is not just the best in ResMed for eight years, it's the best in the market, I think, ever, as a platform. And so that deserves a price premium, and so we will be extracting that. And look, we have been working with customers and eliminating some certain discounts and rebates and other things that we had used in the past because those don't apply now. And so we're eliminating some of those costs. And look, this is a customer-by-customer, region-by-region discussion that happens on a daily basis with our commercial team. But clearly, we cannot take all of the costs that have been given to us, and we are working with since launch and with appropriate removal of other elements and pricing conditions with customers on a customer basis to address this over time. But our goal -- our laser-focused goal is to make sure we take care of every patient that comes through the channel. And I think that's what you saw during this last quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Your line is now live.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. This is Frank on for Anthony. Two questions from our side. Number one, what's the reception to Philips' recent US clearance of the replacement the abatement among US DMEs? And then a follow-up. We're hearing a lot on US hospital staffing shortages. Is there a potential tailwind for Matrix Care, or what are some of the dynamics there looking ahead for the rest of the year?\nMick Farrell: Thanks for the questions, Frank. Look, I actually have no idea what customers are thinking of the replacement phone versus the replacement devices for our competitor. That's their job to take care of that. If I was a patient, I'd want to replace a device. I wouldn't want to replaced phone. That's what I'd say. But I have no idea on that. It's a very, very lack of strong communication that I've seen publicly on that. And I can tell you, as N equals one, I have nothing to add to that. But on the US hospital front, I do think, as I said in my prepared remarks, that we are seeing facilities-based SaaS -- the census rates at skilled nursing facilities are starting to pick up the numbers of patients in beds is picking up. And we actually think -- as you said, that there's a pent-up demand for technology to help with that. But Rob, do you have any further color on MatrixCare and the Brightree home health and hospice?\nRob Douglas: Absolutely. It's actually an underpinning of our SaaS strategy that it's been a long-term issue that getting the right staff and keeping them and dealing with the cost of training them and getting staff who are providing really good patient experience has been a big challenge for all of these care providers, not just hospitals. And so we believe that our technology solutions actually make life better for the staff, make it easier for them to do the job, easier to get trained, and more likely to stay on the job and also more efficient. So, staffing challenges actually are another driver of our strategy, just like as Jim mentioned earlier, the concerns about cleanliness and respiratory health are a driver of our core sleep strategy, these staffing shortages and challenges do drive our SaaS strategy long-term. And long-term, that will be a tailwind for the business. Many, many short-term factors going on there. But we've -- as Mick said earlier, we're seeing good improved performance despite challenging times, particularly for skilled busing facilities across our SaaS businesses.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden. Your line is now live.\nSteve Wheen: Thanks. Good afternoon Mick. I just wanted to ask, I imagine it's quite difficult to differentiate what sales of devices are relating or going into the Philips opportunity versus the organic growth of your business. But if I do strip out the $90 million out of your device revenues for this quarter and then strip out the $40 million of vent sales in the PCP, you're getting in excess of 20% growth. Is that how you characterize what's going on with the new patient starts?\nMick Farrell: Steve, thanks for the question. And yes, good morning to you there in Australia. I think you're not wrong that we would have very strong double-digit growth. And that actually makes sense and has traditionally happened when we launch a new product like the AirSense 11 as our first platform launch in eight years. And as I said in my prep remarks, I mean, I'm blown away by things like the personal care system, watching the care check-in personal therapies or watching the sleep technicians and sleep doctors live at that California Sleep Society engage not just with the presentation from the marketing teams, but then sitting down with the clinical teams and walking through this device, I think it's a device that deserves to take double-digit growth and take a lot of share. And so I think your calculations there are spot on in terms of this is a double-digit growth time for ResMed in the device space irrespective of this competitive recall, irrespective of the comps that we had around COVID and vents and the tailwinds of vents and headwinds of sleep apnea patients coming in a year ago that we're seeing really strong growth of the sleep space. And as Jim said earlier, our goal is to entrench people in these amazing workflows that have lower costs and better outcomes and drive therapy to patients in ways never seen before. The part that I'd highlight is this huge take-up of patients signing on to Mya and having a personal relationship with their therapy through the smartphone with Mya is at unprecedented levels. I'm talking double the uptake of AirSense 10. That's one of the highlights that I think has been missed through this. So, Steve, thanks for the question and the opportunity to highlight that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Deakin-Bell from Citigroup. Your line is now live.\nJohn Deakin-Bell: Thank you. I was just hoping to get a little more color on where you think the sleep testing capacity is in the market. Are we back to pre-pandemic levels? So just give us a little more color on new patients and where you think that is kind of trended over the last couple of quarters.\nMick Farrell: Great question, John. I'll hand that to Jim Hollingshead.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, John. As we said in Mick's prepared remarks, testing capacity is mostly back to normal. I would say, in the US market, we're mostly back to normal, and there's actually probably some upside into that because a number of sleep labs increasingly during the COVID crisis, home sleep testing was more readily adopted by sleep labs and maybe would not have taken it on before. And so probably -- you still probably got slightly fewer people going to labs but a much broader use of home sleep testing. And I think in general, you can say in the US, testing capacity is back to normal, maybe a little bit up, although the shape of it looks a little bit different. And then other reasons, it's really -- it varies quite a lot by what's happened with the Delta variant, what's happened with health care systems. But in general, I would say new patient starts in, say, Europe, are coming back to pre-COVID normal. Some countries are a little bit different. And in some cases, you've still got health systems that are a little bit backed up, right? So especially in hospital-based systems the diagnosis may be back up, but the actual capacity to set patients up on therapy may be now a bit of the bottleneck. So there's pent-up demand and things like that. But I would say, in general, we're almost back to normal. And I would add to that, one of the reasons we decided to move forward with the acquisition of Ectosense is that we really want to make it much easier for patients to understand whether or not they have a sleeping issue. So in some markets Ectosense will be used as a screener. And in some markets, Ectosense is already used as a diagnostic tool. But the patient experience with that technology is really, really simple, really easy to do. And so we're working with that acquisition to open up the funnel even further.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nLyanne Harrison: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to talk about inventory levels a little bit, both at ResMed and also at the distributors. So in your balance sheet, I see higher inventory levels compared to last quarter. Can you talk about what that might mean for device sales going into second quarter? But then also, if we look at the different regions you're operating in, from our perspective, we're seeing greater bottlenecks at set up in the United States than in Europe. So do you have a sense of what inventory levels are like with your distributors between the United States and Europe?\nMick Farrell: So that's a great question, Lyanne, and quite detailed. I'll hand the first part of the question about ResMed's inventory and what's been happening with the build up there to, Brett. And then I'll hand the second part about the inventory at the HMEs, HCPs and distributors, as they call them in Europe, between the US and Europe to Jim Hollingshead. So Brett, over to you first, and then Jim\nBrett Sandercock: Yes. Thanks, Mick. Hi, Lyanne. Yes, on the inventory that -- a lot of that field reflects the components of raw materials part of our inventory. And we're really -- it's really in response, I think, to the elongation of supply chains and the bottlenecks and congestions that we're seeing. We are looking to support production for any upside in electronic components. So it says there's a lot of components that are ready to go once we get electronic components. So we've been pretty deliberate on that. We're looking to increase safety stocks as well, really just trying to deal with these supply disruptions. And the other big one we're seeing is that just with the increased sea freight, air freight, lead times, it's sort of blowing out to two, up to four weeks. So that's kind of more inventory that we're carrying, and I think probably a lot of companies will see that as well. So those logistics delays, I think, are causing a lot more, what I call, stock in transit coming through as well. So it's a combination of those factors. We're also running, for example, the dual AS 10, AS 11 platforms, and that's really there to support demand into the market. So we're doing that as well, which might be a little more unusual than what we would typically do. So the combination of those factors is really driving up our inventory levels a little bit low. Inventory days have been reasonable. So that's really trying to support overall production when we get those components in, I think, is the crux and the thesis there.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming...\nMick Farrell: Hold on. Sorry, Jim is going to answer the second part of that.\nJim Hollingshead: I'll just add to Lyanne's -- no, that's fine. I'll just add to second half of Lyanne's question, which is, I think it's very safe to say that our customers and distributors have very little inventory. They are running right now, I think, with unusually low inventory levels. And so when you take the number two manufacturer out of the market and you under serve the market, it creates a very, very difficult situation. So we're reporting what we think is obviously a strong quarter, but we are working frantically to lift our manufacturing supply and deliver product to market. And as an industry, the manufacturers in this industry are under-serving demand. And so it's put our customers in a very difficult situation, and they're frustrated and we understand that they're frustrated. And we're doing the very best we can to build products as fast as we can and deliver it as fast as we can because we know that the market is undersupplied, and it's putting our customers under a great deal of pressure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey. Your line is now live.\nSaul Hadassin: Thanks very much, guys. Apologies, if the line a bit crackly. But Mick, just a quick question on SaaS, you mentioned growth increasing to the upper single digit by the end of fiscal 2020. Can you just talk to what the drivers of that increase are what the key drivers of that uplift are likely to be give you that confidence?\nMick Farrell: Yeah. Thanks. I'll start and hand to Rob maybe for some further details. Look, we have Bobby Ghoshal, our new President of the SaaS division. And I can tell you, he's hitting the ground running these last five weeks. He's been in there. And certainly, we're seeing some great opportunities for accelerating growth. I think, look, the externalities that I talked about in the prep remarks that we covered earlier, that skilled nursing facility census is coming back, so demand is coming back. And we see the book, the pipeline book starting to build up. And in a SaaS business, that's great because when the pipeline builds up, you get the conversions and then it turns into revenue. So we get pretty good visibility, even three, six, nine months out to seeing sort of an acceleration of growth. So I feel pretty confident that those census rates and others that census rates are going up and that we are going to see with MatrixCare is really good products, growth in the MatrixCare business to start accelerating there. In addition, Brightree and Snap, although they're annualizing some of the acquisitions of Snap, we're seeing really good adoption of those resupply and some really new innovative tools that the Brightree R&D team are bringing to market. And Bobby was previously COO there and has a good knowledge of that. I think that will accelerate throughout the rest of the fiscal year. But Rob, there's so many -- the eight verticals there. What other elements do you have reasons to believe they can accelerate this business?\nRob Douglas: I think you've covered many of them, Mick, but also there's a real execution focus on the team, and we're really confident that they're driving execution. Mick mentioned the innovation. There's a strong innovation mentality in that team. And we've got great new offerings and great new ideas coming to market as well as really streamlining our focus. And a lot of it's also execution on the sales front and having the sales team being able to build the pipelines and then increasingly doing face-to-face visits in getting these deployments underway as things ease up. So we've got a lot of confidence in that business.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Dan Hurren from MST Marquee. Your line is now live.\nDan Hurren: Good morning. Thanks very much. Just looking at the fourth quarter, you guided to this $300 million to $350 million. And at that time, you were quite explicit that we should not expect the uplift until the second half. And now today, you're suggesting uplift comes in first quarter and fourth quarter, and you delivered almost what, 30% of that total up 54% in the first quarter alone. So \u2013 and on top of that, Brett, has just said you've got the small material inventory build. So can you explain what has \u2013 what's changed since then? And why \u2013 what mechanics of this drop off in second, third quarter would be? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Yeah. Thanks, Dan. So look, it's a complex and moving dynamic. But the rate-limiting step here is electronic components and specifically the semiconductor chips from a particular manufacturing and a supply chain that, I know the names and the people and them talking to them to try and get this supply. The trouble is that there are multiple other industries. And demand for semiconductor chips that are through the roof. And obviously, everyone on this call follows many other industries. You've heard this, we're not alone in medical device industry, automotive industry, consumer communications industry, even consumer products are often cloud connected now and have these limitations. So look, things haven't gone better these last 90 days in terms of supply. They've got very difficult. And our visibility, as I look at the June quarter, I feel very confident in the semiconductor chips coming through. But in December and March, it's hand to mouth of these devices and chartering planes and working with redesigns to make sure the semiconductor chips go so much in. And so our best reading of the dynamics, even though we feel in aggregate, that $300 million and $350 million, which is which is a pretty broad range in itself and has some plus or minus on the top and the bottom end of it, that we feel stronger on that June quarter with the supply that we see coming through, whereas it's not as strong. I'm closer to the December one now, and I know it's going to be tough and March as well. But look, things can change on a day-by-day, week-by-week, month-by-month. And what we're doing is we're being as open as we ever have around supply chain as open as we ever had and transparent about sort of the variability, if you like, of the flow of these components that come in. I can tell you though, we get one more chip, it goes into one more device and goes to one patient. And that's the truth. There is no stockpiling of this inventory. It goes all the way straight through to production. And we have an incredibly efficient plan in Singapore and also in Sydney and also manufacturing in Atlanta, Georgia, and we are not constrained on our internal capacity. As soon as that part comes in, that rate-limiting bottleneck part, it goes on to a product, gets to a customer. And that's what we are focused on. And I'm giving as much color as I can qualitatively around that.\nOperator: Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Farrell for any further closing comments.\nMick Farrell: Well, thanks, Kevin, and thanks again to all of our shareholders for staying on an extra five to seven minutes here and joining us on this call. I'd also like to thank once again the 8,000 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders who listen to this call for their dedication and hard work, helping people breathe better, sleep better and live better lives outside the hospital in 140 countries. Thanks for what you do today and every day. Thanks especially to our ResMed heroes on the front lines during this crisis, patient care, technical service, sales teams working with customers every day, but I'd like to add a special call out to our amazing teams on the front lines of supply chain, management production, distribution, all of you are heroes. Every chip you get is a patient's life change. So, I look forward to talking with you all again all of our stakeholders here in 90 days. Thank you. I'll turn the call back to Amy to close out.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Mick, and thanks, everyone. We appreciate your interest and your time. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out directly. This does conclude our first quarter 2022 call. Kevin, you may now close this out.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Jim Hollingshead",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Suraj, for the question. I think it's a very good question. And I'm just going to back up to what we're trying to do in the business, independent of the recall and then talk about the context of the recall. With the launch of AirSense 11, our aim is to put in place a product that once again significantly improves the patient experience and significantly improves workflows and lower costs for providers and also puts us in the position midterm, long-term to improve outcomes. So AirSense 11 is a device that we put on market anticipating long-term share gain. And we have internal goals for that number. And we don't talk about that number publicly, but our plan was to take share with that device. We're launching that device now into a situation where the number two player in the market is out of the market for new patients. And so obviously, we're going to take quite a lot of share, as we can put that product into the market. And we have the two best products on the market in AirSense 10 and AirSense11. So your question is how sticky will that share be? Our goal is to make it quite sticky. But obviously, we have good competitors in this market, and we don't anticipate landing at 100% share, when they recall clears, but we want to have a number that's higher than what it was before we launched AirSense 11, and we're pretty confident we can do that. And just to cap on that, the answer is probably already too long, but to cap on that, I will say that we've managed to take a few points of mass share during the recall as well, and our aim would be to keep some of that share as well. So I think we will emerge from this stronger, than when we entered it. And our offerings are clearly the best offerings on the market. Yeah. I would just say, probably end up repeating some of the key points, but we had a very large comp. And there was a tailwind created by COVID, which is patients, we've talked about this before over the last three or four quarters, but patients are more focused on having clean masks. I mean COVID has created a mentality, if I want a new mask; I want a fresh mask for patients. And then our HME customers in the U.S. have been focused on driving resupply into their installed base of patients. And I actually think that within the context of the Philips recall, driving revenue out of the installed base of patients has once again become quite an important emphasis for our HME customers. And then there are the headwinds. The headwinds of the whole market is not being served, so new patient starts are down. And because we had slower new patient starts during the span of COVID overall, because labs weren't open, there's a little bit of headwind on resupply, because the installed base didn't grow during that period the way we might have anticipated it to. So it balances out. The dynamic inside of the installed base is quite good. So the installed base of patients continue to be resupplied at a very healthy rate. Thanks, John. As we said in Mick's prepared remarks, testing capacity is mostly back to normal. I would say, in the US market, we're mostly back to normal, and there's actually probably some upside into that because a number of sleep labs increasingly during the COVID crisis, home sleep testing was more readily adopted by sleep labs and maybe would not have taken it on before. And so probably -- you still probably got slightly fewer people going to labs but a much broader use of home sleep testing. And I think in general, you can say in the US, testing capacity is back to normal, maybe a little bit up, although the shape of it looks a little bit different. And then other reasons, it's really -- it varies quite a lot by what's happened with the Delta variant, what's happened with health care systems. But in general, I would say new patient starts in, say, Europe, are coming back to pre-COVID normal. Some countries are a little bit different. And in some cases, you've still got health systems that are a little bit backed up, right? So especially in hospital-based systems the diagnosis may be back up, but the actual capacity to set patients up on therapy may be now a bit of the bottleneck. So there's pent-up demand and things like that. But I would say, in general, we're almost back to normal. And I would add to that, one of the reasons we decided to move forward with the acquisition of Ectosense is that we really want to make it much easier for patients to understand whether or not they have a sleeping issue. So in some markets Ectosense will be used as a screener. And in some markets, Ectosense is already used as a diagnostic tool. But the patient experience with that technology is really, really simple, really easy to do. And so we're working with that acquisition to open up the funnel even further. I'll just add to Lyanne's -- no, that's fine. I'll just add to second half of Lyanne's question, which is, I think it's very safe to say that our customers and distributors have very little inventory. They are running right now, I think, with unusually low inventory levels. And so when you take the number two manufacturer out of the market and you under serve the market, it creates a very, very difficult situation. So we're reporting what we think is obviously a strong quarter, but we are working frantically to lift our manufacturing supply and deliver product to market. And as an industry, the manufacturers in this industry are under-serving demand. And so it's put our customers in a very difficult situation, and they're frustrated and we understand that they're frustrated. And we're doing the very best we can to build products as fast as we can and deliver it as fast as we can because we know that the market is undersupplied, and it's putting our customers under a great deal of pressure."

            "name": "Brett Sandercock",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. As noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. Group revenue for the September quarter was $904 million, an increase of 20%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 19%. Revenue growth reflected increased demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices, driven by both sleep patient flow recovering from the COVID-19 impacted reduced levels experienced in the prior year quarter and by increased demand in response to the recent product recall by one of our competitors. In the September quarter, we estimate the incremental revenue from COVID-19-related demand was approximately $4 million compared to $40 million estimated incremental revenue from COVID-19-related demand in the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related revenue in both the September 2021 and September 2020 quarters, our global revenue increased by 25% on a constant currency basis. Looking forward, we expect negligible revenue from COVID-19-related demand. In relation to the impact of our competitors' recall, we estimate that we generated incremental device revenue in the range of $80 million to $90 million in the September quarter. Taking a look at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business, our sales in US, Canada and Latin America countries were $491 million, an increase of 22%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $315 million, an increase of 23% and or an increase of 21% in constant currency terms. By product segment, US, Canada and Latin America device sales were $276 million, an increase of 40%. Masks and other sales were $215 million, an increase of 5%. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales totaled $218 million, an increase of 24% or in constant currency terms, a 22% increase. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $97 million, an increase of 21% or in constant currency terms, an 18% increase. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 31%, while masks and other sales increased by 8%. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related sales in both the current quarter and the prior year quarter, global device sales increased by 44% in constant currency terms, while masks and other sales increased by 10% in constant currency terms. Software as a Service revenue for the September quarter was $98 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. For the balance of fiscal year 2022, we expect several factors will drive demand, including the general recovery of the global sleep market from COVID-19 impacts, the ongoing launch of our next-generation AirSense 11 platform into additional markets and geographies and share gains during our competitors' recall. However, as reported last quarter, while we are working hard to increase manufacturing output, we will not be able to meet the expected demand resulting from our competitors' recall, primarily because of significant and ongoing supply constraints for electronic components. As Mick discussed earlier, we're operating in a very dynamic supply chain environment. Based on the latest information available, we continue to expect component supply constraints will limit the incremental device revenue resulting from our competitors' recall to somewhere between $300 million and $350 million for fiscal year 2022. This includes the device revenue we were able to generate in Q1. In particular, we now do not see any improvement in our component supply position until our fourth quarter of FY 2022. During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin decreased by 270 basis points to 57.2% in the September quarter compared to 59.9% in the same quarter last year. The decrease is predominantly attributable to higher manufacturing and freight costs, ASP declines and unfavorable currency movements, which has been partially offset by a positive product mix, particularly in relation to strong growth of our higher acuity devices. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the first quarter were $177 million, an increase of 11% or in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 10% compared to the prior year period. The increase was predominantly attributable to an increase in employee-related expenses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 19.5% compared to the 21.1% we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the balance of fiscal year 2022. R&D expenses for the quarter were $60 million, an increase of 10% on a constant currency basis, an increase of 9%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.6% compared to 7.3% in the prior year quarter. We continue to make significant investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product and solutions development will deliver a sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of 7% for the balance of fiscal year 2022. Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $19 million for the quarter, and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $17 million. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $281 million, an increase of 18%, underpinned by strong revenue growth. During the quarter, we finalized the deed of settlement with the Australian Taxation Office, or ATO, covering transit pricing audits for the years 2009 through 2018, and also agreed on transfer pricing principles for the future. In anticipation of this settlement, we had previously estimated and recorded an accounting tax reserve of $249 million, net of credits and deductions in our FY 2021 financial results. In relation to the conclusion of the settlement in the current quarter, we recorded an additional GAAP tax expense of $4 million associated with lower tax credits, which were driven by foreign currency movements. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 21.3%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%. Looking forward, we estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2022 will be in the range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $222 million, an increase of 20%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.51, an increase of 19%. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $204 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.39. We had negative cash flow from operations for the quarter of $66 million due to the payment of $285 million to the Australian Taxation Office associated with the deed of settlement. After adjusting for this payment, our operating cash flow for the quarter was $219 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by increases in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $27 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter September totaled $39 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $61.2 million. We recorded equity losses of $1.4 million in our income statement in the September quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. We expect to report equity losses of approximately $2 million per quarter through the balance of fiscal year 2022 associated with the joint venture operations. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $276 million. At September 30, we had $806 million gross debt and $530 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. And at September 30, we had almost $1.5 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, reflecting the Board's confidence in our operating performance. Our solid cash flow and low leverage provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest for growth through R&D. We will also likely continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions such as [indiscernible] Health and EctoSense, an acquisition we made on October 1. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. Yes. Thanks, Mick. Hi, Maggie. Yes, the gross margin is pretty consistent with where we were at Q4. And the big impact we're still seeing is on freight costs, that's been really significant. So we've been -- that's a big headwind for us. So that's in it, some FX impacts. I think we've had a deal with which is heading this quarter as well. We were -- we did have a little bit of benefit on product mix with the higher acuity devices. So I think of the level Astral sellers, ASV devices they helped the total product mix this quarter, which helps on the gross margin side. So that was a little bit of a tailwind for us. But having said all that, there's still challenges, still pressures on freight still pressures that will come through on component costs and so on as well. So we need to keep an eye on that, but product mix has been quite good for us and that's helped. Yes. So overall, pretty pleased with how the gross margin ended up for the quarter. Yes. Thanks, Mick. Hi, Lyanne. Yes, on the inventory that -- a lot of that field reflects the components of raw materials part of our inventory. And we're really -- it's really in response, I think, to the elongation of supply chains and the bottlenecks and congestions that we're seeing. We are looking to support production for any upside in electronic components. So it says there's a lot of components that are ready to go once we get electronic components. So we've been pretty deliberate on that. We're looking to increase safety stocks as well, really just trying to deal with these supply disruptions. And the other big one we're seeing is that just with the increased sea freight, air freight, lead times, it's sort of blowing out to two, up to four weeks. So that's kind of more inventory that we're carrying, and I think probably a lot of companies will see that as well. So those logistics delays, I think, are causing a lot more, what I call, stock in transit coming through as well. So it's a combination of those factors. We're also running, for example, the dual AS 10, AS 11 platforms, and that's really there to support demand into the market. So we're doing that as well, which might be a little more unusual than what we would typically do. So the combination of those factors is really driving up our inventory levels a little bit low. Inventory days have been reasonable. So that's really trying to support overall production when we get those components in, I think, is the crux and the thesis there."

            "name": "Rob Douglas",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Craig. The issue really is that all of our markets are performing very strongly. The actual recall impacts it global. So we're seeing that really excess demand. And just with different dynamics, as Mick said before, you saw that very strong in the mask on all of it. I actually couldn't call out any particular region and saying it wasn't doing really well. There are specific countries, and sometimes it's local when there's a lockdown, there might be a shortage of diagnosis capacity, and you'll see that. But our teams really run through that and manage around that. And as I said, just to recap, the strong performance was across all countries. Absolutely. It's actually an underpinning of our SaaS strategy that it's been a long-term issue that getting the right staff and keeping them and dealing with the cost of training them and getting staff who are providing really good patient experience has been a big challenge for all of these care providers, not just hospitals. And so we believe that our technology solutions actually make life better for the staff, make it easier for them to do the job, easier to get trained, and more likely to stay on the job and also more efficient. So, staffing challenges actually are another driver of our strategy, just like as Jim mentioned earlier, the concerns about cleanliness and respiratory health are a driver of our core sleep strategy, these staffing shortages and challenges do drive our SaaS strategy long-term. And long-term, that will be a tailwind for the business. Many, many short-term factors going on there. But we've -- as Mick said earlier, we're seeing good improved performance despite challenging times, particularly for skilled busing facilities across our SaaS businesses. I think you've covered many of them, Mick, but also there's a real execution focus on the team, and we're really confident that they're driving execution. Mick mentioned the innovation. There's a strong innovation mentality in that team. And we've got great new offerings and great new ideas coming to market as well as really streamlining our focus. And a lot of it's also execution on the sales front and having the sales team being able to build the pipelines and then increasingly doing face-to-face visits in getting these deployments underway as things ease up. So we've got a lot of confidence in that business."

            "name": "Mick Farrell",
            "content": "Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our stakeholders for joining us today as we review results for the September quarter, our first quarter of fiscal year 2022. Our first quarter results demonstrate strong performance across our business, buoyed by extremely high demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices as well as continuing recovery of many markets from COVID-19. We achieved double-digit growth at both the top and bottom line metrics of our business. I want to be clear that achieving these results has not been easy this quarter. We are dealing with an unprecedented what I would call perfect storm of elements, including the COVID recovery, but also including a competitor recall that's \u2013 a recall that's ten-fold higher than any in the industry to date, and supply chain constraints that are impacting not only our industry but multiple industries worldwide. I'm incredibly proud of ResMedians across our global teams, many of whom are working 24x7 to get our products and solutions into the hands of patients who need them most. Despite these extraordinary efforts, we know that we have not been able to meet all of the demand. As the market leader, our competitor, that is in the number two market share position, announced a recall mid-June that has created unprecedented dislocations in the market. In effect, we are facing the challenge of providing the volume for our own number one market share position and also trying to meet as much of their number two market share position as possible around the world. Given the supply chain crisis, our suppliers have been allocating components to us on the inbound side. We have, in turn, been forced to allocate our products on the outbound side to our customers. We have been clear on the guiding principles for that allocation of our products, namely that we are giving priority for production and delivery of our devices to meet the needs of the highest acuity patients first. The allocation conversations that I have with our customers are the same ones that I am having with my suppliers and their suppliers and so on up the supply chain. As an example, during the quarter, I was on a Zoom call with one of our suppliers, suppliers, suppliers, suppliers, suppliers, suppliers, and I'm not kidding. We achieved our goal with that manufacturer. And we received increased allocation from that manufacturer. But then we face the challenge and are still facing it of working with the five customers of theirs, all the way down that chain to get to us to ensure that the agreed upon increased allocation of that component actually gets to ResMed, gets manufactured into ResMed products and then sent to ResMed customers and ultimately to patients. That's just one example of a high degree of difficulty dive for our supply chain team. The supply chain analysis and negotiations are ongoing, and the situation is very fluid, changing day by day, week by week and month by month. We have an incredible Six Sigma Black Belt laden team of supply chain specialists working on these issues 24/7. In short, supply bottlenecks continue to restrict our access to critical electronic components, especially semiconductor chips that ultimately limit our net production output. In addition to component supply issues, the ongoing challenges of seafreight and airfreight from manufacturing facilities to distribution warehouses and ultimately, the customers are increasing our costs and further impacting our ability to respond as rapidly as we want to the huge demand for ResMed products. The combination of component shortages and transportation bottlenecks makes providing steady and smooth flow of products to the market very difficult. We are working incredibly closely with our global supply chain partners, doing everything we can to gain access to additional supply of the critical components that we need to further increase production of our medical devices. We will continue to coordinate with all stakeholders as the situation develops. We understand that this is a difficult situation for all of our customer groups, including physicians, home medical equipment providers, payers and the most important customer, the patient. Our number one priority will always be patients, doing our best to help those who need treatment for sleep apnea, for COPD, for asthma and for other chronic respiratory diseases as well as critical out-of-hospital care. Our goal is to ensure that patients get the therapy that they need, where they need it and when they need it. Let's now discuss the overall market conditions in our industry. We are seeing a steady ongoing recovery of demand in the countries that we operate in. They remain at various stages of the post-COVID peak recovery process in terms of new patient flow. We are still seeing a divergence in total patient flow and sleep lab capacity from 75% to 95% of pre-COVID levels in some countries, up to 100% plus of pre-COVID levels in others. These metrics will continue to ebb and flow as vaccines and boosters roll out globally and as new variants of the coronavirus arise and cause temporary perturbations. Our global ResMed team remains committed to working with national, state and city governments as well as local health systems, hospitals and health care providers to supply the ventilators, the masks and the training for acute care and the transition home for affected patients. Let me now update you on our three strategic priorities as we pivot back to grow our core business. These three are one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses; two, to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and especially in the home. In August, we launched our next-generation device platform that we call AirSense 11 into the United States market. In short, that launch has been very successful. We will be introducing the AirSense 11 into additional countries very soon. Our market-leading R&D team accelerated the launch of this amazing innovation. First, by expanding the controlled product launch to additional customers, and then accelerating to an earlier full product launch date to bring this product to market faster. Globally, we continue to sell our market-leading legacy platform, the AirSense 10, to maximize the total volume of CPAP, APAP and by levels available for customers. Clearly, the ongoing adoption of both the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11 platforms remains very, very strong. It's still early into the SirSense 11 launch, but initial customer feedback, combined with the detailed responses to our controlled product launch, tells me that the AirSense 11 is another success for ResMed. Physician, provider and patient feedback are all very positive. I was able to attend the California Sleep Society meeting in person, actually, during the quarter, and I was able to observe firsthand the responses to the latest innovations on the AirSense 11, such as personal therapy assistant, care check-in and the incredible rate of uptake of the patient-centric app called myAir, which has been upgraded for AirSense 11. And the uptake on that is almost double what it was for the myAir app than the AirSense 10. What's clear to me is that this platform, the AirSense 11, benefits not only patients and their bed partners, in addition, the device and software combination benefits physicians, it benefits providers and it benefits payers as well as entire healthcare systems with more data, more insights and better outcomes. As a 2-way digital health comms platform with many technical features that represent significant therapeutic advances, AirSense 11 is not only easy to set up and use, it also offers a very rich patient-centric experience. All AirSense 11 devices are 100% cloud connectable with upgraded digital health technology that is able to increase patient adherence to improve clinical outcomes and to deliver proven cost reductions within healthcare providers and physicians own health systems. We are engaging with patients in their therapy digitally like never before in the industry. This is a critical part of the ResMed 2025 strategy, as presented at our Investor Day, which we held virtually during this last quarter. Another key aspect of our long-term growth is linked to the awareness and the increasing flow of sleep apnea patients. With 936 million sleep apnea sufferers worldwide, this work is critical to our mission. COVID-19 has advanced awareness, adoption and acceptance of digital health and remote care, including home-based sleep apnea tests. We want to support seamless and cost-effective approaches to sleep diagnostics. We want to scale technology that in our consumer markets enables an easy-to-use device experience and technology that, in our reimbursed markets, can be a low-cost, clinically reliable, screening tool for sleep apnea. In this vein, on October 1, we closed a transaction to acquire EctoSense, a leader in cloud connected home sleep apnea testing technology from Belgium. We believe EctoSense's digital and easy-to-use solutions in the hands of both physicians and sleep lab technicians, as well as consumers can help significantly increase sleep apnea diagnosis rates, as well as general sleep awareness. EctoSense will operate within our sleep and respiratory care business unit, and we're excited to bring this innovative technology to more global markets as we move forward. Let me now turn to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million COPD patients and the 330 million asthma patients worldwide. Our long-term goal is to reach hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation as well as newer therapeutic areas such as cloud-connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions and high flow therapy offerings. Demand for our core noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for COPD and beyond was strong throughout the quarter, especially in markets outside the United States where physicians and providers shifted focus to support the most severe highest acuity patients. This demand is aligned with our strategy to ensure priority for manufacturing and delivery of the devices that meets the needs of those patients, specifically those that need life support ventilation or noninvasive ventilation, including by level support, first. We are balancing the growth in the respiratory care demand with the supply of ventilators that made it to market throughout the coronavirus pandemic as well as customers as they balance their inventory with ongoing acute and chronic ventilation patient needs. We continue to see rapid adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe a little over a year ago, and we continue to expand this technology to regions around the world. The value being provided through AirView for ventilation has been very helpful to physicians not only during COVID, but it is increasingly valuable on an ongoing basis for them and the health care systems that they operate in. In the not-too-distant future, I can see AirView becoming standard of care for patients on home-based ventilation protocols in many health care systems. Let me now review our Software as a Service business for out-of-hospital care. During the quarter, our SaaS business grew in the mid-single digits year-on-year across our portfolio of markets, including home medical equipment as well as facility-based and home-based care settings. The continued growth of home-based care is providing tailwinds for our home medical equipment and our home health products, and we continue to grow with customers as they utilize our software and data solutions, including Brightree and Snap ReSupply to improve and optimize business efficiencies and patient care. The COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging for some verticals in our SaaS business, particularly skilled nursing facilities. However, we are seeing positive trends as census rates of patients improve across SNFs and other facility-based care settings. We will continue to watch this closely as COVID cases ebb and flow at slower and slower rates around the country. We expect there to be pent-up demand for technology investments in these SaaS verticals, which provides opportunities for us to increase our new customer pipeline as COVID restrictions continue to ease. As we look at our portfolio of software solutions, we expect SaaS revenue to accelerate, increasing from mid single-digit growth to high single-digit growth by the back end of this fiscal year. As always, our goal is to meet or beat these market growth rates as we continue to innovate and take market share. We are the leading strategic provider of SaaS solutions for out-of-hospital care, and we provide mission-critical software across a broad set of very attractive markets. We are uniquely positioned, and we have created differentiated value for ResMed with our SaaS portfolio. We are set up for sustainable growth through ongoing innovation investments, commercial excellence partnerships and future acceleration through strategic M&A as well as selective tuck-in M&A opportunities. Looking at the portfolio of ResMed's business across sleep and respiratory care as well as our SaaS solutions, we remain confident in our long-term strategy and our pipeline of innovative solutions. Our patient-centric, physician-centric and provider-centric approach, combined with our unique ResMed culture, means that we are well positioned to continue winning in the vastly underserved respiratory medical markets of sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and other chronic diseases. We are transforming out-of-hospital care at scale. We are leading the market in digital health technology. With over 10 billion nights now, 10 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 15.5 million, 100% cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide, we are unlocking value from these data to help patients, providers, physicians, payers and entire health care systems. Our mission and goal to improve 250 million lives through better healthcare in 2025, drives and motivates me and ResMedians every day. We again made excellent progress toward that goal this quarter. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude and thanks to the more than 8,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication during these ongoing and unprecedented times. You, our ResMed team, have helped save the lives of many hundreds of thousands of people around the world with COVID-19, with those emergency needs these last 18 months. And you are now and you have now already pivoted back to provide ongoing support for all of our customers during some of the most challenging industry dynamics that we've seen in the industry. Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we'll open the call up for Q&A. Brett? Thanks, Matthew. Well, it's easy in markets where we're fully vertically integrated, like Germany, South Korea, and other markets worldwide Australia, New Zealand and others and we're able to work directly with those patients and the doctors to make that happen. It is more difficult in other markets like France or the US where we've worked through providers. But it's been pretty clear from our competitor there that they want people to go and register the devices, and they're going to focus, they said 12 months on just replacing those devices. And frankly, that's theoretical and legal duty to go do that. And so they are laser-focused on that. And so our work is to make sure -- we see the demand from patients directly in those vertically integrated markets and through distributors. And we're pretty confident that the vast, vast, vast majority of our devices go to new patients. There may be some going to replacement patients who are going online or going through certain aspects to get around and go faster than the Philips process, but certainly, the vast majority are going to new patients. The challenge for us is that the demand of being the number one player and also covering as much of the demand of the number two players as possible. We've reached the capacity of those critical components coming in the front end. And so we're not even able to meet all of that new patient demand with -- due to those supply chain constraints. Yes. Thanks, Chris. It's a great question. And as you know, we don't provide detailed guidance and we sort of went further than we ever did because of the wide variety of sell-side estimates of what the incremental revenue could be. And we gave that last quarter. We gave that $300 million to $350 million device rough guidance, right? It's not perfect because we're predicting 12 months out in a very uncertain environment. And as Brett just reiterated, we're sticking with that, knowing that we actually had $80 million to $90 million during this quarter that comes out of that, right, and then we've got the remainder to go fight for those components and be able to deliver that over the next nine months. In the mask side, it's a very complicated story, and there's a number of moving factors, and we can get into this, and I can handle Jim Hollingshead, who runs our Sleep & Respiratory Care, can give further detail on this question or if there's a follow-up question on it. But what I can say on mask is we're not going to give public guidance around it, but there's a number of moving factors. You saw our mask growth during the quarter, it was globally at 8%, and the US market was around 5%. The headwinds we have is that, while our number two competitor is not serving as many new patients as they should, and we're not able to take all that demand, there are less new patients being set up. And ResMed -- no matter what the device was, ResMed had a very good, well above 50% uptake rate of those new masks on new devices, no matter who was the manufacturer. And so that's a headwind for our business if there's a new patient that's not getting any therapy. And then the tailwinds would be, which are not as high in volume, but the tailwinds would be that when it is a ResMed device, there is a higher probability because they're designed to work together, and they are working better together and a doctor who loves our devices often likes our masks and same with the sleep technician and the sleep therapist and a respiratory therapist, they often like the brands across the technology spectrum and ResMed's the leader in that we do get a very good uptake on that. So there's some upgrade on the adherence rate to a ResMed device, but there's a headwind of -- even with a competitor device, if there's no device out there, there is less mask sales happening. And thus, you have the sort of 5% growth in the US masks, while we're limited on the ability as an industry to take care of that upfront demand. I think that's about as much color as I can go into it without quantifying it for you. But I can tell you, it's a complex moving equation for us to model at a customer basis and a country level, so I can understand the difficulty for folks on the sell side as well. Yes. Thanks, David. And as I said in the prep remarks, there's a perfect storm hitting the industry. And so there's so many dynamics impacting us that I'm going to call this afternoon working on this. I'm shifting my attention, which usually focuses purely on customers and governments and making sure the demand is there for this is an amazing industry that we serve and sleep apnea and asthma, and I'm spending a lot more time with suppliers. So with that, our best reading of the future flow of components is that, you look at it, and as Brett said in the prepared remarks, that we actually had reasonably good flow, some through inventory and working through that in the quarter of $80 million to $90 million here in the first quarter. It's going to be very difficult here in the December quarter with component shortages and very difficult in the March quarter with component shortages. I do think the components, as we are getting some increased signals and actually doing some great engineering to work around different suppliers and to design in new components. I feel much more confident about the June quarter 2022, so our Q4 fiscal year 2022. And so that's sort of qualitative guidance to it. We're not modeling it out. We've got the $300 million to $350 million. You can subtract off the $80 million to $90 million and model it. But if I was looking at it, it would be tougher in December and tougher in March right now and then freeing up in the June quarter and then September quarter, even more so as some of our new designs and new components get to roll in and we get that flow going. But look, it's changing day by day, week by week. I'm looking forward to my call this afternoon to potentially impact that. But even if I get agreement with someone today, it takes quite a while, as I explained sort of with that example of the five levels deep in the supply chain to get that to flow through from a foundry, to a chip manufacturer, to our factory, to a product, to the warehouse to then be able to sell it to a customer. So I know that's not a specific quantitative guidance, David. It's probably the best I can give you in terms of color for fiscal year 2022. And the hope we have in Q4 and Q1 2023, as we start to see those components really start to free up. Thanks for the question, Suraj. And since I've answered the first three, I'll just correct that our guidance was $300 million to $350 million, not $350 million to $400 million, what you just said, but $300 million to $350 million 0 for the fiscal year. But Jim Hollingshead, you run this business. Do you want to do you give as much as you can on the color to Suraj? Thanks, Gretel. I'll have a go and maybe Jim can join in as well. But I get the ReSupply is actually very strong. We have Brightree ReSupply. We also have Snap technology that has been incorporated into our Brightree platform that has driven incredible ReSupply. If you remember, that really was going strong throughout 2020. So we have some incredibly high comps when you look at the percentage growth rate of masks from this quarter a year ago, even despite COVID hitting this time a year ago, our mask ReSupply and maybe because of that somewhat with the HMEs focusing on it, our mask ReSupply was through the roof this time of a year ago. And even with those comps, we're still achieving some very good rates in ReSupply. As I said, there are headwinds in it when we're not taking care of all new patients and ResMed gets well over 50% of all marks, some new patients, no matter whose device it is in the global market. That's a headwind that we're dealing with while this recall continues. But the tailwinds of ReSupply are actually well incorporated into those figures. And I think if you look outside the U.S. market, look at Europe, Asia and the other 140 countries we operate in, you saw pretty strong 18% double-digit growth in masks in those areas and global growth of around 8%, which is very strong given the headwinds of new patient setups. But Jim, any further color on the U.S. or beyond? Thanks for the question, Craig. I'll hand that to Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Yes. And I'll add on maybe just a little bit of color there, Craig. I mean it's hard to say, because you said, what regions, and as Rob said, we can't say what regions. And even if you would ask a more specific question, what countries. It'd be difficult to say there, because in the U.S., there are 50 states with all different regulations, and some of them are 100% plus capacity and some are at 75%, 80% within the state level. And then cities going up and down, and China is not just there. It's different regions there as well. So there are ebbs and flows on a daily, weekly, monthly. But what we can say is on aggregate, it is getting better and better. And it's nice to see some cities, some states, some countries at 100% plus that they're getting through it, they're finding ways to embrace digital health, home sleep apnea testing and remote setup, so that we're able to get the flow of patients going through. Then the challenge we have right now is that we don't have the components of those patients with prescriptions come through to meet all that demand, which is the real critical rate limited right now as well. Thanks for your question, Craig. Yes, David, it's a good question. I think everyone had exposure to ResMed products. We're the market leader, everyone knew the brand name. Everyone had tried it, and we get a large percentage of the prescriptions and actually the share in the 140 countries we operate in. But as you said, there are some doctors who liked a particular aspect or a technical aspect or an emotional aspect really or a workflow aspect of some of our competitors' devices or software systems. And to your question, they are getting, if you like, forced exposure, because it's the only one available for new patients, to ResMed's amazing innovation on the device, the software, the systems and the flow. And if they had some form of prejudice of device from the '90s that they tried or something and have been stuck with the brand, they're now trying a new brand. And I do think, to Jim's point earlier, that some of that brand-new share of somebody who was in another brand's componentry area says, wow, this actually is great. My prejudice was wrong. And I think we will get a lot of that share that we'll maintain forever. And I think certainly, the exposure of patients to the brands and to understand that has increased. I mean, the Net Promoter Score for ResMed amongst patients is rising, and the knowledge about the brands, for better or for worse, through this awful recall is, they're getting to know what device they have. And that awareness is actually good for the whole industry, because I think physicians and providers and technicians have always been aware of the brands and had prescription biases and others that we absolutely influence through our really strong commercial, clinical sales teams. And now we're getting that brand name to new customers as well. So I mean, the short answer to your question is, yes, we've got exposure to new consumers, new physicians, new providers. And we think a lot of that will be sticky because of the value we provide. The brand is the brand that represents 50% lower labor cost if you're setting up a patient when it represents three less clicks to get a report, when it reflects an API that can link into your Epic or your Cerner or your National Health Trust system, really efficiently, it becomes really part of your day-to-day workflow. And that's the type of share that we think is part of the ResMed brand and will maintain our strong growth for a long period to come through for this period. Yes. Brett, I'll hand that question to you. Yes. Thanks for the question, Sean. And you're right, we don't provide details around pricing. But look, clearly, this is -- these are unprecedented times, costs. As you saw, and even just in Brett's last answer there around gross margin and going up. Freight costs, I mean, sea freight, there are over 100 ships just two hours north of me here on the I5 stack outside Long Beach that can't get through. So the sea freight inventory sitting there. It's coming through higher cost than it's ever been. Air freight, we have literally chartered planes to fly from Singapore to L.A. and Singapore to Atlanta to get our products to market with this demand. And so those types of things increase costs dramatically. And we have to do that. They're actually consumer planes, but no consumers in them and literally just ResMed device is taking off the seats and overhead, and so that has impacted our costs. One thing we are doing is with AirSense 11, we are launching that with a price premium. It is excellent innovation. It is not just the best in ResMed for eight years, it's the best in the market, I think, ever, as a platform. And so that deserves a price premium, and so we will be extracting that. And look, we have been working with customers and eliminating some certain discounts and rebates and other things that we had used in the past because those don't apply now. And so we're eliminating some of those costs. And look, this is a customer-by-customer, region-by-region discussion that happens on a daily basis with our commercial team. But clearly, we cannot take all of the costs that have been given to us, and we are working with since launch and with appropriate removal of other elements and pricing conditions with customers on a customer basis to address this over time. But our goal -- our laser-focused goal is to make sure we take care of every patient that comes through the channel. And I think that's what you saw during this last quarter. Thanks for the questions, Frank. Look, I actually have no idea what customers are thinking of the replacement phone versus the replacement devices for our competitor. That's their job to take care of that. If I was a patient, I'd want to replace a device. I wouldn't want to replaced phone. That's what I'd say. But I have no idea on that. It's a very, very lack of strong communication that I've seen publicly on that. And I can tell you, as N equals one, I have nothing to add to that. But on the US hospital front, I do think, as I said in my prepared remarks, that we are seeing facilities-based SaaS -- the census rates at skilled nursing facilities are starting to pick up the numbers of patients in beds is picking up. And we actually think -- as you said, that there's a pent-up demand for technology to help with that. But Rob, do you have any further color on MatrixCare and the Brightree home health and hospice? Steve, thanks for the question. And yes, good morning to you there in Australia. I think you're not wrong that we would have very strong double-digit growth. And that actually makes sense and has traditionally happened when we launch a new product like the AirSense 11 as our first platform launch in eight years. And as I said in my prep remarks, I mean, I'm blown away by things like the personal care system, watching the care check-in personal therapies or watching the sleep technicians and sleep doctors live at that California Sleep Society engage not just with the presentation from the marketing teams, but then sitting down with the clinical teams and walking through this device, I think it's a device that deserves to take double-digit growth and take a lot of share. And so I think your calculations there are spot on in terms of this is a double-digit growth time for ResMed in the device space irrespective of this competitive recall, irrespective of the comps that we had around COVID and vents and the tailwinds of vents and headwinds of sleep apnea patients coming in a year ago that we're seeing really strong growth of the sleep space. And as Jim said earlier, our goal is to entrench people in these amazing workflows that have lower costs and better outcomes and drive therapy to patients in ways never seen before. The part that I'd highlight is this huge take-up of patients signing on to Mya and having a personal relationship with their therapy through the smartphone with Mya is at unprecedented levels. I'm talking double the uptake of AirSense 10. That's one of the highlights that I think has been missed through this. So, Steve, thanks for the question and the opportunity to highlight that. Great question, John. I'll hand that to Jim Hollingshead. So that's a great question, Lyanne, and quite detailed. I'll hand the first part of the question about ResMed's inventory and what's been happening with the build up there to, Brett. And then I'll hand the second part about the inventory at the HMEs, HCPs and distributors, as they call them in Europe, between the US and Europe to Jim Hollingshead. So Brett, over to you first, and then Jim Hold on. Sorry, Jim is going to answer the second part of that. Yeah. Thanks. I'll start and hand to Rob maybe for some further details. Look, we have Bobby Ghoshal, our new President of the SaaS division. And I can tell you, he's hitting the ground running these last five weeks. He's been in there. And certainly, we're seeing some great opportunities for accelerating growth. I think, look, the externalities that I talked about in the prep remarks that we covered earlier, that skilled nursing facility census is coming back, so demand is coming back. And we see the book, the pipeline book starting to build up. And in a SaaS business, that's great because when the pipeline builds up, you get the conversions and then it turns into revenue. So we get pretty good visibility, even three, six, nine months out to seeing sort of an acceleration of growth. So I feel pretty confident that those census rates and others that census rates are going up and that we are going to see with MatrixCare is really good products, growth in the MatrixCare business to start accelerating there. In addition, Brightree and Snap, although they're annualizing some of the acquisitions of Snap, we're seeing really good adoption of those resupply and some really new innovative tools that the Brightree R&D team are bringing to market. And Bobby was previously COO there and has a good knowledge of that. I think that will accelerate throughout the rest of the fiscal year. But Rob, there's so many -- the eight verticals there. What other elements do you have reasons to believe they can accelerate this business? Yeah. Thanks, Dan. So look, it's a complex and moving dynamic. But the rate-limiting step here is electronic components and specifically the semiconductor chips from a particular manufacturing and a supply chain that, I know the names and the people and them talking to them to try and get this supply. The trouble is that there are multiple other industries. And demand for semiconductor chips that are through the roof. And obviously, everyone on this call follows many other industries. You've heard this, we're not alone in medical device industry, automotive industry, consumer communications industry, even consumer products are often cloud connected now and have these limitations. So look, things haven't gone better these last 90 days in terms of supply. They've got very difficult. And our visibility, as I look at the June quarter, I feel very confident in the semiconductor chips coming through. But in December and March, it's hand to mouth of these devices and chartering planes and working with redesigns to make sure the semiconductor chips go so much in. And so our best reading of the dynamics, even though we feel in aggregate, that $300 million and $350 million, which is which is a pretty broad range in itself and has some plus or minus on the top and the bottom end of it, that we feel stronger on that June quarter with the supply that we see coming through, whereas it's not as strong. I'm closer to the December one now, and I know it's going to be tough and March as well. But look, things can change on a day-by-day, week-by-week, month-by-month. And what we're doing is we're being as open as we ever have around supply chain as open as we ever had and transparent about sort of the variability, if you like, of the flow of these components that come in. I can tell you though, we get one more chip, it goes into one more device and goes to one patient. And that's the truth. There is no stockpiling of this inventory. It goes all the way straight through to production. And we have an incredibly efficient plan in Singapore and also in Sydney and also manufacturing in Atlanta, Georgia, and we are not constrained on our internal capacity. As soon as that part comes in, that rate-limiting bottleneck part, it goes on to a product, gets to a customer. And that's what we are focused on. And I'm giving as much color as I can qualitatively around that. Well, thanks, Kevin, and thanks again to all of our shareholders for staying on an extra five to seven minutes here and joining us on this call. I'd also like to thank once again the 8,000 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders who listen to this call for their dedication and hard work, helping people breathe better, sleep better and live better lives outside the hospital in 140 countries. Thanks for what you do today and every day. Thanks especially to our ResMed heroes on the front lines during this crisis, patient care, technical service, sales teams working with customers every day, but I'd like to add a special call out to our amazing teams on the front lines of supply chain, management production, distribution, all of you are heroes. Every chip you get is a patient's life change. So, I look forward to talking with you all again all of our stakeholders here in 90 days. Thank you. I'll turn the call back to Amy to close out."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Chief Communications and Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you so much, Kevin. Hi, everyone, and welcome to ResMed's fourth quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings call. This call is being webcast live and a replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today along with the copy of the earnings press release and the presentation both of which are available now. On the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. Following our prepared remarks, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Lucile Blaise, President of our Sleep & Respiratory Care Business for the Q&A portion of the call. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. Please review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to our GAAP reported numbers. Our discussion today will also include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However our actual results could differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the Risk Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all our shareholders for joining us today as we review the results of our June quarter, the last quarter of our fiscal year 2023. Our results reflect incredible growth across our entire business with double-digit growth in our devices, masks, and software businesses. Unconstrained availability of our market leading cloud connected flow generator platforms has enabled us to continue to offer access to 100% cloud connectable AirSense 10 flow generated devices in all of our major global markets and beyond. In parallel, we are ramping up and improving the availability of our best-in-class AirSense 11 platform, which will gain further geographic regulatory approvals throughout the fiscal year and steadily increasing supply also throughout the fiscal year 2024 and beyond. Although challenges within the post-COVID supply chain haven't completely been mitigated yet, we expect ongoing steady improvement in component and end product supply in the quarters ahead using a combination of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 platforms. While we remain focused on scaling production and global availability of the AirSense 11 platform, we remain on allocation for the Air 11 platform for the next few quarters. But I want to be clear on this point. With combined availability of the unconstrained Air 10 platform, we have enough devices to meet all of the customer needs that we see in major markets and globally. With the powerful combination of the Air 10 and the Air 11 platforms, we have the two best device platforms on the market. Our strong double-digit 23% year-over-year growth in the devices category demonstrates that customers are choosing ResMed and we are delivering. Our masks and accessories business also performed at a very strong 18% growth in constant currency this quarter. Patient demand continues to drive increased adoption and utilization of our mask resupply programs, augmenting a steady cadence of new patient setups. We continue to see strong growth in both the U.S. business where provider resupply programs have augmented growth and in our markets outside the U.S. where our consumer outreach and subscription programs are also driving mass replenishment directly with those end user patients. Our teams continue to work incredibly hard to achieve these strong growth results amid a challenging industry environment where component costs and freight costs are still working their way through our inventory post this supply chain crisis. I'm proud of the work that 10,000 ResMedians have put in every week, every month, every quarter to deliver these incredible results for the business, for our customers, for our shareholders, and ultimately for our most important customer, our patients. Let's now briefly review updates on the top three strategic priorities for our company. Number one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea and respiratory care business; number two, to design, develop, and deliver market leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and number three, to create, innovate, and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital, a field that we call residential medicine. In terms of our patient facing digital health platforms, adoption continues to go very well. The feedback we hear from patients and healthcare professionals remains very positive. We are seeing strong adoption of the myAir patient app by folks using AirSense 11. In fact, it is more than double the adoption rate that we saw with our AirSense 10 platform with many, many millions of patients signing up and engaging daily on their myAir app to view their own sleep data on their own phone and to review their own therapy data. This is important as engagement with a digital health platform like myAir is directly linked to higher adherence to therapy in patients. And higher adherence to therapy is directly related to better patient outcomes, to increased resupply and to better economics for the payer and the healthcare provider with lower overall healthcare costs. Last month, we announced and closed the acquisition of Somnoware. Somnoware is a U.S.-based leader in sleep and respiratory care diagnostics software and physician management software. As part of our ongoing efforts to improve and streamline the end-to-end pathway for patients and make it easier for sleep labs and physicians and their practices to diagnose and manage patients, we're excited about this acquisition that complements our current ecosystem of software solutions, including AirView for providers and physicians and Brightree for home care providers. These ecosystem together will drive greater efficiency and better patient care by accelerating the pathway to therapy and with a better overall customer experience. We're also excited about our progress across several digital health technology initiatives to further increase the value proposition for our connected healthcare ecosystem. Over the next several quarters, we plan to introduce several artificial intelligence driven data products and capabilities on both the physician and provider facing AirView platform, as well as the patient facing myAir app. Early testing of these AI driven data products is very positive in both of these customer groups, and we will refine to the optimal digital design and then we will launch and then we will scale these products around the world. These AI driven data products provide personalized suggestions to increase therapy adherence and to ultimately improve patient outcomes as well as patient, physician, and provider experience. We will continue to invest in the world's largest digital healthcare ecosystem that we have with over 15.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud as we continue to unlock value from those data to benefit physicians, providers, payers, and patients. We saw strong growth in our respiratory care business in the quarter through ongoing adoption of our non-invasive ventilators as well as our life support ventilator solutions. We're still in the early stages of market development with some of our newer to market technologies in this category, including home-based high-flow therapy that we call HFT for treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD in the home. We continue to generate clinical evidence and economic outcomes to support broader adoption of these technology innovations for treating lung disease in the home. We're encouraged by the clinical results we've seen with our HFT trials so far, and we continue to remain very focused on addressing COPD as one of the top diseases globally for hospitalization and the number one cause of re-hospitalization in the U.S. geography. The prevalence of respiratory insufficiency due to COPD as well as respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular disease continues to increase and we are focused on having low cost, high quality solutions to address this health epidemic. Our SaaS business had another great quarter with year-over-year growth of 34%. Our SaaS business growth was supported by another full quarter contribution from our fast growing MEDIFOX DAN business, as well as solid organic growth of 8% across our Brightree and MatrixCare portfolio of SaaS businesses. We're pleased to see sustained high-single-digit growth in our SaaS business on an organic basis, driven by the ongoing strength in the HME and infusion segment, and more stability in the facility segment as patient flows have now rebounded post-COVID. I'm very impressed by the leadership of our most recent SaaS portfolio addition MEDIFOX DAN, which is on track and meeting or beating our expectations. I'll be visiting personally with the team in Hildesheim, Germany, this quarter to discuss the growth face-to-face with the digital health innovators there in Hildesheim who are changing healthcare and taking care of people in the lowest cost, lowest acuity and highest quality of life setting, which is very often the home. We believe this is the future of healthcare and that's where we're investing and that's where we're winning. Our customers continue to see the value of adopting technologies to improve and optimize business efficiencies and personalized care, and we deliver the best software solutions to help customers do just that. There is pent-up demand for technology investments in residential medicine verticals, particularly as staffing shortages continue to impact the industry, particularly in nursing, but across the clinician and provider groups. This presents opportunities for ResMed's SaaS solutions to streamline operations and create workflow efficiencies so our customers, staff can focus on providing personal care. It's up to us to deliver for our customers and drive growth. I have confidence that our SaaS business can accelerate from these high-single-digits on an organic basis to double-digit growth on an organic basis in the mid to long-term. Our SaaS business remains an integral part of ResMed's growth strategy. This business complements the market leading software and device solutions that we have in our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. As an important example, our Brightree ReSupply program continues to demonstrate strong synergies between SaaS and our core business, providing resupply for patients with sleep apnea, COPD, neuromuscular disease and beyond. The output of this work can be seen in our very healthy 19% growth in mass revenues in the U.S. geography this quarter. Ultimately, this work results in better outcomes for the patient, the physician, the provider, and the payer with lower overall healthcare costs. We are well-positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for residential medicine globally. We have created differentiated value for our customers as well as long-term sustainable growth for our stakeholders. Here at ResMed, we are transforming respiratory medicine and residential medicine at scale, leading the market in digital health technology across our businesses. As we continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our operations in this post-COVID world, we continue to leverage appropriate pricing and cost reductions to drive accelerated growth in our bottom line. We are focused on driving top-line revenue and maintaining tight discipline and increasing efficiencies so that we can lower costs and ultimately so that we can accelerate our impact and our bottom line profitability, delivering even further value for all of our shareholders. As we move through fiscal year 2024, I see improvements in our business margins with geography mix, with product mix, and specifically with strong bi-level and non-invasive ventilator growth with strong mass growth and with increased software solutions growth. All these business lines are margin accretive to our growth. I also see that the higher inventory costs and freight costs that we've seen through the supply chain crisis continue to work their way through our sold products and as we progress through the fiscal year, we will continue to drive the transition to AirSense 11 and we will gain regulatory approvals and we will scale production. All these factors above lead to tailwinds for the gross margin and the net margin of our business as we move through the fiscal year. I can tell you we are working furiously to drive all of the above elements with our global teams. We now have over 15.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud, as I said earlier, and those data come from over 21.5 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We continue to lead the industry in digital health and we don't plan to stop anytime soon because there's so much opportunity ahead of us. 7% of our revenues go straight into R&D to power our hardware and our data innovation engines. ResMed's mission and key goal remains crystal clear. We will improve 250 million lives through better residential healthcare in 2025. This patient-centric mission drives and motivates ResMedians every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal over the last 90 days and during the trailing 12 months, we have improved over 160 million lives with the delivery of a complete device platform to a patient or a complete mask system to a patient or a digital health software solution that is helping each person to sleep better, to breathe better, and to live a high quality life with healthcare delivered right where they live. As we start fiscal year 2024 here, I'm very excited about the opportunities in front of us. We just had our SaaS ASM earlier this week, and I'll be attending the Country Market Group CMG Group for our North America team in the coming weeks. And sales meetings are happening around the world. We're on a good trajectory. We have an exciting pipeline. In closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the more than 10,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, their hard work and their dedication both today and every day. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney and then we'll move and open up for Q&A for the group. Brett, over to you.\nBrett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. We had strong financial performance in Q4. Group revenue for the June quarter was $1.12 billion, an increase of 23% on a headline basis and in constant currency terms. Revenue growth reflected the ongoing combined availability of cloud connected AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 sleep devices to support strong underlying global demand, as well as solid growth across our broader product portfolio. Year-on-year movements in foreign currencies negatively impacted revenue by approximately $3 million in the June quarter. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution, excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in U.S., Canada, and Latin America countries increased by 25%. In constant currency terms, sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 14%. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 24% while masks and other sales increased by 18%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America increased by 30% as we benefited from strong demand. And as previously mentioned, our continued ability to fully supply the market with combined availability of AS 10 and AS 11 cloud connected devices. Masks and other sales increased by 19%, reflecting growth in resupply and new patient setups. Europe, Asia, and other markets, device sales increased by 15% in constant currency terms, again reflecting strong demand and improving availability of cloud connected devices. Masks and other sales increased by 14% in constant currency terms, reflecting increased patient setups. Software-as-a-Service revenue increased by 34% in the June quarter, reflecting the contribution from our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition and continued strong performance from our HME vertical. Excluding our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, SaaS revenue grew by 8% in the June quarter. MEDIFOX DAN contributed revenue of $27.3 million for the June quarter consistent with our expectations at the time of the acquisition. During the rest of my commentary today, I will refer to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release. Gross margin declined by 200 points to 55.8% in the June quarter. The decrease primarily reflects component cost increases; warranty and manufacturing related cost increases and product mix shifts due to the significant increase in sleep device sales partially offset by increases in average selling prices  On a sequential basis, unfavorable foreign currency movements accounted for the 30 basis points decline in our gross margin and we saw a lower than expected product mix benefit as we continue to see strong growth in sleep devices in the U.S. market. Moving on to operating expenses. SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter increased by 25%, or in constant currency terms increased by 26%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related costs marketing and travel expenses, as well as the incremental SG&A expenses associated with MEDIFOX DAN that we acquired in November 2022. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue was 21.5% compared to 21.1% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% during fiscal year 2024. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 21% or in constant currency terms increased by 23%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7% consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% during fiscal year 2024. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 13% underpinned by strong revenue growth partially offset by lower gross margin. Following the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, our net interest expense for the quarter is $15 million and we expect interest expense to be a similar amount per quarter in the first half of fiscal year 2024. Our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 18.3% compared to the prior year quarter rate of 17.6%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2024 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the June quarter increased by 7% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 7%. During the quarter, we incurred $1.8 million in acquisition expenses associated with our Somnoware acquisition, and we recognized restructuring costs of $9.2 million associated with the closure of the Aria lymphedema business and workforce rationalization in our German and SaaS business verticals. We also recognized a gain of $20.2 million within our income in relation to a business interruption insurance claim. These have all been treated as non-GAAP items in our Q4 financial results. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $237 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings, partially offset by a modest increase in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $34 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $47 million. We ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $228 million. At June 30, we had $1.4 billion in gross debt and $1.2 billion in net debt, which mainly reflects the funding of our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition. During the quarter, we reduced our debt by $145 million. At June 30, we had approximately $745 million available for drawdown under our revolver facility, and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share, representing an increase of 9% over our previous quarterly dividend and reflecting the Board's confidence in our operating performance. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D and expect to deploy further capital for tuck-in acquisitions such as our recently announced acquisition of Somnoware, a company that provides an upstream diagnostic management platform that is complementary to our current AirView and Brightree solutions. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Brett, and thank you, Mick. Kevin, I'd like to go ahead and turn the call back over to you to provide the instructions and run the Q&A portion of our call.\nOperator: Certainly. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\nMatthew Mishan: Hey, good afternoon, and thank you for taking the questions. Hey Mick, with the devices number sort of steady sequentially around this $600 million mark, is this where the number would kind of base out if you are supplying the majority of the market? And from here, are we looking at just saying $600 million and then add on some percentage of what the underlying fleet market is kind of growing at?\nMick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Matthew. And it's a good one. It's hard to predict because there are so many factors involved that that are going on in the market right now. But yes, as you said, a very, very solid number, $602 million in global devices in the quarter and 30% growth in U.S., Canada, Latin America, 15% growth in Europe, Asia, and rest of world. Look, we're seeing a strong sort of mid-single-digits level of patient flow into the channel. We're seeing in addition to that -- like in terms of new patients, we're seeing in addition to that resupply of patients at that five-year point for most U.S. reimbursement and various points in the other 139 countries where people make their own decisions or insurance has other criteria to drive that. So it's new patient setups, it's resupply setups and there's of course the impact of a competitor recall, which is -- was supposed to be over in June 30 and now has no definitive date. And so as we look to that with all those unknown factors, it's very hard for me to say, Matthew, that it's just stop and steady growth from here. It might be stronger growth from here. And that makes it hard to predict gross margins because as we grow those CPAP and APAP numbers so well in the U.S. geography, it's incredible great revenue and cloud connected and links us with the patient for life, but it is lower gross margin than our group. And so it's great gross profit dollars, but has an impact on our gross margin as you saw that steady apart from FX moving it down 30 basis points. So a complex equation but I'd say it's at minimum, it stays where it is and grows with the market but it could potentially grow above that as we continue to take share and solidify that share through our digital ecosystem. Thanks for the question, Matthew.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is now live.\nMargaret Kaczor: Hey, good afternoon, and good morning, everyone. I wanted to follow-up first on the competitive dynamic to the extent that you'll -- you see anything maybe into the -- in the marketplace. So whether your key competitor is coming back either approaching or maybe hiring processes, marketing campaigns, anything that maybe they're gearing up for that you're seeing or is demand relatively similar to what you've seen in the past, no real changes. Thank you.\nMick Farrell: Yes. Thanks, Margaret, and welcome back. Yes. I think it's difficult to predict exactly where they're at from those sort of the early emerging signs, as you say. Look, we have regional competitors in Europe that we are fighting with every day there. We have regional competitors in Asia that we're fighting with every day and regional competitors in the Americas that we're fighting with every day. When Philips comes back, they'll have to start at position number four, if you like, in new patient setups. We are -- they are back and we are competing with them in some countries in Europe, like in Spain, they never went away because they never had a phone device there. So they've been there the whole time through this recall, and we've been beating them handsomely there. And as other markets in Europe where they've started to come back, we are competing and winning and maintaining share and growing share. I think the reputation here and the time to market is going to be a very slow progress for them country by country whether or not they get a consent decree in the largest geography. And so we look at it going forward and say, look, do we have enough supply to take care of all the market demands between us and the other regional players? And we finally got there where I can say that this quarter that we're there and we can take care of it. So it's almost irrelevant to us how and when in terms of what that looks like because we're able to take care of all the market growth. So for us, it sort of takes away that uncertainty and allows us to push forward. But yes, we're competing head-to-head with them in some many countries in Asia and some countries in Europe. And it's like -- it wasn't 2019 where our smaller, quieter, more comfortable, more connected and more digital solutions are taking share and holding share. And it's an ongoing competitive game. And as I said, we're launching some of these AI driven products on top of this ecosystem. It's an exponential game when you think about digital and we're well ahead. We've had two or three years here to sprint ahead. We were ahead before that. And I think it's a long-term game won't get -- we'll keep productively paranoid, but we are improving outcomes, we're lowering costs and the physicians like the workflow efficiencies and patients like the increased adherence and payers like the fact that there's an ROI in lowering total healthcare costs.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Anthony Petrone from Mizuho Group. Your line is now live.\nAnthony Petrone: Great. Thank you. Congrats on a shrunk top-line here, share gains. Maybe two part question. Mick, one would be just on the amount of resupply that's now coming in as it relates to the share gains that you've seen over the past two years, is the resupply number we're seeing now where we actually starting to see consumables come off of the new sockets that you gained. So that would be question one. And then question two, there's obviously the debate out there on GLP-1s, maybe from the perspective of ResMed, how do you see the GLP-1 phenomenon playing out in the sleep space, specifically do you expect to gain more patients from GLP-1s versus maybe certain patients that would fall out of the funnel? Thanks again.\nMick Farrell: Yes. Thanks, Anthony, and welcome back to you too to the ResMed following us here. I'll take yes, both of your question and your follow-up in order. So firstly on resupply, as you know, you've been following us for a number of years. It's not a lock and key. You can use our mask on other devices and you can use other masks on our devices. The way that we've won market share and nobody's been on a major in terms of not being able to sell recall out there on this. And so we've had head-to-head competition with all the top five players in masks, these last three years and we've gained really good share with that. So I think it's just the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable, the minimalist size ones, the ones that have full freedom and the ones that have the ability to for the front sleepers and side sleepers to provide that, that capability. And so that's how we've gained share in the mask side and maintained that share. So I -- there is a better together in that when you have an AirSense 10 or an AirSense 11, the mask leak data are more accurate. The interoperability of an AHI calculation or a leak calculation are more accurate. So we certainly push that angle and we do get some extra share for through the device, but it's not as material as the fact that the masks themselves are just excellent, which I think speaks to the sustainability there. So that strong resupply, as you said, 19% growth in the U.S., 14% growth in Europe, Asia and beyond, where we don't have that sort of automated resupply that we have with Brightree ReSupply Solutions in the U.S. that's been from hard work from our teams in Asia, Latin America, and Europe on patient outreach, subscription programs and connecting directly to that end user. So I think post-COVID people care about respiratory health, respiratory hygiene and taking care of themselves outside the hospital, and we've been able to leverage that trend in the consumer side as well. So I think it's sustainable, and I don't think although it may be catalyzed somewhat by our increased device share, I think our market share is on its own extraordinary and due to the intrinsic products. The second question around GLPs, yes, look, there's a lot of moving parts. I was just reading in the press today that many U.S. employers are banning coverage of GLP-1s due to cost. European governments have all said no from the government insurance side. These things are incredibly expensive about $1,000, well, anywhere from $800 to $1,200, $1,000 a month. So I think there are three factors that'll mitigate GLPs in the space. One is cost, two is adherence, and three is side effects. I'll take them really quickly in order. If you look at cost, take a 40-year old person who's on therapy full time for 40 years, 40 times, 12 times a $1,000 is $480,000 lifetime cost for that patient on a GLP-1 from 40 to 80 lifetime cost. If you take that same patient and say, look, let's treat them with CPAP, right? First year maybe a $1,000, and then 39 years of let's take a really strong case where you get four masks a year and they're all full face masks. That's about thirteen and a half thousand dollars. So it's 35 times more expensive to go with a GLP-1. It's just like what's the ROI here, that's cost. On adherence, the data out there are about 33% adherence at one year through the clinical trials on GLP-1s. That's incredibly low. We get 87% adherence at 90 days, and we hold it pretty strong there. So I think adherence is a big deal. And third is side effects. Reading thyroid, pancreas, kidney, these cancer, these major side effects and minor ones like nausea, constipation, and pain. Our biggest side effect as President Biden had a little mark on his face and he was asked about it, and it was from his CPAP. Look, I think it's a long road to play out here. I think it's frankly good marketing around the area of obesity and it can drive patients into the funnel. But I don't think it's going to be a major impact on patients because we've got 936 million of them worldwide and we need them to get into the funnel. If they come in the funnel because they tried a pill and it didn't work. That's good for us too.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.\nShaymus Contorno: Hi, this is Shaymus on for Suraj. So we saw gross margin set down a little bit. I know you said there was some reasonings for it, but I just looking forward kind of in the future, maybe you can walk us through the temporary and more structurally permanent changes we should think through as far as GM outlook is concerned.\nMick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question and you look and it's a good one. Lots of factors going on gross margin, actually, the major one that as you noticed sequentially on the 30 basis points was foreign exchange and that was on inventory as it flowed through our funnel as we sold those CPAPs, APAPs we had, FX that had impacted them, six, nine months ago, but they're flowing through inventory that we sold during the June quarter. That was the headwind of 30 basis points from Q3 to Q4. We -- look, I think there's so many moving parts, but when you add it up and you look at geography mix and the upside opportunity for us to grow our business in Europe, Asia, particularly Japan, which has some chance for acceleration over the coming years, product mix, I mentioned in the prep remarks, particularly on bi-level and our non-invasive ventilator growth. So think AirCurve ST, FTI, AirCurve ASV, these are in -- and our masks side, particularly the full face, but any of the masks, all of those are gross margin accretive to our group. And I see opportunities for strong growth in all those categories. And also our software solutions have gross margin accretive capabilities and as we go on an organic basis from single-digits to high-single-digits to low doubles there on the software SaaS side of the business, I think that's margin accretive. So I feel good about that. I also know that we are working through the sort of higher inventory costs that we had in that supply chain crisis, we had to spend more on chips, parts and pieces and those contracts and get more expensive components for the cloud connective chip and beyond. And those freight costs that we invested in and everyone's talking all the news, the freight costs are down, you should take away your surcharge. Well, no, actually the freight costs that we paid six, nine months ago are working there with through -- way through our gross margin, as you saw in the June quarter. And that'll go on for some time, but that's going to continue to go down over time and as that does go through our sole products, there's going to be some tailwinds for gross margin. And the final one and really important one is we're going to drive AirSense 11. It's the best in the world product. It's better than the second best product in the world, which is the AirSense 10. And it gives us a chance as we gain regulatory approvals and we scale that production to improve our gross margins there as well. So all those are tailwinds for the gross and net margin of the business as we move through the fiscal year. Hard to predict in that one of the main factors is, how do we accelerate in the U.S. and particularly in CPAP, APAP. I will never turn down a patient if there's demand for a patient and they want an CPAP and APAP, I'm not going to reverse engineer and we know how to do it. We could reverse engineer our gross margin up 30, 50 basis points by slowing down sales of product. We're not going to do that when a patient needs care. We're going to take care of them even if it's a slightly lower gross margin. And by the way, it is very good gross profit dollars, and we get to take that cash flow as you saw a really strong cash flow in the quarter and reinvest it in R&D. So we're working on all the above furiously and we're going to get success as we go over the next one, two, three, and four quarters.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Laura Sutcliffe from UBS. Your line is now live.\nLaura Sutcliffe: Hello, thank you. I was just wondering if you could talk about how your position to increase your mask supply in the event that the consent decree over at the competition impacts their ability to provide those, for example, if they end up constrained at a facility level. Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Yes. Look, we have run all sorts of scenario analyses around that. I think one of the differences if you think in terms of ResMed's ability to work with suppliers in the core device side, where in terms of chip sets, the whole med-tech sector as a group, and I serve on the Board of AdvaMed and we were advocating for more semiconductor chips for the whole industry. When we were going to Intel, TI and all these companies and sort of begging for semiconductor chips 12, 18 months ago, all together we were less than 1% of the supply of chips. And it was very difficult. We did get some, and as you saw, we did have to pay a little more, but we were able to get those contracts with other players and get long-term contracts and get that supply. In the field of medical grade silicon rubber, we are one of the top users in the world for this. As you know, we sell tens of millions of mask products per year. And we are an incredibly large part of that supply chain. So if a competitor was not able to sell masks, their demand for that LSR would go down and those or similar suppliers would then want to keep their factories operating and be looking for other suppliers. And we would be running the game theory and the analysis of where we go and how we go to ramp that production up. So it would be a good problem to have for the business. I think it'd be bad problem to have for patients, but I think the probability of that is relatively low, but if it does happen, we're ready. But Rob, do you have any thoughts on that? Rob Douglas, our President and COO.\nRob Douglas: Yes. Hi, just one other minor comment on that. And we've said this before, because of the relatively low CapEx of our supply chain and the equipment that we need, we generally run with quite a lot of those capacity supply. And so our ability to rapidly increase volumes as needed is really strong.\nMick Farrell: Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nSean Laaman: Good afternoon. Mick, hope you're well. Mick, I'm wondering if you could characterize for us some of the price dynamics that might have been present during the quarter.\nMick Farrell: Yes, thanks for the question, Sean. Yes, a simple question, very complex answer across the 140 countries and all the dynamics. I think one thing that I'm comfortable to say though on this is that if you look over the last four quarters, our commercial teams have done an incredible job of partnering up with our customers to say, look, inflation is up, costs are up. How do we share some of the pain, if you like, of these increased costs? And we were able to increase some prices on some mask systems and components and some devices where we could, it's tough because customers often don't get much relief from the payers. They did in the Medicare side in the U.S. market where there was an inflation adjustment up of around 5% January 1. And so that was a benefit for our providers, and so we could share some of the pain there in terms of increased pricing. But we've also had some surcharges on our products in terms of freight. And although, as I said in the prep remarks, we've seen all the news media that freight costs are all down. Well, yes, okay, they are on a spot price, but 12 months ago or nine months ago, as that works through our inventory, that freight charge is still there and is still impacting our costs. And inflation, although coming down is still high. But I think our commercial teams have done a really good job of partnering up with our customers, walking them through the situation, the reality that costs are up, inflation's up, freights up, inventory costs are up. We need to work on appropriate pricing to make that happen. And we've had some appreciation in average selling price over these last 12 months. And we'll look to do over the next 12 months to do an appropriate pricing with customers on a per customer per contract basis to sort of share some of the pain of the increased cost that our industry is having. But at the same time, we're laser-focused on driving that growth. And so it's a really strong sort of price elasticity, it's a question of how do we make sure we get that balance right? But it's a competitive game. Some of our competitors are out there saying the same thing publicly, that costs are up. And so we need to move prices appropriately. And we are out there working with customers to make sure that we as an industry take care of patients in a sustainable economic way, and that that involves both quantity, price, and supply over the long-term.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nLyanne Harrison: Yes. Good morning, Mick. Can I ask a question about outlook? So through the earlier -- early quarters you mentioned that we were going to see sequential revenue growth through 2023, and we have seen that, and that's been fabulous. But with your competitor -- key competitor out of the market, do you still expect to grow revenue sequentially into first quarter, second quarter 2024 or for however long as they remain out of the market?\nMick Farrell: Yes. So great question, Lyanne. And yes, 12 months ago, when it was pretty clear that we had a strong runway there on the devices side, and we -- it was really, we were constrained by our own production. I was able to very strongly say, look, I am confident that our supply chain team has got access to this re-engineering, redesign, and redeployment of key components, particularly electronic components, particularly semiconductors. And we did that and we grew device revenue every quarter throughout fiscal year 2023, as you noted. I was really excited with the team on that. As we look forward to fiscal year 2024, we don't give guidance really on the top-line. Brett's given some really solid guidance on our SG&A, our R&D, our effective tax rate and how we're looking in those parts of the business that are very controllable. As I said in some of the earlier questions, Lyanne, there's so many moving factors in overall demand in the market. But look, I'm confident because new patients continue to come into the funnel, right? That's happening across the world, and it's not happening randomly. We're driving demand gen programs; we're driving them in Australia, New Zealand with our Awaken Your Best campaign. We're driving them through our German teams, our India teams, social media programs in our China team, this really strong social media demand gen. And so we're getting new patients in the funnel. And there was a lot of patients who couldn't get a replenishment device when their device hit three years or five years or whatever time their insurance allows, or they as a consumer decide that they want to get to the next-gen product. And I think the AirSense 11 and all its features, it's engagement with the patient, with compliance coach, and its ability to engage with them directly on the touchscreen has driven some demand as well. So all that together make me confident that over the fiscal year, we're going to have strong demand. But as you go from Q4 to Q1, there's a seasonal impact. The Northern European and U.S. markets take summer vacations, and these have impacts seasonally on the business. And so traditionally, Q4 to Q1 isn't one up. I'm not giving guidance for it, but traditionally, that's the way it happens. We are not -- we are no longer supply constrained. We are back to a demand environment. And then there's the factor of that number four competitor probably not coming back during the next 60 days through. So the end of this 90-day period, but I'm not going to jump in and predict on that. All I'm going to say is we're out there all day every day, driving demand gen of new patients in, we're out there farming for patients who need to get a replacement device. And every day we're engaging with patients on myAir and reminding them of the importance of a clean hygiene and a new mask and engagement with their digital apps. So all the above gives me very strong confidence for high growth of ResMed throughout the year. But I'm not going to call it on an every 90 day basis here. We just don't do that on the top-line.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nChris Cooper: Good morning -- afternoon. Thank you. So Mick on AirSense 11, you sort of emphasized its importance for gross margin. You also said at the start of the call, you sort of expect this to remain on allocation for a few more quarters yet, I know this timeframe was probably a bit longer than you'd hoped. I just wanted to confirm whether that's entirely a function of supply chain at this point, or I guess whether there's any sort of strategic consideration to manage volumes during such an unusual competitive dynamic.\nMick Farrell: Yes, Chris, thanks for the question. We've really been focused on that patient and making sure no one's left behind. As I said in an earlier question, and although the AirSense 11 is better margin for us, and it's better innovation and it has a higher engagement on the myAir app, which drives engagement, adherence, mass resupply and everything. Our view is that if there's a patient available and we have the parts and pieces and the ability to make an AirSense 10 take care of that demand now while we ramp AirSense 11, we're going to do it and we're going to take care of that patient. By the way, there's some really strong upside for that patient in that the alternative is a competitor device, which would not be as small, quite, comfortable and connected. And so they'd have a much worse experience than the AirSense 10 with a competitive one. So it's better for the patient. It is slightly low margin for us, but we get that patient on therapy, and there is the better together with ResMed that it's more likely, hopefully, that they get a ResMed mask and that they use that mask for the rest of their life. And so I think there's an overlap there, if you like of altruism and the profit motive to do the right thing on a gross profit, cash flow driven environment. And we're not going to manage just to a GM line and say, well, let's not do that and make those products. And so it's less I mean, it's strategic in this way that our brand is about patient care. Our brand is about taking care of someone who's suffocating and getting them out of hospital and doing that. And if we have to do it with an AirSense 10, which is an amazing seven-year old platform, then we're going to do it. If we can do it with the brand new AirSense 11 platform, we're going to do it. And look, nothing's slowing us down. Our quality and regulatory teams are going geography by geography to get the AirSense 11 approved in each of the regulatory environments. So as soon as that is, we can start selling the products. But the ramp up on AirSense 11 is probably not as fast as it would be in a market where you had all five major competitors competing there because of that excess demand we're covering a lot of that with the AirSense 10. So that's sort of how we're thinking about it. Patient-centric, patient demand, take care of that patient now, get them on our ecosystem, and then ramp as fast as we can AirSense 11, and we're doing that. Nothing's slowing down. The accelerator is firmly pedal to the floor on AirSense 11. And so everyone we make, we sell but it will be on allocation just given the huge demand that we see in the market right now, Chris. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST. Your line is now live.\nDan Hurren: Hi, good morning, and thanks very much. Mick, at the third quarter result, you seem to be very confident about gross margin. In fact, I think at the time we know that it was probably the most positive gross margin commentary we'd heard out of ResMed in recent memory. So I know you've spoken to component cost and why you don't manage the gross margin, but what else changed since the time you gave that, that commentary to the result?\nMick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question. And I think actually if you go back and look, the all the factors that I talked about 90 days ago, we're talking about today, but in addition, the AirSense 11 ramp that we're putting together there. What happened in these 90 days that was unpredicted was -- there was more demand. What we thought a competitor may be back, and there was more demand for CPAPs and APAPs and we didn't -- I know the exact number of how we could have slowed down our AirSense 10 generation to get gross margin to be plus 30 basis points from QtoQ, but we didn't engineer it and reverse engineer it that way. We said, there's demand out there, let's go take care of those patients. That was the unexpected factor. It was U.S. CPAP and APAP demand. And I mean, you look through the numbers, you'll see that it was incredibly strong on gross profit generation, cash flow generation, incredibly strong during the quarter. And we did think about it. Oh gosh, do we follow through and saying, oh, we want to get accretive GM, 90-day to 90-day point or do we say take care of that patient? And we said, no, we're going to do the right thing. We're going to take care of the patient. So we're thinking about the long-term here. But no, I'm still bullish over this fiscal year for sure. I -- you never can know what demand's going to look like and where it's at and we are not going to not take care of a patient. But as those higher inventory costs work their way through our system there's opportunity for gross margin improvement as we go forward. There's also the impact of if you looked at the SG&A this time a year ago in the June quarter of 2022 versus 2023, there was still a lot of people on that sort of COVID. I'm not traveling, I'm not going to see customers, I'm not going to do the strategic meetings and the planning meetings. We've opened some of that up, as you saw in our SG&A and so that's impacting our net margin as well. We're going to manage those tightly and carefully. And we'll probably have some further vigilance, if you like, on our SG&A and we won't be pulling back really on R&D. I think that the innovation engine has to continue to grow, and we're doubling down on AI, and I think our leadership and digital health, we have to make that happen. So I'm still bullish throughout the fiscal year of FY2024. But we're not going to not take care of a patient if there's excess demand with a CPAP and APAP to manage one component of the P&L versus taking care of the patients and thinking about the one, three, five-year strategic engagement with the patient, with the physician, with the provider, and doing the right thing for the industry. So that's the sort of factors that have changed in the next 90 days. And I hope actually all this comes together and we continue to do both, right, drive the needs of the patient and be able to get accretion in our GM. And I'm very confident we'll do that over the coming 3, 6, 9, 12 months.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from David Low from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now live.\nDavid Low: Thanks very much. Mick, could I get to comment a little on what you saw in the ex-U.S. market? Obviously last quarter we saw the big event sale ventilator sales into China. Just wondering if there's any countries you'd call out or any items we should be aware of, please.\nMick Farrell: Yes, David, that's a good point. We didn't really see anything of material context in this quarter in terms of exacerbation of COVID that that led to hospital based or life support ventilator sales. And so we're back to I would say some steady growth that we see in our neuromuscular disease, our COPD and other sort of respiratory insufficiency parts of our business for life support vents. On the non-invasive vents and adaptive server vents and bi-levels, we're back to steady market growth and actually we saw strong double-digit growth as those post-COVID, we're starting to see the clinics open up and patient flows start to come back. Rob, any thoughts on ventilators?\nRob Douglas: No. Not on ventilators, because I'm just going to comment on masks.\nMick Farrell: Yes.\nRob Douglas: So the masks in all these other markets were really strong and really it's showing underlying strength of the market not affected by recall dynamics or anything like that. So really the whole patient diagnostic systems are working in order and everything's going strongly.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden. Your line is now line.\nSteve Wheen: Yes. Thanks very much. I just wanted to ask Brett about the working capital position. Again, last quarter we were -- you were thinking that you'd be able to make some inroads into those -- into the inventory balances that you had such that we might see a bit of more of the release of cash, but obviously inventory stepped up again as has the receivables. Is that just building more to the demand that you see? Or could you just help put that into a bit more context as why it didn't quite play out the way you thought?\nBrett Sandercock: Yes. Hi, Steve. It's Brett. The inventory actually came down a little bit sequentially, so that, that's sort of tracking down how we're expecting. We expect that inventory balance should decline over the course of FY024 as well. The receivables you're right was up a little bit, but that's really driven by the revenues. I think overall in the working capital, we're in pretty good shape. It was up a little bit this quarter. When you look at that, we -- it's really the timing around tax payments this quarter. So we paid higher tax this quarter than we would typically do each quarter. So that's that drive, if you like, a little bit of negative working capital. But again, that's just a timing element. So we're expecting pretty robust cash flow generation through each of the quarters in FY2024. And we'll continue to work hard on the working capital and bringing that down. A big driver of that will obviously be the inventory and working that down progressively over the fiscal year.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Mike Matson from Needham and Company. Your line is now live.\nJoseph Conway: Hi guys, this is Joseph on for Mike. Could you maybe talk about the new patient and REPAP backlog internationally? I guess the way that I understand it is it's fully worked through in the U.S. but there's still work to do internationally. I don't know if you -- if that's the case and if you could size that at all.\nMick Farrell: Yes. Look, I don't think we've fully worked through the backlog of patients in the U.S. in terms of patients who want to get whose insurance has got to the five-year point if their Medicare or three, four, five depending on which private payer they're under. And so I do think our competitors' actions slowed down that, that particularly if they're on a competitive device and the demand limitation and the physician saying, look, I've got to take care of new patients. They weren't as prone to write prescriptions or to allocate REPAP, if you like, for patients. So I actually think there's some runways still left on REPAP within the U.S. geography, and I think that's even more so in other markets. As Rob just noted and as we talked about the engagement with consumers and patients in different geographies is driving mass growth and any quarter that have 14% revenue growth in masks in Europe, Asia, rest of the world would be incredible. And that's not driven by any recall dynamics whatsoever from a competitor. Everybody's been competing in masks globally. And so I think that speaks to our ability to hopefully have a sustainable approach to REPAP not only in the U.S. where we have incredibly strong relationships with Brightree and myAir directly to patients, directly to providers but the ecosystems that we are generating in some of our other sort of omni-channel markets around the world. So I think the opportunity for REPAP in the U.S. is still there over this fiscal year and beyond, and to make it a rhythm, right? So it becomes a steady part of the growth of the devices and to drive it. I think there's even more opportunity in the other parts of the world leveraging the work we've done on the mask side to then remind patients and track them when they're at that three, four, five-year time period to pull forward. Now I want to be there with the appropriate supply, so I'm not jumping ahead of ourselves, but we do have the programs and capabilities to do that, but I think the demand is there inherently.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey Capital. Your line is now live.\nSaul Hadassin: Good morning, Mick, and good day, Brett and Rob. Just wondering on masks, it's been a while since we've seen some new product coming out from ResMed. Just wondering how much has the recall -- better recall impacted on your ability to continue to focus on new product development and new product launch? And I guess on the mask side, should we expect anything for near-term in terms of a refresh of the mask portfolio? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Yes. So it's a great question and yes, our R&D team, have obviously been incredibly focused on the re-engineering, the resupply and the redesign on our core device platforms, and we're able to do that, right? So we're able to get the supply back of Air 10s, as you saw, and Air 11s. But yet, look, I -- we had the whole board down in Sydney last quarter, and we were looking through the pipeline of devices and masks and it's incredible. It's really exciting. I don't like to get ahead of my commercial teams, and one of them is at the table with me now telling me to keep quiet. But I can tell you I'm very excited about the pipeline. There will be new innovation, new masks from ResMed as we go through this fiscal year. And as a personal user of these products, I try every new mask that comes out and this new one, which has a great project name that I'm not able to say, but it's a beautiful island that you can travel to by boats. I have tried that that mask and it's incredible and I can't wait for that to come to the market. But yes, look, we do have masks that are coming in the pipeline that are working their way through regulatory and then of course, commercial ramp up to make sure that when we deliver, it's ResMed quality, ResMed capability, first time fit, incredible adherence, and to drive through the channel. And so you'll see those come through our major markets and then globally throughout the fiscal year. So I'm excited about that pipeline. The one that I can talk about is the digital side, where we've launched an AI product and I'm really excited as those get more traction, we'll talk about how the digital products and the mass products throughout the year are going to impact and keep our incredibly strong double-digit growth that we saw this quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further or closing comments.\nMick Farrell: Yes. Thanks, Kevin. And thanks to all of our stakeholders for joining us this last hour as we talked through our results. And we'll talk to you again in 90 days. In closing, I want to thank the 10,000 ResMedians. Many of you are shareholders and listen to these calls as well, thanks for your dedication and hard work, helping people sleep better, breathe better, live better lives in 140 countries. These results are yours, incredible double-digit growth. Thanks for all that you do. I'll hand the call back to you Amy to close this out.\nAmy Wakeham: Awesome. Thank you, Mick, and thanks, everyone. We do appreciate your interest and your time. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out directly. This does conclude our ResMed's fourth quarter 2023 conference call. Kevin, I'll turn it back to you to close the call.\nOperator: Thank you. You may now disconnect. We do thank you for your participation today.",

            "content": "Yes. Hi, just one other minor comment on that. And we've said this before, because of the relatively low CapEx of our supply chain and the equipment that we need, we generally run with quite a lot of those capacity supply. And so our ability to rapidly increase volumes as needed is really strong. No. Not on ventilators, because I'm just going to comment on masks. So the masks in all these other markets were really strong and really it's showing underlying strength of the market not affected by recall dynamics or anything like that. So really the whole patient diagnostic systems are working in order and everything's going strongly."

            "name": "Brett Sandercock",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. We had strong financial performance in Q4. Group revenue for the June quarter was $1.12 billion, an increase of 23% on a headline basis and in constant currency terms. Revenue growth reflected the ongoing combined availability of cloud connected AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 sleep devices to support strong underlying global demand, as well as solid growth across our broader product portfolio. Year-on-year movements in foreign currencies negatively impacted revenue by approximately $3 million in the June quarter. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution, excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in U.S., Canada, and Latin America countries increased by 25%. In constant currency terms, sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 14%. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 24% while masks and other sales increased by 18%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America increased by 30% as we benefited from strong demand. And as previously mentioned, our continued ability to fully supply the market with combined availability of AS 10 and AS 11 cloud connected devices. Masks and other sales increased by 19%, reflecting growth in resupply and new patient setups. Europe, Asia, and other markets, device sales increased by 15% in constant currency terms, again reflecting strong demand and improving availability of cloud connected devices. Masks and other sales increased by 14% in constant currency terms, reflecting increased patient setups. Software-as-a-Service revenue increased by 34% in the June quarter, reflecting the contribution from our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition and continued strong performance from our HME vertical. Excluding our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, SaaS revenue grew by 8% in the June quarter. MEDIFOX DAN contributed revenue of $27.3 million for the June quarter consistent with our expectations at the time of the acquisition. During the rest of my commentary today, I will refer to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release. Gross margin declined by 200 points to 55.8% in the June quarter. The decrease primarily reflects component cost increases; warranty and manufacturing related cost increases and product mix shifts due to the significant increase in sleep device sales partially offset by increases in average selling prices  On a sequential basis, unfavorable foreign currency movements accounted for the 30 basis points decline in our gross margin and we saw a lower than expected product mix benefit as we continue to see strong growth in sleep devices in the U.S. market. Moving on to operating expenses. SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter increased by 25%, or in constant currency terms increased by 26%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related costs marketing and travel expenses, as well as the incremental SG&A expenses associated with MEDIFOX DAN that we acquired in November 2022. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue was 21.5% compared to 21.1% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% during fiscal year 2024. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 21% or in constant currency terms increased by 23%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7% consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% during fiscal year 2024. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 13% underpinned by strong revenue growth partially offset by lower gross margin. Following the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, our net interest expense for the quarter is $15 million and we expect interest expense to be a similar amount per quarter in the first half of fiscal year 2024. Our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 18.3% compared to the prior year quarter rate of 17.6%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2024 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the June quarter increased by 7% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 7%. During the quarter, we incurred $1.8 million in acquisition expenses associated with our Somnoware acquisition, and we recognized restructuring costs of $9.2 million associated with the closure of the Aria lymphedema business and workforce rationalization in our German and SaaS business verticals. We also recognized a gain of $20.2 million within our income in relation to a business interruption insurance claim. These have all been treated as non-GAAP items in our Q4 financial results. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $237 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings, partially offset by a modest increase in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $34 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $47 million. We ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $228 million. At June 30, we had $1.4 billion in gross debt and $1.2 billion in net debt, which mainly reflects the funding of our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition. During the quarter, we reduced our debt by $145 million. At June 30, we had approximately $745 million available for drawdown under our revolver facility, and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share, representing an increase of 9% over our previous quarterly dividend and reflecting the Board's confidence in our operating performance. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D and expect to deploy further capital for tuck-in acquisitions such as our recently announced acquisition of Somnoware, a company that provides an upstream diagnostic management platform that is complementary to our current AirView and Brightree solutions. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy. Yes. Hi, Steve. It's Brett. The inventory actually came down a little bit sequentially, so that, that's sort of tracking down how we're expecting. We expect that inventory balance should decline over the course of FY024 as well. The receivables you're right was up a little bit, but that's really driven by the revenues. I think overall in the working capital, we're in pretty good shape. It was up a little bit this quarter. When you look at that, we -- it's really the timing around tax payments this quarter. So we paid higher tax this quarter than we would typically do each quarter. So that's that drive, if you like, a little bit of negative working capital. But again, that's just a timing element. So we're expecting pretty robust cash flow generation through each of the quarters in FY2024. And we'll continue to work hard on the working capital and bringing that down. A big driver of that will obviously be the inventory and working that down progressively over the fiscal year."

            "name": "Mick Farrell",
            "content": "Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all our shareholders for joining us today as we review the results of our June quarter, the last quarter of our fiscal year 2023. Our results reflect incredible growth across our entire business with double-digit growth in our devices, masks, and software businesses. Unconstrained availability of our market leading cloud connected flow generator platforms has enabled us to continue to offer access to 100% cloud connectable AirSense 10 flow generated devices in all of our major global markets and beyond. In parallel, we are ramping up and improving the availability of our best-in-class AirSense 11 platform, which will gain further geographic regulatory approvals throughout the fiscal year and steadily increasing supply also throughout the fiscal year 2024 and beyond. Although challenges within the post-COVID supply chain haven't completely been mitigated yet, we expect ongoing steady improvement in component and end product supply in the quarters ahead using a combination of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 platforms. While we remain focused on scaling production and global availability of the AirSense 11 platform, we remain on allocation for the Air 11 platform for the next few quarters. But I want to be clear on this point. With combined availability of the unconstrained Air 10 platform, we have enough devices to meet all of the customer needs that we see in major markets and globally. With the powerful combination of the Air 10 and the Air 11 platforms, we have the two best device platforms on the market. Our strong double-digit 23% year-over-year growth in the devices category demonstrates that customers are choosing ResMed and we are delivering. Our masks and accessories business also performed at a very strong 18% growth in constant currency this quarter. Patient demand continues to drive increased adoption and utilization of our mask resupply programs, augmenting a steady cadence of new patient setups. We continue to see strong growth in both the U.S. business where provider resupply programs have augmented growth and in our markets outside the U.S. where our consumer outreach and subscription programs are also driving mass replenishment directly with those end user patients. Our teams continue to work incredibly hard to achieve these strong growth results amid a challenging industry environment where component costs and freight costs are still working their way through our inventory post this supply chain crisis. I'm proud of the work that 10,000 ResMedians have put in every week, every month, every quarter to deliver these incredible results for the business, for our customers, for our shareholders, and ultimately for our most important customer, our patients. Let's now briefly review updates on the top three strategic priorities for our company. Number one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea and respiratory care business; number two, to design, develop, and deliver market leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and number three, to create, innovate, and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital, a field that we call residential medicine. In terms of our patient facing digital health platforms, adoption continues to go very well. The feedback we hear from patients and healthcare professionals remains very positive. We are seeing strong adoption of the myAir patient app by folks using AirSense 11. In fact, it is more than double the adoption rate that we saw with our AirSense 10 platform with many, many millions of patients signing up and engaging daily on their myAir app to view their own sleep data on their own phone and to review their own therapy data. This is important as engagement with a digital health platform like myAir is directly linked to higher adherence to therapy in patients. And higher adherence to therapy is directly related to better patient outcomes, to increased resupply and to better economics for the payer and the healthcare provider with lower overall healthcare costs. Last month, we announced and closed the acquisition of Somnoware. Somnoware is a U.S.-based leader in sleep and respiratory care diagnostics software and physician management software. As part of our ongoing efforts to improve and streamline the end-to-end pathway for patients and make it easier for sleep labs and physicians and their practices to diagnose and manage patients, we're excited about this acquisition that complements our current ecosystem of software solutions, including AirView for providers and physicians and Brightree for home care providers. These ecosystem together will drive greater efficiency and better patient care by accelerating the pathway to therapy and with a better overall customer experience. We're also excited about our progress across several digital health technology initiatives to further increase the value proposition for our connected healthcare ecosystem. Over the next several quarters, we plan to introduce several artificial intelligence driven data products and capabilities on both the physician and provider facing AirView platform, as well as the patient facing myAir app. Early testing of these AI driven data products is very positive in both of these customer groups, and we will refine to the optimal digital design and then we will launch and then we will scale these products around the world. These AI driven data products provide personalized suggestions to increase therapy adherence and to ultimately improve patient outcomes as well as patient, physician, and provider experience. We will continue to invest in the world's largest digital healthcare ecosystem that we have with over 15.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud as we continue to unlock value from those data to benefit physicians, providers, payers, and patients. We saw strong growth in our respiratory care business in the quarter through ongoing adoption of our non-invasive ventilators as well as our life support ventilator solutions. We're still in the early stages of market development with some of our newer to market technologies in this category, including home-based high-flow therapy that we call HFT for treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD in the home. We continue to generate clinical evidence and economic outcomes to support broader adoption of these technology innovations for treating lung disease in the home. We're encouraged by the clinical results we've seen with our HFT trials so far, and we continue to remain very focused on addressing COPD as one of the top diseases globally for hospitalization and the number one cause of re-hospitalization in the U.S. geography. The prevalence of respiratory insufficiency due to COPD as well as respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular disease continues to increase and we are focused on having low cost, high quality solutions to address this health epidemic. Our SaaS business had another great quarter with year-over-year growth of 34%. Our SaaS business growth was supported by another full quarter contribution from our fast growing MEDIFOX DAN business, as well as solid organic growth of 8% across our Brightree and MatrixCare portfolio of SaaS businesses. We're pleased to see sustained high-single-digit growth in our SaaS business on an organic basis, driven by the ongoing strength in the HME and infusion segment, and more stability in the facility segment as patient flows have now rebounded post-COVID. I'm very impressed by the leadership of our most recent SaaS portfolio addition MEDIFOX DAN, which is on track and meeting or beating our expectations. I'll be visiting personally with the team in Hildesheim, Germany, this quarter to discuss the growth face-to-face with the digital health innovators there in Hildesheim who are changing healthcare and taking care of people in the lowest cost, lowest acuity and highest quality of life setting, which is very often the home. We believe this is the future of healthcare and that's where we're investing and that's where we're winning. Our customers continue to see the value of adopting technologies to improve and optimize business efficiencies and personalized care, and we deliver the best software solutions to help customers do just that. There is pent-up demand for technology investments in residential medicine verticals, particularly as staffing shortages continue to impact the industry, particularly in nursing, but across the clinician and provider groups. This presents opportunities for ResMed's SaaS solutions to streamline operations and create workflow efficiencies so our customers, staff can focus on providing personal care. It's up to us to deliver for our customers and drive growth. I have confidence that our SaaS business can accelerate from these high-single-digits on an organic basis to double-digit growth on an organic basis in the mid to long-term. Our SaaS business remains an integral part of ResMed's growth strategy. This business complements the market leading software and device solutions that we have in our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. As an important example, our Brightree ReSupply program continues to demonstrate strong synergies between SaaS and our core business, providing resupply for patients with sleep apnea, COPD, neuromuscular disease and beyond. The output of this work can be seen in our very healthy 19% growth in mass revenues in the U.S. geography this quarter. Ultimately, this work results in better outcomes for the patient, the physician, the provider, and the payer with lower overall healthcare costs. We are well-positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for residential medicine globally. We have created differentiated value for our customers as well as long-term sustainable growth for our stakeholders. Here at ResMed, we are transforming respiratory medicine and residential medicine at scale, leading the market in digital health technology across our businesses. As we continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our operations in this post-COVID world, we continue to leverage appropriate pricing and cost reductions to drive accelerated growth in our bottom line. We are focused on driving top-line revenue and maintaining tight discipline and increasing efficiencies so that we can lower costs and ultimately so that we can accelerate our impact and our bottom line profitability, delivering even further value for all of our shareholders. As we move through fiscal year 2024, I see improvements in our business margins with geography mix, with product mix, and specifically with strong bi-level and non-invasive ventilator growth with strong mass growth and with increased software solutions growth. All these business lines are margin accretive to our growth. I also see that the higher inventory costs and freight costs that we've seen through the supply chain crisis continue to work their way through our sold products and as we progress through the fiscal year, we will continue to drive the transition to AirSense 11 and we will gain regulatory approvals and we will scale production. All these factors above lead to tailwinds for the gross margin and the net margin of our business as we move through the fiscal year. I can tell you we are working furiously to drive all of the above elements with our global teams. We now have over 15.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud, as I said earlier, and those data come from over 21.5 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We continue to lead the industry in digital health and we don't plan to stop anytime soon because there's so much opportunity ahead of us. 7% of our revenues go straight into R&D to power our hardware and our data innovation engines. ResMed's mission and key goal remains crystal clear. We will improve 250 million lives through better residential healthcare in 2025. This patient-centric mission drives and motivates ResMedians every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal over the last 90 days and during the trailing 12 months, we have improved over 160 million lives with the delivery of a complete device platform to a patient or a complete mask system to a patient or a digital health software solution that is helping each person to sleep better, to breathe better, and to live a high quality life with healthcare delivered right where they live. As we start fiscal year 2024 here, I'm very excited about the opportunities in front of us. We just had our SaaS ASM earlier this week, and I'll be attending the Country Market Group CMG Group for our North America team in the coming weeks. And sales meetings are happening around the world. We're on a good trajectory. We have an exciting pipeline. In closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the more than 10,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, their hard work and their dedication both today and every day. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney and then we'll move and open up for Q&A for the group. Brett, over to you. Yes. Thanks for the question, Matthew. And it's a good one. It's hard to predict because there are so many factors involved that that are going on in the market right now. But yes, as you said, a very, very solid number, $602 million in global devices in the quarter and 30% growth in U.S., Canada, Latin America, 15% growth in Europe, Asia, and rest of world. Look, we're seeing a strong sort of mid-single-digits level of patient flow into the channel. We're seeing in addition to that -- like in terms of new patients, we're seeing in addition to that resupply of patients at that five-year point for most U.S. reimbursement and various points in the other 139 countries where people make their own decisions or insurance has other criteria to drive that. So it's new patient setups, it's resupply setups and there's of course the impact of a competitor recall, which is -- was supposed to be over in June 30 and now has no definitive date. And so as we look to that with all those unknown factors, it's very hard for me to say, Matthew, that it's just stop and steady growth from here. It might be stronger growth from here. And that makes it hard to predict gross margins because as we grow those CPAP and APAP numbers so well in the U.S. geography, it's incredible great revenue and cloud connected and links us with the patient for life, but it is lower gross margin than our group. And so it's great gross profit dollars, but has an impact on our gross margin as you saw that steady apart from FX moving it down 30 basis points. So a complex equation but I'd say it's at minimum, it stays where it is and grows with the market but it could potentially grow above that as we continue to take share and solidify that share through our digital ecosystem. Thanks for the question, Matthew. Yes. Thanks, Margaret, and welcome back. Yes. I think it's difficult to predict exactly where they're at from those sort of the early emerging signs, as you say. Look, we have regional competitors in Europe that we are fighting with every day there. We have regional competitors in Asia that we're fighting with every day and regional competitors in the Americas that we're fighting with every day. When Philips comes back, they'll have to start at position number four, if you like, in new patient setups. We are -- they are back and we are competing with them in some countries in Europe, like in Spain, they never went away because they never had a phone device there. So they've been there the whole time through this recall, and we've been beating them handsomely there. And as other markets in Europe where they've started to come back, we are competing and winning and maintaining share and growing share. I think the reputation here and the time to market is going to be a very slow progress for them country by country whether or not they get a consent decree in the largest geography. And so we look at it going forward and say, look, do we have enough supply to take care of all the market demands between us and the other regional players? And we finally got there where I can say that this quarter that we're there and we can take care of it. So it's almost irrelevant to us how and when in terms of what that looks like because we're able to take care of all the market growth. So for us, it sort of takes away that uncertainty and allows us to push forward. But yes, we're competing head-to-head with them in some many countries in Asia and some countries in Europe. And it's like -- it wasn't 2019 where our smaller, quieter, more comfortable, more connected and more digital solutions are taking share and holding share. And it's an ongoing competitive game. And as I said, we're launching some of these AI driven products on top of this ecosystem. It's an exponential game when you think about digital and we're well ahead. We've had two or three years here to sprint ahead. We were ahead before that. And I think it's a long-term game won't get -- we'll keep productively paranoid, but we are improving outcomes, we're lowering costs and the physicians like the workflow efficiencies and patients like the increased adherence and payers like the fact that there's an ROI in lowering total healthcare costs. Yes. Thanks, Anthony, and welcome back to you too to the ResMed following us here. I'll take yes, both of your question and your follow-up in order. So firstly on resupply, as you know, you've been following us for a number of years. It's not a lock and key. You can use our mask on other devices and you can use other masks on our devices. The way that we've won market share and nobody's been on a major in terms of not being able to sell recall out there on this. And so we've had head-to-head competition with all the top five players in masks, these last three years and we've gained really good share with that. So I think it's just the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable, the minimalist size ones, the ones that have full freedom and the ones that have the ability to for the front sleepers and side sleepers to provide that, that capability. And so that's how we've gained share in the mask side and maintained that share. So I -- there is a better together in that when you have an AirSense 10 or an AirSense 11, the mask leak data are more accurate. The interoperability of an AHI calculation or a leak calculation are more accurate. So we certainly push that angle and we do get some extra share for through the device, but it's not as material as the fact that the masks themselves are just excellent, which I think speaks to the sustainability there. So that strong resupply, as you said, 19% growth in the U.S., 14% growth in Europe, Asia and beyond, where we don't have that sort of automated resupply that we have with Brightree ReSupply Solutions in the U.S. that's been from hard work from our teams in Asia, Latin America, and Europe on patient outreach, subscription programs and connecting directly to that end user. So I think post-COVID people care about respiratory health, respiratory hygiene and taking care of themselves outside the hospital, and we've been able to leverage that trend in the consumer side as well. So I think it's sustainable, and I don't think although it may be catalyzed somewhat by our increased device share, I think our market share is on its own extraordinary and due to the intrinsic products. The second question around GLPs, yes, look, there's a lot of moving parts. I was just reading in the press today that many U.S. employers are banning coverage of GLP-1s due to cost. European governments have all said no from the government insurance side. These things are incredibly expensive about $1,000, well, anywhere from $800 to $1,200, $1,000 a month. So I think there are three factors that'll mitigate GLPs in the space. One is cost, two is adherence, and three is side effects. I'll take them really quickly in order. If you look at cost, take a 40-year old person who's on therapy full time for 40 years, 40 times, 12 times a $1,000 is $480,000 lifetime cost for that patient on a GLP-1 from 40 to 80 lifetime cost. If you take that same patient and say, look, let's treat them with CPAP, right? First year maybe a $1,000, and then 39 years of let's take a really strong case where you get four masks a year and they're all full face masks. That's about thirteen and a half thousand dollars. So it's 35 times more expensive to go with a GLP-1. It's just like what's the ROI here, that's cost. On adherence, the data out there are about 33% adherence at one year through the clinical trials on GLP-1s. That's incredibly low. We get 87% adherence at 90 days, and we hold it pretty strong there. So I think adherence is a big deal. And third is side effects. Reading thyroid, pancreas, kidney, these cancer, these major side effects and minor ones like nausea, constipation, and pain. Our biggest side effect as President Biden had a little mark on his face and he was asked about it, and it was from his CPAP. Look, I think it's a long road to play out here. I think it's frankly good marketing around the area of obesity and it can drive patients into the funnel. But I don't think it's going to be a major impact on patients because we've got 936 million of them worldwide and we need them to get into the funnel. If they come in the funnel because they tried a pill and it didn't work. That's good for us too. Yes. Thanks for the question and you look and it's a good one. Lots of factors going on gross margin, actually, the major one that as you noticed sequentially on the 30 basis points was foreign exchange and that was on inventory as it flowed through our funnel as we sold those CPAPs, APAPs we had, FX that had impacted them, six, nine months ago, but they're flowing through inventory that we sold during the June quarter. That was the headwind of 30 basis points from Q3 to Q4. We -- look, I think there's so many moving parts, but when you add it up and you look at geography mix and the upside opportunity for us to grow our business in Europe, Asia, particularly Japan, which has some chance for acceleration over the coming years, product mix, I mentioned in the prep remarks, particularly on bi-level and our non-invasive ventilator growth. So think AirCurve ST, FTI, AirCurve ASV, these are in -- and our masks side, particularly the full face, but any of the masks, all of those are gross margin accretive to our group. And I see opportunities for strong growth in all those categories. And also our software solutions have gross margin accretive capabilities and as we go on an organic basis from single-digits to high-single-digits to low doubles there on the software SaaS side of the business, I think that's margin accretive. So I feel good about that. I also know that we are working through the sort of higher inventory costs that we had in that supply chain crisis, we had to spend more on chips, parts and pieces and those contracts and get more expensive components for the cloud connective chip and beyond. And those freight costs that we invested in and everyone's talking all the news, the freight costs are down, you should take away your surcharge. Well, no, actually the freight costs that we paid six, nine months ago are working there with through -- way through our gross margin, as you saw in the June quarter. And that'll go on for some time, but that's going to continue to go down over time and as that does go through our sole products, there's going to be some tailwinds for gross margin. And the final one and really important one is we're going to drive AirSense 11. It's the best in the world product. It's better than the second best product in the world, which is the AirSense 10. And it gives us a chance as we gain regulatory approvals and we scale that production to improve our gross margins there as well. So all those are tailwinds for the gross and net margin of the business as we move through the fiscal year. Hard to predict in that one of the main factors is, how do we accelerate in the U.S. and particularly in CPAP, APAP. I will never turn down a patient if there's demand for a patient and they want an CPAP and APAP, I'm not going to reverse engineer and we know how to do it. We could reverse engineer our gross margin up 30, 50 basis points by slowing down sales of product. We're not going to do that when a patient needs care. We're going to take care of them even if it's a slightly lower gross margin. And by the way, it is very good gross profit dollars, and we get to take that cash flow as you saw a really strong cash flow in the quarter and reinvest it in R&D. So we're working on all the above furiously and we're going to get success as we go over the next one, two, three, and four quarters. Yes. Look, we have run all sorts of scenario analyses around that. I think one of the differences if you think in terms of ResMed's ability to work with suppliers in the core device side, where in terms of chip sets, the whole med-tech sector as a group, and I serve on the Board of AdvaMed and we were advocating for more semiconductor chips for the whole industry. When we were going to Intel, TI and all these companies and sort of begging for semiconductor chips 12, 18 months ago, all together we were less than 1% of the supply of chips. And it was very difficult. We did get some, and as you saw, we did have to pay a little more, but we were able to get those contracts with other players and get long-term contracts and get that supply. In the field of medical grade silicon rubber, we are one of the top users in the world for this. As you know, we sell tens of millions of mask products per year. And we are an incredibly large part of that supply chain. So if a competitor was not able to sell masks, their demand for that LSR would go down and those or similar suppliers would then want to keep their factories operating and be looking for other suppliers. And we would be running the game theory and the analysis of where we go and how we go to ramp that production up. So it would be a good problem to have for the business. I think it'd be bad problem to have for patients, but I think the probability of that is relatively low, but if it does happen, we're ready. But Rob, do you have any thoughts on that? Rob Douglas, our President and COO. Thanks for the question. Yes, thanks for the question, Sean. Yes, a simple question, very complex answer across the 140 countries and all the dynamics. I think one thing that I'm comfortable to say though on this is that if you look over the last four quarters, our commercial teams have done an incredible job of partnering up with our customers to say, look, inflation is up, costs are up. How do we share some of the pain, if you like, of these increased costs? And we were able to increase some prices on some mask systems and components and some devices where we could, it's tough because customers often don't get much relief from the payers. They did in the Medicare side in the U.S. market where there was an inflation adjustment up of around 5% January 1. And so that was a benefit for our providers, and so we could share some of the pain there in terms of increased pricing. But we've also had some surcharges on our products in terms of freight. And although, as I said in the prep remarks, we've seen all the news media that freight costs are all down. Well, yes, okay, they are on a spot price, but 12 months ago or nine months ago, as that works through our inventory, that freight charge is still there and is still impacting our costs. And inflation, although coming down is still high. But I think our commercial teams have done a really good job of partnering up with our customers, walking them through the situation, the reality that costs are up, inflation's up, freights up, inventory costs are up. We need to work on appropriate pricing to make that happen. And we've had some appreciation in average selling price over these last 12 months. And we'll look to do over the next 12 months to do an appropriate pricing with customers on a per customer per contract basis to sort of share some of the pain of the increased cost that our industry is having. But at the same time, we're laser-focused on driving that growth. And so it's a really strong sort of price elasticity, it's a question of how do we make sure we get that balance right? But it's a competitive game. Some of our competitors are out there saying the same thing publicly, that costs are up. And so we need to move prices appropriately. And we are out there working with customers to make sure that we as an industry take care of patients in a sustainable economic way, and that that involves both quantity, price, and supply over the long-term. Yes. So great question, Lyanne. And yes, 12 months ago, when it was pretty clear that we had a strong runway there on the devices side, and we -- it was really, we were constrained by our own production. I was able to very strongly say, look, I am confident that our supply chain team has got access to this re-engineering, redesign, and redeployment of key components, particularly electronic components, particularly semiconductors. And we did that and we grew device revenue every quarter throughout fiscal year 2023, as you noted. I was really excited with the team on that. As we look forward to fiscal year 2024, we don't give guidance really on the top-line. Brett's given some really solid guidance on our SG&A, our R&D, our effective tax rate and how we're looking in those parts of the business that are very controllable. As I said in some of the earlier questions, Lyanne, there's so many moving factors in overall demand in the market. But look, I'm confident because new patients continue to come into the funnel, right? That's happening across the world, and it's not happening randomly. We're driving demand gen programs; we're driving them in Australia, New Zealand with our Awaken Your Best campaign. We're driving them through our German teams, our India teams, social media programs in our China team, this really strong social media demand gen. And so we're getting new patients in the funnel. And there was a lot of patients who couldn't get a replenishment device when their device hit three years or five years or whatever time their insurance allows, or they as a consumer decide that they want to get to the next-gen product. And I think the AirSense 11 and all its features, it's engagement with the patient, with compliance coach, and its ability to engage with them directly on the touchscreen has driven some demand as well. So all that together make me confident that over the fiscal year, we're going to have strong demand. But as you go from Q4 to Q1, there's a seasonal impact. The Northern European and U.S. markets take summer vacations, and these have impacts seasonally on the business. And so traditionally, Q4 to Q1 isn't one up. I'm not giving guidance for it, but traditionally, that's the way it happens. We are not -- we are no longer supply constrained. We are back to a demand environment. And then there's the factor of that number four competitor probably not coming back during the next 60 days through. So the end of this 90-day period, but I'm not going to jump in and predict on that. All I'm going to say is we're out there all day every day, driving demand gen of new patients in, we're out there farming for patients who need to get a replacement device. And every day we're engaging with patients on myAir and reminding them of the importance of a clean hygiene and a new mask and engagement with their digital apps. So all the above gives me very strong confidence for high growth of ResMed throughout the year. But I'm not going to call it on an every 90 day basis here. We just don't do that on the top-line. Yes, Chris, thanks for the question. We've really been focused on that patient and making sure no one's left behind. As I said in an earlier question, and although the AirSense 11 is better margin for us, and it's better innovation and it has a higher engagement on the myAir app, which drives engagement, adherence, mass resupply and everything. Our view is that if there's a patient available and we have the parts and pieces and the ability to make an AirSense 10 take care of that demand now while we ramp AirSense 11, we're going to do it and we're going to take care of that patient. By the way, there's some really strong upside for that patient in that the alternative is a competitor device, which would not be as small, quite, comfortable and connected. And so they'd have a much worse experience than the AirSense 10 with a competitive one. So it's better for the patient. It is slightly low margin for us, but we get that patient on therapy, and there is the better together with ResMed that it's more likely, hopefully, that they get a ResMed mask and that they use that mask for the rest of their life. And so I think there's an overlap there, if you like of altruism and the profit motive to do the right thing on a gross profit, cash flow driven environment. And we're not going to manage just to a GM line and say, well, let's not do that and make those products. And so it's less I mean, it's strategic in this way that our brand is about patient care. Our brand is about taking care of someone who's suffocating and getting them out of hospital and doing that. And if we have to do it with an AirSense 10, which is an amazing seven-year old platform, then we're going to do it. If we can do it with the brand new AirSense 11 platform, we're going to do it. And look, nothing's slowing us down. Our quality and regulatory teams are going geography by geography to get the AirSense 11 approved in each of the regulatory environments. So as soon as that is, we can start selling the products. But the ramp up on AirSense 11 is probably not as fast as it would be in a market where you had all five major competitors competing there because of that excess demand we're covering a lot of that with the AirSense 10. So that's sort of how we're thinking about it. Patient-centric, patient demand, take care of that patient now, get them on our ecosystem, and then ramp as fast as we can AirSense 11, and we're doing that. Nothing's slowing down. The accelerator is firmly pedal to the floor on AirSense 11. And so everyone we make, we sell but it will be on allocation just given the huge demand that we see in the market right now, Chris. Thanks for the question. Yes. Thanks for the question. And I think actually if you go back and look, the all the factors that I talked about 90 days ago, we're talking about today, but in addition, the AirSense 11 ramp that we're putting together there. What happened in these 90 days that was unpredicted was -- there was more demand. What we thought a competitor may be back, and there was more demand for CPAPs and APAPs and we didn't -- I know the exact number of how we could have slowed down our AirSense 10 generation to get gross margin to be plus 30 basis points from QtoQ, but we didn't engineer it and reverse engineer it that way. We said, there's demand out there, let's go take care of those patients. That was the unexpected factor. It was U.S. CPAP and APAP demand. And I mean, you look through the numbers, you'll see that it was incredibly strong on gross profit generation, cash flow generation, incredibly strong during the quarter. And we did think about it. Oh gosh, do we follow through and saying, oh, we want to get accretive GM, 90-day to 90-day point or do we say take care of that patient? And we said, no, we're going to do the right thing. We're going to take care of the patient. So we're thinking about the long-term here. But no, I'm still bullish over this fiscal year for sure. I -- you never can know what demand's going to look like and where it's at and we are not going to not take care of a patient. But as those higher inventory costs work their way through our system there's opportunity for gross margin improvement as we go forward. There's also the impact of if you looked at the SG&A this time a year ago in the June quarter of 2022 versus 2023, there was still a lot of people on that sort of COVID. I'm not traveling, I'm not going to see customers, I'm not going to do the strategic meetings and the planning meetings. We've opened some of that up, as you saw in our SG&A and so that's impacting our net margin as well. We're going to manage those tightly and carefully. And we'll probably have some further vigilance, if you like, on our SG&A and we won't be pulling back really on R&D. I think that the innovation engine has to continue to grow, and we're doubling down on AI, and I think our leadership and digital health, we have to make that happen. So I'm still bullish throughout the fiscal year of FY2024. But we're not going to not take care of a patient if there's excess demand with a CPAP and APAP to manage one component of the P&L versus taking care of the patients and thinking about the one, three, five-year strategic engagement with the patient, with the physician, with the provider, and doing the right thing for the industry. So that's the sort of factors that have changed in the next 90 days. And I hope actually all this comes together and we continue to do both, right, drive the needs of the patient and be able to get accretion in our GM. And I'm very confident we'll do that over the coming 3, 6, 9, 12 months. Yes, David, that's a good point. We didn't really see anything of material context in this quarter in terms of exacerbation of COVID that that led to hospital based or life support ventilator sales. And so we're back to I would say some steady growth that we see in our neuromuscular disease, our COPD and other sort of respiratory insufficiency parts of our business for life support vents. On the non-invasive vents and adaptive server vents and bi-levels, we're back to steady market growth and actually we saw strong double-digit growth as those post-COVID, we're starting to see the clinics open up and patient flows start to come back. Rob, any thoughts on ventilators? Yes. Yes. Look, I don't think we've fully worked through the backlog of patients in the U.S. in terms of patients who want to get whose insurance has got to the five-year point if their Medicare or three, four, five depending on which private payer they're under. And so I do think our competitors' actions slowed down that, that particularly if they're on a competitive device and the demand limitation and the physician saying, look, I've got to take care of new patients. They weren't as prone to write prescriptions or to allocate REPAP, if you like, for patients. So I actually think there's some runways still left on REPAP within the U.S. geography, and I think that's even more so in other markets. As Rob just noted and as we talked about the engagement with consumers and patients in different geographies is driving mass growth and any quarter that have 14% revenue growth in masks in Europe, Asia, rest of the world would be incredible. And that's not driven by any recall dynamics whatsoever from a competitor. Everybody's been competing in masks globally. And so I think that speaks to our ability to hopefully have a sustainable approach to REPAP not only in the U.S. where we have incredibly strong relationships with Brightree and myAir directly to patients, directly to providers but the ecosystems that we are generating in some of our other sort of omni-channel markets around the world. So I think the opportunity for REPAP in the U.S. is still there over this fiscal year and beyond, and to make it a rhythm, right? So it becomes a steady part of the growth of the devices and to drive it. I think there's even more opportunity in the other parts of the world leveraging the work we've done on the mask side to then remind patients and track them when they're at that three, four, five-year time period to pull forward. Now I want to be there with the appropriate supply, so I'm not jumping ahead of ourselves, but we do have the programs and capabilities to do that, but I think the demand is there inherently. Yes. So it's a great question and yes, our R&D team, have obviously been incredibly focused on the re-engineering, the resupply and the redesign on our core device platforms, and we're able to do that, right? So we're able to get the supply back of Air 10s, as you saw, and Air 11s. But yet, look, I -- we had the whole board down in Sydney last quarter, and we were looking through the pipeline of devices and masks and it's incredible. It's really exciting. I don't like to get ahead of my commercial teams, and one of them is at the table with me now telling me to keep quiet. But I can tell you I'm very excited about the pipeline. There will be new innovation, new masks from ResMed as we go through this fiscal year. And as a personal user of these products, I try every new mask that comes out and this new one, which has a great project name that I'm not able to say, but it's a beautiful island that you can travel to by boats. I have tried that that mask and it's incredible and I can't wait for that to come to the market. But yes, look, we do have masks that are coming in the pipeline that are working their way through regulatory and then of course, commercial ramp up to make sure that when we deliver, it's ResMed quality, ResMed capability, first time fit, incredible adherence, and to drive through the channel. And so you'll see those come through our major markets and then globally throughout the fiscal year. So I'm excited about that pipeline. The one that I can talk about is the digital side, where we've launched an AI product and I'm really excited as those get more traction, we'll talk about how the digital products and the mass products throughout the year are going to impact and keep our incredibly strong double-digit growth that we saw this quarter. Yes. Thanks, Kevin. And thanks to all of our stakeholders for joining us this last hour as we talked through our results. And we'll talk to you again in 90 days. In closing, I want to thank the 10,000 ResMedians. Many of you are shareholders and listen to these calls as well, thanks for your dedication and hard work, helping people sleep better, breathe better, live better lives in 140 countries. These results are yours, incredible double-digit growth. Thanks for all that you do. I'll hand the call back to you Amy to close this out."

[Operator Instructions] A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Chief Communications and Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Hey thank you Kevin. Hello everyone and welcome to ResMed\u2019s third quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast live and a replay will be available on the investor relations section of our corporate website later today along with the copy of the earnings press release and the presentation both of which are available now. On the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. Following our prepared remarks, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer and David Pendarvis, Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel for our Q&A session. During today\u2019s call we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please see the supporting schedules in today\u2019s earnings release. Our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, however our actual results could differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Mick.\nMick Farrell: Thanks Amy and thank you to our stock holders for joining us today as we review results for the March quarter. Our third quarter fiscal year 2023 financial results reflect very strong performance across our entire business. Through the hard work of our ResMed team worldwide, we\u2019ve been able to steadily improve supply and manufacturing output to deliver for customers, and most especially for patients with now full market availability of our life saving products and Therapy Solutions. During the quarter, we were able to offer unconstrained access to cloud connected AirSense 10 flow generated devices in North America, as well as improved access to those cloud connected devices across our global markets. We continue to work through some supply chain constraints with our latest and greatest AirSense 11 platform, and we expect to steadily improve the global availability of AirSense 11 over the next several quarters. We are thrilled to have the AirSense 10 platform off allocation and fully available to customers in the U.S. and other major markets in swift succession. I would like to send a huge personal thank you to our Six Sigma Black Belt supply chain and our manufacturing teams. Partnering with our global supplier Alliance, we have been able to significantly increase production to the point that we are now able to deliver cloud connected devices to meet the needs of all of our customers in the U.S. And we are working hard to make that the case in all 140 countries that we sell into worldwide as we move forward. Last quarter, we made a commitment to meet the global demand for connected CPAP and APAP devices with a combination of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 by the end of calendar year 2023. As I just noted, we have already achieved that goal in our largest market, and we will be well ahead of that goal across all of our global markets. Supply chain challenges aren\u2019t completely behind us but we have passed the idea in supply and we see steady increases in supply ahead. Our amazing R&D teams and global supplier Alliance teams have designed and validated new components. They have added new suppliers and they have worked hand in hand with existing suppliers to secure the flow of parts that we need. We\u2019re also focused on scaling our manufacturing capabilities with the world\u2019s biggest and highest output manufacturing plant on the planet in the field of respiratory medicine. That high tech facility is now fully up and running in Tuas, Singapore. We are working country by country to secure the necessary regulatory approvals as we ramp production and delivery of the AirSense 11 platform across global markets. Given this global ramp plan, we expect to remain on allocation for the AirSense 11 platform for the next few quarters with AirSense10 covering all the difference in demand. With this combination of Air 10 and Air 11. We have the two best sleep apnea therapy platforms in the market. And we are now able to service all of our customer\u2019s needs. Our incredible growth rates of 43% in global device revenue this quarter speaks to that market leadership position of these two platforms, customers are voting with their wallets. Our mask and accessory business also continued to its strong growth trajectory, with 15% global growth in constant currency this quarter across our masks businesses. Mask growth is supported by both new patient growth as well as enhanced resupply programs to existing to existing patients catalyzed by on-going core patient demand. We have now reached the point that new patient flow is well above the levels we saw pre-COVID. In fact, March this we just finished March 2023 was our highest quarter ever for new patient\u2019s setups in our cloud based patient management system called AirView. Our digital health ecosystem enables and drives long-term adherence pushing towards 90% adherence for our highest performing customers. Even as we\u2019ve now past three years since the start of COVID there continues to be sustained heightened awareness by patients of the importance of respiratory hygiene and respiratory health. This has been a major step change that has held for now 12 quarters, we consider that a permanent change at this point. In the U.S. market, customers resupply programs including Brightree ReSupply have augmented growth. In our consumer driven markets, outreach programs and subscription programs have also driven masked replenishment rates. Patients want fresh equipment because there is less leak and more comfort for them the person who was suffocating before this treatment. Physicians want fresh equipment because they have seen peer reviewed published evidence that patient resupply is directly correlated to increased patient therapy adherence. Our teams continue to work incredibly hard to achieve these double digit growth results amid a challenging industry environment. All 10,000 of us ResMedians are laser focused on continuing to live both the devices and masks for our customers globally every week, every month and every quarter. Let\u2019s now briefly review updates on the top three strategic priorities for our company. Number one, to grow, expand the reach of and differentiate our core sleep apnea and Respiratory Care businesses. Number two, to design develop and deliver market leading devices as well as market leading digital health solutions that can be scaled globally. And number three, to create, innovate and grow the world\u2019s best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital. The launch of and market reaction to our AirSense 11 device platform continues to go very well. Patient feedback remains very positive, and we continue to see strong adoption of our myAir patient app. In fact, Air 11 adoption rates of myAir are more than double the adoption rate of myAir with the AirSense 10 platform. It turns out that patients love getting their own data every day on their myAir app with a daily score, daily coaching, therapy engagement through advanced analytics and patient focused algorithms. Patient utilization of a digital health platform like myAir is directly linked to adherence, which is then directly linked to better patient outcomes as seen by the physician, which ultimately drives better outcomes for the payer and the provider. Given these trends, increasing production and global availability of the AirSense 11 platform clearly remains a top priority and an obligation and we will continue to drive market penetration, leading the market, expanding the market as we scale production and achieve regulatory approvals country by country. Meanwhile, we continue to improve the software and digital health technology that drives a significant component of the value proposition for our connected devices. Over the next several quarters, we will introduce several artificial intelligence driven coaching features into the AirView system, as well as on the patient facing myAir app. These AI algorithms will provide personalized suggestions to improve the patient experience and ultimately to increase patient therapy adherence. Many of these AI driven solutions will be available on both the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11 ecosystems. ResMed\u2019s AirSense 11 device is the best positive airway pressure device on the planet, followed very closely by the second best device, which is the AirSense 10 platform. And together they share the same digital health technology ecosystem. We will continue to invest in the ecosystem supporting these platforms as we innovate solutions for the benefit of physicians, providers, and especially patients. The bottom line is that our digital health technology investments have a multiplier effect across both Air 10 and Air 11 ecosystems catalyzed and powered by AirView and myAir. Pivoting to our respiratory care business, we continue to drive growth and adoption of our bilevel and other non-invasive ventilator solutions around the world as well as investing in our newer to market technologies for patients including neuromuscular disease, COPD, and asthma and beyond. During the quarter we announced a pilot collaboration between our digital therapeutics team under the Propellor health brand, and the University of California Davis Health System. This partnership allows eligible UC Davis Health patients to have access to Propellor\u2019s digital therapeutics platform, including sensors for inhaled medications, a mobile app, a web portal, as well as on-going patient support. Data from the Propeller sensors will be transmitted to the UC Davis Health Electronic Health Record system through an API to support patient enrollment and remote patient monitoring. It\u2019s still early days for this technology. However, combined with our investments in clinical research for home based high flow therapy for the treatment of COPD in the home we see these technology innovations as important clinical additions for treating respiratory disease and an integral part of our 2025 growth strategy, as we now pivot to look beyond to ResMed 2030. Turning to our software as a service offerings for care delivered outside the hospital, our SaaS business grew strongly at 35% year-over-year in the quarter, including the contribution from our recently acquired MEDIFOX DAN team in Germany. On an organic basis, SaaS growth in the quarter achieved high single digit growth of 9% across our SaaS portfolio. We\u2019re excited about the strong sustainable growth of our core SaaS business. And we\u2019re very pleased to see MEDIFOX DAN contributing to our growth in its first full quarter as part of the global RedMed Group. We continue to grow with customers that deliver care outside the hospital, as they increase utilization of our software and data solutions to improve and optimize business efficiencies and patient care. Here at ResMed, we believe the future of healthcare is in lower cost, lower acuity settings, we are investing in technology that our customers need to operate and scale as patient volumes grow in these facilities and out of hospital facilities. As opposed to COVID, patient census continues to improve in our facilities verticals, we are seeing pent up demand for technology investments that continue to come to market across skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes and beyond. Our Home Medical Equipment SaaS business under the Brightree brand continues to grow at a very rapid pace and deliver sustained profitable growth. We are seeing the on-going impacts of staffing shortages across all of the outside hospital healthcare verticals that we serve. This pressure on our customers provides opportunities to drive conversations about the benefits of our software solutions to streamline and drive efficiencies across their businesses, so that they can free up staff to focus on their core purpose of serving patients and improving patient outcomes. Our SaaS business remains an important part of ResMed\u2019s growth strategy, and it complements the market leading software and device solutions that we have in our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. Our Brightree ReSupply program continues to demonstrate the synergies we can generate between our SaaS business and our core SRC business. Brightree ReSupply automates the entire process from contacting the patient, interacting with the payer on coverage, communicating directly with the patient, collecting co-pays, and managing the logistics and distribution process of product. The ultimate goal is to keep a CPAP APAP or bilevel therapy user replenished with the supplies that they need to enable a better and longer lasting therapy experience. This results in better outcomes for the patient, the physician, the provider, and the payer. We are well positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for outside hospital care globally. And we have created differentiated value for our customers and long-term sustainable growth for our stakeholders. We are transforming out of hospital health care at scale, leading the market in digital health technology across our business. We now have over 14 point 5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud. And we have over 20.5 100% Cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are liberating data to the cloud every day and unlocking value for patients, for providers, for physicians, for payers, and entire healthcare systems. We are leading the industry and we won\u2019t stop innovating. We\u2019re investing 7% of our revenue in R&D. It\u2019s worth noting that the annualized revenue pool is now well north of $4 billion. There is so much opportunity ahead of us. It\u2019s inspiring and it\u2019s exciting. ResMed\u2019s mission remains crystal clear. We have a goal to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025. This patient centric mission drives and motivates ResMedians every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal with our growth over the last 90 days. And during the last 12 months we have improved over 156 million lives with the delivery of the device platform to a patient or a full mask system to a patient or a digital health software solution that directly impacts the patient, helping each person to sleep better, to breathe better and to live a high quality life with health care delivered right where they live. Let me close my remarks with my sincere gratitude to the more than 10,000 ResMedians working across 140 countries for their perseverance, their hard work and their dedication today, and every day. Thank you. With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks and then get in the queue because we will open up for Q&A from the group. Brett, over to you\nBrett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I\u2019ll provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. Unless noted all comparisons out of the prior year quarter. We had strong financial performance in Q3. Group revenue for the March quarter was $1.12 billion an increase of 29%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 31%. Revenue growth reflected improved availability of sleep devices to support the strong underlying demand for these products, as well as solid growth across our broader product portfolio. Year-on-year movements in foreign currencies in particular, weaker euro negatively impacted revenue by approximately $20 million in the March quarter. We record an incremental revenue of approximately $15 million from COVID related demand in the March quarter. However, looking forward we expect negligible revenue from COVID related demand. Looking at geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business, sales in U.S. Canada and Latin America increased by 32%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 28% in constant currency terms. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 43%, while masks and other sales increased by 15%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in U.S. Canada and Latin America increased by 48% as we benefited from strong demand and improving availability of our connected devices. Masks and other sales increased by 14%, reflecting solid resupply and growth in new patients setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets device sales increased by 36% in constant currency terms, again reflecting strong demand and improving availability of connected devices. Masked and other sales increased by 15% in constant currency terms, reflecting increased patient setups. Software as a service revenue increased by 35% in the March quarter, reflecting the contribution from our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, and continued strong performance from our HMV vertical. Excluding our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, SaaS revenue grew by 9% in the March quarter. MEDIFOX DAN acquisition contributed revenue of $26.6 million for the March quarter consistent with our expectations at the time of the acquisition. During the rest of my commentary, today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release. Gross margin declined by 200 basis points to 56.1% in the March quarter. The decrease primarily reflects product mix shifts use a significant increase in sleep device sales, as well as component cost increases and unfavorable foreign currency movements partially offset by increases in average selling prices. Moving on to operating expenses SG&A expenses for the third quarter increased by 25% or in constant currency terms increased by 28%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee related costs and travel expenses, as well as the incremental SG&A expense associated with our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 20.5% compared to the 21.1% we recorded in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the balance of fiscal year 2023. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 14% or in constant currency terms increased by 16%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.8% compared to 7.7% in the prior quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2023. Operating profits for the quarter increased by 27% underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by a lower gross margin. Following the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN our net interest expense for the quarter was $15 million and we expect interest expense to be a similar amount for the balance of fiscal year 2023. Our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 20% compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 21.1%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the March quarter increased by 28% and non-GAAP, diluted earnings per share increased by 27%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $283 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings partially offset by a modest increase in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $29 million. Depreciation and Amortization for the quarter totaled $44 million. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $228 million. As of March 31, we had $1.6 billion in gross debt, and $1.4 billion in net debt reflecting the funding of our previously announced MEDIFOX DAN acquisition. During the quarter, we reduced our revolver debt by $215 million. As a result, at the end of the quarter, we have approximately $605 million available for drawdown under our revolver facility and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D, reduce our overall debt levels, and deploy further capital for tuck in acquisitions. And with that, I\u2019ll hand the call back to Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Brett. And thank you, Mick. Kevin, I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to you to provide instructions and then run the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nLyanne Harrison: Yes, good morning. All. Before I start, I want to say thank you to David Pendarvis. You know, we\u2019re certainly sad to see him retire. But we know that we\u2019re in safe hands with Amy. In terms of my question, obviously some very good device revenue there. But I want to just to talk about the you mentioned the third quarter, you had a new patient high higher than what we\u2019ve seen pre-COVID. Can you provide some comments of how much of that new patient backlog remains? And also what sort of progress you\u2019re making on the Repat backlog? And if you can discuss that, according to the Americas investor [Indiscernible] separately, that\u2019d be very helpful.\nMick Farrell: Well, thanks for the question, Lyanne and a tribute to Dave for his 20 plus years, 22 years of I think it was this is his 83rd investor call 83. So amazing tribute to Dave and we are in very safe hands with Amy on investor relations front. To your question. Look, yes, incredible growth, 43% growth in device revenue this quarter to an all-time high. You know, many, many factors that have gone into that primarily that we were able to deliver on our promise to get unconstrained on AirSense 10 a 100% connected devices, we\u2019ve got those end market. And so I think, we were able to take care of all of the demand of customers in the U.S. market period, end of story. We said we\u2019d be there by the end of this calendar year. But we\u2019re they\u2019re already here right now. And as I said in the prep remarks, we\u2019re going to be scaling the AirSense 11, steadily and strongly as that new platform, the latest and greatest comes to market and we move forward. In terms of backlog of those sort of new patients I think we\u2019re there in the U.S. But in terms of REPAPING, I think there\u2019s a lot more to do, and we\u2019re going to partner, across the U.S. with all of our 1000s of home medical equipment companies to start to work through that REPAP program. But I think that\u2019s going to happen over time. We just got to the point where we\u2019re completely unconstrained on AirSense 10 in this quarter. I think it\u2019s fantastic. I want to get unconstrained on AirSense 11. That\u2019s going to take a number of huge numbers of quarters. And then of course, that\u2019s just one country. We\u2019re in 140 countries worldwide, we\u2019re going to go get regulatory and all them and then get those products to market. And so it\u2019s going to be an on-going process over the coming quarters and years to continue there. I\u2019m not going to say that we\u2019re going to see this sort of exceptional 43% growth, on an on-going basis, the market growth is closer to the mid to high single digits in this space. But we\u2019re seeing that market growth come back. We\u2019re seeing the new patients come back. We are through that that pandemic side and we\u2019re getting new patient flow, we see it in our home sleep testing data, we\u2019re looking at all the stuff coming throughout [Indiscernible]. We\u2019re seeing it in the number of patients are being set up, in AirView, all time high. But we\u2019re looking at that every week, every month and every quarter, and it\u2019s steadily improving. And it\u2019s not just the U.S. It\u2019s, it\u2019s in Western Europe, Northern Europe. And it\u2019s and it\u2019s certainly coming through Asia, very strong growth in China over the last number of quarters as we\u2019ve come through the COVID crisis there as well. So that\u2019s my summary there, Lyanne. Great question.\nLyanne Harrison: Sorry, can I just clarify when you said that you\u2019re there on the backlog? Is that both for the United States and rest of the world?\nMick Farrell: Yes. So we\u2019re through, we\u2019re through the backlog in the U.S. And we\u2019re going to be progressively working our way through the other 139 countries that, it\u2019s it\u2019s not, it\u2019s a complex system, where when you get regulatory approvals let\u2019s say, for the AirSense 11, you\u2019ve got to go region, by region, you can do you know, European Union, but then you have to go country by country for many of these approaches for Brazil, for China for India, and it takes time to get them there to get unconstrained with the two platform approach that we\u2019ve been able to take in the U.S., Canada and a number of other countries. But look, we\u2019ll give you updates over the coming quarters. Lyanne as we get unconstrained country by country, you\u2019ll you will report it to you. And our goal is to be unconstrained everywhere tomorrow. It\u2019s just not logistically possible to be able to do that. So we\u2019re going slowly and steadily to that, but I\u2019m just happy to be, nine months ahead of when we were saying we\u2019re going to deliver an unconstrained at least in some of our top markets here, and we\u2019ll keep you updated as we go forward.\nLyanne Harrison: Okay, thank you very much Mick.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Lyanne.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST Macquarie. Your line is now live.\nDan Hurren: Good morning. Thanks for the question. Someone else asked the gross margin question. But I\u2019d like to ask about the SG&A. And just the fact that it\u2019s remained relatively constant as a percentage rip scent of revenue during the course of the record, which to say a bit counterintuitive, when you consider the fact that the product had been shortages, etcetera, and suddenly was selling themselves. So I just wonder if we could talk about the key elements of that SG&A and the mid-to-long term trajectory there as volumes continue to improve?\nMick Farrell: Yes, that\u2019s a great question. Daniel, I\u2019ll hand over to Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer to cover our SG&A.\nRob Douglas: Yes, Dan. So you know how we operate, no matter what\u2019s going on, we\u2019re fiscally disciplined. We\u2019re always keeping an eye on the future and where we\u2019re going and what\u2019s happening as we build, we build in expenses. We absolutely talked about the fact that we weren\u2019t doing face to face marketing, and a lot of travel and those types of things earlier in the pandemic. And as that started to come back, we\u2019ve had to manage carefully how that\u2019s been an extra load on our SG&A. But it\u2019s really, really a factor of careful management. Everyone\u2019s aware of the issue of employee costs, and those things which is which are moving in the time of inflation. And we continue to manage that carefully. And we\u2019re extremely prudent about what we add in on and how we go. And so we really don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves and end up like some of these other companies that have found them way over provisioned in there -- and they go-to-market operations and had to make corrections. So we\u2019re, we\u2019re in good shape, and we\u2019ve got a solid plan. And, we should be able to stick very carefully with our bets our forecast on our SG&A.\nOperator: Take your next question today. It\u2019s coming from Matthew Silvia [Ph] from Citi. Your line is now live.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. Good afternoon. To those in California. You obviously had a very strong devices growth in the quarter. I was just wondering whether you still believe that you can sequentially grow every quarter in fiscal year 2023 in devices? And then how should we think about FY 2024 and the returns potential return of Philips to the market and whether there\u2019s been any update there?\nMick Farrell: Yes, thanks for the question, Matthew. And yes, not -- last quarter, I certainly said that we expect to see sequential growth of devices throughout the calendar year, actually here through 2023. And those are forecasts. I got to tell you, this $607.9 million of device sales in the quarter was ahead of where I thought we were at that point. That\u2019s a big number to come up. And as Brett said, there\u2019s about 15 million of ventilator sales to China in there, as they went through another phase of, of COVID as they reopened during the during the March quarter. So if you take that out, it\u2019s still a big number to shoot for here in Q4. But we have the best commercial teams on the planet in respiratory medicine, sales. And you know in Q4, our fiscal year Q4 is a big time there's presence clubs in some geographies, there's fiscal incentives everywhere for people to finish their fiscal year strong. And so there\u2019s a lot of incentives. So it\u2019s a tough number to get there on sequential growth. Taking out those ventilators, I think we can do it, I\u2019m confident my team, I\u2019ll back my team. They got a little bit ahead of me here in March. And I love that I\u2019d love them to be a little bit ahead of me in June. And so I\u2019m confident we can do that. More important than that is that we are now taking care of every patient\u2019s needs in our major markets. And our goal is to be there in all 140 countries. So some of it is that that revenue growth, and it\u2019s amazing, but it\u2019s really about patient care. And it\u2019s about leaving no patient behind. And it was really disappointing. I think, for us as an industry, some of these quarters over the last eight quarters, that as an industry, we weren\u2019t able to take care of every patient that got a prescription. We\u2019re now doing that in our major markets. And we plan to absolutely fulfill that not only where we\u2019ve already achieved it, but to get ahead of it in all the other countries as we go. So sequential growth is good, we\u2019re going to be pushing towards trying that. But more important than that, taking care of every patient in every geography, and working as hard as we can to get to those patients and get them a well quality mask and get them on a resupply program because that\u2019s what leads to long-term adherence, not just that one time device sale, but getting an adherent patient that 87, 90 plus percent adherence rates on not just a 90 day basis, but an on-going basis. That\u2019s our challenge. Matthew, great question. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Gretel Janu from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.\nGretel Janu: Thanks, good morning all. I\u2019ll ask the gross margin questions. Is the mix really the key driver of the way to gross margins here? Do you have is the higher price offsetting component costs? And just as we look forward, if you\u2019re going to continue to assume strong device sales growth, should we expect gross margins to continue to be weaker at these levels in the short term? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Yes, thanks for the for the question, Gretel. And as you said, and as Brett said in his prep remarks, we had some we had some headwinds on gross margin, which were geography mix, where, it was more in low margin countries, U.S., Canada, and in product mix, we saw more CPAP and APAP growth than we did by level or life support or even other non-invasive ventilators. And so, those headwinds are going to start to subside, but I, I am actually I think Gretel that, as I look forward, I see gross margin expansion in double digit basis points ahead for the coming quarters and throughout the fiscal year and the calendar year. I\u2019m bullish on gross margin expansion because I see geography mix and product mix, headwinds subsiding. I\u2019m bullish on gross margin, as I see ventilator growth, opportunities start to come back and I see mass growth and replenishment growth, new patient growth start to come on masks. And I\u2019m bullish on gross margin as we go forward because I see inventory costs starting to we\u2019re going to start to cut into that and bring them down versus the run up we had with our competitor being out of market. And I also I\u2019m bullish on gross margin, because I see us being able to get better freight costs as we go forward. And as you said, we have been offsetting some of that gross margin headwinds with ASP holding steady in our core business, increasing ASPs in our SaaS businesses. And we\u2019ve had some freight surcharges and others with customers, as we start to see our costs come down, we\u2019ll take away some of those surcharges and so on and so we\u2019ll balance that out. But net net, I see us being able to expand our gross margin and grow as we look forward throughout, not just the fiscal year 2023, but the calendar year here in 2023.\nOperator: Thank you Next question is coming from Matt Taylor from Jefferies. Your line is now live.\nMatt Taylor: Alright, thanks. So sorry, I was on mute. I just wanted to ask about how much we should expect the mask trend to start following the device trends as you become more encumbered. I thought maybe there would be a little bit more mass growth this quarter, not taking away from a good result. But maybe you can talk about that as a derivative.\nMick Farrell: Yes, thanks, Matt, for your for your question. And you know that as you look at our masks and accessories business, that sort of 70% to 80% of our masks growth is replenishment, its existing patients out there who are coming back for a fresh mask, a fresh humidifier, a fresh set of tubing, heated tubing, and so on and filters. So it\u2019s the mask and accessories is 70% 80% replenishment business. And so it\u2019s not as directly impact. So new patient growth is incredible. We\u2019re back to better than pre-COVID. And we\u2019re growing from there. And that\u2019s great to see that sort of strong rise of new patients coming in, but it doesn\u2019t sort of directly correlate to your point it\u2019s less a derivative and more a sort of a compounding effect over time as you know like compound interest as you build up that install base those patients are ordering if they are, ordering on a three month or six month basis, that becomes a compounding effect on the device growth today leading to a future investment in growth in masks over the coming fiscal quarters and fiscal years as you build that installed base, so there\u2019s not a direct correlation 43% device growth doesn\u2019t immediately correlate to mass growth. But I mean, to your point 15% global mass growth on a constant currency basis is incredible pre-COVID, we would have been very proud of a number like that. Post pandemic coming through this growth. I\u2019m incredibly proud of the team and what they\u2019re able to do not just in new patient setups, but in the replenishment programs. And as I said in the prepared remarks, it\u2019s not just in the reimbursed markets where we\u2019ve got formalized systems. In France, the U.S. Japan, we have formalized systems to go with our customers to patients to ensure they if they want it that the patient gets a mask when they need it. We\u2019re also working in our consumer driven markets where we\u2019re driving adherence programs, subscription programs that are fast growing in many of our geographies where it\u2019s cash pay, or direct to consumer interaction, and they\u2019re saying, I want a fresh mask. And so it\u2019s true to the core demand. It\u2019s not just a system driven one, this is a patient driven one. And that\u2019s the part about mass growth that I think is most exciting. Final thing I\u2019ll say on mass growth, is that I think there was some skeptics, two or three years ago, people like oh, this step up in respiratory health and hygiene step up in mask replenishment, that\u2019s a short term trend due to COVID pandemic, with three years since the start of this, this COVID pandemic, and that has been 12 quarters of strong mass growth. So I think that\u2019s strong mass growth is sustainable for the future. We\u2019ve been able to execute for 12 quarters and we plan to continue to do that as we go forward.\nMatt Taylor: Thank you Mick. Very helpful.\nMick Farrell: Thanks Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Michael Polark from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live.\nMichael Polark: Thank you for taking the question. I\u2019ll ask another twist on the mask question. As you\u2019ve better filled on the device side, especially in the U.S., are you -- is there a halo impact in terms of winning share incrementally on the consumables side? Is that a dynamic that\u2019s played out recently or could play out over the next year or so as the device kind of the urgency to step into the device void abates and you refocus on other priorities?\nMick Farrell: Yes. Look, Mike, there\u2019s certainly a relationship and when our commercial teams there are working with the best platform, the AirSense 11 and the best second best platform, the AirSense 10, both of which are better than our competitors, they\u2019re also obviously offering the best masks, the best mask portfolio out there, and we have a leading share in that in all 140 countries as well. So there\u2019s definitely a synergy effect in that it\u2019s the same people, talking to the same physicians, the same providers, the same health care systems. And so we\u2019re there. In addition, there\u2019s some sort of clinical technical needs. I mean we design our products to work better together. Our masks on our devices have far more accurate mask leak detection. They have far more accurate detection of pressure and control of an APAP device or a bi-level device, and particularly if it\u2019s used on an overlap patients say, who has obstructive sleep apnea and COPD, you need that IPAP and APAP, the press control to be right on. When you use our buy level with our mask that\u2019s going to be far more accurate and the physicians know that and they will script towards that for those patients. And then for the respiratory therapist doing a setup, they know our products are designed better together. Our teams have shown in the clinical and technical data of how they\u2019re designed. And so there is a strong positive synergy effect. So yes, I do think there\u2019s a correlation with terminal. You can think the sort of simple commercial. I mean, they\u2019re selling it, but then you look at it from the physician\u2019s perspective on clinical and then the therapist perspective on fit and comfort and leak. So I think all that goes together to show there some good synergy between our device growth and mask growth over time.\nOperator: The next question is coming from David Low from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nDavid Low: Thanks very much. Mick, can I go back to gross margins. I mean if I heard you correctly, you said you expect gross margins to expand in the double digits in the future. Can you do a little bit on what sort of time frame? And are we talking gross margin percentage? Are we talking gross profits? Just trying to understand what you\u2019re expecting on that front, please?\nMick Farrell: Yes, David, thanks. I\u2019m going to hand to Brett to go through more detail. But what I was saying is I expect double-digit basis points improvement from where we were at in the quarter. 56.1%, I see is as an idea, and I want to grow from there. I see us being able to move that up, I don\u2019t know, 10, 20, 30, 50, 100 basis points over the coming quarters and beyond. But Brett, do you want to provide a little more detail for David, to the headwinds, the tailwinds and all the fun that goes into gross margin?\nBrett Sandercock: Yes, sure. Sure, Mick. Yes, David, it\u2019s -- I mean we wouldn\u2019t -- we\u2019re not going to try and quantify, but when we look at it, we do expect margin expansion over the coming quarters. So if you look at some of the key ones that have hurt us year-on-year or it\u2019s around -- it\u2019s product mix, obviously, with a massive increase in sleep devices. We had to deal with component cost increases coming through year-on-year, but that looks to be stabilizing there. So that\u2019s -- there\u2019s 2 big headwinds that we expect will moderate. And then we\u2019re working on manufacturing, logistics, freight costs, we\u2019re looking at efficiencies. So we\u2019re focused back on that now. And that -- again, these should improve over the coming quarters as well. Then on top of that, with the AirSense 11 platform, that does contribute positively to gross margin as well. Now that one will take time as we roll that out. But if you kind of put in the -- I guess, you look at the sort of the headwinds are moderating, we should get a few tailwinds in manufacturing and logistics. And that kind of gives us the confidence we think we can get that expansion from here on in.\nDavid Low: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question today is coming from Malgorzata Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is now live.\nMargaret Kaczor: Hey everyone thanks for taking the question. I wanted to maybe follow up on some of the patient demand metrics that you guys gave early on the call. I think I heard maybe high single-digit market growth in the U.S. or Americas. And then should we add repat to that so that, that ultimately leads us to a double-digit growth rate? And then how do you think about that, I guess, once Philips does potentially reenter the marketplace for you guys on a long-term growth. Can you, I guess, continue at that double-digit top line growth rate? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Malgorzata. I think there\u2019s so much that goes into it. But yes, look, we -- we\u2019re on the other side of this pandemic, right? Not only just the pandemics becoming endemic in the way that the world is opening up and we\u2019re driving forward. But in our industry, we\u2019re now seeing that strong growth of patients that we\u2019re really starting to pick up. And yes, it\u2019s mid- to high single digits growth on the patients starting to come through the funnel now, and that\u2019s really strong. How long that\u2019s sustainable and how we can drive it? That\u2019s -- it\u2019s going to be up to us as the market leader. We have the market lead here, and we\u2019re going to drive awareness programs. We\u2019re going to drive demand generation programs. We\u2019re going to partner with I just got an update from a team here in the U.S. market, looking at a project to bring patients into the funnel and to drive patients into the funnel and as the market leader, that\u2019s really our job, so not just accept market growth, but to drive market growth. So this is going to be an active thing that we\u2019re going to be looking at as we move forward. And it\u2019s very exciting for us to do that. I\u2019m not going to quantify it out. I mean given where we\u2019re at, I know you have your models, everyone on the sell side and buy side has their models. But I would say to that, whatever your models are, think about an active leader engaging in digital awareness, marketing awareness and driving and curating patients through the channel. And we\u2019ve learned a lot through the COVID crisis about digital health, about engaging with patients in home testing in remote setup and virtual pathways that have really been necessary at the peak of the pandemic and now become a catalyst for future demand generation. So I don\u2019t know, Rob or Lucie, if you have any extra thoughts on that?\nRob Douglas: Just one other minor point, Mick. That that new patient growth is really solid and there\u2019s so many untreated patients. We can see a long-term future in that. But also as we build our long-term adherence programs and start driving long-term adherence, that will keep the mask growth ahead of that new patient growth and we see a long-term outlook for that to.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Andrew Paine from CLS. Your line is now live\nAndrew Paine: Yes, Hi morning and evening everyone. Just thinking about your ability to retain market share when Philips comes back to the market, it\u2019s pick up in the -- but assuming from the start of FY 2024, what levers do you think you can pull here to ensure that you do retain market share? Are we looking at kind of things like pricing as a factor? Or do you think there\u2019s other things that will help you retain that share?\nMick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Andrew. And yes, certainly, look, we look at all competition. We\u2019ve got competitors based in Western Europe and in Asia that we\u2019ve been competing with very strongly for the last few decades and certainly the last 2 years. And 1 competitor who\u2019s been out of the market for new patient setups for 2 years and who knows how much longer, they\u2019ll have to come in that third competitor that will have to come in and start fighting to become the number 2 share player from a 0% new patient setup share. And -- we look forward to that. We were beating that particular competitor in 2019 before they had their recalls. So I know we\u2019ll be able to beat them when they come back in. And so no, our goal is to see 0 share. Our goal is to actually maintain and grow share as the market leader, that gets more and more difficult to take more and more share. But that\u2019s our goal. We have the smallest, quietest, most comfortable and most cloud-connected devices. But more important than that, we\u2019ve created a digital ecosystem that engages patients with myAir, doctors with our view, health care systems by APIs that link into Epic or Cerner in the U.S. and health care systems around the world in U.K. and NHS, Northern Europe into government and Western Europe into government-run health care systems. And we\u2019re engaging with patients in our consumer-driven markets incredibly well. So our goal is to maintain and grow that share. But more important than that, to grow the market. As the market leader, that\u2019s sort of our obligation. There are now with the latest epidemiology rising up around 1 billion people with obstructive sleep apnea that needs to be treated worldwide. And if you add in COPD asthma and insomia, you\u2019re talking 2.5 billion people in our total addressable market. So -- you can think about share, but it\u2019s really not Coke and Pepsi was out and Pepsi is coming back. This is not a low-growth carbonated beverages market. This is a high-growth digital health technology market in med tech, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re driving it forward. But yes, I look forward to just getting the uncertainty out of this number 3 player. I want to back in let\u2019s see and let\u2019s compete and we\u2019ll keep our share and grow it and game on, look forward to it. And actually, one last thing I\u2019ll say on that people have been talking about when the number 3 competitor comes back. How will they come back? Their CFO last week said, Oh, no, we won\u2019t be coming in and lowering prices. We\u2019ll look to take 2019 prices and add with inflation. So game on. I look forward to it. We\u2019ve always competed on value. We\u2019ve always competed on driving that, and it\u2019s never been a competition on price for us. We\u2019ve always been a price premium to the other players, but we save them more money. So that the smart customers are using our products because it\u2019s more profitable.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\nMatthew Mishan: Yes, hi Mick, you mentioned at one point that you\u2019re getting 90% adherence on some of your best customers. I\u2019m just curious like where that is versus kind of baseline? And how you can move that forward with like the rest of your customer base?\nMick Farrell: Yes, Matt, it\u2019s a really good question. And so the peer-reviewed published evidence out there is an 87% adherence number that\u2019s been out there for a couple of years. If you look at the average of the market, where people maybe aren\u2019t using as much of the digital capabilities, the patients aren\u2019t using myAir, the doctors aren\u2019t using AirView. General industry adherence might be on average, 60% to 70%, right, with a competitive device that\u2019s not connected or maybe someone who\u2019s not fully engaged with the digital ecosystem we have. As they start to get engaged, there\u2019s actually a peer-reviewed published evidence on this, just adding just adding the doctor using AirView moves up adherence by 10%. So you go from, let\u2019s say, an average of 65% to 75% for that customer. Just having the doctors AirView, if the patient uses myAir, you move up almost another 10%. So for that example, you might go from 75% to 85% adherence, where the doctor is using AirView and the patients using myAir. To get to those 90s, you need a really special customer that\u2019s really engaged and really investing in tech that takes our tech and sort of adds algorithms, it adds capabilities to it. And we have a number of those sophisticated customers in Europe and the U.S., and we partner with them, and we do joint development with them. And we love that training. We learn from each other. Because together is how we deliver the care. We were a manufacturer and we\u2019re a provider of digital health solutions, we\u2019ve worked with providers in our biggest countries to get there. And where we don\u2019t, in smaller consumer-driven markets, we have to pick up the ball and engage directly ourselves. But that 90% is achieved in very rare cases, but it\u2019s -- that peer view published evidence shows that it can be done with the tech at 87%. And yes, to your point, how do we get everyone up to that 87% that 90%, that is a process of engagement of training. And that\u2019s why I say our share is not only going to stay where it is, but have the chance to grow from that because we are the market leader in this. No one is investing like we are in cloud compute. No one is investing like we are in analytics in AI and ML and engagement with patients and physicians and providers. And we\u2019re not doing alone. We\u2019re doing it with the ecosystem, with the patients. We\u2019re listening to them with the physicians and with the providers. Thanks for the question, Matt.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey Capital. Your line is live.\nSaul Hadassin: Thanks for taking my question. Mick, just a question on Primasun. I just noticed this quarter, the investment was very low, certainly less than what the guidance had been. So I\u2019m wondering, did something change this quarter? And any update on how that project is going? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Yes. So it\u2019s a great question because let\u2019s just talk to our whole sort of demand generation and engagement approach. I mean, as you know, Primasun is a joint venture with Verily in the U.S. market, looking to digitally engaged -- well digitally identify, engage and enroll patients in a sort of digital health pathway from sleep concern consumer all the way through to diagnosed patient on treatment and management. We have activities through our core U.S. and North America marketing team. And obviously, in the other 139 countries we operate in, we\u2019re looking at other digital ways to engage the 1 billion people who need our help. So look, we\u2019re looking at investments. We\u2019re at a pilot phase of some trials, and we\u2019re getting ready to scale some approach with Primasun, with U.S. programs and many of the others were operating in all parts of the world. And so as we start to roll those out, now that we\u2019re at the point where we\u2019ve got full capability to supply, as we said in the prep remarks and throughout the call, with AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 is a combination, we can really turn to start to turn the dial up on these demand generation initiatives with undiagnosed sleep apnea patients. And I\u2019m excited to start doing that. So those investments might pick up a little over the coming quarters, but they\u2019ll have a huge return in bringing patients into the funnel. So watch this space.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is now live.\nSuraj Kalia: Good afternoon, Mick, can you hear me all right?\nMick Farrell: Got you loud and clear, Suraj.\nSuraj Kalia: Perfect. So first, let me just express my thanks to David. David, wish you have a great retirement. It\u2019s been a pleasure dealing with you all these years. So Mick, a lot of questions have been asked. You comment about AI caught my attention. So Mick think about it this way. Suraj comes in, he\u2019s gone through the CPAP titration, the sleep lab. Certain parameters have been set at a buy level variable, whatever. How would -- what parameters specifically would your AI/ML-based algos telepatient? And the reason I ask is specifically trying to understand how will you use this to improve compliance? Thank you.\nMick Farrell: Well Suraj, it\u2019s a really good question. And we only have 5 minutes left in the call. I could spend whole 50 minutes of them. A lot of those things are actually quite proprietary as we put together these AI and ML models on how we would coach a patient, particularly you talk about a high acuity patient like that on bi-level or ventilation, non-invasive ventilation therapy. But look, yes, certainly, I look at our compliance predictors and our compliance analysis tools that can help empower an HME in the U.S. and just some of the ways in which we\u2019re able to use AI and ML to drive prioritization of the most at risk for quitting patients. And those who are so close enough to get there. And those were definitely there and just need some sort of digital coaching. That sort of triage, if you like, which has previously been done manually is now going to an automated way. And it\u2019s -- we\u2019ve always had some levels of that automation, but to have an algorithm that learns as it goes and to get better and better at it -- it just serves the doctor. It serves the respiratory therapists and both of them are super pleased to see that level of efficiency, reduction of if you like, the administrative management and focus on the toughest patients but also making sure that the best patients get the digital coaching and help that they need. So it\u2019s really we\u2019re triaging compliance, adherence and beyond. But watch this space. We\u2019re going to launch a bunch of new products that I\u2019ll be able to talk to very specifically what they are and what they do over the coming quarters.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Craig Wong-Pan from RBC. Your line is now live.\nCraig Wong-Pan: Thanks for taking my question. I just note the inventory balances continued to increase. So I was wondering when you might start to see that come down? And also, is there much kind to cloud inventory or parts in that number still?\nMick Farrell: Yes, Craig, thanks for the question. It did move up just a little bit in the quarter. I actually have got a very strong target for Andrew Price, President of our operations and the whole manufacturing team to get that number down because we\u2019re through the peak of this, and we\u2019ve got full supply, let\u2019s get that number down. But Brett, do you want to speak to some of the details of how we\u2019re going to turn that inventory number down significantly over the coming quarters and fiscal year?\nBrett Sandercock: Sure. Sure, Mick. Yes. I mean I\u2019d characterize it, Craig that we stabilized that inventory this quarter and really that drove the really strong operating cash flow that you saw. But I think there\u2019s more that we can do. And the aim is to reduce those inventory levels overall. I mean, a number of things we can do, but some of the -- someone might point out we\u2019re seeing improvement in lead times, which will help. You\u2019ve got I guess, getting from port to port improved a bit, so we can lower inventories. We\u2019re continuing to increase sea freight versus air freight. So some of that manifest in inventory. But eventually, that kind of stabilizes at a ratio, we\u2019re tuning safety stock levels now because we\u2019ve got more predictability on what we need and when we can get supply. And then inventory, obviously, is future looking. So we\u2019re looking to support sales. So we just got to balance all that. But all that said, I think we\u2019re looking for inventory levels, that trajectory to gradually go down over the course of FY 2024.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nChris Cooper: Thanks, Mick. I\u2019m just after your latest thoughts on the diabetes and obesity drugs, please. We -- I guess we had another positive update last night. They do seem to be coming thicken fast at the moment. I guess could you just share how ResMed thinking about these? And to what extent their success may have any impact on your business, please?\nMick Farrell: Yes. Thanks, Chris. Yes. No, it\u2019s a huge market and actually quite exciting. We\u2019ve always wanted to have interactions. We actually -- when I first joined the company 23 years ago, we were working with bariatric surgeons and looking at patients that would go through bariatric surgery and maybe from 450 pounds down to 200 pounds. And our challenge in those days when it was mostly a CPAP market was -- how do we make sure they get on APAC because their needs -- their AHI might go from 50 when they were at 450 pounds to 30, when they were 250 pounds, but that\u2019s 30 is still severe sleep apnea. So we had to have an APAC algorithm could adjust with them. These days, the market is 80% APAP so you don\u2019t need to make sure that a patient on a, let\u2019s say, a weight loss drug or so on the seasonal weight loss and their AHI needs go down from very, very severely sleep apnea to just severe or moderate to severe. We have the algorithms and the capabilities within the devices with our audit set algorithm to adjust automatically. And we\u2019ll also have all the digital health data. so that the pulmonary doctor can partner up with the primary care or bariatric-type doctor that\u2019s working on -- and presumably be PCP is working the obesity drugs, and they can monitor the patient to see how much better they\u2019re getting, maybe more inherent more participation in their fitness and exercise for the overall health. So for us, actually, and you know we\u2019re invested in one of the sleep apnea drugs. It\u2019s not a weight loss drug that actually goes to the core of trying to treat sleep apnea, which is called Apnemed [Ph]. We\u2019re going to partner with pharma in this space. We\u2019ve seen the substitute of the sort of tiny sort of whatever it is, 0.5% of patient flow into these implanted devices. And there\u2019s a company out there doing, I think that\u2019s a very expensive advertising, but it\u2019s driving lots of patients into the funnel. It\u2019s demand gen for us because they market it as a button to treat sleep apnea, but it\u2019s actually an implanted medical device the size of a pacemaker that goes into the chest when the patient finds that out, they say, Well, what are the alternatives, although they are non-invasive alternative like CPAP or APAP or \u2013 when the patient goes online with that. I think some of the pharmaceutical advertising in this space will drive us to the 80% of undiagnosed patients in the space to say, Hey, look, I\u2019ll take the pill first and maybe then I need sleep apnea therapy or vice versa. But we think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity to partner here with pharma. We\u2019re already partnering with our Propeller division with some of the COPD and asthma drug delivery. I look forward to not just with Apnemed, but these other obesity drugs to understand how they drive patients into the funnel and how we work with them to treat those patients.\nOperator: Thank you. We reached end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further closing comments.\nMick Farrell: Well, thanks, Kevin, and thank you again to all of our stakeholders for joining us on the call. I\u2019d once again like to take the opportunity to thank the 10,000 ResMedians. Many of you are also shareholders. So thank you for what you do and for investing in our company as well. Thank you for your dedication and hard work, helping people sleep better, breathe better and live better lives in 140 countries. You delivered these numbers that we just reported.

            "content": "Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. Unless noted all comparisons out of the prior year quarter. We had strong financial performance in Q3. Group revenue for the March quarter was $1.12 billion an increase of 29%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 31%. Revenue growth reflected improved availability of sleep devices to support the strong underlying demand for these products, as well as solid growth across our broader product portfolio. Year-on-year movements in foreign currencies in particular, weaker euro negatively impacted revenue by approximately $20 million in the March quarter. We record an incremental revenue of approximately $15 million from COVID related demand in the March quarter. However, looking forward we expect negligible revenue from COVID related demand. Looking at geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business, sales in U.S. Canada and Latin America increased by 32%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 28% in constant currency terms. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 43%, while masks and other sales increased by 15%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in U.S. Canada and Latin America increased by 48% as we benefited from strong demand and improving availability of our connected devices. Masks and other sales increased by 14%, reflecting solid resupply and growth in new patients setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets device sales increased by 36% in constant currency terms, again reflecting strong demand and improving availability of connected devices. Masked and other sales increased by 15% in constant currency terms, reflecting increased patient setups. Software as a service revenue increased by 35% in the March quarter, reflecting the contribution from our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, and continued strong performance from our HMV vertical. Excluding our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, SaaS revenue grew by 9% in the March quarter. MEDIFOX DAN acquisition contributed revenue of $26.6 million for the March quarter consistent with our expectations at the time of the acquisition. During the rest of my commentary, today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release. Gross margin declined by 200 basis points to 56.1% in the March quarter. The decrease primarily reflects product mix shifts use a significant increase in sleep device sales, as well as component cost increases and unfavorable foreign currency movements partially offset by increases in average selling prices. Moving on to operating expenses SG&A expenses for the third quarter increased by 25% or in constant currency terms increased by 28%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee related costs and travel expenses, as well as the incremental SG&A expense associated with our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 20.5% compared to the 21.1% we recorded in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the balance of fiscal year 2023. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 14% or in constant currency terms increased by 16%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.8% compared to 7.7% in the prior quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2023. Operating profits for the quarter increased by 27% underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by a lower gross margin. Following the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN our net interest expense for the quarter was $15 million and we expect interest expense to be a similar amount for the balance of fiscal year 2023. Our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 20% compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 21.1%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the March quarter increased by 28% and non-GAAP, diluted earnings per share increased by 27%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $283 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings partially offset by a modest increase in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $29 million. Depreciation and Amortization for the quarter totaled $44 million. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $228 million. As of March 31, we had $1.6 billion in gross debt, and $1.4 billion in net debt reflecting the funding of our previously announced MEDIFOX DAN acquisition. During the quarter, we reduced our revolver debt by $215 million. As a result, at the end of the quarter, we have approximately $605 million available for drawdown under our revolver facility and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D, reduce our overall debt levels, and deploy further capital for tuck in acquisitions. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy. Yes, sure. Sure, Mick. Yes, David, it's -- I mean we wouldn't -- we're not going to try and quantify, but when we look at it, we do expect margin expansion over the coming quarters. So if you look at some of the key ones that have hurt us year-on-year or it's around -- it's product mix, obviously, with a massive increase in sleep devices. We had to deal with component cost increases coming through year-on-year, but that looks to be stabilizing there. So that's -- there's 2 big headwinds that we expect will moderate. And then we're working on manufacturing, logistics, freight costs, we're looking at efficiencies. So we're focused back on that now. And that -- again, these should improve over the coming quarters as well. Then on top of that, with the AirSense 11 platform, that does contribute positively to gross margin as well. Now that one will take time as we roll that out. But if you kind of put in the -- I guess, you look at the sort of the headwinds are moderating, we should get a few tailwinds in manufacturing and logistics. And that kind of gives us the confidence we think we can get that expansion from here on in. Sure. Sure, Mick. Yes. I mean I'd characterize it, Craig that we stabilized that inventory this quarter and really that drove the really strong operating cash flow that you saw. But I think there's more that we can do. And the aim is to reduce those inventory levels overall. I mean, a number of things we can do, but some of the -- someone might point out we're seeing improvement in lead times, which will help. You've got I guess, getting from port to port improved a bit, so we can lower inventories. We're continuing to increase sea freight versus air freight. So some of that manifest in inventory. But eventually, that kind of stabilizes at a ratio, we're tuning safety stock levels now because we've got more predictability on what we need and when we can get supply. And then inventory, obviously, is future looking. So we're looking to support sales. So we just got to balance all that. But all that said, I think we're looking for inventory levels, that trajectory to gradually go down over the course of FY 2024."

            "content": "Thanks Amy and thank you to our stock holders for joining us today as we review results for the March quarter. Our third quarter fiscal year 2023 financial results reflect very strong performance across our entire business. Through the hard work of our ResMed team worldwide, we've been able to steadily improve supply and manufacturing output to deliver for customers, and most especially for patients with now full market availability of our life saving products and Therapy Solutions. During the quarter, we were able to offer unconstrained access to cloud connected AirSense 10 flow generated devices in North America, as well as improved access to those cloud connected devices across our global markets. We continue to work through some supply chain constraints with our latest and greatest AirSense 11 platform, and we expect to steadily improve the global availability of AirSense 11 over the next several quarters. We are thrilled to have the AirSense 10 platform off allocation and fully available to customers in the U.S. and other major markets in swift succession. I would like to send a huge personal thank you to our Six Sigma Black Belt supply chain and our manufacturing teams. Partnering with our global supplier Alliance, we have been able to significantly increase production to the point that we are now able to deliver cloud connected devices to meet the needs of all of our customers in the U.S. And we are working hard to make that the case in all 140 countries that we sell into worldwide as we move forward. Last quarter, we made a commitment to meet the global demand for connected CPAP and APAP devices with a combination of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 by the end of calendar year 2023. As I just noted, we have already achieved that goal in our largest market, and we will be well ahead of that goal across all of our global markets. Supply chain challenges aren't completely behind us but we have passed the idea in supply and we see steady increases in supply ahead. Our amazing R&D teams and global supplier Alliance teams have designed and validated new components. They have added new suppliers and they have worked hand in hand with existing suppliers to secure the flow of parts that we need. We're also focused on scaling our manufacturing capabilities with the world's biggest and highest output manufacturing plant on the planet in the field of respiratory medicine. That high tech facility is now fully up and running in Tuas, Singapore. We are working country by country to secure the necessary regulatory approvals as we ramp production and delivery of the AirSense 11 platform across global markets. Given this global ramp plan, we expect to remain on allocation for the AirSense 11 platform for the next few quarters with AirSense10 covering all the difference in demand. With this combination of Air 10 and Air 11. We have the two best sleep apnea therapy platforms in the market. And we are now able to service all of our customer's needs. Our incredible growth rates of 43% in global device revenue this quarter speaks to that market leadership position of these two platforms, customers are voting with their wallets. Our mask and accessory business also continued to its strong growth trajectory, with 15% global growth in constant currency this quarter across our masks businesses. Mask growth is supported by both new patient growth as well as enhanced resupply programs to existing to existing patients catalyzed by on-going core patient demand. We have now reached the point that new patient flow is well above the levels we saw pre-COVID. In fact, March this we just finished March 2023 was our highest quarter ever for new patient's setups in our cloud based patient management system called AirView. Our digital health ecosystem enables and drives long-term adherence pushing towards 90% adherence for our highest performing customers. Even as we've now past three years since the start of COVID there continues to be sustained heightened awareness by patients of the importance of respiratory hygiene and respiratory health. This has been a major step change that has held for now 12 quarters, we consider that a permanent change at this point. In the U.S. market, customers resupply programs including Brightree ReSupply have augmented growth. In our consumer driven markets, outreach programs and subscription programs have also driven masked replenishment rates. Patients want fresh equipment because there is less leak and more comfort for them the person who was suffocating before this treatment. Physicians want fresh equipment because they have seen peer reviewed published evidence that patient resupply is directly correlated to increased patient therapy adherence. Our teams continue to work incredibly hard to achieve these double digit growth results amid a challenging industry environment. All 10,000 of us ResMedians are laser focused on continuing to live both the devices and masks for our customers globally every week, every month and every quarter. Let's now briefly review updates on the top three strategic priorities for our company. Number one, to grow, expand the reach of and differentiate our core sleep apnea and Respiratory Care businesses. Number two, to design develop and deliver market leading devices as well as market leading digital health solutions that can be scaled globally. And number three, to create, innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital. The launch of and market reaction to our AirSense 11 device platform continues to go very well. Patient feedback remains very positive, and we continue to see strong adoption of our myAir patient app. In fact, Air 11 adoption rates of myAir are more than double the adoption rate of myAir with the AirSense 10 platform. It turns out that patients love getting their own data every day on their myAir app with a daily score, daily coaching, therapy engagement through advanced analytics and patient focused algorithms. Patient utilization of a digital health platform like myAir is directly linked to adherence, which is then directly linked to better patient outcomes as seen by the physician, which ultimately drives better outcomes for the payer and the provider. Given these trends, increasing production and global availability of the AirSense 11 platform clearly remains a top priority and an obligation and we will continue to drive market penetration, leading the market, expanding the market as we scale production and achieve regulatory approvals country by country. Meanwhile, we continue to improve the software and digital health technology that drives a significant component of the value proposition for our connected devices. Over the next several quarters, we will introduce several artificial intelligence driven coaching features into the AirView system, as well as on the patient facing myAir app. These AI algorithms will provide personalized suggestions to improve the patient experience and ultimately to increase patient therapy adherence. Many of these AI driven solutions will be available on both the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11 ecosystems. ResMed's AirSense 11 device is the best positive airway pressure device on the planet, followed very closely by the second best device, which is the AirSense 10 platform. And together they share the same digital health technology ecosystem. We will continue to invest in the ecosystem supporting these platforms as we innovate solutions for the benefit of physicians, providers, and especially patients. The bottom line is that our digital health technology investments have a multiplier effect across both Air 10 and Air 11 ecosystems catalyzed and powered by AirView and myAir. Pivoting to our respiratory care business, we continue to drive growth and adoption of our bilevel and other non-invasive ventilator solutions around the world as well as investing in our newer to market technologies for patients including neuromuscular disease, COPD, and asthma and beyond. During the quarter we announced a pilot collaboration between our digital therapeutics team under the Propellor health brand, and the University of California Davis Health System. This partnership allows eligible UC Davis Health patients to have access to Propellor's digital therapeutics platform, including sensors for inhaled medications, a mobile app, a web portal, as well as on-going patient support. Data from the Propeller sensors will be transmitted to the UC Davis Health Electronic Health Record system through an API to support patient enrollment and remote patient monitoring. It's still early days for this technology. However, combined with our investments in clinical research for home based high flow therapy for the treatment of COPD in the home we see these technology innovations as important clinical additions for treating respiratory disease and an integral part of our 2025 growth strategy, as we now pivot to look beyond to ResMed 2030. Turning to our software as a service offerings for care delivered outside the hospital, our SaaS business grew strongly at 35% year-over-year in the quarter, including the contribution from our recently acquired MEDIFOX DAN team in Germany. On an organic basis, SaaS growth in the quarter achieved high single digit growth of 9% across our SaaS portfolio. We're excited about the strong sustainable growth of our core SaaS business. And we're very pleased to see MEDIFOX DAN contributing to our growth in its first full quarter as part of the global RedMed Group. We continue to grow with customers that deliver care outside the hospital, as they increase utilization of our software and data solutions to improve and optimize business efficiencies and patient care. Here at ResMed, we believe the future of healthcare is in lower cost, lower acuity settings, we are investing in technology that our customers need to operate and scale as patient volumes grow in these facilities and out of hospital facilities. As opposed to COVID, patient census continues to improve in our facilities verticals, we are seeing pent up demand for technology investments that continue to come to market across skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes and beyond. Our Home Medical Equipment SaaS business under the Brightree brand continues to grow at a very rapid pace and deliver sustained profitable growth. We are seeing the on-going impacts of staffing shortages across all of the outside hospital healthcare verticals that we serve. This pressure on our customers provides opportunities to drive conversations about the benefits of our software solutions to streamline and drive efficiencies across their businesses, so that they can free up staff to focus on their core purpose of serving patients and improving patient outcomes. Our SaaS business remains an important part of ResMed's growth strategy, and it complements the market leading software and device solutions that we have in our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. Our Brightree ReSupply program continues to demonstrate the synergies we can generate between our SaaS business and our core SRC business. Brightree ReSupply automates the entire process from contacting the patient, interacting with the payer on coverage, communicating directly with the patient, collecting co-pays, and managing the logistics and distribution process of product. The ultimate goal is to keep a CPAP APAP or bilevel therapy user replenished with the supplies that they need to enable a better and longer lasting therapy experience. This results in better outcomes for the patient, the physician, the provider, and the payer. We are well positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for outside hospital care globally. And we have created differentiated value for our customers and long-term sustainable growth for our stakeholders. We are transforming out of hospital health care at scale, leading the market in digital health technology across our business. We now have over 14 point 5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud. And we have over 20.5 100% Cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are liberating data to the cloud every day and unlocking value for patients, for providers, for physicians, for payers, and entire healthcare systems. We are leading the industry and we won't stop innovating. We're investing 7% of our revenue in R&D. It's worth noting that the annualized revenue pool is now well north of $4 billion. There is so much opportunity ahead of us. It's inspiring and it's exciting. ResMed's mission remains crystal clear. We have a goal to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025. This patient centric mission drives and motivates ResMedians every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal with our growth over the last 90 days. And during the last 12 months we have improved over 156 million lives with the delivery of the device platform to a patient or a full mask system to a patient or a digital health software solution that directly impacts the patient, helping each person to sleep better, to breathe better and to live a high quality life with health care delivered right where they live. Let me close my remarks with my sincere gratitude to the more than 10,000 ResMedians working across 140 countries for their perseverance, their hard work and their dedication today, and every day. Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks and then get in the queue because we will open up for Q&A from the group. Brett, over to you Well, thanks for the question, Lyanne and a tribute to Dave for his 20 plus years, 22 years of I think it was this is his 83rd investor call 83. So amazing tribute to Dave and we are in very safe hands with Amy on investor relations front. To your question. Look, yes, incredible growth, 43% growth in device revenue this quarter to an all-time high. You know, many, many factors that have gone into that primarily that we were able to deliver on our promise to get unconstrained on AirSense 10 a 100% connected devices, we've got those end market. And so I think, we were able to take care of all of the demand of customers in the U.S. market period, end of story. We said we'd be there by the end of this calendar year. But we're they're already here right now. And as I said in the prep remarks, we're going to be scaling the AirSense 11, steadily and strongly as that new platform, the latest and greatest comes to market and we move forward. In terms of backlog of those sort of new patients I think we're there in the U.S. But in terms of REPAPING, I think there's a lot more to do, and we're going to partner, across the U.S. with all of our 1000s of home medical equipment companies to start to work through that REPAP program. But I think that's going to happen over time. We just got to the point where we're completely unconstrained on AirSense 10 in this quarter. I think it's fantastic. I want to get unconstrained on AirSense 11. That's going to take a number of huge numbers of quarters. And then of course, that's just one country. We're in 140 countries worldwide, we're going to go get regulatory and all them and then get those products to market. And so it's going to be an on-going process over the coming quarters and years to continue there. I'm not going to say that we're going to see this sort of exceptional 43% growth, on an on-going basis, the market growth is closer to the mid to high single digits in this space. But we're seeing that market growth come back. We're seeing the new patients come back. We are through that that pandemic side and we're getting new patient flow, we see it in our home sleep testing data, we're looking at all the stuff coming throughout [Indiscernible]. We're seeing it in the number of patients are being set up, in AirView, all time high. But we're looking at that every week, every month and every quarter, and it's steadily improving. And it's not just the U.S. It's, it's in Western Europe, Northern Europe. And it's and it's certainly coming through Asia, very strong growth in China over the last number of quarters as we've come through the COVID crisis there as well. So that's my summary there, Lyanne. Great question. Yes. So we're through, we're through the backlog in the U.S. And we're going to be progressively working our way through the other 139 countries that, it's it's not, it's a complex system, where when you get regulatory approvals let's say, for the AirSense 11, you've got to go region, by region, you can do you know, European Union, but then you have to go country by country for many of these approaches for Brazil, for China for India, and it takes time to get them there to get unconstrained with the two platform approach that we've been able to take in the U.S., Canada and a number of other countries. But look, we'll give you updates over the coming quarters. Lyanne as we get unconstrained country by country, you'll you will report it to you. And our goal is to be unconstrained everywhere tomorrow. It's just not logistically possible to be able to do that. So we're going slowly and steadily to that, but I'm just happy to be, nine months ahead of when we were saying we're going to deliver an unconstrained at least in some of our top markets here, and we'll keep you updated as we go forward. Thanks, Lyanne. Yes, that's a great question. Daniel, I'll hand over to Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer to cover our SG&A. Yes, thanks for the question, Matthew. And yes, not -- last quarter, I certainly said that we expect to see sequential growth of devices throughout the calendar year, actually here through 2023. And those are forecasts. I got to tell you, this $607.9 million of device sales in the quarter was ahead of where I thought we were at that point. That's a big number to come up. And as Brett said, there's about 15 million of ventilator sales to China in there, as they went through another phase of, of COVID as they reopened during the during the March quarter. So if you take that out, it's still a big number to shoot for here in Q4. But we have the best commercial teams on the planet in respiratory medicine, sales. And you know in Q4, our fiscal year Q4 is a big time there's presence clubs in some geographies, there's fiscal incentives everywhere for people to finish their fiscal year strong. And so there's a lot of incentives. So it's a tough number to get there on sequential growth. Taking out those ventilators, I think we can do it, I'm confident my team, I'll back my team. They got a little bit ahead of me here in March. And I love that I'd love them to be a little bit ahead of me in June. And so I'm confident we can do that. More important than that is that we are now taking care of every patient's needs in our major markets. And our goal is to be there in all 140 countries. So some of it is that that revenue growth, and it's amazing, but it's really about patient care. And it's about leaving no patient behind. And it was really disappointing. I think, for us as an industry, some of these quarters over the last eight quarters, that as an industry, we weren't able to take care of every patient that got a prescription. We're now doing that in our major markets. And we plan to absolutely fulfill that not only where we've already achieved it, but to get ahead of it in all the other countries as we go. So sequential growth is good, we're going to be pushing towards trying that. But more important than that, taking care of every patient in every geography, and working as hard as we can to get to those patients and get them a well quality mask and get them on a resupply program because that's what leads to long-term adherence, not just that one time device sale, but getting an adherent patient that 87, 90 plus percent adherence rates on not just a 90 day basis, but an on-going basis. That's our challenge. Matthew, great question. Thank you. Yes, thanks for the for the question, Gretel. And as you said, and as Brett said in his prep remarks, we had some we had some headwinds on gross margin, which were geography mix, where, it was more in low margin countries, U.S., Canada, and in product mix, we saw more CPAP and APAP growth than we did by level or life support or even other non-invasive ventilators. And so, those headwinds are going to start to subside, but I, I am actually I think Gretel that, as I look forward, I see gross margin expansion in double digit basis points ahead for the coming quarters and throughout the fiscal year and the calendar year. I'm bullish on gross margin expansion because I see geography mix and product mix, headwinds subsiding. I'm bullish on gross margin, as I see ventilator growth, opportunities start to come back and I see mass growth and replenishment growth, new patient growth start to come on masks. And I'm bullish on gross margin as we go forward because I see inventory costs starting to we're going to start to cut into that and bring them down versus the run up we had with our competitor being out of market. And I also I'm bullish on gross margin, because I see us being able to get better freight costs as we go forward. And as you said, we have been offsetting some of that gross margin headwinds with ASP holding steady in our core business, increasing ASPs in our SaaS businesses. And we've had some freight surcharges and others with customers, as we start to see our costs come down, we'll take away some of those surcharges and so on and so we'll balance that out. But net net, I see us being able to expand our gross margin and grow as we look forward throughout, not just the fiscal year 2023, but the calendar year here in 2023. Yes, thanks, Matt, for your for your question. And you know that as you look at our masks and accessories business, that sort of 70% to 80% of our masks growth is replenishment, its existing patients out there who are coming back for a fresh mask, a fresh humidifier, a fresh set of tubing, heated tubing, and so on and filters. So it's the mask and accessories is 70% 80% replenishment business. And so it's not as directly impact. So new patient growth is incredible. We're back to better than pre-COVID. And we're growing from there. And that's great to see that sort of strong rise of new patients coming in, but it doesn't sort of directly correlate to your point it's less a derivative and more a sort of a compounding effect over time as you know like compound interest as you build up that install base those patients are ordering if they are, ordering on a three month or six month basis, that becomes a compounding effect on the device growth today leading to a future investment in growth in masks over the coming fiscal quarters and fiscal years as you build that installed base, so there's not a direct correlation 43% device growth doesn't immediately correlate to mass growth. But I mean, to your point 15% global mass growth on a constant currency basis is incredible pre-COVID, we would have been very proud of a number like that. Post pandemic coming through this growth. I'm incredibly proud of the team and what they're able to do not just in new patient setups, but in the replenishment programs. And as I said in the prepared remarks, it's not just in the reimbursed markets where we've got formalized systems. In France, the U.S. Japan, we have formalized systems to go with our customers to patients to ensure they if they want it that the patient gets a mask when they need it. We're also working in our consumer driven markets where we're driving adherence programs, subscription programs that are fast growing in many of our geographies where it's cash pay, or direct to consumer interaction, and they're saying, I want a fresh mask. And so it's true to the core demand. It's not just a system driven one, this is a patient driven one. And that's the part about mass growth that I think is most exciting. Final thing I'll say on mass growth, is that I think there was some skeptics, two or three years ago, people like oh, this step up in respiratory health and hygiene step up in mask replenishment, that's a short term trend due to COVID pandemic, with three years since the start of this, this COVID pandemic, and that has been 12 quarters of strong mass growth. So I think that's strong mass growth is sustainable for the future. We've been able to execute for 12 quarters and we plan to continue to do that as we go forward. Thanks Matt. Yes. Look, Mike, there's certainly a relationship and when our commercial teams there are working with the best platform, the AirSense 11 and the best second best platform, the AirSense 10, both of which are better than our competitors, they're also obviously offering the best masks, the best mask portfolio out there, and we have a leading share in that in all 140 countries as well. So there's definitely a synergy effect in that it's the same people, talking to the same physicians, the same providers, the same health care systems. And so we're there. In addition, there's some sort of clinical technical needs. I mean we design our products to work better together. Our masks on our devices have far more accurate mask leak detection. They have far more accurate detection of pressure and control of an APAP device or a bi-level device, and particularly if it's used on an overlap patients say, who has obstructive sleep apnea and COPD, you need that IPAP and APAP, the press control to be right on. When you use our buy level with our mask that's going to be far more accurate and the physicians know that and they will script towards that for those patients. And then for the respiratory therapist doing a setup, they know our products are designed better together. Our teams have shown in the clinical and technical data of how they're designed. And so there is a strong positive synergy effect. So yes, I do think there's a correlation with terminal. You can think the sort of simple commercial. I mean, they're selling it, but then you look at it from the physician's perspective on clinical and then the therapist perspective on fit and comfort and leak. So I think all that goes together to show there some good synergy between our device growth and mask growth over time. Yes, David, thanks. I'm going to hand to Brett to go through more detail. But what I was saying is I expect double-digit basis points improvement from where we were at in the quarter. 56.1%, I see is as an idea, and I want to grow from there. I see us being able to move that up, I don't know, 10, 20, 30, 50, 100 basis points over the coming quarters and beyond. But Brett, do you want to provide a little more detail for David, to the headwinds, the tailwinds and all the fun that goes into gross margin? Yes. Thanks for the question, Malgorzata. I think there's so much that goes into it. But yes, look, we -- we're on the other side of this pandemic, right? Not only just the pandemics becoming endemic in the way that the world is opening up and we're driving forward. But in our industry, we're now seeing that strong growth of patients that we're really starting to pick up. And yes, it's mid- to high single digits growth on the patients starting to come through the funnel now, and that's really strong. How long that's sustainable and how we can drive it? That's -- it's going to be up to us as the market leader. We have the market lead here, and we're going to drive awareness programs. We're going to drive demand generation programs. We're going to partner with I just got an update from a team here in the U.S. market, looking at a project to bring patients into the funnel and to drive patients into the funnel and as the market leader, that's really our job, so not just accept market growth, but to drive market growth. So this is going to be an active thing that we're going to be looking at as we move forward. And it's very exciting for us to do that. I'm not going to quantify it out. I mean given where we're at, I know you have your models, everyone on the sell side and buy side has their models. But I would say to that, whatever your models are, think about an active leader engaging in digital awareness, marketing awareness and driving and curating patients through the channel. And we've learned a lot through the COVID crisis about digital health, about engaging with patients in home testing in remote setup and virtual pathways that have really been necessary at the peak of the pandemic and now become a catalyst for future demand generation. So I don't know, Rob or Lucie, if you have any extra thoughts on that? Yes. Thanks for the question, Andrew. And yes, certainly, look, we look at all competition. We've got competitors based in Western Europe and in Asia that we've been competing with very strongly for the last few decades and certainly the last 2 years. And 1 competitor who's been out of the market for new patient setups for 2 years and who knows how much longer, they'll have to come in that third competitor that will have to come in and start fighting to become the number 2 share player from a 0% new patient setup share. And -- we look forward to that. We were beating that particular competitor in 2019 before they had their recalls. So I know we'll be able to beat them when they come back in. And so no, our goal is to see 0 share. Our goal is to actually maintain and grow share as the market leader, that gets more and more difficult to take more and more share. But that's our goal. We have the smallest, quietest, most comfortable and most cloud-connected devices. But more important than that, we've created a digital ecosystem that engages patients with myAir, doctors with our view, health care systems by APIs that link into Epic or Cerner in the U.S. and health care systems around the world in U.K. and NHS, Northern Europe into government and Western Europe into government-run health care systems. And we're engaging with patients in our consumer-driven markets incredibly well. So our goal is to maintain and grow that share. But more important than that, to grow the market. As the market leader, that's sort of our obligation. There are now with the latest epidemiology rising up around 1 billion people with obstructive sleep apnea that needs to be treated worldwide. And if you add in COPD asthma and insomia, you're talking 2.5 billion people in our total addressable market. So -- you can think about share, but it's really not Coke and Pepsi was out and Pepsi is coming back. This is not a low-growth carbonated beverages market. This is a high-growth digital health technology market in med tech, and that's how we're driving it forward. But yes, I look forward to just getting the uncertainty out of this number 3 player. I want to back in let's see and let's compete and we'll keep our share and grow it and game on, look forward to it. And actually, one last thing I'll say on that people have been talking about when the number 3 competitor comes back. How will they come back? Their CFO last week said, Oh, no, we won't be coming in and lowering prices. We'll look to take 2019 prices and add with inflation. So game on. I look forward to it. We've always competed on value. We've always competed on driving that, and it's never been a competition on price for us. We've always been a price premium to the other players, but we save them more money. So that the smart customers are using our products because it's more profitable. Yes, Matt, it's a really good question. And so the peer-reviewed published evidence out there is an 87% adherence number that's been out there for a couple of years. If you look at the average of the market, where people maybe aren't using as much of the digital capabilities, the patients aren't using myAir, the doctors aren't using AirView. General industry adherence might be on average, 60% to 70%, right, with a competitive device that's not connected or maybe someone who's not fully engaged with the digital ecosystem we have. As they start to get engaged, there's actually a peer-reviewed published evidence on this, just adding just adding the doctor using AirView moves up adherence by 10%. So you go from, let's say, an average of 65% to 75% for that customer. Just having the doctors AirView, if the patient uses myAir, you move up almost another 10%. So for that example, you might go from 75% to 85% adherence, where the doctor is using AirView and the patients using myAir. To get to those 90s, you need a really special customer that's really engaged and really investing in tech that takes our tech and sort of adds algorithms, it adds capabilities to it. And we have a number of those sophisticated customers in Europe and the U.S., and we partner with them, and we do joint development with them. And we love that training. We learn from each other. Because together is how we deliver the care. We were a manufacturer and we're a provider of digital health solutions, we've worked with providers in our biggest countries to get there. And where we don't, in smaller consumer-driven markets, we have to pick up the ball and engage directly ourselves. But that 90% is achieved in very rare cases, but it's -- that peer view published evidence shows that it can be done with the tech at 87%. And yes, to your point, how do we get everyone up to that 87% that 90%, that is a process of engagement of training. And that's why I say our share is not only going to stay where it is, but have the chance to grow from that because we are the market leader in this. No one is investing like we are in cloud compute. No one is investing like we are in analytics in AI and ML and engagement with patients and physicians and providers. And we're not doing alone. We're doing it with the ecosystem, with the patients. We're listening to them with the physicians and with the providers. Thanks for the question, Matt. Yes. So it's a great question because let's just talk to our whole sort of demand generation and engagement approach. I mean, as you know, Primasun is a joint venture with Verily in the U.S. market, looking to digitally engaged -- well digitally identify, engage and enroll patients in a sort of digital health pathway from sleep concern consumer all the way through to diagnosed patient on treatment and management. We have activities through our core U.S. and North America marketing team. And obviously, in the other 139 countries we operate in, we're looking at other digital ways to engage the 1 billion people who need our help. So look, we're looking at investments. We're at a pilot phase of some trials, and we're getting ready to scale some approach with Primasun, with U.S. programs and many of the others were operating in all parts of the world. And so as we start to roll those out, now that we're at the point where we've got full capability to supply, as we said in the prep remarks and throughout the call, with AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 is a combination, we can really turn to start to turn the dial up on these demand generation initiatives with undiagnosed sleep apnea patients. And I'm excited to start doing that. So those investments might pick up a little over the coming quarters, but they'll have a huge return in bringing patients into the funnel. So watch this space. Got you loud and clear, Suraj. Well Suraj, it's a really good question. And we only have 5 minutes left in the call. I could spend whole 50 minutes of them. A lot of those things are actually quite proprietary as we put together these AI and ML models on how we would coach a patient, particularly you talk about a high acuity patient like that on bi-level or ventilation, non-invasive ventilation therapy. But look, yes, certainly, I look at our compliance predictors and our compliance analysis tools that can help empower an HME in the U.S. and just some of the ways in which we're able to use AI and ML to drive prioritization of the most at risk for quitting patients. And those who are so close enough to get there. And those were definitely there and just need some sort of digital coaching. That sort of triage, if you like, which has previously been done manually is now going to an automated way. And it's -- we've always had some levels of that automation, but to have an algorithm that learns as it goes and to get better and better at it -- it just serves the doctor. It serves the respiratory therapists and both of them are super pleased to see that level of efficiency, reduction of if you like, the administrative management and focus on the toughest patients but also making sure that the best patients get the digital coaching and help that they need. So it's really we're triaging compliance, adherence and beyond. But watch this space. We're going to launch a bunch of new products that I'll be able to talk to very specifically what they are and what they do over the coming quarters. Yes, Craig, thanks for the question. It did move up just a little bit in the quarter. I actually have got a very strong target for Andrew Price, President of our operations and the whole manufacturing team to get that number down because we're through the peak of this, and we've got full supply, let's get that number down. But Brett, do you want to speak to some of the details of how we're going to turn that inventory number down significantly over the coming quarters and fiscal year? Yes. Thanks, Chris. Yes. No, it's a huge market and actually quite exciting. We've always wanted to have interactions. We actually -- when I first joined the company 23 years ago, we were working with bariatric surgeons and looking at patients that would go through bariatric surgery and maybe from 450 pounds down to 200 pounds. And our challenge in those days when it was mostly a CPAP market was -- how do we make sure they get on APAC because their needs -- their AHI might go from 50 when they were at 450 pounds to 30, when they were 250 pounds, but that's 30 is still severe sleep apnea. So we had to have an APAC algorithm could adjust with them. These days, the market is 80% APAP so you don't need to make sure that a patient on a, let's say, a weight loss drug or so on the seasonal weight loss and their AHI needs go down from very, very severely sleep apnea to just severe or moderate to severe. We have the algorithms and the capabilities within the devices with our audit set algorithm to adjust automatically. And we'll also have all the digital health data. so that the pulmonary doctor can partner up with the primary care or bariatric-type doctor that's working on -- and presumably be PCP is working the obesity drugs, and they can monitor the patient to see how much better they're getting, maybe more inherent more participation in their fitness and exercise for the overall health. So for us, actually, and you know we're invested in one of the sleep apnea drugs. It's not a weight loss drug that actually goes to the core of trying to treat sleep apnea, which is called Apnemed [Ph]. We're going to partner with pharma in this space. We've seen the substitute of the sort of tiny sort of whatever it is, 0.5% of patient flow into these implanted devices. And there's a company out there doing, I think that's a very expensive advertising, but it's driving lots of patients into the funnel. It's demand gen for us because they market it as a button to treat sleep apnea, but it's actually an implanted medical device the size of a pacemaker that goes into the chest when the patient finds that out, they say, Well, what are the alternatives, although they are non-invasive alternative like CPAP or APAP or \u2013 when the patient goes online with that. I think some of the pharmaceutical advertising in this space will drive us to the 80% of undiagnosed patients in the space to say, Hey, look, I'll take the pill first and maybe then I need sleep apnea therapy or vice versa. But we think there's a lot of opportunity to partner here with pharma. We're already partnering with our Propeller division with some of the COPD and asthma drug delivery. I look forward to not just with Apnemed, but these other obesity drugs to understand how they drive patients into the funnel and how we work with them to treat those patients. Well, thanks, Kevin, and thank you again to all of our stakeholders for joining us on the call. I'd once again like to take the opportunity to thank the 10,000 ResMedians. Many of you are also shareholders. So thank you for what you do and for investing in our company as well. Thank you for your dedication and hard work, helping people sleep better, breathe better and live better lives in 140 countries. You delivered these numbers that we just reported. Thank you for all that you do. I'll hand the call back to Amy, and then we'll close out."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, please go ahead.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Kevin. Hi, everyone. Happy new year and welcome to ResMed's second quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings call. Thanks for joining us. This call is being webcast live and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today, along with a copy of the earnings press release and the presentation, both of which are available now. Joining me on the call today are Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. Mick will provide a brief high-level overview of our financial results, review our progress towards our ResMed's 2025 strategic goals, and discuss our progress as we continue to navigate the ongoing macro industry and supply chain challenges. Brett will then review our financial results in more detail. And we'll then move into the Q&A portion of our call. During the Q&A session, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; and David Pendarvis, Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release. And as a reminder, our discussion today will include some forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future operating and financial performance. We do believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could affect our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.\nMick Farrell: Thanks Amy and Kevin and thank you to all of our stakeholders for joining us today as we review results for the December quarter, our second quarter of fiscal year 2023. Our financial results reflect solid performance across our entire business, once again driven by strong sales growth in the Americas region as we were able to significantly increase both production and delivery of flow-generator devices. We're seeing ongoing high demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices worldwide and we're making steady progress, working with our suppliers to continue to increase our production to ultimately meet the needs of all customers and especially patients. Our mask sales growth was strong across the globe, reflecting a post-COVID pandemic awareness of the importance and need for respiratory hygiene and respiratory health. ReSupply programs in the US continued to drive solid, ongoing sustained market mask growth catalyzed somewhat by the end of calendar year deductible momentum in the US geography. Mask sales across Europe, Asia, and the rest of world also improved, driven by increased new patient setups as connected device supply increased. Our teams worked incredibly hard to achieve these extraordinary numbers in the face of an ongoing industry supply chain constrained market. We see the supply environment improving every week, every month, and every quarter, and our access to the specific electronic components we need has increased. We are confident in our ability to fulfill all customer demand before the end of calendar year 2023 and we expect to see steady ongoing incremental device revenue growth in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year 2023. Customer acceptance of our reengineered AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud device remained strong during the second quarter, particularly in the United States geography. As we increase the volume of fully connected AirSense 10 and fully connected AirSense 11 devices over the next few quarters, we will be able to phase out the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud device and refocus on our strategy which is based around the growth of 100% cloud connectable devices across the globe. Outside the US, we have not seen the same adoption rates of that AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud Device. However, there have been pockets of success in some geographies and we see a strong growth path going forward as we ramp up our fully connected AirSense 10 and our fully connected AirSense 11 products and as we achieve regulatory clearance of the latter platform market-by-market. To that point, we introduced our newest product, the AirSense 11 platform into the Japanese market during December and we look forward to continuing to support doctors and patients in Japan with our world leading 100% cloud connectable medical devices and our cloud-based software technology. Our number one priority across all of our markets will always be patients, doing our best to help those who need treatment for sleep apnea, COPD, respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular disease, asthma, and all those who need access to out-of-hospital health care. Our goal is to ensure that patients get the care that they need, where they need it, and when they need it. Let's now briefly review updates on ResMed's top three strategic priorities. Number one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses; number two, to design, develop and deliver market-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; number three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and especially in a patient's own home. The launch and acceptance of our AirSense 11 device platform continues to go very well. Patient feedback remains very positive and we continue to see very strong adoption of our myAir patient app. In fact, adoption rates are at more than double the adoption rate of myAir with the AirSense 10 platform at about 55% of all patients getting their data every day on their myAir app. Increasing production and delivery of the AirSense 11 platform remains a top priority for our ResMedians around the globe and we will continue to achieve better results and stronger market penetration each quarter. Earlier this month, we were able to take our AirSense 10 fully connected device off allocation in the US market. This is a very exciting development for our commercial team here in the Americas and for all of our customers. We look forward to continuing to expand the supply of fully connected AirSense 10 and fully connected AirSense 11 devices, so that supply can become unconstrained in all countries, but we will progress the throughout fiscal 2023 on this endeavor. An important aspect of our ResMed 2025 strategy is to reach hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including non-invasive ventilation, and life support ventilation, as well as newer therapeutic areas such as cloud connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions and home-based high flow therapy solutions. We are continuing to drive growth and adoption of our ventilated devices around the world and we saw good uptake of both our life support and our non-life support ventilator platforms during the quarter. There is also ongoing adoption of Propeller's monitoring system. Its digital therapeutic platform is now integrated with the two leading US electronic health record systems Epic and Cerner. This digital health integration makes it easier for doctors and healthcare workers to onboard people to the Propeller platform. It's still early days for this technology, however, combined with our investments in home based high flow therapy for treatment of COPD in the home, we see this technology combination as an important clinical addition for treating lung disease and an integral part -- an important part of our 2025 growth strategy. Turning to our Software-as-a-Service offerings for outside hospital care, our SaaS fast business grew 18% year-over-year. This extraordinary growth includes sustained high single-digit organic growth of our US-based SaaS business at around 7% and is accelerated by the addition of approximately six weeks of MEDIFOX DAN revenue as we closed that acquisition and welcome that German team into the ResMed family of SaaS solutions just over midway through the December quarter. We continue to grow with outside hospital care customers as they increase their utilization of our software and data solutions to improve and optimize business efficiencies and patient care. As the post- COVID patients census continues to improve in our facilities verticals, we are seeing pent-up demand for technology investments that continue to come to the market. Our HME SaaS business under the Brightree brand continues to grow at a very rapid pace and we welcome tech solutions for our HME customers across the US market. As I just mentioned, during the quarter, we received final regulatory approval and closed our acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, the leading provider of end-to-end software solutions for nursing homes and home health customers in Germany. We're now focused on integrating and growing this business as we accelerate SaaS innovation and SaaS growth in Germany and beyond. I've met in-person with many of the key leaders of the MEDIFOX DAN team and I can tell you, I'm excited about the cultural fit, the technology focus, the sharing and learning opportunities that they bring and we bring to our global SaaS team. This is our first investment in an outside hospital software business beyond the US market, but I can tell you, the global SaaS team is very much in sync and they have come out of the grade strongly not just in the revenue growth I just talked about, but also in the soft side, team collaboration, transparency, beyond. We look forward to updating you as we achieve key milestones in that business over the quarters and years ahead. Our team is ready to deliver. Our SaaS business is an important part of ResMed's future growth and complements the incredibly strong software and device solutions that we have in our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. One great example of the synergies between our SaaS business and our core business is the success of the Brightree ReSupply program. Brightree ReSupply automates the entire process from contacting the patient, interacting with the insurance company on coverage, and interacting directly with the patient on co-pays as well as managing the logistics and distribution process. The ultimate goal is to keep a CPAP, APAP or bilevel therapy user replenished with the suppliers that they need to enable a better and longer lasting therapy experience. We have published clinical data that show that a patient on a ReSupply program has higher adherence to therapy and we also have peer reviewed published data in CHEST showing, what\u2019s called the ALASKA study that there is a 39% reduction in mortality for patients who are adherent to CPAP versus control. These are incredible data and they lead to these synergies not just being a good revenue opportunity, but being an incredible cost-saving opportunity for the healthcare system and life-saving opportunity for the patients involved. We will continue to identify and capitalize on synergy opportunities as we move forward. We are well-positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for out-of-hospital care globally, and we have created differentiated value for customers and long term sustainable growth for our stakeholders. We are transforming out-of-hospital health care at scale, leading the market in digital health technology across our business. We now have over 13.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 19 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are liberating data to the cloud every day and unlocking value for patients, providers, physicians, payers, and entire health care systems and communities. We are leading the industry, but I see this as just the start of the digital health marathon. And I can tell you, we love the race. As the overlap between digital health and consumer tech industries continues, it is important to note that ResMed's Chief Medical Officer Dr. Carlos Nunez was recently named Chair of the Board of the Health Division of the Consumer Technology Association, or CTA, and the Health Division is the fastest growing division within CTA. The Health Division focuses on consumer-based technology-enabled health solutions to deliver better health outcomes for patients and reduce overall healthcare costs for the healthcare system. Their mission is fully aligned with our ResMed mission, and I'm delighted to see Carlos be recognized for his leadership and the sessions that he chaired at CES in Vegas a couple of weeks ago, show that ResMed's thought leadership and Carlos' thought leadership is helping to craft the future of digital health and bring it to consumers as we have done over the past decade. We're excited about the ways Carlos and CTA's Health Division can help continue to shape our industry for the future, lowering costs, and improving outcomes, and engaging consumers in their own health care. ResMed's mission and clear goal is to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025. This patient-centric mission drives and motivates ResMedians every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal over the last period. During the last 12 months, we improved over 149 million lives with delivery of a device platform to a patient, a full mask system to a patient, or a digital health software solution, helping people to sleep better, to breathe better, and to live higher quality lives with healthcare delivered right where they live, and mostly, in their own home. Before I close, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude to more than 10,000 ResMedians now for their perseverance, hard work, and dedication both today and every day. Thank you. With that I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we will move and open up for Q&A from the group. Brett over to you.\nBrett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. We had strong financial performance in Q2. Group revenue was $1.03 billion, an increase of 16%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 20%. Revenue growth reflected increased demand for our sleep products across our portfolio and ongoing increased device demand generated by our competitor\u2019s product recall. Year-on-year movements in foreign currencies, in particular, the weaker euro negatively impacted revenue by approximately $36 million this quarter. As mentioned, we closed the MEDIFOX DAN acquisition on November 21, 2022 and accordingly, we have recognized MEDIFOX DAN revenue of $10.7 million in our Q2 FY 2023 results from this date. While we continue to experience ongoing challenges in securing sufficient electronic components to meet market demand, we are now seeing a more predictable and improving supply chain environment. We expect to continue to deliver sequentially higher quarterly device revenue through the balance of fiscal year 2023. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in US, Canada, and Latin America countries increased by 26%. Sales in Europe, Asia, and other markets increased by 8% in constant currency terms. Our product segment, globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 25%, while masks and others sales increased by 13%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the US, Canada, and Latin America increased by 41% as we benefited from incremental revenue derived from the introduction of the Card-to-Cloud device and improving availability of our connected devices. Masks and other sales increased by 11%, reflecting solid ReSupply revenue. In Europe, Asia, and other markets, device sales increased by 5% in constant currency terms, reflecting the ongoing supply constraints in those markets for our connected devices. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia, and other markets increased by 14% in constant currency terms. Software-as-a-Service revenue, including revenue from our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition increased by 18% in the December quarter, driven by continued strong performance from our HME vertical. On an organic basis, SaaS revenue grew by 7% in the December quarter. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Gross margin declined by 80 basis points to 56.8% in the December quarter. The decrease is predominantly attributable to product mix shifts due to increased flow generator sales as well as unfavorable foreign currency movements, partially offset by increases in average selling prices. Moving on to operating expenses, SG&A expenses for the second quarter increased by 14%, or in constant currency terms increased by 20%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee related costs, additional expenses related to our acquisitions, and travel and entertainment expenses. SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 20.5% compared to the 20.7% we recorded in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the balance of fiscal year 2023. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 4%, or in constant currency terms, increased by 15%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.8% compared to 7% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2023. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 14%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by lower gross margin. Our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 18.3% compared to the prior year quarter rate of 15.6%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the December quarter increased by 13% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 13%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $129 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings, partially offset by higher levels of working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $27 million, depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $38 million. We recorded equity losses of $3.1 million in our income statement in the December quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $3 million per quarter through the balance of fiscal year 2023 associated with the joint venture operation. On November 21, 2022, we completed our acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN for consideration of $997 million and this was funded through a drawdown on our existing revolver credit facility. During the quarter, we recorded acquisition related expenses of $8.4 million associated with the MEDIFOX DAN acquisition. The acquisition was EPS neutral on a non-GAAP basis in Q2, and we expect the acquisition to be mildly accretive to EPS on a non-GAAP basis in the second half of FY 2023. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $253 million. At December 31, we had $1.8 billion in gross debt and $1.5 billion in net debt, reflecting the funding of our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition. At December 31, we had approximately $390 million available for drawdown under our fleet revolver facility and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Following the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, our net interest expense is expected to increase to approximately $15 million per quarter for the second half of fiscal year 2023, reflecting our increased debt position. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D and also expect to continue to fund at future tuck-in acquisitions. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great, thanks, Brett and thanks Mick. Kevin, I'd like to now turn the call back over to you to provide the instructions and then run the Q&A portion of our call.\nOperator: Certainly. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nChris Cooper: Thanks. Good morning -- good afternoon. So, good to hear the fully connected AirSense 10 is now off allocation. Can I ask what happens with the C2Cs that have effectively now I presume surplus to requirements? And are there any sort of impacts on pricing or inventory valuation we need to think about in the second half?\nMick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Chris and it's a good one. Obviously, we're thrilled to have AirSense 10 fully connected now, unconstrained in the US geography. As you know, we operate in 140 countries worldwide. The AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud inventory, we're working our way through that and it actually is moving very quickly. I'd state it this way that we've got the number one device in the market, which is the AirSense 11 fully connected in terms of customer ratings. We also have the number two device in the market, which is the AirSense 10 fully connected. But then we have the number three device the third best device in the market, which is the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud, I believe that's better than the tier 2, 3, 4 competitors that are in the market. And so we've got the number one, two, and three device there and we're selling them and different customers want different things. And certainly, the AirSense 11 fully connected is at a price premium. But we'll start to see, I think us work through all of our inventory, the excess patient demand is still there globally. And I think we'll be there for a period of time, even after one of our competitors looks like they may come back into the market, hopefully sometime this this calendar year so that we can get our mask attachment rates on to them. But yes, Chris, we expect to work through all that AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud inventory. Good question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.\nSuraj Kalia: Mick, can you hear me all right?\nMick Farrell: Got you loud and clear, Suraj.\nSuraj Kalia: Congrats on a great quarter. Hey, Mick, maybe I'm just trying to thread the needle here, but love to get some extra color. I heard you say by 2025, 250 million lives, that's the plan. If I use where you are currently, let's say 150 million, just rounding it off, that's a 70% almost jump in patient covered life -- covered by CPAP. How should I think about the implied guide? Am I jumping the gun here? Or are you sort of telegraphing you'll should be in a position for the next three years deliver about 17%, 18% CAGR? Thank you.\nMick Farrell: Suraj, it's a great question and how we measure the lives changed is a pretty simple formula includes the CPAPs, APAPs, bi-level devices. But it also includes full mask systems, which you know, the sort of linear growth, if you like of the devices and some slight exponential growth of the mask systems because of replenishment rates and repeat customers coming back. But it also includes patients' lives touched through digital health. So, whether it's a Brightree patient who gets access to their device or other HME equipment, whether it's a patient in COPD medicines that gets an app that reminds them to take their medicine on a Propeller, or a patient that has a life support ventilator that gets a digital health reminder to get replenishment. And so combining all those impacts on a life. And the way I look at it is a life is changed as much by a brand new device arriving in their house as it is by an app that helps them take a medicine that keeps them out-of-hospital. So, that's how we sort of look at lives change. Yes, 150 million calendar year 2023, you got it, right. I mean, you got the math, the mathematics there is the CAGR is 17.5% volume growth of the lives that we touch over the next three calendar years through 2025 and we're going to do that. We're going to get more and more patients on CPAPs, APAPs, bi-levels, more and more on ReSupply and masks systems, and then more and more on our digital health platforms. And we've got -- it's a lofty goal and it's a stretch goal, but we believe we can get there and change 250 million lives by 2025. Thanks Suraj. Great question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\nMathew Mishan: Hey. Good afternoon, Mick. Just a quick question on the gross margins. Just how has the productivity of manufacturing and shipping improved over the last few months? Are you guys still working through, like high-cost inventory? How much spot buying is there? And then is sort of the decrease in gross margins -- slight decrease in gross margin, mainly on the mix of devices versus masks and accessories?\nMick Farrell: Yes, Matt, I'll start and then I'll hand to Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer to cover in detail. But just at the start, yes, there was a sequential decrease in gross margin. One way, Matt, I could have avoided that is tell the team don't sell all those CPAPs and APAPs, to create, right because it was great gross profit dollars to the business and was great to change a patient's life by a new device, but I could have get my GM 70, 80 basis points up by saying slow down those CPAP and APAP sales. Of course, we didn't do that. The right thing is the humanitarian aspect to get those devices that we pivoted, our supply chain reengineered and redesigned to get them to market and you saw extraordinary growth, 41% growth in our US-based device market. Now, that's not our highest gross margin, its diluted to GM percentage, but it's contributory and positive to gross profit dollars. And so it's good for patients, and it's good for our stakeholders. So, that's what we did. But Rob, yes, some a really good question -- first part of the question.\nRob Douglas: Yes, Matt, thanks for question. There's lots of factors in that gross margin and you're asking specifically about productivity and productivity improvements. We've done a whole lot of work around volume improvements and really driving volume and all of our discussions with suppliers have been increasing volume and reliability of delivery. Our normal settings in normal world is we have a long-term outlook volume commitment and we're looking at optimization and pricing improvements and things like that. Those activities have pretty well been on hold while we've been doing these -- this sort of real scramble that drive volumes. Freights a similar situation, although we are seeing freights probably going to improve faster than some of these other costs that were in there. But totally in terms of our supply chain culture, we absolutely will be aiming to go back to our continuous improvement situation where we have a really strong volume leverage gain. We continue to drive the volumes in a systematic way and we use that to drive productivity and drive cost out of the system.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden. Your line is now live.\nSteve Wheen: Yes, thanks Mick. I just wanted to follow up on that gross margin question. In the previous quarter, I think it was -- Brett was talking to the efficiencies that you're achieving through doing more volume, was -- the margin benefit from that efficiency was sitting in your inventory balance and that's obviously been building and built again this quarter. I'm just interested is that still the case that when that inventory comes off the balance sheet, you should automatically start to see the efficiency gains that you've been able to achieve to-date?\nMick Farrell: Brett, do you want to have a first go of that question?\nBrett Sandercock: Yes, Mick thanks. So, Steve, yes, I mean, that's -- what we're doing -- I mean -- I think Rob articulated really, at the moment, we're optimizing for delivery rather than efficiency and we got things like we're running the three platforms at the moment. So, I'm really focused on delivering devices to patients. So, that's having an impact. The big one is work through inventory or the wash-through is the freight cost. So, we're seeing some reduction in freight costs. But that's not manifested in our P&L, yet, that's one for the Q3, Q4. So, there will be some benefits that starts wash through into Q3 and Q4 that we're not seeing it that's currently still in inventory. But on the efficiency side, we're really -- we will get there, but we're optimizing on delivery for the moment. But I think as we work through the fiscal, we'll be in a much better position to drive on efficiency measures.\nMick Farrell: I\u2019d just pile on there that you look at Brett's guidance, nice conservative guidance is that our gross margin will be sort of steady as we go forward. I look on this and say, I think there's some upside. As we start to see mask rates start to improve, we saw 13% constant currency growth in masks during the quarter. I think, yes, as Brett said, the freight costs will wash through the inventory. And we're getting great scale from the biggest respiratory medical manufacturing plant in the planet, there in Singapore and the efficiency we've got a well above any competitor and we're doing really well on that and I think that'll come through. And then in addition to that, you'll get some upside from MEDIFOX DAN, which is accretive to revenue, gross margin, and EPS, as Brett said, throughout fiscal and beyond. So, that would be my guidance there as well, Steve. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Bailey from Macquarie. Your line is now live.\nDavid Bailey: Yes, thanks very much. Morning Mick and Brett. Just got a question on new patient growth. Just thinking about patients who have been prescribed the device and waiting and also those yet to be diagnosed, just wondering if you could compare and contrast the US and rest of world? And then some comments on what you think it means for industry device growth for fiscal 2023 and 2024 relative to our historical growth rates?\nMick Farrell: David, that's a great question. It's actually the answer. We could take the whole rest of the Q&A session to go through it because it's what we do is trying to reach out to the 936 million people in our core market that suffocate every night with sleep apnea around the world and we're laser-focused on it. As you saw, we delivered very strongly on those new patient setups 41% growth of devices in US, Canada, Latin America and we turned to positive there in Europe, Asia, and other. And what I can tell you is we're really working through that excess patient demand. Those numbers will tell you we're working faster through that excess demand in the US and getting closer to a state you get a prescription and you'll get a device in days or weeks versus it gone up to months there at the peak of the crisis. And I think if you look across the other 140 countries we sell into, every country is different. We've got to get the regulatory approval for AirSense 11 there. We've got to work our way through, but we're going step-by-step on that journey. And so as I look at this excess patient demand, I made the comment there in my prep remarks, I think we will get to all of our customers' demand before the end of this calendar year and that tells you our confidence in increased supply and our ability to meet that need, and we're laser-focused on that humanitarian emergency of patients waiting too long for therapy and we just don't want that you suffocate. This is a case of life and death; we've got the data to show that. We want your path to therapy to be expedited. And in addition to that, the final thing I'll say is that we are looking at our patient demand generation activities that have been on hold these last 18 months. And I'm looking at our models in Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Japan, Singapore, UK, and beyond where we have these omnichannel markets availability to contact consumers or sleep concern consumers directly and get them into the funnel. And here in the US, we have direct models and also our joint venture there with Verily and Primasun that we've done some really good demand gen tests and a number of cities just waiting for me to fire the starting gun for that team. And we're getting very close to firing that starting gun. So, we have a smooth flow of -- from excess patient demand to now patient demand generation to continue our growth trajectory.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live.\nMike Matson: Yes, thanks for taking my questions. I guess, Mick, I think you mentioned high flow therapy in your prepared remarks. I just wanted to get an update on kind of where things stand with commercializing that? And maybe talk about the -- just the market opportunity there? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Yes. Look, it's a great question, Mike. And our long-term goals there in 2025, a number of those 250 million lives are going to change in 2025 will be patients with neuromuscular disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. And two of those great therapies, high flow therapy in the home, I want to be very specific, it's been used in the hospital during the pandemic. High flow therapy in the home, we see as a huge opportunity, probably 10 times the size of our ventilation market in COPD is available for home therapy, HFT therapy. And then Propeller, yes, early days and the pilots are going well. We're integrated to the payer provider EHR systems, which gives us the credibility now to go from pilots to start to scale some payer providers, particularly in the US geography. But Rob, any further details on our work on HFT and cloud connected inhalers for Mike there?\nRob Douglas: Yes, Mike. We're pretty excited about this. It's a long-term project though, but as Mick said, we view this as a very large potential market, very significantly larger than some of our other respiratory care markets. And we believe that we're running tests -- we're really focusing on its complementariness with home oxygen therapy that is you'll get much better outcomes if you add this in. And we're working hard on all of the market access and evidence generation programs to do that. Now, most of those programs are buying either RCTs or real-world evidence trials. So, we're sort of in limited market release at the moment in specific markets where we're making these claims. But as that evidence evolves and we generate it and take it to the -- to payers and standard setting organizations, we see this is going to be a very strong market for us, but it is a multiyear project.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Craig Wong-Pan from RBC. Your line is now live.\nCraig Wong-Pan: Thank you. Just a question on the SaaS business. The 7% organic growth that you mentioned, I was wondering if much of that was benefiting from price increases or if the price increases you started through the quarter have a bigger benefit to come through in future periods?\nMick Farrell: Yes, Craig, thanks for the question. No, that doesn't include a whole lot of price increases. In fact, we put price increases on hold during the COVID pandemic in some of our SaaS businesses and so we probably are changing to the area of price increases as we go forward. We've gone from pandemic to endemic, so that will happen and then flow out over the coming 12, 24 months. I'm really excited. We're looking at that domestic SaaS business in the worst of COVID getting down to low single-digits. We moved to mid-single-digits. And then Bobby, who's President of that division and his team have really accelerated that organic growth to 7% -- 8% last quarter, 7% this quarter, and so that high single-digits organic growth. And actually, we see upside from that in the organic, if you think about it, Brightree, MatrixCare, and Citus Health path. So, we see opportunities to move that up. And then when you add on MEDIFOX DAN and its capabilities, I think the combined business, obviously, the next four quarters, we'll call out the inorganic part will be double-digits on the inorganic, of course. But even going forward, as we look out towards 2025, we see opportunities for high single-digit and even low double-digit growth across that combined business as we lap the acquisition. So, really good growth there. Price increases will be a part of that going forward, but they weren't historically, to answer your question directly.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nSean Laaman: Good morning Mick, hope you well. Mick my question is do you have enough visibility on the component pipeline to ascertain when you might be able to provide direct cloud connected devices in those markets that have an aversion to the Card-to-Cloud?\nMick Farrell: Yes, Sean, I hope your Sydney morning is going well day after Australia Day. Look, the way we're looking at this is we've got 140 countries. We've got a very complex supply logistics program to get the patients minimize the time from prescription to therapy across all those markets, but it's a complex equation. The good news is we are seeing supply of those rate limited semiconductors for communications. The 3G, 4G, 5G chips are starting to see supply come back. The microprocessors, the next rate limited step are starting to increase and so we're seeing our path through this. And you saw in the quarter, we were able to deliver incredibly strongly on that, and we're off allocation for the AirSense 10 100% connected. Look, I'd love to tell you, we've got a very complex jigsaw puzzle here. I'd love to tell you it will be off allocation on AirSense 11 in all of our markets. It's just not going to happen in the short-term. But as we go through this year, we'll update you as we go off allocation and it will happen market-by-market geography-by-geography. Rob, did I miss anything there?\nRob Douglas: The only other comment, Sean, is some of this is driven by regulatory requirements around getting approvals and validations and also, several of these markets have different components that they need. So, they're different validation and engineering projects to do it. And we just have to sequence that through our prioritization process as well. So, that's actually true with all product launches.\nMick Farrell: Yes, and the good news is it's not our first rodeo. We've done this launch platforms in 140 countries many times before, and we're back to our sort of meat and potatoes here. This is what we do all day every day. And going off supply chain constraints over the calendar year will be fantastic for us to be able to then just go back to what we do, which is helping people sleep better, breathe better, and live better lives outside hospital care. Thanks for the question Sean.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is now live.\nMargaret Kaczor: Hi, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Good morning to Brett. I wanted to follow-up on the growth drivers as we think about this and next year, because I'm hearing there's patient backlog, obviously, there's core market demand generation that will start to pick up. And then from our perspective, we look at RePAPs as well. So, how do you layer those together over what time period? How much growth could you handle? And then maybe specific to RePAPs, since we haven't talked that much about them on this call, where have they been in the last two years? And when should they return to be a bigger piece of the mix itself? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Yes. Thanks Margaret. It's a great question and it's one we're thinking about a lot here. And we're thinking about all three prongs that you talked about. The first one, excess patient demand, how do we work through that. US, we're getting close to really working through it. We've got 140 other countries. And to Rob's point, it's a complex equation to get the supply chain and deliver in all 140, but we're working through that. Secondly, demand generation, yes, where we have omnichannel and have really established social media presences and abilities to drive demand gen, we'll be starting to turn those on country-by-country. And then thirdly, RePAPs, to your point, the last two and a half, three years of COVID crisis, pandemic crisis, competitor recall crisis, we have not turned the knob on RePAP. And in fact, we know our customers have been holding back when they're supply chain constrained on contacting patients who reach that three-year, five-year post-warranty, you're ready for a new device on insurance and/or patient making the call. So, I think all three of those are going to be applied in all 50 states here in the US and in all 140 countries worldwide. We do have scenarios and plans, I'm not going to detail them here on this call, but I can tell you that we expect to see steady growth throughout our market and we're going to drive that. And we're going to make sure that patients waiting lists are not long. We're not going to turn the needles until we're ready to get there in supply. I'm just happy we're having this conversation this quarter and it's so much better than the last eight quarters that we're talking about demand gen and driving RePAPs, because that's what we've done for 33.5 years in the business and it's what we love doing and we're going to do more of it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Matt Taylor from Jefferies. Your line is now live.\nMatt Taylor: Great. Thank you for taking the question and good morning and good evening. I had a follow-up on that question. I guess I just wanted to understand what are your expectations if and when your competitor does come back? I mean, presumably, there could be some, I guess, impact on flow gens that would create pressure, but maybe you get some pickup in the mask. Could you characterize how quickly you would expect things to change dynamically in both directions? And then how much juice can you actually get out of the demand creation and ReSupply to backfill or you, kind of, increase growth? What are your pilot programs or places where you've done that telling you about how much of a quantitative pickup you can get?\nMick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question Matt. I'll start and hand to Rob for further detail because it is a really important area for us. Look, if you think about -- our competitor has been out on the market for 18 months and who knows. They've got to -- we'll find out probably later this week, they got an earnings call, maybe they'll tell us what's happened at the consent decree and give us some timing. Frankly, give the market some time it'd be good. We've run scenarios, they come back Monday February 1, July 1, we've also run scenarios that it's January 1, 2024. And actually, in all those scenarios, ResMed grows and ResMed does really well, and ResMed does a really good job of taking care of the unmet patient need. So, if they come back earlier, come back Monday, we get a 60% plus or minus attach rate of our masks. So, we get good GM contribution, great patient care in terms of the best masks in the planet going to them, and we're able to drive that. Now, they'll be starting from 0%, new patient share, they're going to able to go and fight account-by-account. And they won't be fighting against ResMed out the gate. They'll be fighting against the Tier 2, 3, and 4 players who have come in to fill that part of the equation and they're doing an okay job. And so they have to fight against the okay players. Then they have to fight against us, the market leader. But I look forward to them coming back actually in terms of the mask side of the business, it will be really good. The scenario where it's further out, it's later this calendar year or early next calendar year or beyond. We're okay with that too because we're ramping up our supply, and we're going to get closer and closer to meet all of customer demand in this. So, frankly, it's not irrelevant, but it's not a big perturbation of our long-term strategy and our long-term business. And we've got the scenarios and the little pivots that we need to have more masks or more demand gen in the different scenarios. So, I think investors and some analysts are thinking more about this -- are worried -- more worried about this than we are because we thought so much about it and have the scenarios and the playbook ready for all three of those scenarios and 2020 beyond. I look forward to this sort of people calling a binary. I see there's a mild perturbation of the Monte Carlo sim that really doesn't change in the long-term outcomes for ResMed and our patients is not changed in any of those scenarios. But Rob, any further detail for Matt here?\nRob Douglas: Yes, Matt the only other thing I'd add is we sort of think of sort of market growth rate in terms of the patient lifetime journey through this condition -- terrible condition, very serious and the biggest problem is awareness. And so you start off with how do you become aware of it. Does your primary care know to refer you to a sleep specialist? Can that specialist refer you to either home or lab testing? And then do you get a referral to a provider who's got the capacity to look after you. And basically, staff capacity is even a big issue for them. And so -- and then will that provide a look after long-term and keep the ReSupply programs. And our solutions are across all of those, but there's bottlenecks in all of those parts of the patient lifetime -- patient journey, if you like. And as I say, we're providing solutions across that and incrementally driving improvements across all of those. So, that provides a really good long-term outlook for steady growth in the business, as Mick was saying.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Polark from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live.\nMichael Polark: Hey, good afternoon. Two quick ones if I can sneak them in. Is there a vision or strategy to convert Card-to-Cloud products to connected solutions over time? Or is the base case to lead those units that have gone into the market over the last year or so, as is? And then the second quick one is MEDIFOX DAN, the gross margin on that revenue ballpark, can you share what that is? Thank you so much.\nMick Farrell: Thanks Mike and cheeky sneaking in two questions, but I'll answer both for sure. Card-to-Cloud, as those devices -- as those AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud devices reach their either warranty period or payer allotted period at which a patient can get another device allocated to them, which is usually in the three years or five years, normally time horizon, those patients will get the opportunity to upgrade their devices from an AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud to presumably an AirSense 11 device. And look, the first 26 years of ResMed's existence, we had, firstly, non-connected and then Card-to-Cloud pager-type technologies sort of sneaker-net. It works. It can get you there. It's not as optimal. It doesn\u2019t get that sort of patient engagement on myAir and all the abilities that we can get to that 87% adherence, but it's darn good therapy. It's the smallest, quietest, the most comfortable therapy. And with the Card-to-Cloud, our HME -- mostly sold in the US, HME customers have done this for years and the data go to the cloud, and so the doctor doesn't see much difference because the doctor is seeing all the data in AirView on Card-to-Cloud and directly connected and so actually able to drive really good care with those patients. So, it will be a bolus of patients over that sort of 12-month period. And we've had, I would say, some pretty good success in humanitarian aid really and showing that ResMed isn't just going to stick to a strategy. It's going to say, if we need to pivot tactically to take care of patients, we'll do it and we'll take care of them long-term. But there will be a bolus of patients, I think, jumping at the front of RePAP in a couple of years who want to get the latest and greatest technology and some on consumer pay markets might go quicker. The second question around gross margin. Yes, look, MEDIFOX DAN accretive to our group gross margin. I'm not going to quantify it exactly, but that's why I said you're going to see, I think, some upside to our GM as we go through the fiscal year, including MEDIFOX DAN. It's accretive to revenue, gross margin percentage, but also NOP dollars and our EPS performance over the fiscal and beyond. Thanks for the questions Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey Capital. Your line is now live.\nSaul Hadassin: Good afternoon and good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Mick, just a quick one. Just the US flow generator growth rate of 41%, obviously, very strong. Just wondering if you can give us any color as to within that, how much was volume versus price and also mix?\nMick Farrell: Yes, Saul, look, it's a great question. We don't split out our details on price. But I can give some sort of general color and maybe, Rob, Brett, maybe you want to add a little bit on for Saul to the color that we can provide. Competitive dynamics are very tight. Look, we were very open that we had a surcharge that we put the start of last year around the freight costs that were incredibly high, $12 and EUR12 across all devices and so on. We will start to actually take that away to get customer-by-customer and appropriately as we go through the year. And as we actually see -- to Rob's point earlier, as we see those freight costs come through our inventory, they don't just come in a spot change, it takes time for the COGS reduction there to come through. But in terms of that 41%, I can say it was materially improved by the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud and was able to get those devices there. But our ability, I think, also as we have started this quarter to turn AirSense 10 fully connected off-constraint, I think will continue to be a nice tailwind for our business there. But Brett, I'll hand to you for any further color we can provide to Saul to help on his modeling on this great US flow generator growth.\nBrett Sandercock: Yes. Thanks Mick. I mean the only thing I'd add, Saul, is that we -- it was really the sleep devices or APAP devices are really strong as we got device availability that went straight into the market. So, that was really kind of driving that, which is obviously higher volume devices than, say, bi-levels, for example. So, that did definitely play a big part in that revenue growth.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from David Low from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nDavid Low: Thanks so much. Just a quick one. Mick you talked about being unconstrained on supply by the end of the calendar year and then I think to Sean's question, you talked about different markets and regulatory approvals. So, the question I've got is will the AirSense 11 be unconstrained more quickly in the US? And can you give us any sort of sense as to when you expect that will be the case?\nMick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question David. Yes, clearly, AirSense 10 fully connected will be unconstrained first just because that platform has been in the market for a long period of time. We've got all the inventory, all the capabilities to drive it, and it's regulatory approved in virtually every market, 140 around the world. And so it's just much easier to turn that off-constraint and get it moving first. But yes, to your point, the smaller, the quieter, the more comfortable and the most connected and most clever device is the AirSense 11. As we get regulatory approvals and we're going country-by-country on this. As we said, we just got Japan during the last quarter and we're going to go country-by-country on this, when we get regulatory approvals and as we get supply starting to improve on those components, we can really ramp that up with all its great technology and really good cost advantages and patient-friendly advantages. It's got coaching capabilities and interaction with the patient on the screen that's interactive and can do some really good over-the-air upgrades, but also over-the-air interactions with physicians and its connectivity to myAir, 55%. I mean almost vast majority of patients are being offered and almost for all them are saying, yes, I want to see my data every day and get a myAir score. So, it will go faster and less constrained in those markets where it has approval. I'm not going to predict the exact date that that will happen because we've got scenarios around that. But I think we will start to see that go off-constraints before the end of the calendar year because that's when we're going to be able to meet all the customer demand, which is our goal and with on a fast-track to do it this calendar year. Rob, what did I miss there on David's question?\nRob Douglas: The only other thing is, David, it's been really important for us to be able to supply those two platforms. It's been a great thing for us to have sort of a double. Basically, we've got so much extra capability and capacity because we've got two platform lines designed for the market.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST Macquarie -- I'm sorry Marquee. Your line is now live.\nDan Hurren: Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Look, it's pretty clear that a lot of the growth is now coming from products that have been reengineered and didn't really even exist in their current form a little while ago. So, -- and we've seen AirSense 10 connected as you're talking about launch with different parts and alternate supplies and so forth. But we've also seen some early regulatory approvals for an AirSense 11 with apparently different communication chipset. Is there any reason why that product couldn\u2019t launch within the next few months as you've seen roughly the same time line between approval and launch for something like the AirSense 10 connected?\nMick Farrell: Yes. Thanks Dan. And clearly, you're very diligent looking at FDA and different regulatory approvals around the world. Look, what I'll say to this is that the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud was a reengineered re-pivoted device, absolutely. And the AirSense 10 fully connected, we did rejig the comms chip to get one that was less supply chain constraints. So, those two are reengineering back in the line. We didn't reengineer the AirSense 11 that's selling right now. But of course, there will be variance. This is a long-term platform. This platform, the AirSense 11 is going to do CPAP, APAP, bi-level, all sorts of amazing therapy models. If you even look at the work that we're doing on the Lumis HFT device that we talked about earlier in the Q&A and during my prep remarks, that's on a platform of the AirSense 10 and obviously, AirSense 11 will become the platform of note for us over the coming years. But we don't go into details of our future product pipeline. So, thanks for the question. But look, I can tell you, those three products in the market are number one, two, and three and as you saw this quarter, they're selling well, and we expect them to continue to.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nLyanne Harrison: Good morning all. I might just come back to that full customer demand comment by the end of calendar 2023. Mick, is that in relation to just the new starts? Or do you also expect that you'll meet the demand for the backlog of RePAPs as well that we've had over the last few years?\nMick Farrell: Yes, Lyanne, you're getting to some of the complexities behind that. Look, our goal is to get off the supply constraint during this calendar and we know we can get there. We won't get there if we turn on every single knob that we have for demand generation and RePAP generation around the world. And so we will be turning those dials, if you like, for demand generation and RePAP generation through our customers and directly as we get supply improving country-by-country. And so yes, I think we can get to all customer demand if we do no change faster, but our goal is to take care of not just the patients who are currently in the pipeline, but also the 80% -- 90% in many countries who are undiagnosed and untreated. And so our mission is to do that and it's aligned with altruism but also our profit motive. And the overlap of those is a really powerful tool for us to have sustainable long-term growth as we have the last 33.5 years. And so clearly, if we turn every dial to max, we wouldn't be able to get off a constraint this year. We won't turn all to max, but we will and we are starting to turn those dials and getting the programs up and running in different cities, different states, different geographies around the world as we start to get off-constraint. So, I won't go into further detail than that to say that, Lyanne, yes, you're digging in, it is more complex than just we get there. It's we get there and then we start turning on the market growth rate as the market leader, which is our sort of our duty and our obligation and we're going to do both. We're going to grow the market and grow our share and deliver for patients.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Steve Wheen, it\u2019s a follow-up from Jarden. Please go ahead.\nSteve Wheen: Yes, thanks for taking my question. This question is about the diagnosis rate in the US, in particular, for OSA. There has been some frustration to the ability to diagnose patients. So, I just wonder what you're seeing from -- during the quarter from an improvement on that front with regard to diagnosis?\nMick Farrell: Yes, Steve, thanks and thanks for coming for your second question at the end of the queue. It shows that the system works and you can get the second question in. It's a good one. Our diagnosis rate in the US, obviously, impacted the start of COVID with all the labs being shut down and then we saw that big pivot and adoption of home sleep apnea testing and some great models from ResMed and many other players in the market to help physicians find ways to remotely screen, diagnose, treat, and manage sleep apnea patients. As we come out from pandemic to endemic in the US, we've definitely seen -- I'd say, our data show that at least 50% of patients are going through home sleep apnea testing. And then of the other 50%, some of them do home sleep apnea test and then just a follow-up in a lab for titration and mask fit and so on. And so really good adoption of home sleep apnea testing. It's sort of related to our demand generation area that demand generation isn't just going out there on social media and advertising and finding that customer acquisition cost and appropriate place well under lifetime value and getting them into the channel. It's also working with the channel to understand where we have capacity, what cities, what geographies that we have. And as you know, Steve following us closely, we purchased a company called Ectosense, and their product called NightOwl. And I have one sitting on the desk right here. This thing is the size of my fingertip and it has the ability to have highly sensitive and specific screening and diagnosis of sleep apnea with reimbursement in a geography like the US, and we're actually experimenting in Asia and Latin America and around the world on this. And the technology is originally European, so hopefully, it gets adopted there, too. I love Ectosense, and I love home sleep apnea testing happening where it's small, it's quiet, it's convenient, and its cloud connected similar to our therapeutics. And yes, so I think you're going to see that diagnostic rate in the US pick up post-pandemic because people learned that telemedicine, digital health, remote screening, remote diagnostics work, and we can scale them. But it won't just be here in the US. It might be pioneered, launched here, and scaled here. but it's going to work in many other countries around the world. And I can tell you we're really excited about partnerships with the physicians and the patients themselves to find their path to better sleep and better breathing. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further or closing comments.\nMick Farrell: Thanks Kevin and thank you again to all of our shareholders and stakeholders for joining us on this call. I'd want to thank once again the opportunity for all 10,000 ResMedians, many of whom of you are also shareholders. So, thank you for that. Thank you also for your dedication, hard work, helping people breathe, sleep, and live better lives in over 140 countries. You delivered these numbers. Thank you for all that you do. And I'll hand back to you, Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Mick and thanks everyone for joining us. We appreciate your interest and your time. And as always, if you have any additional questions or need to follow-up, please don't hesitate to reach out directly. This does conclude ResMed's second quarter 2023 conference call. Kevin, I'll turn it back to you to close things out.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Rob Douglas",
            "content": "Yes, Matt, thanks for question. There's lots of factors in that gross margin and you're asking specifically about productivity and productivity improvements. We've done a whole lot of work around volume improvements and really driving volume and all of our discussions with suppliers have been increasing volume and reliability of delivery. Our normal settings in normal world is we have a long-term outlook volume commitment and we're looking at optimization and pricing improvements and things like that. Those activities have pretty well been on hold while we've been doing these -- this sort of real scramble that drive volumes. Freights a similar situation, although we are seeing freights probably going to improve faster than some of these other costs that were in there. But totally in terms of our supply chain culture, we absolutely will be aiming to go back to our continuous improvement situation where we have a really strong volume leverage gain. We continue to drive the volumes in a systematic way and we use that to drive productivity and drive cost out of the system. Yes, Mike. We're pretty excited about this. It's a long-term project though, but as Mick said, we view this as a very large potential market, very significantly larger than some of our other respiratory care markets. And we believe that we're running tests -- we're really focusing on its complementariness with home oxygen therapy that is you'll get much better outcomes if you add this in. And we're working hard on all of the market access and evidence generation programs to do that. Now, most of those programs are buying either RCTs or real-world evidence trials. So, we're sort of in limited market release at the moment in specific markets where we're making these claims. But as that evidence evolves and we generate it and take it to the -- to payers and standard setting organizations, we see this is going to be a very strong market for us, but it is a multiyear project. The only other comment, Sean, is some of this is driven by regulatory requirements around getting approvals and validations and also, several of these markets have different components that they need. So, they're different validation and engineering projects to do it. And we just have to sequence that through our prioritization process as well. So, that's actually true with all product launches. Yes, Matt the only other thing I'd add is we sort of think of sort of market growth rate in terms of the patient lifetime journey through this condition -- terrible condition, very serious and the biggest problem is awareness. And so you start off with how do you become aware of it. Does your primary care know to refer you to a sleep specialist? Can that specialist refer you to either home or lab testing? And then do you get a referral to a provider who's got the capacity to look after you. And basically, staff capacity is even a big issue for them. And so -- and then will that provide a look after long-term and keep the ReSupply programs. And our solutions are across all of those, but there's bottlenecks in all of those parts of the patient lifetime -- patient journey, if you like. And as I say, we're providing solutions across that and incrementally driving improvements across all of those. So, that provides a really good long-term outlook for steady growth in the business, as Mick was saying. The only other thing is, David, it's been really important for us to be able to supply those two platforms. It's been a great thing for us to have sort of a double. Basically, we've got so much extra capability and capacity because we've got two platform lines designed for the market."

            "name": "Brett Sandercock",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. We had strong financial performance in Q2. Group revenue was $1.03 billion, an increase of 16%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 20%. Revenue growth reflected increased demand for our sleep products across our portfolio and ongoing increased device demand generated by our competitor's product recall. Year-on-year movements in foreign currencies, in particular, the weaker euro negatively impacted revenue by approximately $36 million this quarter. As mentioned, we closed the MEDIFOX DAN acquisition on November 21, 2022 and accordingly, we have recognized MEDIFOX DAN revenue of $10.7 million in our Q2 FY 2023 results from this date. While we continue to experience ongoing challenges in securing sufficient electronic components to meet market demand, we are now seeing a more predictable and improving supply chain environment. We expect to continue to deliver sequentially higher quarterly device revenue through the balance of fiscal year 2023. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in US, Canada, and Latin America countries increased by 26%. Sales in Europe, Asia, and other markets increased by 8% in constant currency terms. Our product segment, globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 25%, while masks and others sales increased by 13%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the US, Canada, and Latin America increased by 41% as we benefited from incremental revenue derived from the introduction of the Card-to-Cloud device and improving availability of our connected devices. Masks and other sales increased by 11%, reflecting solid ReSupply revenue. In Europe, Asia, and other markets, device sales increased by 5% in constant currency terms, reflecting the ongoing supply constraints in those markets for our connected devices. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia, and other markets increased by 14% in constant currency terms. Software-as-a-Service revenue, including revenue from our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition increased by 18% in the December quarter, driven by continued strong performance from our HME vertical. On an organic basis, SaaS revenue grew by 7% in the December quarter. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Gross margin declined by 80 basis points to 56.8% in the December quarter. The decrease is predominantly attributable to product mix shifts due to increased flow generator sales as well as unfavorable foreign currency movements, partially offset by increases in average selling prices. Moving on to operating expenses, SG&A expenses for the second quarter increased by 14%, or in constant currency terms increased by 20%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee related costs, additional expenses related to our acquisitions, and travel and entertainment expenses. SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 20.5% compared to the 20.7% we recorded in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the balance of fiscal year 2023. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 4%, or in constant currency terms, increased by 15%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.8% compared to 7% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2023. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 14%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by lower gross margin. Our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 18.3% compared to the prior year quarter rate of 15.6%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the December quarter increased by 13% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 13%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $129 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings, partially offset by higher levels of working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $27 million, depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $38 million. We recorded equity losses of $3.1 million in our income statement in the December quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $3 million per quarter through the balance of fiscal year 2023 associated with the joint venture operation. On November 21, 2022, we completed our acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN for consideration of $997 million and this was funded through a drawdown on our existing revolver credit facility. During the quarter, we recorded acquisition related expenses of $8.4 million associated with the MEDIFOX DAN acquisition. The acquisition was EPS neutral on a non-GAAP basis in Q2, and we expect the acquisition to be mildly accretive to EPS on a non-GAAP basis in the second half of FY 2023. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $253 million. At December 31, we had $1.8 billion in gross debt and $1.5 billion in net debt, reflecting the funding of our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition. At December 31, we had approximately $390 million available for drawdown under our fleet revolver facility and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Following the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, our net interest expense is expected to increase to approximately $15 million per quarter for the second half of fiscal year 2023, reflecting our increased debt position. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D and also expect to continue to fund at future tuck-in acquisitions. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy. Yes, Mick thanks. So, Steve, yes, I mean, that's -- what we're doing -- I mean -- I think Rob articulated really, at the moment, we're optimizing for delivery rather than efficiency and we got things like we're running the three platforms at the moment. So, I'm really focused on delivering devices to patients. So, that's having an impact. The big one is work through inventory or the wash-through is the freight cost. So, we're seeing some reduction in freight costs. But that's not manifested in our P&L, yet, that's one for the Q3, Q4. So, there will be some benefits that starts wash through into Q3 and Q4 that we're not seeing it that's currently still in inventory. But on the efficiency side, we're really -- we will get there, but we're optimizing on delivery for the moment. But I think as we work through the fiscal, we'll be in a much better position to drive on efficiency measures. Yes. Thanks Mick. I mean the only thing I'd add, Saul, is that we -- it was really the sleep devices or APAP devices are really strong as we got device availability that went straight into the market. So, that was really kind of driving that, which is obviously higher volume devices than, say, bi-levels, for example. So, that did definitely play a big part in that revenue growth."

            "name": "Mick Farrell",
            "content": "Thanks Amy and Kevin and thank you to all of our stakeholders for joining us today as we review results for the December quarter, our second quarter of fiscal year 2023. Our financial results reflect solid performance across our entire business, once again driven by strong sales growth in the Americas region as we were able to significantly increase both production and delivery of flow-generator devices. We're seeing ongoing high demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices worldwide and we're making steady progress, working with our suppliers to continue to increase our production to ultimately meet the needs of all customers and especially patients. Our mask sales growth was strong across the globe, reflecting a post-COVID pandemic awareness of the importance and need for respiratory hygiene and respiratory health. ReSupply programs in the US continued to drive solid, ongoing sustained market mask growth catalyzed somewhat by the end of calendar year deductible momentum in the US geography. Mask sales across Europe, Asia, and the rest of world also improved, driven by increased new patient setups as connected device supply increased. Our teams worked incredibly hard to achieve these extraordinary numbers in the face of an ongoing industry supply chain constrained market. We see the supply environment improving every week, every month, and every quarter, and our access to the specific electronic components we need has increased. We are confident in our ability to fulfill all customer demand before the end of calendar year 2023 and we expect to see steady ongoing incremental device revenue growth in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year 2023. Customer acceptance of our reengineered AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud device remained strong during the second quarter, particularly in the United States geography. As we increase the volume of fully connected AirSense 10 and fully connected AirSense 11 devices over the next few quarters, we will be able to phase out the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud device and refocus on our strategy which is based around the growth of 100% cloud connectable devices across the globe. Outside the US, we have not seen the same adoption rates of that AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud Device. However, there have been pockets of success in some geographies and we see a strong growth path going forward as we ramp up our fully connected AirSense 10 and our fully connected AirSense 11 products and as we achieve regulatory clearance of the latter platform market-by-market. To that point, we introduced our newest product, the AirSense 11 platform into the Japanese market during December and we look forward to continuing to support doctors and patients in Japan with our world leading 100% cloud connectable medical devices and our cloud-based software technology. Our number one priority across all of our markets will always be patients, doing our best to help those who need treatment for sleep apnea, COPD, respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular disease, asthma, and all those who need access to out-of-hospital health care. Our goal is to ensure that patients get the care that they need, where they need it, and when they need it. Let's now briefly review updates on ResMed's top three strategic priorities. Number one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses; number two, to design, develop and deliver market-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; number three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and especially in a patient's own home. The launch and acceptance of our AirSense 11 device platform continues to go very well. Patient feedback remains very positive and we continue to see very strong adoption of our myAir patient app. In fact, adoption rates are at more than double the adoption rate of myAir with the AirSense 10 platform at about 55% of all patients getting their data every day on their myAir app. Increasing production and delivery of the AirSense 11 platform remains a top priority for our ResMedians around the globe and we will continue to achieve better results and stronger market penetration each quarter. Earlier this month, we were able to take our AirSense 10 fully connected device off allocation in the US market. This is a very exciting development for our commercial team here in the Americas and for all of our customers. We look forward to continuing to expand the supply of fully connected AirSense 10 and fully connected AirSense 11 devices, so that supply can become unconstrained in all countries, but we will progress the throughout fiscal 2023 on this endeavor. An important aspect of our ResMed 2025 strategy is to reach hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including non-invasive ventilation, and life support ventilation, as well as newer therapeutic areas such as cloud connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions and home-based high flow therapy solutions. We are continuing to drive growth and adoption of our ventilated devices around the world and we saw good uptake of both our life support and our non-life support ventilator platforms during the quarter. There is also ongoing adoption of Propeller's monitoring system. Its digital therapeutic platform is now integrated with the two leading US electronic health record systems Epic and Cerner. This digital health integration makes it easier for doctors and healthcare workers to onboard people to the Propeller platform. It's still early days for this technology, however, combined with our investments in home based high flow therapy for treatment of COPD in the home, we see this technology combination as an important clinical addition for treating lung disease and an integral part -- an important part of our 2025 growth strategy. Turning to our Software-as-a-Service offerings for outside hospital care, our SaaS fast business grew 18% year-over-year. This extraordinary growth includes sustained high single-digit organic growth of our US-based SaaS business at around 7% and is accelerated by the addition of approximately six weeks of MEDIFOX DAN revenue as we closed that acquisition and welcome that German team into the ResMed family of SaaS solutions just over midway through the December quarter. We continue to grow with outside hospital care customers as they increase their utilization of our software and data solutions to improve and optimize business efficiencies and patient care. As the post- COVID patients census continues to improve in our facilities verticals, we are seeing pent-up demand for technology investments that continue to come to the market. Our HME SaaS business under the Brightree brand continues to grow at a very rapid pace and we welcome tech solutions for our HME customers across the US market. As I just mentioned, during the quarter, we received final regulatory approval and closed our acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, the leading provider of end-to-end software solutions for nursing homes and home health customers in Germany. We're now focused on integrating and growing this business as we accelerate SaaS innovation and SaaS growth in Germany and beyond. I've met in-person with many of the key leaders of the MEDIFOX DAN team and I can tell you, I'm excited about the cultural fit, the technology focus, the sharing and learning opportunities that they bring and we bring to our global SaaS team. This is our first investment in an outside hospital software business beyond the US market, but I can tell you, the global SaaS team is very much in sync and they have come out of the grade strongly not just in the revenue growth I just talked about, but also in the soft side, team collaboration, transparency, beyond. We look forward to updating you as we achieve key milestones in that business over the quarters and years ahead. Our team is ready to deliver. Our SaaS business is an important part of ResMed's future growth and complements the incredibly strong software and device solutions that we have in our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. One great example of the synergies between our SaaS business and our core business is the success of the Brightree ReSupply program. Brightree ReSupply automates the entire process from contacting the patient, interacting with the insurance company on coverage, and interacting directly with the patient on co-pays as well as managing the logistics and distribution process. The ultimate goal is to keep a CPAP, APAP or bilevel therapy user replenished with the suppliers that they need to enable a better and longer lasting therapy experience. We have published clinical data that show that a patient on a ReSupply program has higher adherence to therapy and we also have peer reviewed published data in CHEST showing, what's called the ALASKA study that there is a 39% reduction in mortality for patients who are adherent to CPAP versus control. These are incredible data and they lead to these synergies not just being a good revenue opportunity, but being an incredible cost-saving opportunity for the healthcare system and life-saving opportunity for the patients involved. We will continue to identify and capitalize on synergy opportunities as we move forward. We are well-positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for out-of-hospital care globally, and we have created differentiated value for customers and long term sustainable growth for our stakeholders. We are transforming out-of-hospital health care at scale, leading the market in digital health technology across our business. We now have over 13.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 19 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are liberating data to the cloud every day and unlocking value for patients, providers, physicians, payers, and entire health care systems and communities. We are leading the industry, but I see this as just the start of the digital health marathon. And I can tell you, we love the race. As the overlap between digital health and consumer tech industries continues, it is important to note that ResMed's Chief Medical Officer Dr. Carlos Nunez was recently named Chair of the Board of the Health Division of the Consumer Technology Association, or CTA, and the Health Division is the fastest growing division within CTA. The Health Division focuses on consumer-based technology-enabled health solutions to deliver better health outcomes for patients and reduce overall healthcare costs for the healthcare system. Their mission is fully aligned with our ResMed mission, and I'm delighted to see Carlos be recognized for his leadership and the sessions that he chaired at CES in Vegas a couple of weeks ago, show that ResMed's thought leadership and Carlos' thought leadership is helping to craft the future of digital health and bring it to consumers as we have done over the past decade. We're excited about the ways Carlos and CTA's Health Division can help continue to shape our industry for the future, lowering costs, and improving outcomes, and engaging consumers in their own health care. ResMed's mission and clear goal is to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025. This patient-centric mission drives and motivates ResMedians every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal over the last period. During the last 12 months, we improved over 149 million lives with delivery of a device platform to a patient, a full mask system to a patient, or a digital health software solution, helping people to sleep better, to breathe better, and to live higher quality lives with healthcare delivered right where they live, and mostly, in their own home. Before I close, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude to more than 10,000 ResMedians now for their perseverance, hard work, and dedication both today and every day. Thank you. With that I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we will move and open up for Q&A from the group. Brett over to you. Thanks for the question, Chris and it's a good one. Obviously, we're thrilled to have AirSense 10 fully connected now, unconstrained in the US geography. As you know, we operate in 140 countries worldwide. The AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud inventory, we're working our way through that and it actually is moving very quickly. I'd state it this way that we've got the number one device in the market, which is the AirSense 11 fully connected in terms of customer ratings. We also have the number two device in the market, which is the AirSense 10 fully connected. But then we have the number three device the third best device in the market, which is the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud, I believe that's better than the tier 2, 3, 4 competitors that are in the market. And so we've got the number one, two, and three device there and we're selling them and different customers want different things. And certainly, the AirSense 11 fully connected is at a price premium. But we'll start to see, I think us work through all of our inventory, the excess patient demand is still there globally. And I think we'll be there for a period of time, even after one of our competitors looks like they may come back into the market, hopefully sometime this this calendar year so that we can get our mask attachment rates on to them. But yes, Chris, we expect to work through all that AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud inventory. Good question. Got you loud and clear, Suraj. Suraj, it's a great question and how we measure the lives changed is a pretty simple formula includes the CPAPs, APAPs, bi-level devices. But it also includes full mask systems, which you know, the sort of linear growth, if you like of the devices and some slight exponential growth of the mask systems because of replenishment rates and repeat customers coming back. But it also includes patients' lives touched through digital health. So, whether it's a Brightree patient who gets access to their device or other HME equipment, whether it's a patient in COPD medicines that gets an app that reminds them to take their medicine on a Propeller, or a patient that has a life support ventilator that gets a digital health reminder to get replenishment. And so combining all those impacts on a life. And the way I look at it is a life is changed as much by a brand new device arriving in their house as it is by an app that helps them take a medicine that keeps them out-of-hospital. So, that's how we sort of look at lives change. Yes, 150 million calendar year 2023, you got it, right. I mean, you got the math, the mathematics there is the CAGR is 17.5% volume growth of the lives that we touch over the next three calendar years through 2025 and we're going to do that. We're going to get more and more patients on CPAPs, APAPs, bi-levels, more and more on ReSupply and masks systems, and then more and more on our digital health platforms. And we've got -- it's a lofty goal and it's a stretch goal, but we believe we can get there and change 250 million lives by 2025. Thanks Suraj. Great question. Yes, Matt, I'll start and then I'll hand to Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer to cover in detail. But just at the start, yes, there was a sequential decrease in gross margin. One way, Matt, I could have avoided that is tell the team don't sell all those CPAPs and APAPs, to create, right because it was great gross profit dollars to the business and was great to change a patient's life by a new device, but I could have get my GM 70, 80 basis points up by saying slow down those CPAP and APAP sales. Of course, we didn't do that. The right thing is the humanitarian aspect to get those devices that we pivoted, our supply chain reengineered and redesigned to get them to market and you saw extraordinary growth, 41% growth in our US-based device market. Now, that's not our highest gross margin, its diluted to GM percentage, but it's contributory and positive to gross profit dollars. And so it's good for patients, and it's good for our stakeholders. So, that's what we did. But Rob, yes, some a really good question -- first part of the question. Brett, do you want to have a first go of that question? I'd just pile on there that you look at Brett's guidance, nice conservative guidance is that our gross margin will be sort of steady as we go forward. I look on this and say, I think there's some upside. As we start to see mask rates start to improve, we saw 13% constant currency growth in masks during the quarter. I think, yes, as Brett said, the freight costs will wash through the inventory. And we're getting great scale from the biggest respiratory medical manufacturing plant in the planet, there in Singapore and the efficiency we've got a well above any competitor and we're doing really well on that and I think that'll come through. And then in addition to that, you'll get some upside from MEDIFOX DAN, which is accretive to revenue, gross margin, and EPS, as Brett said, throughout fiscal and beyond. So, that would be my guidance there as well, Steve. Thanks for the question. David, that's a great question. It's actually the answer. We could take the whole rest of the Q&A session to go through it because it's what we do is trying to reach out to the 936 million people in our core market that suffocate every night with sleep apnea around the world and we're laser-focused on it. As you saw, we delivered very strongly on those new patient setups 41% growth of devices in US, Canada, Latin America and we turned to positive there in Europe, Asia, and other. And what I can tell you is we're really working through that excess patient demand. Those numbers will tell you we're working faster through that excess demand in the US and getting closer to a state you get a prescription and you'll get a device in days or weeks versus it gone up to months there at the peak of the crisis. And I think if you look across the other 140 countries we sell into, every country is different. We've got to get the regulatory approval for AirSense 11 there. We've got to work our way through, but we're going step-by-step on that journey. And so as I look at this excess patient demand, I made the comment there in my prep remarks, I think we will get to all of our customers' demand before the end of this calendar year and that tells you our confidence in increased supply and our ability to meet that need, and we're laser-focused on that humanitarian emergency of patients waiting too long for therapy and we just don't want that you suffocate. This is a case of life and death; we've got the data to show that. We want your path to therapy to be expedited. And in addition to that, the final thing I'll say is that we are looking at our patient demand generation activities that have been on hold these last 18 months. And I'm looking at our models in Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Japan, Singapore, UK, and beyond where we have these omnichannel markets availability to contact consumers or sleep concern consumers directly and get them into the funnel. And here in the US, we have direct models and also our joint venture there with Verily and Primasun that we've done some really good demand gen tests and a number of cities just waiting for me to fire the starting gun for that team. And we're getting very close to firing that starting gun. So, we have a smooth flow of -- from excess patient demand to now patient demand generation to continue our growth trajectory. Yes. Look, it's a great question, Mike. And our long-term goals there in 2025, a number of those 250 million lives are going to change in 2025 will be patients with neuromuscular disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. And two of those great therapies, high flow therapy in the home, I want to be very specific, it's been used in the hospital during the pandemic. High flow therapy in the home, we see as a huge opportunity, probably 10 times the size of our ventilation market in COPD is available for home therapy, HFT therapy. And then Propeller, yes, early days and the pilots are going well. We're integrated to the payer provider EHR systems, which gives us the credibility now to go from pilots to start to scale some payer providers, particularly in the US geography. But Rob, any further details on our work on HFT and cloud connected inhalers for Mike there? Yes, Craig, thanks for the question. No, that doesn't include a whole lot of price increases. In fact, we put price increases on hold during the COVID pandemic in some of our SaaS businesses and so we probably are changing to the area of price increases as we go forward. We've gone from pandemic to endemic, so that will happen and then flow out over the coming 12, 24 months. I'm really excited. We're looking at that domestic SaaS business in the worst of COVID getting down to low single-digits. We moved to mid-single-digits. And then Bobby, who's President of that division and his team have really accelerated that organic growth to 7% -- 8% last quarter, 7% this quarter, and so that high single-digits organic growth. And actually, we see upside from that in the organic, if you think about it, Brightree, MatrixCare, and Citus Health path. So, we see opportunities to move that up. And then when you add on MEDIFOX DAN and its capabilities, I think the combined business, obviously, the next four quarters, we'll call out the inorganic part will be double-digits on the inorganic, of course. But even going forward, as we look out towards 2025, we see opportunities for high single-digit and even low double-digit growth across that combined business as we lap the acquisition. So, really good growth there. Price increases will be a part of that going forward, but they weren't historically, to answer your question directly. Yes, Sean, I hope your Sydney morning is going well day after Australia Day. Look, the way we're looking at this is we've got 140 countries. We've got a very complex supply logistics program to get the patients minimize the time from prescription to therapy across all those markets, but it's a complex equation. The good news is we are seeing supply of those rate limited semiconductors for communications. The 3G, 4G, 5G chips are starting to see supply come back. The microprocessors, the next rate limited step are starting to increase and so we're seeing our path through this. And you saw in the quarter, we were able to deliver incredibly strongly on that, and we're off allocation for the AirSense 10 100% connected. Look, I'd love to tell you, we've got a very complex jigsaw puzzle here. I'd love to tell you it will be off allocation on AirSense 11 in all of our markets. It's just not going to happen in the short-term. But as we go through this year, we'll update you as we go off allocation and it will happen market-by-market geography-by-geography. Rob, did I miss anything there? Yes, and the good news is it's not our first rodeo. We've done this launch platforms in 140 countries many times before, and we're back to our sort of meat and potatoes here. This is what we do all day every day. And going off supply chain constraints over the calendar year will be fantastic for us to be able to then just go back to what we do, which is helping people sleep better, breathe better, and live better lives outside hospital care. Thanks for the question Sean. Yes. Thanks Margaret. It's a great question and it's one we're thinking about a lot here. And we're thinking about all three prongs that you talked about. The first one, excess patient demand, how do we work through that. US, we're getting close to really working through it. We've got 140 other countries. And to Rob's point, it's a complex equation to get the supply chain and deliver in all 140, but we're working through that. Secondly, demand generation, yes, where we have omnichannel and have really established social media presences and abilities to drive demand gen, we'll be starting to turn those on country-by-country. And then thirdly, RePAPs, to your point, the last two and a half, three years of COVID crisis, pandemic crisis, competitor recall crisis, we have not turned the knob on RePAP. And in fact, we know our customers have been holding back when they're supply chain constrained on contacting patients who reach that three-year, five-year post-warranty, you're ready for a new device on insurance and/or patient making the call. So, I think all three of those are going to be applied in all 50 states here in the US and in all 140 countries worldwide. We do have scenarios and plans, I'm not going to detail them here on this call, but I can tell you that we expect to see steady growth throughout our market and we're going to drive that. And we're going to make sure that patients waiting lists are not long. We're not going to turn the needles until we're ready to get there in supply. I'm just happy we're having this conversation this quarter and it's so much better than the last eight quarters that we're talking about demand gen and driving RePAPs, because that's what we've done for 33.5 years in the business and it's what we love doing and we're going to do more of it. Yes. Thanks for the question Matt. I'll start and hand to Rob for further detail because it is a really important area for us. Look, if you think about -- our competitor has been out on the market for 18 months and who knows. They've got to -- we'll find out probably later this week, they got an earnings call, maybe they'll tell us what's happened at the consent decree and give us some timing. Frankly, give the market some time it'd be good. We've run scenarios, they come back Monday February 1, July 1, we've also run scenarios that it's January 1, 2024. And actually, in all those scenarios, ResMed grows and ResMed does really well, and ResMed does a really good job of taking care of the unmet patient need. So, if they come back earlier, come back Monday, we get a 60% plus or minus attach rate of our masks. So, we get good GM contribution, great patient care in terms of the best masks in the planet going to them, and we're able to drive that. Now, they'll be starting from 0%, new patient share, they're going to able to go and fight account-by-account. And they won't be fighting against ResMed out the gate. They'll be fighting against the Tier 2, 3, and 4 players who have come in to fill that part of the equation and they're doing an okay job. And so they have to fight against the okay players. Then they have to fight against us, the market leader. But I look forward to them coming back actually in terms of the mask side of the business, it will be really good. The scenario where it's further out, it's later this calendar year or early next calendar year or beyond. We're okay with that too because we're ramping up our supply, and we're going to get closer and closer to meet all of customer demand in this. So, frankly, it's not irrelevant, but it's not a big perturbation of our long-term strategy and our long-term business. And we've got the scenarios and the little pivots that we need to have more masks or more demand gen in the different scenarios. So, I think investors and some analysts are thinking more about this -- are worried -- more worried about this than we are because we thought so much about it and have the scenarios and the playbook ready for all three of those scenarios and 2020 beyond. I look forward to this sort of people calling a binary. I see there's a mild perturbation of the Monte Carlo sim that really doesn't change in the long-term outcomes for ResMed and our patients is not changed in any of those scenarios. But Rob, any further detail for Matt here? Thanks Mike and cheeky sneaking in two questions, but I'll answer both for sure. Card-to-Cloud, as those devices -- as those AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud devices reach their either warranty period or payer allotted period at which a patient can get another device allocated to them, which is usually in the three years or five years, normally time horizon, those patients will get the opportunity to upgrade their devices from an AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud to presumably an AirSense 11 device. And look, the first 26 years of ResMed's existence, we had, firstly, non-connected and then Card-to-Cloud pager-type technologies sort of sneaker-net. It works. It can get you there. It's not as optimal. It doesn't get that sort of patient engagement on myAir and all the abilities that we can get to that 87% adherence, but it's darn good therapy. It's the smallest, quietest, the most comfortable therapy. And with the Card-to-Cloud, our HME -- mostly sold in the US, HME customers have done this for years and the data go to the cloud, and so the doctor doesn't see much difference because the doctor is seeing all the data in AirView on Card-to-Cloud and directly connected and so actually able to drive really good care with those patients. So, it will be a bolus of patients over that sort of 12-month period. And we've had, I would say, some pretty good success in humanitarian aid really and showing that ResMed isn't just going to stick to a strategy. It's going to say, if we need to pivot tactically to take care of patients, we'll do it and we'll take care of them long-term. But there will be a bolus of patients, I think, jumping at the front of RePAP in a couple of years who want to get the latest and greatest technology and some on consumer pay markets might go quicker. The second question around gross margin. Yes, look, MEDIFOX DAN accretive to our group gross margin. I'm not going to quantify it exactly, but that's why I said you're going to see, I think, some upside to our GM as we go through the fiscal year, including MEDIFOX DAN. It's accretive to revenue, gross margin percentage, but also NOP dollars and our EPS performance over the fiscal and beyond. Thanks for the questions Mike. Yes, Saul, look, it's a great question. We don't split out our details on price. But I can give some sort of general color and maybe, Rob, Brett, maybe you want to add a little bit on for Saul to the color that we can provide. Competitive dynamics are very tight. Look, we were very open that we had a surcharge that we put the start of last year around the freight costs that were incredibly high, $12 and EUR12 across all devices and so on. We will start to actually take that away to get customer-by-customer and appropriately as we go through the year. And as we actually see -- to Rob's point earlier, as we see those freight costs come through our inventory, they don't just come in a spot change, it takes time for the COGS reduction there to come through. But in terms of that 41%, I can say it was materially improved by the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud and was able to get those devices there. But our ability, I think, also as we have started this quarter to turn AirSense 10 fully connected off-constraint, I think will continue to be a nice tailwind for our business there. But Brett, I'll hand to you for any further color we can provide to Saul to help on his modeling on this great US flow generator growth. Yes. Thanks for the question David. Yes, clearly, AirSense 10 fully connected will be unconstrained first just because that platform has been in the market for a long period of time. We've got all the inventory, all the capabilities to drive it, and it's regulatory approved in virtually every market, 140 around the world. And so it's just much easier to turn that off-constraint and get it moving first. But yes, to your point, the smaller, the quieter, the more comfortable and the most connected and most clever device is the AirSense 11. As we get regulatory approvals and we're going country-by-country on this. As we said, we just got Japan during the last quarter and we're going to go country-by-country on this, when we get regulatory approvals and as we get supply starting to improve on those components, we can really ramp that up with all its great technology and really good cost advantages and patient-friendly advantages. It's got coaching capabilities and interaction with the patient on the screen that's interactive and can do some really good over-the-air upgrades, but also over-the-air interactions with physicians and its connectivity to myAir, 55%. I mean almost vast majority of patients are being offered and almost for all them are saying, yes, I want to see my data every day and get a myAir score. So, it will go faster and less constrained in those markets where it has approval. I'm not going to predict the exact date that that will happen because we've got scenarios around that. But I think we will start to see that go off-constraints before the end of the calendar year because that's when we're going to be able to meet all the customer demand, which is our goal and with on a fast-track to do it this calendar year. Rob, what did I miss there on David's question? Yes. Thanks Dan. And clearly, you're very diligent looking at FDA and different regulatory approvals around the world. Look, what I'll say to this is that the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud was a reengineered re-pivoted device, absolutely. And the AirSense 10 fully connected, we did rejig the comms chip to get one that was less supply chain constraints. So, those two are reengineering back in the line. We didn't reengineer the AirSense 11 that's selling right now. But of course, there will be variance. This is a long-term platform. This platform, the AirSense 11 is going to do CPAP, APAP, bi-level, all sorts of amazing therapy models. If you even look at the work that we're doing on the Lumis HFT device that we talked about earlier in the Q&A and during my prep remarks, that's on a platform of the AirSense 10 and obviously, AirSense 11 will become the platform of note for us over the coming years. But we don't go into details of our future product pipeline. So, thanks for the question. But look, I can tell you, those three products in the market are number one, two, and three and as you saw this quarter, they're selling well, and we expect them to continue to. Yes, Lyanne, you're getting to some of the complexities behind that. Look, our goal is to get off the supply constraint during this calendar and we know we can get there. We won't get there if we turn on every single knob that we have for demand generation and RePAP generation around the world. And so we will be turning those dials, if you like, for demand generation and RePAP generation through our customers and directly as we get supply improving country-by-country. And so yes, I think we can get to all customer demand if we do no change faster, but our goal is to take care of not just the patients who are currently in the pipeline, but also the 80% -- 90% in many countries who are undiagnosed and untreated. And so our mission is to do that and it's aligned with altruism but also our profit motive. And the overlap of those is a really powerful tool for us to have sustainable long-term growth as we have the last 33.5 years. And so clearly, if we turn every dial to max, we wouldn't be able to get off a constraint this year. We won't turn all to max, but we will and we are starting to turn those dials and getting the programs up and running in different cities, different states, different geographies around the world as we start to get off-constraint. So, I won't go into further detail than that to say that, Lyanne, yes, you're digging in, it is more complex than just we get there. It's we get there and then we start turning on the market growth rate as the market leader, which is our sort of our duty and our obligation and we're going to do both. We're going to grow the market and grow our share and deliver for patients. Yes, Steve, thanks and thanks for coming for your second question at the end of the queue. It shows that the system works and you can get the second question in. It's a good one. Our diagnosis rate in the US, obviously, impacted the start of COVID with all the labs being shut down and then we saw that big pivot and adoption of home sleep apnea testing and some great models from ResMed and many other players in the market to help physicians find ways to remotely screen, diagnose, treat, and manage sleep apnea patients. As we come out from pandemic to endemic in the US, we've definitely seen -- I'd say, our data show that at least 50% of patients are going through home sleep apnea testing. And then of the other 50%, some of them do home sleep apnea test and then just a follow-up in a lab for titration and mask fit and so on. And so really good adoption of home sleep apnea testing. It's sort of related to our demand generation area that demand generation isn't just going out there on social media and advertising and finding that customer acquisition cost and appropriate place well under lifetime value and getting them into the channel. It's also working with the channel to understand where we have capacity, what cities, what geographies that we have. And as you know, Steve following us closely, we purchased a company called Ectosense, and their product called NightOwl. And I have one sitting on the desk right here. This thing is the size of my fingertip and it has the ability to have highly sensitive and specific screening and diagnosis of sleep apnea with reimbursement in a geography like the US, and we're actually experimenting in Asia and Latin America and around the world on this. And the technology is originally European, so hopefully, it gets adopted there, too. I love Ectosense, and I love home sleep apnea testing happening where it's small, it's quiet, it's convenient, and its cloud connected similar to our therapeutics. And yes, so I think you're going to see that diagnostic rate in the US pick up post-pandemic because people learned that telemedicine, digital health, remote screening, remote diagnostics work, and we can scale them. But it won't just be here in the US. It might be pioneered, launched here, and scaled here. but it's going to work in many other countries around the world. And I can tell you we're really excited about partnerships with the physicians and the patients themselves to find their path to better sleep and better breathing. Thanks for the question. Thanks Kevin and thank you again to all of our shareholders and stakeholders for joining us on this call. I'd want to thank once again the opportunity for all 10,000 ResMedians, many of whom of you are also shareholders. So, thank you for that. Thank you also for your dedication, hard work, helping people breathe, sleep, and live better lives in over 140 countries. You delivered these numbers. Thank you for all that you do. And I'll hand back to you, Amy."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the ResMed First Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Amy Wakeham, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Kevin. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining us. This call is being webcast live and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today, along with a copy of their earnings press release and presentation, which are both available now. Joining me on the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. Mick will provide a brief high-level overview of our financial results. He'll review progress towards our ResMed 2025 strategic goals and discuss the current state of things as we continue to navigate the ongoing macro industry and supply chain challenges. Brett will then review our financial results in more detail. And finally, we'll move into the Q&A portion of our call. During the Q&A session, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; and David Pendarvis, Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel. During our call today, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, please review the supporting schedules in today's earnings release. And as a reminder, our discussion today will include some forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future operating and financial performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our stakeholders for joining us today as we review results for the September quarter, our first quarter of fiscal year 2023. These financial results demonstrate solid performance across our entire business, driven by strong sales growth in the Americas region as well as ongoing high demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices and mask systems worldwide. Achieving these numbers hasn't been easy given supply chain constraints, but we are powering ahead focused on the long term. Of course, we see the same macroeconomic challenges that many other industries are also facing as well as an industry-specific issue of a competitor-driven supply-demand imbalance the past 18-plus months, resulting in excess demand for our products. The good news is this. Our global ResMed team demonstrates over and over again their incredible ability to pivot and to solve problems, to support customers and to meet the needs of people around the world with market-leading therapies and software solutions. We are building on the success we achieved last quarter with our reengineered AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud device. Customer acceptance has been strong, particularly in the United States region, and this has enabled us to substantially increase shipping volumes to support patient demand while we continue to fight through global supply chain challenges. It is interesting to note that outside the U.S., we are not seeing the same magnitude of adoption of the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud device as we are in the U.S. This is due to the fact that our 100% cloud connectable platforms, such as AirSense 11 and others, and our ecosystem of software solutions are so embedded into the workflows of health care systems. This is particularly evident in countries where we have partnered to develop digital health reimbursement models. Customers in countries such as France and Japan and beyond, prefer to work with the limited product flow of our 100% cloud connectable devices rather than change their workflows for Card-to-Cloud models. While this means that some patients will have longer wait times in these regions, it does show the power of our long-term digital health strategy, lowering labor costs, improving efficiency and improving patient outcomes are just too hard to switch from. Nevertheless, on a global basis, the redesign and launch of the Card-to-Cloud device have greatly improved our ability to get closer to meeting the incredible demand in the market. AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud provided meaningful growth for the quarter. And far more importantly, it meant that patients could get access to a world-leading ResMed device to treat their sleep apnea. Clearly, launching this platform to address the spiking demand was and is the right decision. Our number one priority will always be patients, doing our best to help those who need treatment for sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular disease, obesity, hypoventilation syndrome, asthma and all those who need access to our out-of-hospital health care systems. Our goal is to ensure that patients get the care that they need, where they need it and when they need it. We continue partnering with our global supply chain to increase access to the critical components that are needed to accelerate production of our medical devices. Last month, I had the opportunity to fly to Sydney and meet many of our supplier partners in person for the first time in 3 years at our Star Supplier event in Sydney. Star is an annual celebration of our partnership with top suppliers. The event was also an opportunity to bring the ResMed story to life for our critical suppliers focusing on the life-saving importance of what we do every day. We showed our suppliers that increased component allocation for ResMed ultimately benefits patients, providers, physicians and all of our stakeholders worldwide. Supplier feedback from the Star event was overwhelmingly positive and many attendees commented how the event helped them to better understand our strong patient focus here at ResMed as well as our commitment to product quality and the patient-driven need for them to increase supply to ResMed. As a consequence of these partnerships, our suppliers are responding positively, and I can share this, we expect steady increase in ResMed's device production each quarter throughout this fiscal year and beyond. Let me now review updates on ResMed's top 3 strategic priorities: number one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses; number two, to design, develop and deliver market-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and number three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and especially in the home. The launch and acceptance of our next-generation device platform called AirSense 11 continues to go very well. Patient feedback remains very positive, and we continue to see very strong adoption of our myAir patient app. In fact, more than -- it's more than doubled the adoption rate of myAir with the AirSense 10 platform, with over 60% of all patients downloading and using the app on AirSense 11. We know that patient engagement in their therapy through myAir is an incredibly important part of the therapy process and the ongoing compliance ecosystem due to our clinical publications in the area. Published real-world evidence data show that we achieved 87% adherence rates when our full tech stack is used, including both myAir and AirView. Clearly, increasing production of the AirSense 11 platform remains a top priority for ResMed, and we are doing that every quarter. Additionally, we look forward to continuing to expand AirSense 11 into additional countries as we progress throughout fiscal year 2023 and as we continue to gain regulatory approvals country by country. A key part of our ResMed 2025 strategy is to reach hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation as well as newer therapeutic areas such as cloud-connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions as well as high flow therapy offerings. During the quarter, our ResMed team presented data at the European Respiratory Society Congress that the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD is much higher than previously estimated. The epidemiology data presented at ERS showed that over 480 million people worldwide have COPD. This is 100 million more than previously published data. As the global population continues to grow and age, we estimate that over 590 million people will have COPD by 2050. This represents a 23% relative increase in global COPD numbers from the baseline of 2020. Combined with the estimated 330 million people worldwide that suffer from asthma, these prevalence figures highlight the importance of treating these chronic conditions with our respiratory care solutions. Turning to our Software-as-a-Service business for outside hospital care, our SaaS business achieved another quarter of high single-digit growth year-on-year. The continued trend to move to lower cost and lower acuity locations for care is driving strong growth of home-based care. This is providing tailwinds for our home medical equipment and our home health software platforms provided under our Brightree brand. We continue to grow with our home care customers as they increase their utilization of our software and data solutions to improve and optimize their own business efficiencies as well as patient care, including specifically our Snap resupply offering. Census growth in skilled nursing as well as hospice is still challenged by post-COVID patient flow recovery as well as labor shortages. One of our most innovative solutions in this space under our MatrixCare brand has been technology solutions to improve staffing efficiency, improving both staff hiring and management. As post-COVID patient census continues to improve and pent-up demand for technology investments continues to come to the market, we expect to see even more growth opportunities to sell our services and solutions to new and existing skilled nursing and hospice customers. Last quarter, I discussed our agreement to acquire MediFoxDarn, the leading provider of end-to-end software solutions for nursing homes and home health customers in Germany. We are on track to close this acquisition before the end of the calendar year. This current quarter, we're in December 2022. And we remain excited about our opportunity to accelerate SaaS innovation and SaaS growth in Germany. This is our first investment in a pure-play SaaS business outside the U.S., and we look forward to updating you as we achieve key milestones in that business over the year ahead. Our integration team is primed and ready. I'm excited about the future of our SaaS business. It's an important part of ResMed's growth and complements the incredible software and device solutions we have in our core sleep and respiratory care businesses. We see a lot of opportunities to innovate in lower-cost, lower-acuity settings of care. We believe this is the future of health care delivery, and ResMed is the right strategic home for these growth businesses. We are well positioned as the leading strategic provider of SaaS solutions for out-of-hospital care, and we have created differentiated value for our customers and long-term sustainable growth for our stakeholders. Bringing it all together, we are transforming out-of-hospital health care at scale, leading the market in digital health technology. We now have over 12.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 18.5 million cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are liberating these data to the cloud, and we're unlocking value for patients, for providers, for physicians, for payers and for entire health care systems. Our mission and goal to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025, drives and motivates me and ResMedians every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal over this last period. During the last 12 months, we improved over 144 million lives with our device platforms, our full mask systems and our software solutions in digital health. We're helping people sleep better, helping people breathe better and helping people live higher quality and happier lives with care delivered right where they live. So before I hand over the call to Brett fee's remarks, I want to once again express my gratitude to more than 8,600 ResMedians for their perseverance, their hard work and their dedication today and every day. Thank you. With that, I will hand the call over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks, and then we will open up to Q&A with Brett, me and again. Brett, over to you.\nBrett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. We had strong financial performance in Q1 despite the headwinds we faced as a result of significant ongoing supply chain constraints. Group revenue for the September quarter was $950 million, an increase of 5%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 9%. Revenue growth reflected increased demand for our sleep products across our portfolio and ongoing device demand generated by our competitors' product recall. Year-on-year movements in foreign currencies, in particular, a weaker euro, negatively impacted revenue by approximately $36 million this quarter. While we continue to experience ongoing challenges in securing sufficient production components to meet market demand, we are now seeing a more predictable supply chain environment. This gives us confidence around our expectation of increasing device production in fiscal year '23 relative to fiscal year '22. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries increased by 18%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets decreased by 6% in constant currency terms. By product segment, globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 9%, while masks and other sales increased by 8%. Breaking it down by regional areas. Device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 23%, as we benefited from incremental revenue derived from the introduction of our Card-to-Cloud device. Masks and other sales increased by 11%, reflecting solid resupply revenue achieved despite the challenging device supply environment, which continues to limit new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales decreased by 10% in constant currency terms, mainly as a result of the ongoing challenges in securing sufficient production components for connected devices and lower sales of higher acuity devices relative to the strong sales we experienced in the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 3% in constant currency terms. Software-as-a-Service revenue increased by 9% in the September quarter. We saw particularly strong performance from the HME vertical as customers continue to utilize our SaaS solutions to streamline and more efficiently run their businesses. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Gross margin increased by 40 basis points to 57.6% in the September quarter. The increase is predominantly attributable to increases in average selling prices, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and foreign currency movements. Moving on to operating expenses. SG&A expenses for the first quarter increased by 10% or in constant currency terms increased by 16%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related costs and a post-COVID normalization of travel and entertainment expenses. SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 20.4% compared to the 19.5% we recorded in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for fiscal year '23. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 5% or in constant currency terms, increased by 9%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.6%, consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for fiscal year '23. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 4%, underpinned by strong revenue growth and improvement in gross margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 19.8% compared to the prior year quarter rate of 20%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year '23 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the quarter was $222 million, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.51, both consistent with the same period in the prior year. Note year-on-year movements in foreign currencies negatively impacted earnings per share by approximately $0.07 this quarter. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $45 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings offset by higher levels of working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $29 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $36 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends to shareholders totaling $64 million. We recorded equity losses of $2 million in our income statement in the September quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. We expect to record equity losses in the range of $3 million to $5 million per quarter through the balance of fiscal year '23 associated with the joint venture operation. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $207 million. At September 30, we had $795 million in gross debt and $588 million in net debt. Our debt levels remain modest. At September 30, we had approximately $1.4 billion available for drawdown under our revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share. As reported last quarter, we expect to close on the MedifoxDarn acquisition by the end of the calendar year pending regulatory clearances. Additionally, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D and also expect to further deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Brett. Kevin, I'd like to call you back on to the call and turn it over to you to provide the instructions and run the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden. Your line is now live. \nSteve Wheen: Just looking at working capital, this one for Brett. We saw the levels of inventory continue to increase. Just wondering how you're going to think about managing Card-to-Cloud inventory levels at a time or as your supply chain starts to free up a little bit more to allow you to make more AirSense 11. Just trying to work out whether there's any risk around inventory obsolescence as you try and transition back towards your latest platform?\nBrett Sandercock: Yes. Steve, I think at the moment, the market is very much characterized by really excess demand. So we're still trying to meet that, and I think that's going to be with us for a while. So we're building inventory really looking at that kind of future production that we're looking to manufacture. And then we'll manage -- we've introduced Card-to-Cloud, been very successful, particularly in the U.S. market. So that's part of our portfolio. It's important. But we certainly have the plans where I think we can manage that transition between Card-to-Cloud and connected devices as we get more of those components in. So I think it will be kind of a managed plan that will move from manufacturing the Card-to-Cloud to more connected devices as the electronic components come in. But we've got -- we have plans in place to do that and make that transition.\nMick Farrell: If I could, Steve, just to add that inventory build that we've had is really a deliberate outcome of our strategy around managing the supply constraints where we've had to really build up the materials components inventories for everything so that we could build the maximum when we break through the bottlenecks on the specific components. And then as the supply chain situation improves into the future, we'll be able to wind back from that.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Your line is now live.\nMatt Mishan: Just a follow-up on the mask growth. I think you said at one point in the call, that mask growth is still being affected by the lower patient setups. I mean with Card-to-Cloud, was that an OUS comment, a global comment or is that still an issue with the U.S. where we're still below the patient setup?\nMick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Matt. I mean if you look at the mask growth numbers in the quarter, we saw 11% growth in U.S., Canada and Latin America. So really strong double-digit growth there and 3% in Europe, Asia and Rest of World with a total global growth of 8%. 2019, we talked about market growth being mid-single digits for devices and high single digits for masks. So we're right there at 8% total growth. But I actually think we could be higher than that if we -- we're taking care of every new patient that's out there. As we said and as I said in the prep remarks, with our competitor out of the market these last 12, 15 months, at least can be 18 months, maybe 24 months out of the market in total. They were the number two player. And we are the number one player, and we're taking as much of the number two excess demand as we can. But we're not getting all of it. Still, even with Card-to-Cloud in the quarter, we weren't getting to every patient that needed a device. And so that delta is what we're talking about, that mask growth could have been even higher. But to your point, because Card-to-Cloud acceptance was so much better in the U.S., we did get better mask growth there. We saw 11% growth in the quarter and very strong. Yes, Card-to-Cloud, as I said in the prep remarks, not being taken up in countries where the whole reimbursement model has changed around digital health and cloud-connected devices such as France and Japan. And it's just structurally difficult, and they don't want to switch from the great efficiencies and outcomes that we get with our 100% cloud connectable systems. So that's sort of the nuance around that. What it talks to is an opportunity to continue to grow our device business, but to even further increase our mask growth, not only in the US, but also in Europe, Asia and Rest of World. Thanks for the question, Matt.\nOperator: Next question today is coming from Gretel Janu from Credit Suisse.\nGretel Janu: So how are you allocating your iron here between U.S. and rest of world, given that the U.S. is adopting the Card-to-Cloud. So are you giving greater levels to rest of world relative to what you historically have the mix between the 2 regions?\nMick Farrell: Yes, Gretel, it's a great question. It's a very complex one. And we've actually established during the COVID crisis on ventilators, we established a global epidemiology model, a humanitarian-based epidemiology model where we really looked at the flow of the virus around the world and where we should allocate limited supply of ventilators for that. And I think we did a really good job in that crisis of 2020. We applied those same skills really these last 12, 15 months of having a global team looking at the 140 countries we operate in, looking on a humanitarian basis, as the needs for people who are suffocating now in our core market, suffocating with sleep apnea and other -- on the AirSense 10 platform, we do have other respiratory care and respiratory insufficiency capabilities as well and the AirSense 10 connected devices on bio levels. So we have a global model. We look at allocations based on the demand on patients and the need to get them there. It's a complex and moving dynamic equation. The latest moving apart in it is that AirSense Card-to-Cloud has been coming out the gate incredibly strongly in the June quarter. We talked about 90 days ago and here in the September quarter, and we expect that to continue. That may mean increasing some AirSense 11 allocation to places like France or Japan, where they aren't seeing the same adoption due to the changes there. So it's an ongoing dynamic thing that we look at daily, weekly, monthly in our production, shipping and delivery schedules. So it's not a simple equation. But yes, the impetus of your question was would we look to the humanitarian need and do our best to make sure that device gets to a patient fairly, and that's exactly what we're trying to do on a global basis. It's not simple. It's quite complex, but we're working at it every day. And the team is doing an incredible job, as you saw in these great growth numbers. Thanks for the question, Gretel.\nOperator: Next question today is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey.\nSaul Hadassin: Mick, we've seen a lot of data breaches in the last few weeks, including in the health care space. And on the basis of how much data you guys have access to, just wondering if this is caused you to have a look again about data accessibility and risks associated with potential data hacks and just what your thoughts is on -- thoughts are on the strength of protection that you have. How do you actually protect against something that is happening in the future?\nMick Farrell: Yes. So, it's a great question. And obviously, cybersecurity is something we think about all day and every day, and our Chief Information Security Officer and his team are what I would call productively paranoid about the 12.5 billion nights of data and the 18.5 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices out there in 140 countries. And I did see the news in Australia of a number of health care system hacks. And we've had them here in the U.S. as well, United had one and a number of local health care systems have as well as some infrastructure areas. Look, it's a case of productive paranoia. You have to be investing in this space. You have to be looking at what happened doing root cause analysis of the hacks that have happened. In almost every case, it's been a human, a person clicking on something and giving allocation. And so we're looking very carefully at our training and holding back systems from -- and fixing systems where there are weak links and making sure that all day, every day, you're looking at this because, yes, people are out there. Initially, hackers went to consumer tech and fintech industries. As you said, health care is on their radar. We're probably third on the radar, but we're definitely there. And it's something that we think about and we invest a lot in our cybersecurity protections. But it's an ongoing game of investments and making sure that we stay at or ahead of the curve and how we work with our partners in the health care system to make sure that the data we look at privacy as well as cybersecurity and interoperability. Those 3 have to all be balanced, but cybersecurity is right there as one of our core competencies right now, and we invest a lot in that area. Thanks for the question, Saul.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST Marquee.\nDan Hurren: Look, I just want to ask about seafreight method. You previously talked about some degree of inventory builds that may shift away from airfreight and had to seafreight. And we've seen other mass participants already do that to sell the group want to ask where you are on that transition and what sort of impact it has on margins.\nMick Farrell: Brett, do you want to have a go on that?\nBrett Sandercock: Yes. Sure. Yes. Dan, Yes. I mean we've moved -- we were almost exclusive are. We've moved some to sea freight. And so that's happening. It's probably -- it's progressive and probably measured because we still want to get inventory to our DCs and then obviously on patients. So we're just trying to balance that. But we have started progressing that to sea freight. So that's happening. Again, we're probably seeing -- we're seeing a little bit of relief or moderation in those kind of freight rates that are coming through. It will take a little bit of time for that to wash through for us. But I still think in the second half, we'll start to see some benefit from some kind of overall freight costs coming down relative to last year.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Mike Matson from Needham.\nMike Matson: Yes. I guess just on the international side of the business was quite a bit weaker than the North American side. And I think you commented on the Card-to-Cloud not seeing as much uptake, but I just wanted to see if that was really the primary issue there. Was there anything else going on? Any kind of economic challenges in any of the OUS markets?\nMick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Mike. And really, truly, the major component is getting Card-to-Cloud in those areas. If Card-to-Cloud had the same adoption in Europe, Middle East, Africa and Rest of World as it did within the U.S., Canada, we would be seeing significantly higher device growth numbers. And so that's -- it's item number one on how we can address that. And actually, in countries where there's no reimbursement models and others, we are pushing towards those Card-to-Cloud as well as increasing, as I said earlier, to Gretel's question, the flow of AirSense 11. One other thing that Brett did note in his prepared remarks was that this quarter a year ago, Europe saw very high sales of ventilators. Some of that was in the COVID space and in the response to some recalls from a competitor space around ventilators in Europe where ventilators, respiratory care is a larger portion of our European business than it is in the U.S. And so that was in the comp on the other side. So those are the 2 main factors that were there. Card-to-Cloud adoption and year-on-year with regard to our noninvasive ventilation, life support ventilation and whole respiratory care business, if you like, in Europe was just a bigger portion of the business there. But thanks for the question, Mike.\nOperator: Next question is coming from David Bailey from Macquarie.\nDavid Bailey: Yes. But you sort of mentioned some of the constraints to set up from component shortages in a competitor recall. Just interested in your thoughts on that patient backlog. If you've got any estimates as to how many patients do you think could be waiting for a device, how long it will take to work through? And what that might mean for industry growth relative to that mid-single-digit number you sort of talked to previously.\nMick Farrell: Well, look, I'll have a go at that first, David. Thanks for the question. Brett, please and Rob and Dave power on. Look, there's excess demand that's out there with your number two player in a highly competitive market being out of the market for 15 months now, and they say they may be back in January, but I'm not optimistic that they'll actually be back given all the issues that are there for them. And so we look at that and say, let's do as much as we can towards this. We know we are not getting there. When we know the size of the market, we know the total flow of patients. We know what our number one share was, how it's grown, and we're taking care of all of that. We know what their number two share was and how that's grown, and we know we're taking a high double-digit percentage of that, but not all of it. We're not at 100% of it. And so we know there's that gap to fill, which is excess demand. Yes, it does build up to a pipeline -- a great pipeline of patients that are out there. But on the downside, it's tough for those patients because wait times go from days and weeks to weeks and months and from months to quarters in some regions. And so that's why we are and have pivoted for this redesign and reengineered AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud. It's why we are redesigning parts and pieces within our AirSense 11 and our AirSense 10 connected devices. And we're ramping up all 3 of those. So if you put it together, we have the number one product in the market, the best product, which is the AirSense 11. We then have the number two best product, which is the AirSense 10 fully connected. And we have the number three best device, which is the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud. And we're selling all three and ramping up all the throughout our Sydney, our Singapore, Atlanta and European distribution centers. And so we're doing the best we can. It'd be very difficult. I mean we do have a lot of quantification on it, competitive reasons, I don't want to go out to exactly what we're looking at. But the timing of how we feel it is dependent upon how fast we get the components and parts and pieces into our Singapore plant and beyond. And those every day, they get better. I said in the prep remarks, that every quarter this year, we're going to make more and more of the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud, we're going to make more and more of the AirSense 11. You've seen that. We delivered in June. We delivered in September. We will deliver again in December. We'll deliver again in March '23. We'll deliver again in June '23. And so every quarter, we'll give you the update on it. But I almost don't want to quantify it on a time basis because we know what it is on a device basis, I want the time to get shorter and shorter as ResMed accelerates faster and faster towards getting that excess demand and making sure our supply can get us close to meeting it. And then when we meet it, we can then get back to a balanced inventory situation.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Matt Taylor from Jeffries.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Zack on for Matt. I was just curious if you could give some color on supply chain improvement on a quarter-over-quarter basis? And any color on how you can reach full capacity over the next couple of quarters.\nMick Farrell: Rob, do you want to have a go at that?\nRob Douglas: Sure. Thanks, Zach. Yes, Mick was talking before around the quarter-on-quarter, and we're talking device volumes there. And you heard Brett's earlier comment saying we're sort of seeing a stabilizing view of the supply chain. And what had happened in the past was that you think you had a plan, but then these decommits had come through. Now we're definitely seeing a big reduction in the rate of decommits. They're not fully gone. And so there is that sort of still some uncertainty in exactly which products we can deliver on what day because some of the commits can come at -- come out. Other things that are going to help us going forward is that the engineering projects that Mick talked about, including validating new component -- new communications modules. And recall, we're in an environment of the economy and consumer products. It looks like the demand, the excess demand of phones and those types of devices is moderating a bit. The excess demand that autos were creating isn't moderating as far as we can see, and that's still very significant. And in fact, the technologies that we use are more likely to be the types of things in autos than in phone. So there is still some sort of industry pressure on the chip components, but as our engineering projects develop and we get more options validated, we have more likelihood of increasing that volume. And so what we're saying is we're actually producing a huge amount more devices now than we were, say, before the pandemic or even before the competitive recall happened. And our plans, if we can follow it, you can see in our inventories, we've got the parts for it. If we get the final parts in, we'll absolutely keep driving these volumes. And there's risk to the upside. We haven't completely eliminated risk to the downside but we're pretty confident that we're in good shape.\nOperator: Next question today is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America.\nLyanne Harrison: Just following on the question about how long your competitor might be out of the market. Is that gets delayed or pushed out up to 24 months. Do you think ResMed will be -- have enough production volume as we think about third quarter fiscal and fourth quarter fiscal, enough volume to meet the gap that Phillips has left? And then also, last quarter, you also spoke about some of your demand generation initiatives. Are you at a point now in terms of your visibility on production that you're implementing some of those demand generation initiatives?\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Lyanne. It's a really good question with sort of 2 elements to it. One, that's difficult for me to determine because it requires knowledge of the US government from FDA and DOJ and a consent degree with a competitor that I'm not involved in those conversations. I see what we all see publicly out there. And so how long our competitor will be out, we don't know. But we run scenarios on that, right, but they'll come back in January, they come back in July, they'll come back later than that in 2023. And as I look at that, I think about our ability and what we can do in every quarter, we're going to increase production of AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud, AirSense 10 coms, AirSense 11 cons. And so if I track those lines up and move them up, there are scenarios where we can get to the full industry demand in calendar year 2023. A lot of things have to come together for that to happen. And there's a lot of scenarios, as Rob said, around parts and pieces coming in and on the other side. But we're doing everything we can to get closer and closer to that. So yes, we can strive towards it, and we're going to move towards it. And we want no patient left behind. We want anyone who suffocates and gets a prescription to have a short wait time no matter what country they're in to a ResMed device and we're doing everything we can to keep up with that excess demand. It will be there for the next 3, 6, 9, 12 months. But as you start to look through 2023, I think, yes, potentially the supply and demand curves could cross over for us and the other players in the industry as well. So how long -- there's a number of scenarios around that, as I discussed. Second part of your question, demand gen initiatives. Yes, we have some really exciting demand gen initiatives from our Asia, Latin America team, the work that we're doing in China and in India and Brazil. These huge population markets to look at different methods of getting to patients and ensuring that care is delivered across socioeconomic bounds and there's health equity and the delivery of our products in these high-growth markets or some really exciting things Justin Leon and his team are driving in our Asia, Latin America demand gen initiatives. And then here in the U.S. market, we've got some really exciting work in our joint venture with Verily called Primasun. I just ran into the CEO of Primasun there at the med tech conference this week in Boston. And there's some really exciting milestones that we'll be looking at throughout calendar year 2023 to drive demand gen to identify, engage and enroll patients. Actually, sleep concern consumers to a pathway to become patients. And so those will start to roll out during the year. In addition, our Western European and Northern European teams and our teams across the world have really exciting programs that, frankly, we've been experimenting and piloting on during the COVID crisis, the embracement of digital health, the embracement of respiratory health, the embracement of care delivered outside the home during the COVID crisis. And actually, during our competitive recall crisis, I think we've seen an ability for us to partner even more closely with our partners in the channel physicians and providers are willing to experiment even more. So I do expect us to turn on a number of these demand gen initiatives throughout calendar year 2023 as we start to get supply up to where demand is and then can drive core demand of the market back again through that demand gen. So great question, Lyanne, and thanks for that.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Craig Wong-Pan from RBC.\nCraig Wong-Pan: Sorry about that. The -- I think there's been some changes with some of the expectations for cost loans like R&D, I think, is now let 6% to 7% of sales versus previously 7% to 8%. And then the Primasun joint ventures, the losses have increased as well. Could you just talk about what's led to those shifts in expectations?\nBrett Sandercock: Yes, sure. I'll talk to...\nMick Farrell: Brett, I think that's a great question for you.\nBrett Sandercock: Yes. Thanks. Yes. On the R&D, it's just uptick slightly lower. But a lot of that has to do with the weaker Australian dollar. As you know, we've got a decent amount of R&D undertaken here in Australia. So it kind of reflects the lower currency there, Craig. It's not -- it doesn't -- will still be have the same number of more people in R&D and working on that. But obviously, the translation impact is going to be felt as we forecast forward. So that's on the R&D side of things. And your other question?\nCraig Wong-Pan: The Primasun joint venture has increased...\nBrett Sandercock: Sort of Mick mentioned that some of the milestones, some of the activities that you're undertaking. So they will look to invest or fund more of those demand gen activities as they kind of move into a more commercializing phase. So that's going to uptick, I think, over the next few quarters. Our share of those costs essentially. So that's why I guided that to be a little bit higher over the next several quarters.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs.\nChris Cooper: Can I ask one on the outlook for pricing? We heard some pockets of feedback late in the quarter that at least one of your competitors is beginning to price more aggressively on masks. Are you seeing that feed through yet? If you do sort of begin to see a more competitive price environment, how would you envisage responding to that?\nMick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for your question, Chris. And certainly, pricing is a big topic always in our industry over these last 12 months as inflation around the world has moved from low-single digits to mid-single digits to high-single digits in almost every country we're in, that we've started to respond to that. And as shipping costs have gone up, we've started to respond to that. As you know, at the start of this calendar year, we instituted some surcharges on products in the U.S. and on Europe for those extra costs that were associated with shipping. And then we have, as appropriate, working with customers and within the health care systems increased prices on specific parts and pieces where the costs for us have gone up. And so therefore, we're sharing some of that burden of increased costs with our channel. In terms of -- while appreciating your channel check in the conversation with a customer or 2, I -- we are not seeing across the board major changes in ASPs on either the device or the mask side. It's interesting to note that with our really strong growth of masks, they're 11% in the quarter in U.S., Canada and Latin America. That's in a market where there's no recall from anybody. That's just the standard competitive market, and ResMed is out there fighting for it even with the lower flow of new patients, as we talked about earlier, due to the fact that not every patient who needs a new setup is getting it even though the vast majority of those sales are repeat sales to customers already in our installed base of amazing people being treated every day by ResMed masks. So not a huge sort of impact on pricing right now. If anything, prices are stable to slightly up on devices, and I would say stable in the mask side sort of in line with where they have been. And so no major changes there. Obviously, we watch that. It's a dynamic approach, but we don't focus on price, we focus on value. We talk about how the first time fit with ResMed is where it's at and how the adherence rates are where they are and the mask league is much lower. And customers know that and they track that. And we give them data in our view in myAir and give them all analytics to know how well our masks are doing compared to the competitors. And that's why the doctors prescribe our masks and it's why the HMEs and home care providers around the world choose our masks. So we compete on value, not price. And we look forward to increase competition and increase growth in both the device and mask side. We love a competitive market, and we tend to win in it.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer.\nSuraj Kalia: Perfect. So Mick, you mentioned about taking most of the excess demand share. Maybe if I could ask my question a little differently, Mick. So let's say we use three buckets. Patients either remain on Phillips, patients switched to ResMed or the third bucket that patients are left to find on their own, right? Let's just assume these 3 buckets. How would the pie charts of existing patients versus new patients coming into the funnel look like? Just trying to understand at a very simplistic level, where are we in the share transfer and what is happening to these patients?\nMick Farrell: Yes. Thanks, Suraj. And I appreciate the angle you're coming out on it. Let me give you my thoughts on it and address your question from this angle. So I'll put it. I'll say there's 2 buckets. There's new patients and then there's patients getting what we call recap or a device that's 5 to 7 years old, let's say, it's out of warranty maybe, 3 to 5 years and they want to upgrade. And then there's a third bucket of patients who are part of the competitive recall. So the first bucket, which is new patients. Yes, look, there's ResMed and a bunch of small share players competing all day, every day for those new patients and incredible excess demand and every product we make, we can sell into that space. And we are doing very well and taking a lot of share, as you see in the numbers. 23% growth in devices in U.S., Canada, Latin America, 9% growth worldwide in that category of devices. So doing incredibly well in that new patient's bucket. If you look at the existing patients that are looking to retap, right, after three, five or seven years on therapy, I think some home care providers and HMEs in Europe and rest of the world won't be contacting those patients right now. They know the situation. They don't want to get somebody into the channel where the wait times are long. And so I think there's some opportunity for even further excess demand in that second bucket of existing patients looking to retap that haven't been turned on. It's another type of demand gen to Lyanne's question earlier that our channel probably is not turning on much and keeping that dial very low, except for those patients who come and say, \"Look, I really need an upgrade, then they put them in the queue. That's the second bucket. The third bucket is the 5.5 million patients who are on a competitive device from the recall that was announced June a year ago. Our competitor, that's their duty and they are working through those. They're not there. They say they're maybe 3 million into the 5 million. I'm skeptical of that. I think they're talking about production numbers versus delivered numbers. As I look to the channels and speaking to people about how many of the devices that they've asked for have actually been received for as part of that recall. So that third bucket is tough. And so what does the patient do there? Do they just wait? Or do they go get a prescription and try to go spat.com or easybreathe.com or some other retail channel in a different market and try to come in and drive some excess demand that way. It's very hard to determine all of that. We do have some numbers around it. But that third bucket is really the duty of our competitor to take care of, and they're working their way through it. And it looks like it's 18 months through to December. If they get there by June next year, that's 24 months. I'd hope that they are at least there then and can come back. Again, as I said earlier, with the scenarios, we're looking at all sorts of scenarios. I want them back. I love the competitive game. I love beating them in the game of who's got the smallest quite most comfortable and most cloud-connected device that lowers costs and improves outcomes. And we were doing that in 2019. Actually, from the launch of AirSense 10 in 2014 to 2019 for 5 strong years, and I look forward to continuing to do that afterwards. But that's how I'd look at it. Three buckets, new patients are doing incredibly well. Repap, not really turning that dial right now, probably turn it on as we get demand gen. And the third one, yes, we will be getting some of that. We're not fighting for that because that's not where we want to play. That's a competitor's duty to take care of them. And we're focused for the long run. And the 1 billion people worldwide is suffocate who haven't yet been brought into the channel. That's the real opportunity. Thanks for the question, Suraj.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair.\nMargaret Kaczor: This is Maggie on for Margaret. I wanted to ask on the mass growth specifically and just trying to get a better picture of the resupply trend. So obviously, I can appreciate the amount of new patients coming on service. But maybe if you can kind of talk about the resupply trends and what you're seeing and what we can kind of expect for the remainder of the fiscal year.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Maggie. Look, it's a really good question around resupply. And as you know, looking at our SaaS business through Brightree resupply and Snap resupply, we have some really good models in our SaaS business that's truly the synergy between our SaaS business and our core sleep and Respiratory Care business. And we've got the back-end synergies around cyber securities we talked to earlier, cloud ops and interoperability, but the front-end synergies there around driving resupply have been really strong and Brightree resupply and Snap resupplier are a good part of driving that resupply revenue. Yes. Look, you saw 11% growth, right, in U.S., Canada and Latin America in those resupply. And the U.S. is primarily the market for that where there are very sophisticated models and a very strong incentive for both the patient, the provider and ResMed and actually the payer with the return that they get by reduced hospitalizations to ensure that patients continue to get new masks. Those systems are not quite as evolved or implemented within Europe, Middle East, Africa and Rest of World and so -- and Asia Pac. We do have models, particularly where we're working directly with providers and/or patients to drive resupply models and those are working well. But look, there's a -- I would say there's a lot of opportunity to drive resupply in Europe, middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific. And if you look at Catherine Pucknat, and our team in Germany and what she's doing to engage with patients, you look at just in Lyon and what he's doing across Asia and Latin America to engage directly with patients and show them the path to get a fresh, clean new mask on a regular basis and become part of a subscription program for that. There's a lot of innovation to come. So look, I'm proud of the 8% growth in a tough environment with new patients coming in. I want that to get higher. And I certainly want Europe, Asia and Rest of World to go from low to mid- to high single digits again. And we will get there as that resupply and the new patient flow, both come to market. So a lot of moving pieces there, Maggie. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Mathieu Chevrier from Citi.\nMathieu Chevrier: Just a longer-term question. How do you see home testing and the Primasun JV impacting the longer-term growth rate of the industry?\nMick Farrell: Yes. Look, it's a great question. home sleep apnea testing is now just part of the game. I think what happened during COVID is we were all forced to do telehealth, digital health and to embrace that across the 140 countries that we are in. And we've seen increased adoption rates of home sleep testing across the world. It's just really exciting. Look, if you look at France and Germany, France, it always adopted home sleep testing and very, very good rates of that. Germany really hadn't pre-COVID now has and the physicians have seen it the home care providers have seen it, and we're vertically integrating that market. So we're really driving the adoption if you look at Northern and Western Europe of home sleep testing. And I do think when and if -- I don't know when we get our supply up to where demand is, we can start to turn on those home sleep testing demand gen opportunities because, as I said earlier, 1 billion people suffocating worldwide. We've got less than 20% on treatment in the U.S., less than 10%, 15% in Europe and less than 5% in Asia, less than 1% in some of the high population countries. And so home sleep testing is a really interesting path for that. There were some really interesting sort of viral videos. Our India team is doing a great job. They've actually got an Indian rap star to talk about home sleep testing. We saw a huge spike in the response rate and people going through that. It's really interesting with relatively low cost. These pilots and experiments we're doing with not old schooled media buying a Super Bowl ad or buying an add on Champions League, European football. We're going down to social media levels and using, I would say, very strong interesting experiments around social media marketing to drive demand gen for home sleep testing. And if you ask a person, would they prefer to be tested for sleep apnea in their home or in a hospital, 80% of people say in the home. 20% really should always go to a hospital. They have a comorbidity, history of stroke, history of heart attack, COPD, some other comorbidity or some other sleep disorder. And there are 100 other sleep disorders other than sleep apnea. They're rare, but they're there. So we're going to ramp up home sleep testing in the U.S. with our Verily joint venture, but we're also going to do it directly with all of our home care partners across the U.S. and in the other 140 countries we do business in. So thanks a lot for the question. And I think that will be our last question. We're just running straight up. And one more question, maybe. Amy, what do you think?\nOperator: Our final question today is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden.\nSteve Wheen: A little squeaking another one. I just wonder in response to the consent decree that Philips is in the process of negotiating. They've obviously done a very large impairment to the Respironics business. Do you have any sort of thoughts as to what they might be needing to contemplate as part of that, whether it impacts innovation, whether it impacts their ability to manufacture just if you had any high-level thoughts as to what you think that decree could look like?\nMick Farrell: That's a great question. I'll give some thoughts on hand to Dave Pendarvis, who's not only our Chief Administrative Officer, but also a lawyer and maybe we'll understand that. Look, you have to wait until these things come out. We haven't seen a public discussion of what the consent decree looks like. They're negotiating it now. So when that comes out, we'll look at it. What has been public is a number of responses on that 483 and really specifically talking about culture changes, management changes and a focus on quality. The reengineering and recultural training that, that type of change requires a lot of work. And I would think people will have to move from development and R&D back to what I would call quality remediation and quality systems improvement. So there will be some sort of quality debt, if you like, that would be needed to pay back if you just read through the public information on that 483. But Dave, what are your thoughts and perspective on this?\nDavid Pendarvis: Yes, I think you've got it right, Mick. The -- there's a broad range of where this thing could land from sort of a watch and report on the one hand to almost closing down operations on the other end. And without being in the mix of either talking to the agency or talking to the company, which we can't do either one on this particular topic. It's hard to know where they're going to land in between there. But as Mick said, if you look at the public statements, which is both the 483 and also their proposal to take control of the recall, you can see the issues that the agency is concerned about. And so what they're going to want to do is get assurance that those issues are not going to put patients at risk in the future. You've got to have systems in place not only for the products that are issued now but for other products that may be out there on the market or be brought to the market in the future. So except for the agency, obviously, it's a consent decree for a reason. It means that there is an agreement between the parties as to what those parameters will be. And until they announce it, it's really tough to speculate on what the exact details will be. And as I said, there's a pretty broad range. Thanks.\nOperator: We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further closing comments.\nMick Farrell: Well, thanks, Kevin, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us on this call. I'd like to once again take the opportunity to thank the 8,600 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders for their dedication and hard work, helping people breathe better, sleep better and live better lives in residential medicine in over 140 countries worldwide. Thanks for all that you do. I look forward to talking with you all right here in 90 days. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Rob Douglas",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Zach. Yes, Mick was talking before around the quarter-on-quarter, and we're talking device volumes there. And you heard Brett's earlier comment saying we're sort of seeing a stabilizing view of the supply chain. And what had happened in the past was that you think you had a plan, but then these decommits had come through. Now we're definitely seeing a big reduction in the rate of decommits. They're not fully gone. And so there is that sort of still some uncertainty in exactly which products we can deliver on what day because some of the commits can come at -- come out. Other things that are going to help us going forward is that the engineering projects that Mick talked about, including validating new component -- new communications modules. And recall, we're in an environment of the economy and consumer products. It looks like the demand, the excess demand of phones and those types of devices is moderating a bit. The excess demand that autos were creating isn't moderating as far as we can see, and that's still very significant. And in fact, the technologies that we use are more likely to be the types of things in autos than in phone. So there is still some sort of industry pressure on the chip components, but as our engineering projects develop and we get more options validated, we have more likelihood of increasing that volume. And so what we're saying is we're actually producing a huge amount more devices now than we were, say, before the pandemic or even before the competitive recall happened. And our plans, if we can follow it, you can see in our inventories, we've got the parts for it. If we get the final parts in, we'll absolutely keep driving these volumes. And there's risk to the upside. We haven't completely eliminated risk to the downside but we're pretty confident that we're in good shape."

            "name": "Brett Sandercock",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. We had strong financial performance in Q1 despite the headwinds we faced as a result of significant ongoing supply chain constraints. Group revenue for the September quarter was $950 million, an increase of 5%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 9%. Revenue growth reflected increased demand for our sleep products across our portfolio and ongoing device demand generated by our competitors' product recall. Year-on-year movements in foreign currencies, in particular, a weaker euro, negatively impacted revenue by approximately $36 million this quarter. While we continue to experience ongoing challenges in securing sufficient production components to meet market demand, we are now seeing a more predictable supply chain environment. This gives us confidence around our expectation of increasing device production in fiscal year '23 relative to fiscal year '22. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries increased by 18%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets decreased by 6% in constant currency terms. By product segment, globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 9%, while masks and other sales increased by 8%. Breaking it down by regional areas. Device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 23%, as we benefited from incremental revenue derived from the introduction of our Card-to-Cloud device. Masks and other sales increased by 11%, reflecting solid resupply revenue achieved despite the challenging device supply environment, which continues to limit new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales decreased by 10% in constant currency terms, mainly as a result of the ongoing challenges in securing sufficient production components for connected devices and lower sales of higher acuity devices relative to the strong sales we experienced in the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 3% in constant currency terms. Software-as-a-Service revenue increased by 9% in the September quarter. We saw particularly strong performance from the HME vertical as customers continue to utilize our SaaS solutions to streamline and more efficiently run their businesses. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Gross margin increased by 40 basis points to 57.6% in the September quarter. The increase is predominantly attributable to increases in average selling prices, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and foreign currency movements. Moving on to operating expenses. SG&A expenses for the first quarter increased by 10% or in constant currency terms increased by 16%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related costs and a post-COVID normalization of travel and entertainment expenses. SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 20.4% compared to the 19.5% we recorded in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for fiscal year '23. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 5% or in constant currency terms, increased by 9%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.6%, consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for fiscal year '23. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 4%, underpinned by strong revenue growth and improvement in gross margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 19.8% compared to the prior year quarter rate of 20%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year '23 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the quarter was $222 million, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.51, both consistent with the same period in the prior year. Note year-on-year movements in foreign currencies negatively impacted earnings per share by approximately $0.07 this quarter. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $45 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings offset by higher levels of working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $29 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $36 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends to shareholders totaling $64 million. We recorded equity losses of $2 million in our income statement in the September quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. We expect to record equity losses in the range of $3 million to $5 million per quarter through the balance of fiscal year '23 associated with the joint venture operation. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $207 million. At September 30, we had $795 million in gross debt and $588 million in net debt. Our debt levels remain modest. At September 30, we had approximately $1.4 billion available for drawdown under our revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share. As reported last quarter, we expect to close on the MedifoxDarn acquisition by the end of the calendar year pending regulatory clearances. Additionally, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D and also expect to further deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. Yes. Steve, I think at the moment, the market is very much characterized by really excess demand. So we're still trying to meet that, and I think that's going to be with us for a while. So we're building inventory really looking at that kind of future production that we're looking to manufacture. And then we'll manage -- we've introduced Card-to-Cloud, been very successful, particularly in the U.S. market. So that's part of our portfolio. It's important. But we certainly have the plans where I think we can manage that transition between Card-to-Cloud and connected devices as we get more of those components in. So I think it will be kind of a managed plan that will move from manufacturing the Card-to-Cloud to more connected devices as the electronic components come in. But we've got -- we have plans in place to do that and make that transition. Yes. Sure. Yes. Dan, Yes. I mean we've moved -- we were almost exclusive are. We've moved some to sea freight. And so that's happening. It's probably -- it's progressive and probably measured because we still want to get inventory to our DCs and then obviously on patients. So we're just trying to balance that. But we have started progressing that to sea freight. So that's happening. Again, we're probably seeing -- we're seeing a little bit of relief or moderation in those kind of freight rates that are coming through. It will take a little bit of time for that to wash through for us. But I still think in the second half, we'll start to see some benefit from some kind of overall freight costs coming down relative to last year. Yes, sure. I'll talk to... Yes. Thanks. Yes. On the R&D, it's just uptick slightly lower. But a lot of that has to do with the weaker Australian dollar. As you know, we've got a decent amount of R&D undertaken here in Australia. So it kind of reflects the lower currency there, Craig. It's not -- it doesn't -- will still be have the same number of more people in R&D and working on that. But obviously, the translation impact is going to be felt as we forecast forward. So that's on the R&D side of things. And your other question? Sort of Mick mentioned that some of the milestones, some of the activities that you're undertaking. So they will look to invest or fund more of those demand gen activities as they kind of move into a more commercializing phase. So that's going to uptick, I think, over the next few quarters. Our share of those costs essentially. So that's why I guided that to be a little bit higher over the next several quarters."

            "name": "Mick Farrell",
            "content": "Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our stakeholders for joining us today as we review results for the September quarter, our first quarter of fiscal year 2023. These financial results demonstrate solid performance across our entire business, driven by strong sales growth in the Americas region as well as ongoing high demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices and mask systems worldwide. Achieving these numbers hasn't been easy given supply chain constraints, but we are powering ahead focused on the long term. Of course, we see the same macroeconomic challenges that many other industries are also facing as well as an industry-specific issue of a competitor-driven supply-demand imbalance the past 18-plus months, resulting in excess demand for our products. The good news is this. Our global ResMed team demonstrates over and over again their incredible ability to pivot and to solve problems, to support customers and to meet the needs of people around the world with market-leading therapies and software solutions. We are building on the success we achieved last quarter with our reengineered AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud device. Customer acceptance has been strong, particularly in the United States region, and this has enabled us to substantially increase shipping volumes to support patient demand while we continue to fight through global supply chain challenges. It is interesting to note that outside the U.S., we are not seeing the same magnitude of adoption of the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud device as we are in the U.S. This is due to the fact that our 100% cloud connectable platforms, such as AirSense 11 and others, and our ecosystem of software solutions are so embedded into the workflows of health care systems. This is particularly evident in countries where we have partnered to develop digital health reimbursement models. Customers in countries such as France and Japan and beyond, prefer to work with the limited product flow of our 100% cloud connectable devices rather than change their workflows for Card-to-Cloud models. While this means that some patients will have longer wait times in these regions, it does show the power of our long-term digital health strategy, lowering labor costs, improving efficiency and improving patient outcomes are just too hard to switch from. Nevertheless, on a global basis, the redesign and launch of the Card-to-Cloud device have greatly improved our ability to get closer to meeting the incredible demand in the market. AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud provided meaningful growth for the quarter. And far more importantly, it meant that patients could get access to a world-leading ResMed device to treat their sleep apnea. Clearly, launching this platform to address the spiking demand was and is the right decision. Our number one priority will always be patients, doing our best to help those who need treatment for sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular disease, obesity, hypoventilation syndrome, asthma and all those who need access to our out-of-hospital health care systems. Our goal is to ensure that patients get the care that they need, where they need it and when they need it. We continue partnering with our global supply chain to increase access to the critical components that are needed to accelerate production of our medical devices. Last month, I had the opportunity to fly to Sydney and meet many of our supplier partners in person for the first time in 3 years at our Star Supplier event in Sydney. Star is an annual celebration of our partnership with top suppliers. The event was also an opportunity to bring the ResMed story to life for our critical suppliers focusing on the life-saving importance of what we do every day. We showed our suppliers that increased component allocation for ResMed ultimately benefits patients, providers, physicians and all of our stakeholders worldwide. Supplier feedback from the Star event was overwhelmingly positive and many attendees commented how the event helped them to better understand our strong patient focus here at ResMed as well as our commitment to product quality and the patient-driven need for them to increase supply to ResMed. As a consequence of these partnerships, our suppliers are responding positively, and I can share this, we expect steady increase in ResMed's device production each quarter throughout this fiscal year and beyond. Let me now review updates on ResMed's top 3 strategic priorities: number one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses; number two, to design, develop and deliver market-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and number three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and especially in the home. The launch and acceptance of our next-generation device platform called AirSense 11 continues to go very well. Patient feedback remains very positive, and we continue to see very strong adoption of our myAir patient app. In fact, more than -- it's more than doubled the adoption rate of myAir with the AirSense 10 platform, with over 60% of all patients downloading and using the app on AirSense 11. We know that patient engagement in their therapy through myAir is an incredibly important part of the therapy process and the ongoing compliance ecosystem due to our clinical publications in the area. Published real-world evidence data show that we achieved 87% adherence rates when our full tech stack is used, including both myAir and AirView. Clearly, increasing production of the AirSense 11 platform remains a top priority for ResMed, and we are doing that every quarter. Additionally, we look forward to continuing to expand AirSense 11 into additional countries as we progress throughout fiscal year 2023 and as we continue to gain regulatory approvals country by country. A key part of our ResMed 2025 strategy is to reach hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation as well as newer therapeutic areas such as cloud-connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions as well as high flow therapy offerings. During the quarter, our ResMed team presented data at the European Respiratory Society Congress that the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD is much higher than previously estimated. The epidemiology data presented at ERS showed that over 480 million people worldwide have COPD. This is 100 million more than previously published data. As the global population continues to grow and age, we estimate that over 590 million people will have COPD by 2050. This represents a 23% relative increase in global COPD numbers from the baseline of 2020. Combined with the estimated 330 million people worldwide that suffer from asthma, these prevalence figures highlight the importance of treating these chronic conditions with our respiratory care solutions. Turning to our Software-as-a-Service business for outside hospital care, our SaaS business achieved another quarter of high single-digit growth year-on-year. The continued trend to move to lower cost and lower acuity locations for care is driving strong growth of home-based care. This is providing tailwinds for our home medical equipment and our home health software platforms provided under our Brightree brand. We continue to grow with our home care customers as they increase their utilization of our software and data solutions to improve and optimize their own business efficiencies as well as patient care, including specifically our Snap resupply offering. Census growth in skilled nursing as well as hospice is still challenged by post-COVID patient flow recovery as well as labor shortages. One of our most innovative solutions in this space under our MatrixCare brand has been technology solutions to improve staffing efficiency, improving both staff hiring and management. As post-COVID patient census continues to improve and pent-up demand for technology investments continues to come to the market, we expect to see even more growth opportunities to sell our services and solutions to new and existing skilled nursing and hospice customers. Last quarter, I discussed our agreement to acquire MediFoxDarn, the leading provider of end-to-end software solutions for nursing homes and home health customers in Germany. We are on track to close this acquisition before the end of the calendar year. This current quarter, we're in December 2022. And we remain excited about our opportunity to accelerate SaaS innovation and SaaS growth in Germany. This is our first investment in a pure-play SaaS business outside the U.S., and we look forward to updating you as we achieve key milestones in that business over the year ahead. Our integration team is primed and ready. I'm excited about the future of our SaaS business. It's an important part of ResMed's growth and complements the incredible software and device solutions we have in our core sleep and respiratory care businesses. We see a lot of opportunities to innovate in lower-cost, lower-acuity settings of care. We believe this is the future of health care delivery, and ResMed is the right strategic home for these growth businesses. We are well positioned as the leading strategic provider of SaaS solutions for out-of-hospital care, and we have created differentiated value for our customers and long-term sustainable growth for our stakeholders. Bringing it all together, we are transforming out-of-hospital health care at scale, leading the market in digital health technology. We now have over 12.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 18.5 million cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are liberating these data to the cloud, and we're unlocking value for patients, for providers, for physicians, for payers and for entire health care systems. Our mission and goal to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025, drives and motivates me and ResMedians every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal over this last period. During the last 12 months, we improved over 144 million lives with our device platforms, our full mask systems and our software solutions in digital health. We're helping people sleep better, helping people breathe better and helping people live higher quality and happier lives with care delivered right where they live. So before I hand over the call to Brett fee's remarks, I want to once again express my gratitude to more than 8,600 ResMedians for their perseverance, their hard work and their dedication today and every day. Thank you. With that, I will hand the call over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks, and then we will open up to Q&A with Brett, me and again. Brett, over to you. If I could, Steve, just to add that inventory build that we've had is really a deliberate outcome of our strategy around managing the supply constraints where we've had to really build up the materials components inventories for everything so that we could build the maximum when we break through the bottlenecks on the specific components. And then as the supply chain situation improves into the future, we'll be able to wind back from that. Yes. Thanks for the question, Matt. I mean if you look at the mask growth numbers in the quarter, we saw 11% growth in U.S., Canada and Latin America. So really strong double-digit growth there and 3% in Europe, Asia and Rest of World with a total global growth of 8%. 2019, we talked about market growth being mid-single digits for devices and high single digits for masks. So we're right there at 8% total growth. But I actually think we could be higher than that if we -- we're taking care of every new patient that's out there. As we said and as I said in the prep remarks, with our competitor out of the market these last 12, 15 months, at least can be 18 months, maybe 24 months out of the market in total. They were the number two player. And we are the number one player, and we're taking as much of the number two excess demand as we can. But we're not getting all of it. Still, even with Card-to-Cloud in the quarter, we weren't getting to every patient that needed a device. And so that delta is what we're talking about, that mask growth could have been even higher. But to your point, because Card-to-Cloud acceptance was so much better in the U.S., we did get better mask growth there. We saw 11% growth in the quarter and very strong. Yes, Card-to-Cloud, as I said in the prep remarks, not being taken up in countries where the whole reimbursement model has changed around digital health and cloud-connected devices such as France and Japan. And it's just structurally difficult, and they don't want to switch from the great efficiencies and outcomes that we get with our 100% cloud connectable systems. So that's sort of the nuance around that. What it talks to is an opportunity to continue to grow our device business, but to even further increase our mask growth, not only in the US, but also in Europe, Asia and Rest of World. Thanks for the question, Matt. Yes, Gretel, it's a great question. It's a very complex one. And we've actually established during the COVID crisis on ventilators, we established a global epidemiology model, a humanitarian-based epidemiology model where we really looked at the flow of the virus around the world and where we should allocate limited supply of ventilators for that. And I think we did a really good job in that crisis of 2020. We applied those same skills really these last 12, 15 months of having a global team looking at the 140 countries we operate in, looking on a humanitarian basis, as the needs for people who are suffocating now in our core market, suffocating with sleep apnea and other -- on the AirSense 10 platform, we do have other respiratory care and respiratory insufficiency capabilities as well and the AirSense 10 connected devices on bio levels. So we have a global model. We look at allocations based on the demand on patients and the need to get them there. It's a complex and moving dynamic equation. The latest moving apart in it is that AirSense Card-to-Cloud has been coming out the gate incredibly strongly in the June quarter. We talked about 90 days ago and here in the September quarter, and we expect that to continue. That may mean increasing some AirSense 11 allocation to places like France or Japan, where they aren't seeing the same adoption due to the changes there. So it's an ongoing dynamic thing that we look at daily, weekly, monthly in our production, shipping and delivery schedules. So it's not a simple equation. But yes, the impetus of your question was would we look to the humanitarian need and do our best to make sure that device gets to a patient fairly, and that's exactly what we're trying to do on a global basis. It's not simple. It's quite complex, but we're working at it every day. And the team is doing an incredible job, as you saw in these great growth numbers. Thanks for the question, Gretel. Yes. So, it's a great question. And obviously, cybersecurity is something we think about all day and every day, and our Chief Information Security Officer and his team are what I would call productively paranoid about the 12.5 billion nights of data and the 18.5 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices out there in 140 countries. And I did see the news in Australia of a number of health care system hacks. And we've had them here in the U.S. as well, United had one and a number of local health care systems have as well as some infrastructure areas. Look, it's a case of productive paranoia. You have to be investing in this space. You have to be looking at what happened doing root cause analysis of the hacks that have happened. In almost every case, it's been a human, a person clicking on something and giving allocation. And so we're looking very carefully at our training and holding back systems from -- and fixing systems where there are weak links and making sure that all day, every day, you're looking at this because, yes, people are out there. Initially, hackers went to consumer tech and fintech industries. As you said, health care is on their radar. We're probably third on the radar, but we're definitely there. And it's something that we think about and we invest a lot in our cybersecurity protections. But it's an ongoing game of investments and making sure that we stay at or ahead of the curve and how we work with our partners in the health care system to make sure that the data we look at privacy as well as cybersecurity and interoperability. Those 3 have to all be balanced, but cybersecurity is right there as one of our core competencies right now, and we invest a lot in that area. Thanks for the question, Saul. Brett, do you want to have a go on that? Yes. Thanks for the question, Mike. And really, truly, the major component is getting Card-to-Cloud in those areas. If Card-to-Cloud had the same adoption in Europe, Middle East, Africa and Rest of World as it did within the U.S., Canada, we would be seeing significantly higher device growth numbers. And so that's -- it's item number one on how we can address that. And actually, in countries where there's no reimbursement models and others, we are pushing towards those Card-to-Cloud as well as increasing, as I said earlier, to Gretel's question, the flow of AirSense 11. One other thing that Brett did note in his prepared remarks was that this quarter a year ago, Europe saw very high sales of ventilators. Some of that was in the COVID space and in the response to some recalls from a competitor space around ventilators in Europe where ventilators, respiratory care is a larger portion of our European business than it is in the U.S. And so that was in the comp on the other side. So those are the 2 main factors that were there. Card-to-Cloud adoption and year-on-year with regard to our noninvasive ventilation, life support ventilation and whole respiratory care business, if you like, in Europe was just a bigger portion of the business there. But thanks for the question, Mike. Well, look, I'll have a go at that first, David. Thanks for the question. Brett, please and Rob and Dave power on. Look, there's excess demand that's out there with your number two player in a highly competitive market being out of the market for 15 months now, and they say they may be back in January, but I'm not optimistic that they'll actually be back given all the issues that are there for them. And so we look at that and say, let's do as much as we can towards this. We know we are not getting there. When we know the size of the market, we know the total flow of patients. We know what our number one share was, how it's grown, and we're taking care of all of that. We know what their number two share was and how that's grown, and we know we're taking a high double-digit percentage of that, but not all of it. We're not at 100% of it. And so we know there's that gap to fill, which is excess demand. Yes, it does build up to a pipeline -- a great pipeline of patients that are out there. But on the downside, it's tough for those patients because wait times go from days and weeks to weeks and months and from months to quarters in some regions. And so that's why we are and have pivoted for this redesign and reengineered AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud. It's why we are redesigning parts and pieces within our AirSense 11 and our AirSense 10 connected devices. And we're ramping up all 3 of those. So if you put it together, we have the number one product in the market, the best product, which is the AirSense 11. We then have the number two best product, which is the AirSense 10 fully connected. And we have the number three best device, which is the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud. And we're selling all three and ramping up all the throughout our Sydney, our Singapore, Atlanta and European distribution centers. And so we're doing the best we can. It'd be very difficult. I mean we do have a lot of quantification on it, competitive reasons, I don't want to go out to exactly what we're looking at. But the timing of how we feel it is dependent upon how fast we get the components and parts and pieces into our Singapore plant and beyond. And those every day, they get better. I said in the prep remarks, that every quarter this year, we're going to make more and more of the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud, we're going to make more and more of the AirSense 11. You've seen that. We delivered in June. We delivered in September. We will deliver again in December. We'll deliver again in March '23. We'll deliver again in June '23. And so every quarter, we'll give you the update on it. But I almost don't want to quantify it on a time basis because we know what it is on a device basis, I want the time to get shorter and shorter as ResMed accelerates faster and faster towards getting that excess demand and making sure our supply can get us close to meeting it. And then when we meet it, we can then get back to a balanced inventory situation. Rob, do you want to have a go at that? Thanks, Lyanne. It's a really good question with sort of 2 elements to it. One, that's difficult for me to determine because it requires knowledge of the US government from FDA and DOJ and a consent degree with a competitor that I'm not involved in those conversations. I see what we all see publicly out there. And so how long our competitor will be out, we don't know. But we run scenarios on that, right, but they'll come back in January, they come back in July, they'll come back later than that in 2023. And as I look at that, I think about our ability and what we can do in every quarter, we're going to increase production of AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud, AirSense 10 coms, AirSense 11 cons. And so if I track those lines up and move them up, there are scenarios where we can get to the full industry demand in calendar year 2023. A lot of things have to come together for that to happen. And there's a lot of scenarios, as Rob said, around parts and pieces coming in and on the other side. But we're doing everything we can to get closer and closer to that. So yes, we can strive towards it, and we're going to move towards it. And we want no patient left behind. We want anyone who suffocates and gets a prescription to have a short wait time no matter what country they're in to a ResMed device and we're doing everything we can to keep up with that excess demand. It will be there for the next 3, 6, 9, 12 months. But as you start to look through 2023, I think, yes, potentially the supply and demand curves could cross over for us and the other players in the industry as well. So how long -- there's a number of scenarios around that, as I discussed. Second part of your question, demand gen initiatives. Yes, we have some really exciting demand gen initiatives from our Asia, Latin America team, the work that we're doing in China and in India and Brazil. These huge population markets to look at different methods of getting to patients and ensuring that care is delivered across socioeconomic bounds and there's health equity and the delivery of our products in these high-growth markets or some really exciting things Justin Leon and his team are driving in our Asia, Latin America demand gen initiatives. And then here in the U.S. market, we've got some really exciting work in our joint venture with Verily called Primasun. I just ran into the CEO of Primasun there at the med tech conference this week in Boston. And there's some really exciting milestones that we'll be looking at throughout calendar year 2023 to drive demand gen to identify, engage and enroll patients. Actually, sleep concern consumers to a pathway to become patients. And so those will start to roll out during the year. In addition, our Western European and Northern European teams and our teams across the world have really exciting programs that, frankly, we've been experimenting and piloting on during the COVID crisis, the embracement of digital health, the embracement of respiratory health, the embracement of care delivered outside the home during the COVID crisis. And actually, during our competitive recall crisis, I think we've seen an ability for us to partner even more closely with our partners in the channel physicians and providers are willing to experiment even more. So I do expect us to turn on a number of these demand gen initiatives throughout calendar year 2023 as we start to get supply up to where demand is and then can drive core demand of the market back again through that demand gen. So great question, Lyanne, and thanks for that. Brett, I think that's a great question for you. Yes. Thanks for your question, Chris. And certainly, pricing is a big topic always in our industry over these last 12 months as inflation around the world has moved from low-single digits to mid-single digits to high-single digits in almost every country we're in, that we've started to respond to that. And as shipping costs have gone up, we've started to respond to that. As you know, at the start of this calendar year, we instituted some surcharges on products in the U.S. and on Europe for those extra costs that were associated with shipping. And then we have, as appropriate, working with customers and within the health care systems increased prices on specific parts and pieces where the costs for us have gone up. And so therefore, we're sharing some of that burden of increased costs with our channel. In terms of -- while appreciating your channel check in the conversation with a customer or 2, I -- we are not seeing across the board major changes in ASPs on either the device or the mask side. It's interesting to note that with our really strong growth of masks, they're 11% in the quarter in U.S., Canada and Latin America. That's in a market where there's no recall from anybody. That's just the standard competitive market, and ResMed is out there fighting for it even with the lower flow of new patients, as we talked about earlier, due to the fact that not every patient who needs a new setup is getting it even though the vast majority of those sales are repeat sales to customers already in our installed base of amazing people being treated every day by ResMed masks. So not a huge sort of impact on pricing right now. If anything, prices are stable to slightly up on devices, and I would say stable in the mask side sort of in line with where they have been. And so no major changes there. Obviously, we watch that. It's a dynamic approach, but we don't focus on price, we focus on value. We talk about how the first time fit with ResMed is where it's at and how the adherence rates are where they are and the mask league is much lower. And customers know that and they track that. And we give them data in our view in myAir and give them all analytics to know how well our masks are doing compared to the competitors. And that's why the doctors prescribe our masks and it's why the HMEs and home care providers around the world choose our masks. So we compete on value, not price. And we look forward to increase competition and increase growth in both the device and mask side. We love a competitive market, and we tend to win in it. Yes. Thanks, Suraj. And I appreciate the angle you're coming out on it. Let me give you my thoughts on it and address your question from this angle. So I'll put it. I'll say there's 2 buckets. There's new patients and then there's patients getting what we call recap or a device that's 5 to 7 years old, let's say, it's out of warranty maybe, 3 to 5 years and they want to upgrade. And then there's a third bucket of patients who are part of the competitive recall. So the first bucket, which is new patients. Yes, look, there's ResMed and a bunch of small share players competing all day, every day for those new patients and incredible excess demand and every product we make, we can sell into that space. And we are doing very well and taking a lot of share, as you see in the numbers. 23% growth in devices in U.S., Canada, Latin America, 9% growth worldwide in that category of devices. So doing incredibly well in that new patient's bucket. If you look at the existing patients that are looking to retap, right, after three, five or seven years on therapy, I think some home care providers and HMEs in Europe and rest of the world won't be contacting those patients right now. They know the situation. They don't want to get somebody into the channel where the wait times are long. And so I think there's some opportunity for even further excess demand in that second bucket of existing patients looking to retap that haven't been turned on. It's another type of demand gen to Lyanne's question earlier that our channel probably is not turning on much and keeping that dial very low, except for those patients who come and say, \"Look, I really need an upgrade, then they put them in the queue. That's the second bucket. The third bucket is the 5.5 million patients who are on a competitive device from the recall that was announced June a year ago. Our competitor, that's their duty and they are working through those. They're not there. They say they're maybe 3 million into the 5 million. I'm skeptical of that. I think they're talking about production numbers versus delivered numbers. As I look to the channels and speaking to people about how many of the devices that they've asked for have actually been received for as part of that recall. So that third bucket is tough. And so what does the patient do there? Do they just wait? Or do they go get a prescription and try to go spat.com or easybreathe.com or some other retail channel in a different market and try to come in and drive some excess demand that way. It's very hard to determine all of that. We do have some numbers around it. But that third bucket is really the duty of our competitor to take care of, and they're working their way through it. And it looks like it's 18 months through to December. If they get there by June next year, that's 24 months. I'd hope that they are at least there then and can come back. Again, as I said earlier, with the scenarios, we're looking at all sorts of scenarios. I want them back. I love the competitive game. I love beating them in the game of who's got the smallest quite most comfortable and most cloud-connected device that lowers costs and improves outcomes. And we were doing that in 2019. Actually, from the launch of AirSense 10 in 2014 to 2019 for 5 strong years, and I look forward to continuing to do that afterwards. But that's how I'd look at it. Three buckets, new patients are doing incredibly well. Repap, not really turning that dial right now, probably turn it on as we get demand gen. And the third one, yes, we will be getting some of that. We're not fighting for that because that's not where we want to play. That's a competitor's duty to take care of them. And we're focused for the long run. And the 1 billion people worldwide is suffocate who haven't yet been brought into the channel. That's the real opportunity. Thanks for the question, Suraj. Thanks, Maggie. Look, it's a really good question around resupply. And as you know, looking at our SaaS business through Brightree resupply and Snap resupply, we have some really good models in our SaaS business that's truly the synergy between our SaaS business and our core sleep and Respiratory Care business. And we've got the back-end synergies around cyber securities we talked to earlier, cloud ops and interoperability, but the front-end synergies there around driving resupply have been really strong and Brightree resupply and Snap resupplier are a good part of driving that resupply revenue. Yes. Look, you saw 11% growth, right, in U.S., Canada and Latin America in those resupply. And the U.S. is primarily the market for that where there are very sophisticated models and a very strong incentive for both the patient, the provider and ResMed and actually the payer with the return that they get by reduced hospitalizations to ensure that patients continue to get new masks. Those systems are not quite as evolved or implemented within Europe, Middle East, Africa and Rest of World and so -- and Asia Pac. We do have models, particularly where we're working directly with providers and/or patients to drive resupply models and those are working well. But look, there's a -- I would say there's a lot of opportunity to drive resupply in Europe, middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific. And if you look at Catherine Pucknat, and our team in Germany and what she's doing to engage with patients, you look at just in Lyon and what he's doing across Asia and Latin America to engage directly with patients and show them the path to get a fresh, clean new mask on a regular basis and become part of a subscription program for that. There's a lot of innovation to come. So look, I'm proud of the 8% growth in a tough environment with new patients coming in. I want that to get higher. And I certainly want Europe, Asia and Rest of World to go from low to mid- to high single digits again. And we will get there as that resupply and the new patient flow, both come to market. So a lot of moving pieces there, Maggie. Thanks for the question. Yes. Look, it's a great question. home sleep apnea testing is now just part of the game. I think what happened during COVID is we were all forced to do telehealth, digital health and to embrace that across the 140 countries that we are in. And we've seen increased adoption rates of home sleep testing across the world. It's just really exciting. Look, if you look at France and Germany, France, it always adopted home sleep testing and very, very good rates of that. Germany really hadn't pre-COVID now has and the physicians have seen it the home care providers have seen it, and we're vertically integrating that market. So we're really driving the adoption if you look at Northern and Western Europe of home sleep testing. And I do think when and if -- I don't know when we get our supply up to where demand is, we can start to turn on those home sleep testing demand gen opportunities because, as I said earlier, 1 billion people suffocating worldwide. We've got less than 20% on treatment in the U.S., less than 10%, 15% in Europe and less than 5% in Asia, less than 1% in some of the high population countries. And so home sleep testing is a really interesting path for that. There were some really interesting sort of viral videos. Our India team is doing a great job. They've actually got an Indian rap star to talk about home sleep testing. We saw a huge spike in the response rate and people going through that. It's really interesting with relatively low cost. These pilots and experiments we're doing with not old schooled media buying a Super Bowl ad or buying an add on Champions League, European football. We're going down to social media levels and using, I would say, very strong interesting experiments around social media marketing to drive demand gen for home sleep testing. And if you ask a person, would they prefer to be tested for sleep apnea in their home or in a hospital, 80% of people say in the home. 20% really should always go to a hospital. They have a comorbidity, history of stroke, history of heart attack, COPD, some other comorbidity or some other sleep disorder. And there are 100 other sleep disorders other than sleep apnea. They're rare, but they're there. So we're going to ramp up home sleep testing in the U.S. with our Verily joint venture, but we're also going to do it directly with all of our home care partners across the U.S. and in the other 140 countries we do business in. So thanks a lot for the question. And I think that will be our last question. We're just running straight up. And one more question, maybe. Amy, what do you think? That's a great question. I'll give some thoughts on hand to Dave Pendarvis, who's not only our Chief Administrative Officer, but also a lawyer and maybe we'll understand that. Look, you have to wait until these things come out. We haven't seen a public discussion of what the consent decree looks like. They're negotiating it now. So when that comes out, we'll look at it. What has been public is a number of responses on that 483 and really specifically talking about culture changes, management changes and a focus on quality. The reengineering and recultural training that, that type of change requires a lot of work. And I would think people will have to move from development and R&D back to what I would call quality remediation and quality systems improvement. So there will be some sort of quality debt, if you like, that would be needed to pay back if you just read through the public information on that 483. But Dave, what are your thoughts and perspective on this? Well, thanks, Kevin, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us on this call. I'd like to once again take the opportunity to thank the 8,600 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders for their dedication and hard work, helping people breathe better, sleep better and live better lives in residential medicine in over 140 countries worldwide. Thanks for all that you do. I look forward to talking with you all right here in 90 days. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this conference call is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Kevin. Hello everyone. Welcome to ResMed's fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings call. We are live webcasting this call and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today. Our earnings press release and presentation are both available online now. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures that we believe provide useful information for investors. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release to reconcile the non-GAAP measures with the GAAP reported numbers. In addition, our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We make these statements based on our reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results could differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Mick Farrell.\nMichael Farrell: Thanks Amy, and thank you to our shareholders for joining us as we announce results from our full fiscal year 2024 and review our fourth quarter results in more detail. Our global ResMed team executed incredibly well in our fourth quarter, producing another strong period of growth and execution across our business. With solid performance across all regions and all segments of our business and strong double-digit bottom-line growth. Ongoing new patient demand for our market leading flow generators remained robust in the quarter, even against a very tough year-over-year comparable. Media interest in sleep apnea and all the various therapies seems to be helping patients find their way to screening, diagnosis and therapy. And especially the lowest cost, most efficacious therapy with the best outcomes, which is positive airway pressure therapy. In terms of our masks and accessories, business physicians, respiratory therapists and patients are choosing ResMed masks when they start therapy and as they continue through resupply, resulting in very strong double-digit growth in our masks and accessories business. Our residential care software business delivered double-digit growth in revenue and in net operating profit. Our laser focus on operating leverage has delivered another quarter of strong, profitable growth and we're well positioned to continue on this trajectory as we launch into fiscal year 2025. Over 2.4 billion people worldwide suffer from sleep apnea, insomnia or respiratory insufficiency due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or neuromuscular disease. As the market leader in respiratory medicine and residential care globally, here at ResMed, we're uniquely positioned to drive increased market penetration through demand generation to accelerate growth. These chronic conditions in sleep health and breathing health form a global health epidemic that ResMed is well positioned to address. We believe that healthcare should be delivered in the lowest cost, lowest acuity and highest comfort location possible, in the optimal case, that's right, in a person's own home. ResMed is the clear leader in sleep apnea, a market of over 1 billion people globally. Our end markets remain significantly underpenetrated. We're leading the industry in digital health solutions, with approximately 19 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and 26 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices sold into over 140 countries worldwide. We've leveraged these de-identified data to show that our therapy solutions lower costs, improve outcomes and bend the curve of chronic disease progression. Significant opportunities remain in digital health, and we plan to be right there at the cutting edge of innovation. The latest advances in wearables from the consumer technology industry and the latest medicines from big pharmaceutical companies will bring more and more new patients into the healthcare system. We have many opportunities to add value, expanding interoperability, lowering costs and improving patient outcomes. Billions of people can benefit from our products and solutions, and we're focused on expanding our reach and growing the market to help people get on their pathway to better sleep, better breathing and better care at home. Sales of our flow generator devices, including the category leading AirSense 11 platform, grew 6% year-over-year globally. We're supporting the global market and every patient who needs a device has access to our market leading 100% cloud connectable platforms, the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11. We continue increasing the availability and production of our AirSense 11 and our AirCurve11 platforms worldwide as we secure regulatory clearances and launch these market leading technologies country by country. Our masks and accessories business grew 15% year-over-year, expanding in a competitive category globally. Our latest mask innovation, the AirFit F40, introduced last quarter, is doing extremely well in the markets that it has launched in. New patients are selecting the F40 for its comfort, fit and ease of use. It is the smallest profile oronasal mask on the market from ResMed. Patients are voting with their wallets, and respiratory therapists are voting with their setup protocols, and physicians are voting with their prescriptions. We look forward to ongoing success in the US and across global markets as we increase availability and introduce the F40 into more and more countries throughout fiscal year 2025. ResMed's clinical and commercial teams continue to partner with physicians and providers to drive resupply programs directly with their patients, and we're successfully establishing subscription programs in our cash pay countries to help consumers find their path to therapy with resupply directly. Masks and accessory resupply programs are a very important part of our offering as we serve the ongoing therapy needs of patients globally, research shows that resupply programs can both improve patient adherence and improve long-term clinical outcomes. In the US our resupply programs are powered by our digital health ecosystem, including AirView for physicians, myAir for patients and Brightree for home medical equipment providers. We will continue to develop, launch and scale these technologies and programs to help people take control of their own health, regularly refreshing their ongoing therapy needs. As the global leader in significantly underpenetrated markets, our most important opportunity is to expand and grow the market through awareness, diagnosis and seamless pathways to treatment. We aspire to be the digital health concierge for each person as they pursue their personal journey to better sleep, better breathing and better residential care. We are ramping up our demand generation initiatives to raise awareness and create pathways for patients to help them find access to care for their sleep health and their breathing health. We're serving traditional healthcare channels as well as investing in cost effective, social media driven, demand generation campaigns to help consumers who are concerned about their sleep and breathing, find ways their own personal way into appropriate screening, diagnosis, treatment and management pathways. Our physician and provider-based software ecosystem called AirView now contains over 28 million patient records. Adoption of our consumer patient engagement app, which is called myAir, where people choose to participate in their personalized sleep health journey, remains incredibly active and now includes over 8.3 million users. These digital health ecosystems are growing every quarter, showing the engagement of physicians as well as patients in accessing their own data to measure progress along their personal health journey. As we look to the future, I've discussed two global megatrends that I believe will further support ongoing growth for ResMed. Awareness of sleep health issues driven by consumer technology companies, specifically, sleep tracking wearables like the Samsung Galaxy Watch, which has a De Novo FDA clearance to screen for moderate to severe sleep apnea. And we expect similar capabilities from other wearable players in consumer tech such as the Apple Watch, Google's Fitbit, the Oura Ring, WHOOP and Garmin. In terms of the second megatrend behind future patient growth, we are seeing increased volumes of patients entering the healthcare system driven by the efforts of big pharmaceutical companies as they increase awareness of the treatments for diabetes and obesity medicines and they continue their research into the impacts of these medicines on sleep apnea. Together, we believe these two mega trends in consumer tech and big pharma will increase patient awareness and be a significant tailwind for long term growth here at ResMed, our goal is to educate people as they move from what we call sleep wellness tracking on a wearable to what we would call sleep health tracking, where they are seeking the help, advice and care of a health professional in the field of sleep medicine. This connection pathway from consumer awareness of sleep health and breathing health issues into a true healthcare pathway is what we are calling the digital health concierge opportunity. Our plan is to be there for that person as they go through the process of screening, diagnosis, treatment and ongoing management of their sleep health and their breathing health for life. Big Pharma is squarely focused on GLP-1 medications. For many people dealing with their obesity and diabetes issues, their healthcare goals are focused on losing weight while improving their diet, cardiovascular exercise and their sleep routines, something that Bill Dement called the triumvirate of health. We believe that increased utilization of GLP-1s to treat obesity will bring many new people into the healthcare funnel, activating them to see their primary care physicians as they strive to achieve and maintain weight loss. We believe this will open them up to treating other chronic diseases that they may suffer from, including increased awareness of sleep apnea, ultimately driving new patients into diagnosis and treatment pathways that they may not have previously considered or been treated for. So, it's not just driving more patients into our channel, but we believe it's also driving more motivated patients. The emphasis on GLP-1 medications and increased focus by Big Pharma has put a spotlight on sleep apnea like never before. We believe that the growth in weight loss drugs will be a net positive for our business and the data support that thesis. ResMed has added to the biggest study in the field and our data which is using real world evidence of the impact of GLP-1s through a de-identified patient analysis leveraging third party claims data. We now have an expanded cohort of over 811,000 de-identified subjects in our analysis. This analysis demonstrates that GLP-1s are having a positive impact on patients both seeking and adhering to positive airway pressure therapy. The latest numbers are an improvement from what we have presented previously. For patients prescribed a GLP-1 medication, the latest data show a 10.7 absolute percentage points higher propensity to start PAP therapy over those without a GLP-1 prescription. These data show that patients with this drug prescription are more motivated to start their CPAP, APAP or bilevel therapy. In terms of longer-term impacts on PAP therapy, we have seen that the resupply rate at T equals 12 months is 310 basis points, so 3.1 absolute percentage points higher for the patients who have a GLP-1 prescription and further at T equals 24 months, the resupply rate is 530 basis points, or 5.3 absolute percentage points higher for PAP therapy resupply for patients who have a GLP-1 prescription. These data show that the new pharmaceutical class is a clear tailwind for our business, bringing more patients into the healthcare system. And more than that, we believe it is bringing highly motivated patients into the healthcare system. We've included this updated analysis in our quarterly earnings PowerPoint deck and I encourage you to review the data there in further detail. ResMed is the clear world leader in sleep health, breathing health and healthcare delivered at home. Frankly, it's our obligation and it's our brand promise. It's the ResMed brand promise to ensure that sleep concerned consumers find their path to the highest efficacy, lowest cost and most comfortable therapy that's out there and it's best for them. Our peer reviewed and published evidence demonstrates that we can achieve over 87% to PAP technology, 87% adherence to PAP technology in the first 90 days by combining our market leading device platforms with digital health solutions, myAir and AirView. Of course, that means that 13% of patients in that scenario still need alternatives and ResMed wants to be there to help those patients too. So, we are investing in alternative therapies to help patients who can't adhere to PAP therapy to find their pathway to second line therapies. And that includes dental devices where ResMed provides Narval, the market leading 3D printed dental device for treatment of sleep apnea with dental treatment in western and northern Europe. In addition, we have investments in third-line therapies, including pharmaceutical options with our investment in ApneaMed and hyperglossal nerve stimulation technology with our investment in NIC SOA. So, let's step back and talk about broadly our digital health technology investments. Leveraging an extraordinary ecosystem of almost 19 billion nights of de-identified medical data, we are developing and continue to expand our portfolio of artificial intelligence driven capabilities, as well as customer facing AI products that we're launching into the market from our ecosystem. We continue to roll out and expand the AI products in AirView such as compliance coach in the United States and our new smart coaching pilot which is expanding into a few new countries as we go through our current quarter, which is Q1 of fiscal year 2025 and beyond. We are also progressing with our generative AI capabilities to help patients along their health journey. A project that was initially piloted within our Asia Pacific region, our generative AI sleep concierge that we call Dawn and yes, that is a reference to the sun rising at dawn after a great night of sleep. Dawn was recently expanded from Asia Pac into our US market. We'll continue to share the progress on this front of GenAI and simple ML and generic AI as well, as this tech is further developed and scaled across our business. It's going to enhance the user experience and drive consumer awareness and what we're focused on is outcomes, not the tech, but what it can do for a patient, a physician, a provider. In our residential care software as a service business, we had another strong quarter with year-over-year growth of 10%, supported by strength in our home medical equipment provider business through our Brightree brand, as well as very strong growth in our home nursing and nursing home business with our MEDIFOX DAN brand. We've made very good progress in the business segment throughout fiscal 2024 and we plan to maintain high single-digit growth to low double-digit growth throughout each quarter in fiscal year 2025. But really importantly, we're driving operating leverage and we're going to have very strong double-digit net operating profit growth from our residential care software business sector in 2025. Our residential care software business is integral to the broader ResMed growth portfolio with ongoing synergistic growth opportunities across our businesses. We are accelerating growth across our residential care software business intrinsically, but we're also helping to support the core business through mask and accessory resupply growth. We continue to drive operating leverage by managing across our businesses with capabilities managed such as cloud compute, cybersecurity, interoperability, privacy and research and development velocity across our software platforms and with our core sleep, health and breathing health businesses. We are transforming respiratory medicine and residential care software at scale. We are leading the industry in developing, applying and adopting digital health technology across the 140 plus countries that we serve. We continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our operations. We're focused on driving top line revenue growth, but with strong cost discipline and increasing efficiencies to accelerate profitability at the bottom line. We made excellent progress on that this quarter. The global team delivered growth in non-GAAP operating income of 30%. The global team also delivered growth in non-GAAP net income of 30%. I'm more than incredibly proud of our global team and their performance. We provide differentiated products and solutions for customers worldwide, driving long term sustainable value for our shareholders. We lead the industry in digital health technology with the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, most connected and most intelligent technologies. During the last 12 months, we have improved over 178 million lives by delivering a medical device directly to a patient, or a complete mask directly to a patient, or a digital health software solution that provides personal care. We've helped each person sleep better, breathe better and live higher quality lives with best-in-class healthcare delivered right where they live. In closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to 10,000 plus ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication today and every day across 140 countries. Thank you, team. With that, I'll hand the call over to our CFO Brett, who's in Sydney this morning for his remarks, and then we'll open up to Q&A with the global team here in San Diego and Sydney. Over to you Brett.\nBrett Sandercock: Great, thanks Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. Unless noted, all comparisons over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms were applicable. We had strong financial performance in Q4 ,group revenue for the June quarter was $1.22 billion, a 9% headline increase and 10% in constant currency terms. Revenue growth reflects positive and consistent contributions across our product and resupply portfolio. Year-over-year movements in foreign currencies had a minimal impact on revenue during the June quarter. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business, sales in US, Canada and Latin America increased by 10%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other regions increased by 8%. Globally, device sales increased by 6%, while masks and other sales increased by 15%. Breaking it down by regional areas device sales in the US, Canada and Latin America increased by 5%, supported by solid ongoing new patient diagnosis. Masks and other sales increased by 17%, reflecting growth in both resupply and new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other regions, device sales increased by 8% on a constant currency basis and masks and other sales increased by 9% on a constant currency basis. Software as a service revenue increased by 10% in the June quarter, underpinned by growth from MEDIFOX DAN and continued strong performance from our HME vertical. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release. Gross margin increased by 330 basis points to 59.1% in the June quarter. The year-over-year increase was driven by reductions in freight expense, manufacturing and component cost improvements, favourable product mix and an increase in average selling prices. Sequential gross margin improved by 60 basis points. The increase was driven by favorable product mix and manufacturing cost improvements partially offset by increased freight costs. We continue to monitor the freight cost headwinds arising from the Middle east, conflict and congestion in Asian ports. We expect increased freight cost rates will continue to impact our gross margin in fiscal year 2025. We have made good progress expanding gross margin over the last several quarters and we will continue to drive initiatives to improve gross margin. Looking forward, we estimate our gross margin will be in the range of 59% to 60% in fiscal year 2025. Moving on to operating expenses, SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter increased by 1%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 19.8% compared to 21.5% in the prior year period and reflects savings and ongoing cost discipline following restructuring actions undertaken in the December quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 20% for fiscal year 2025. Consistent with historical trends, we expect Q1 FY '25 will be at the higher end of this range. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 4% on a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.6% compared to 7% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for fiscal year 2025. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 30%, underpinned by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and modest growth in operating expenses. Our net interest expense for the quarter was 6 million. Given our lower debt levels, we expect interest expense in the range of $1 million to $3 million in Q1 FY '25. Additionally, we will likely generate net interest income in the second half of fiscal year 2025. During the quarter, we recognized unrealized losses of $15 million associated with our minority investment portfolio. This reduced our Q4 earnings per share by $0.10. Our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 18.7%. Broadly consistent with the prior year quarter, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2025 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the June quarter increased by 30% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 30%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $440 million, reflecting strong underlying earnings and improvement in our working capital position. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $25 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $44 million. We ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $238 million. During the quarter, we reduced debt by $300 million. As of June 30, we had $707 million in gross debt and $469 million in net debt. And we have approximately $1.5 billion available for drawdown under our revolver facility. We continue to maintain a healthy liquidity position. Today, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share, representing an increase of 10% over our previous quarterly dividend and reflecting the board's confidence in our operating performance. During the quarter, we purchased 232,000 shares under our previously authorised share buyback program for consideration of $50 million. We plan to continue to repurchase shares the value of approximately $50 million per quarter in fiscal year 2025. This will more than offset any dilution from the vesting of equity to employees during the year. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D, deploy further capital for tuck in acquisitions, and continue with our share buyback program. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Brett, and thanks, everyone. Kevin, I'd like to turn the call back over to you to review the Q&A instructions and run that portion of the call.\nOperator: Certainly with that be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nLyanne Harrison: Yeah, good morning, Mick, Brett and Amy. Can I start with devices that came in a little bit lower than what I had expected? And can you give us some color? In terms of that 6% increase in device revenues? How much of that do you think is driven by November price increases? How much is the AX 11 mixed benefit? And how much of that is volume? And then on volume, are you seeing any change in that new start pipeline coming through?\nMichael Farrell: Well, thanks for your question, Lyanne. That lets me talk through our really strong growth I believe in our devices business. Just to refresh in Q4 fiscal year '23 just 12 short months ago we were talking about US device growth of 30% and Europe, Asia, rest of world growth of 15%. So incredible double-digit comps that we're building these numbers off and we saw really good growth in the US of 5% growth in our US, Canada, Latin America and we saw 8% growth in Europe, Asia, rest of the world. We're in full competition with all the players out there and as you said, 6% constant currency globally. Look, you know, the market is growing in that mid-single digits and we are holding share or gaining share. But really now as the global market leader, our primary focus is on demand generation. Where are their capacities in the field for screening, diagnosis, treatment and management? That we can drive appropriate demand generation not to overflow the channel, but to make sure that any spare capacity in screening, diagnosis and treatment and management can come through. So, I was very impressed by those numbers. I think they're right in line with market and slightly ahead in Europe, Asia and rest of world. And I think the team did incredibly well. And we're doing it through patient flow, which is very strong. And yes, there are some ASP changes in there. They're kind of small. Our costs have gone up, and we did have some adjustments to pricing over the last 12 months. But the primary generator here is the flow of patients, which, as I said in the prep remarks, we're seeing really good flow of patients. And our job as the global market leader is to continue to have that grow and grow even faster as we go throughout the fiscal years ahead. Thanks for your question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden. Your line is out live.\nSteven Wheen : Yeah thanks. I just had a question with regards to the gross margin. The -- are you going to quantify the freight-related expectations that you would have for the next quarter. And are you being able to introduce rate levies again given the spike in sea freight charges at the moment?\nMichael Farrell: So, thanks for the question, Steve. I'll hand that over to Brett to cover some issues around GM and really good accretion of our gross margin year-on-year and sequentially, Brett, over to you.\nBrett Sandercock : Yes. Thanks, Mick. Yes, Steve, we're seeing -- I mean, we're seeing pressure on freight cost, particularly around the rates, the quite significant increases. I think everyone's seen those. So that is obviously, will continue to be a headwind for us, but we think notwithstanding that, we should be in that 59% to 60% range on gross margin. There's a lot of factors, as you know, play into that. But the freight will be a headwind. In terms of -- really, I guess it depends how whether it's sort of permanent or transitory and see how the market goes in terms of freight that obviously, those costs we're bearing at the moment. So, what we do going forward, I think, is something we'll think about as the year goes on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brett Fishbin from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\nBrett Fishbin: Hey guys, how are you doing? Thank you so much for taking the questions. Wanted to ask a quick follow-up on the gross margin question just now. Just thinking about some of the year-over-year trend, it looks like 2024 is finishing at about 57.7%, and you're guiding to 59% to 60%. So maybe if you could just walk through some of the positive incremental drivers relative to how we're exiting the second half year? And you already touched on the freight as a partial offset? Thank you.\nMichael Farrell: So Brett, back to you, gross margin.\nBrett Sandercock : Yes, sure. The -- you -- to clarify, you talking into the future gross margins?\nBrett Fishbin: Specifically, just asking about some of the commentary for FY '25 relative to FY '24.\nBrett Sandercock : Yes, going forward. So going forward, I guess there's some factors at play out on the gross margin. Some of these big positive. We talked about freight, which will be a headwind. But if you -- if we look forward, we have cost optimization initiatives that we're getting back to now, whereas previously, we were really just trying to meet demand and catching up. But now we're getting back to running a more regular cost optimization programs. So, we'll do that. We're building the pipeline of those initiatives, that will be around manufacturing improvements and efficiencies. It will be around the procurement initiatives than what we do there. And also, we'll get -- with the volumes we have now, we'll also get scale benefits coming through. So, they're kind of the areas, I guess, we look at in terms of cost optimization in supply chain. Other factors the continued transition to the AS 11 platform will be supportive of gross margin into FY '25. We think product mix will likely be favorable through the course of FY '25, that will be supportive. And I guess the last one is just around new product introductions as you introduce new products that helps with less discounting and you're able to price that according to the features and the value of those products. So, there are some of the factors, I think that will play out in FY '25.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live.\nMichael Matson: Yeah, thanks. So, I guess, first, I just want to ask about Philips. Have you seen them reentering any of the international markets in any meaningful way with devices specifically?\nMichael Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Mike. And yes, our -- I guess I'll call them our #4 competitor right now, right, because they've dropped down to fourth in new patient share globally. That competitor is back in many markets in Europe Asia and Rest of World, we grew in the quarter, 8% in Europe, Asia, rest of the world on a comp of 15%. So, if you see which I do, the market growing in mid-single digits. ResMed is taking share in Europe, Asia, rest of the world relative to our competition. So, competitors from Europe like the one you named, but there's other ones that have higher share and competitors from Asia who have higher shares than them. And so, I think that competitor as they come back are having to earn their way back. We've got to try to repair their brand, try to repair their approach that they're going to have a safe and efficacious product, and they're competing with the Tier 2, Tier 3 players and working their way in. They had a call last week, and they sound like they're growing from a very low base to something better, and that's good on them. I love competition. ResMed is the market leader. We have the smallest, quietest, the most comfortable devices, but more important than that, they're the most connected and the most intelligent and it's all about the ecosystem of AirView and myAir and getting those data to the cloud and getting to doctors, getting to physicians. So yes, that competitor is back in a number of markets. And as we said last quarter, the quarter before, we were beating them from 2010 to 2019, 2020 before they had the recall, and we're going to beat them as they come back and we've shown that this quarter, and we'll continue to show it going forward.\nMichael Matson: Okay, got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST Marquee, your line is now live.\nDan Hurren: Good morning. Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about that mask growth and the impact of the new products. And specifically, does that strong growth are reflective of an element of initial stocking? Or is that level of growth representative of what the new products can sustain?\nMichael Farrell: Look, it's a good question because we talk about mask growth being high single digits. And then obviously, in this quarter. We performed right there in Europe, Asia, rest of the world at 9%, right there in that high single digits. Then in U.S., Canada, Latin America, we performed at 17% growth. On a pretty good comp actually of 19% from the year before. So double digit on double digit. Look, you're not going to grow double digits in masks forever when the market is growing at high single digits, and you are the clear market leader. But you can drive demand generation and you can drive better resupply programs. And I said in the prep remarks, we've done a lot of investment in Brightree, Snap Technologies and all of the digital health technology that we have to support home medical equipment providers here in the U.S. market. And then globally, we've really set up some great subscription programs where people, frankly, I think, have been underserved in Europe, Asia and rest of world with the ability to get fresh equipment if they love their device and they love their mask, why isn't it super simple to just click on an app see the price and get a drop ship delivery of a device to your place in a cash pay market where those same people are doing the same and have done with Amazon and all the other WeChat in China, Amazon, the U.S., et cetera, et cetera, globally. Everyone has seen this in the consumer field. And so I think health care needs to catch up and be more consumer focused and in those cash pay markets. We've set up some great subscription programs. And in the more regulated provider-based markets like the U.S. and Europe, we're really partnering with our providers like never before. So that's how we saw the outperformance. That's how we saw the extra demand generation. That's how we saw the extra resupply. Our goal is to meet or beat market growth every quarter that we go ahead. The team did it really well this quarter, and I have confidence that we'll be able to do it going forward. Thanks for the question about masks. It's a really important part of our business.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from David Bailey from Macquarie. Your line is now live.\nDavid Bailey: Morning. Thanks to -- thanks Mick and Brett. Just thinking about longer-term new patient growth. You sort of mentioned that the awareness piece could potentially increase on the back of some of the GLP-1 studies and data. Just on the diagnosis side of things. Are there any constraints in your view to more new patients coming through. And I suppose I'm getting to -- the question is, when do you think you might see an inflection from or an increase in that sort of mid-single-digit growth to something a little bit higher?\nMichael Farrell: Yes, David, it's a really good question, and it's sort of the 3.5 decade question for ResMed, right, which is how do you get people screen diagnosed and treated for a disease, whether they're unconscious when they suffer from it in sleep apnea, being asleep while you have the suffocation. So, education, awareness and better protocols to get patients into the funnel screening diagnosis, treatment and management has been our decades long mission. And look, we did very well, I think, going through COVID and on the other side to apply increases in home sleep apnea testing increases in remote patient monitoring and technology that we've used to help. And so, I do think the big pharma GLP-1 trend is bringing more and more patients in and they're very motivated patients. You saw our latest update on our real-world evidence, 111,000 patients seeing 10.7 absolute percentage points, high propensity to start CPAP. These are very motivated patients over the average patient. And I think that's a big trend. You didn't mention in your question, but I will, David, consumer tech, the wearables. I mean, Samsung dropping the mic there on the other consumer tech companies to say, we've got a de novo clearance to screen for monitor severe sleep apnea from a watch, from the Samsung Galaxy Watch. And I know the Apple Watch has an oximeter on it, and they can do the same. We know Google's Fitbit team have been doing sleep architecture for years. And they will start to recognize many patients with this. So, the real question is not will there be a flow of patients from consumer tech and big pharma. That's going to happen. The real question is, can ResMed really pick up and fight and be the world leader in a digital sleep health concierge to take that sleep concern consumer and help them find a path to a health care specialist to a protocol to a system that gets them screened, diagnosed and treated. We're making good progress on it. We've got a number of experiments globally. We're partnering with an ecosystem of other smaller players out there as well as our own technology in all 140 countries. I can tell you the experiments are happening, and we're seeing some success. The question of the inflection point, look, I do think we can take market growth rate and move it up by 50, 75, 100, maybe even 125 basis points. We're not going to double it. It's a huge, huge global franchise now. Look at our trailing 12 months revenue north of $4.5 billion, but I do think we can move it up 50, 75, 125 basis points by bringing these new technologies that help with that digital sleep pathway. Yes, I'm aware I've got a disease, my watch has told me I'm at risk what do I do about it? ResMed needs to be there to help that person find their pathway through the convoluted frankly, global health care systems to therapy. For those who are coming in the big pharma one, they're already in the health care system. They're going to a primary care physician or a specialist doctor. So that's an even easier route where it's more about education and driving the traditional channels. So we're working both, social media, digital and traditional channels. And together, I do think there's opportunities to accelerate market growth and watch this space. We've done well over the years, and we've learned a lot in these last five years. And now as the global leader, it's our obligation to do this, and we're all over it. Thanks for the question, David.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Gretel Janu from E&P. Your line is now live.\nGretel Janu: Thanks. Good morning. Just back on the gross margin and the guidance of 59% to 60% for FY '25, how should we think about the cadence of that throughout the first half and second half weaker first half, stronger second half given freight or relatively consistent throughout each quarter? Thanks.\nMichael Farrell: Yes. Good question, Gretel. Over to you, Brett. And it feels like this is the after call with modeling. But over to you, Brett.\nBrett Sandercock : Great. Thanks, Mick. Thanks, Gretel. Yes, I mean, we're at 59.1%, I guess, exit there. I think we've got a 59% to 60% and I think it's probably likely kind of be that gradual improvement as we work through FY '25, I think it's kind of our best estimate at this stage.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.\nSuraj Kalia: Mick, can you hear me all right?\nMichael Farrell: Can hear you loud and clear, Suraj.\nSuraj Kalia: Perfect. Congrats on a nice quarter. So, Mick, if I could, I'd love to push you on one of the earlier questions about pricing impact in the quarter. If you could strip out at least give us directionally a little bit additional color, that would be great. Mick and also, if I'll throw my follow-up question also together in terms of inventory levels, how should we think about inventory levels on masks, accessories across the pond. Is there anything out of the normal? Or how would you characterize it? Thank you for taking my questions.\nMichael Farrell: Great. Well, I'll take the first question around pricing impact. And then Brett, you'll take the sneaky second question there around -- sneaky, I mean, by getting it in upfront, Suraj, not the question itself, on inventory levels, particularly with masking accessories. And we saw the total inventory come down, but I think it's specifically Brett on masks and accessories. So firstly, on pricing impact, look, Suraj, you and all the sell side, you guys do your investigations and you look and talk to our customers, particularly in the U.S. and ask about pricing. You know that as a company, you've followed us over the last few fiscal years, we did see cost of components go up with inflation with shipping costs that have gone -- we've had increased cost of goods sold that ResMed has had to deal with, and we've shared some of that, not all of it. We've shared some of that with our customers with some increase in pricing. Often associated directly with innovation, right? The AirSense 11 was higher priced than the AirSense 10, but it's small, it's quiter. It's more comfortable. It's more connected. It has 2-way comps. It has over-the-year upgrades. It has all these advances. And so, it has a high price point. Similarly, with new mask inventions, the F40 is out there. It's a great mask. We don't need a price discount on something that is that much better than the competition. It's the smallest full-face mask, the smallest oral nasal mask in the history, a 35-year history of ResMed. So that -- those will be at price premiums. And so don't break out the exact breakdown on devices or masks of pricing or volume. But I can tell you, the vast majority of our growth was all on volumes. It's all about getting more of the one billion-plus patients with a sleep apnea, the half billion patients with insomnia and half billion with COPD into the system, so they can get better fleet and better breathing. So we focus primarily on that screening diagnosis treatment, get the volume in, and then ASP is a component in that where we have increased costs. Look, frankly, I hope inflation comes down and costs come down, and we can share some savings with our customers because they have a tough time with reimbursement often not going up. At least the U.S. Medicare went up at the start of this year, in line with an inflation adjustment, but not all insurance companies around the world do that. And so, our job is to get more patients in to make sure the channel is profitable so that we can have more money to invest in getting awareness out to all the patients who need our help. That's my answer to the first half. Brett, over to you to talk about inventory and masks and accessories, particularly.\nBrett Sandercock : Yes. Thanks, Mick. Yes, on inventory, we've brought the inventory levels down over the last 12 months or so. I think down to reasonably appropriate levels where we are seeing at the moment. And then inventory likely to grow more in line with revenue as we go forward. So, we feel we are in reasonable shape there. In terms of masks can accessories around that, we don't think of that too much differently. There's nothing particularly specific about it. We manage those inventory levels as we do with devices and components and so on. So, nothing particularly to call out there other than I think we've got -- we're more comfortable with inventory levels that we're at now, and we will work, for example, 12 months ago. So, I think we're in pretty good shape on inventory.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Margaret Andrew from William Blair. Your line is now live.\nMargaret Kaczor: Hey, good afternoon, good morning, folks. Thanks for taking the question. And I'm going to apologize because it's a series of three questions, but I'm going to say pick and choose whatever you want to answer. I promise they're all connected. And it's really -- Mike, you talked about wanting to be a sleep concierge service in one of your earlier question answers. And so, the question is, one, First, is the sleep concierge service something that you will give away as a service? I assume you will, but maybe there's some ability to monetize that. And then two, how many patients do you think that those digital technologies that you referenced, how many patients could they bring into the market over what time period? Is it millions already what's your success rate in getting those patients connected to you and ultimately, on a CPAP today versus what they're -- where they're getting lost. And third, again, I apologize for the multiquestion here. But ultimately, this all kind of brings this idea of the funnel together and you guys delivered double-digit growth this quarter, I guess, is that one way to continue that as a trend and whether you want to give it numerically or not. But how do you get that over time on a longer-term basis? Thank you.\nMichael Farrell: Yes, Margaret, it's a great set of questions. And it really is one question, right? It's really about that demand generation and how we can as a company best leverage what is, frankly, once in a generation in the pharmaceutical cycle. And I think maybe once in a generation on the wearable cycle from consumer tech of a bolus of patients over the coming one, three, five, 10 years. So, look, yes, we want -- we aspire to be this digital health concierge and digital health concierge specifically for sleeping and breathing. Look, I mean, obviously, when we're providing technology, if we're providing a service that is a service that's out there in the health care field, we're going to be charging for it. But in the context of helping people find access to information, ResMed has the world's leading database with 19 billion nights of medical data in the cloud. We have more knowledge than anyone on the planet. I wouldn't call it a data lake, but I'd call it a data well, it's a bunch of deep, deep information about the field of sleep and breathing and about patients how they get to sleep, how they breath all night, and how they wake up and have mask leak and/or apneas and/or issues. And so with that, we want to bring that information and bring it to the world. For instance, we don't charge patients for myAir. Patients get access because we believe they paid their insurance. They -- in markets that are cash pay, they paid for that product with their own cash. So I believe they have the right to access their own data on their myAir app. So if they sign up, there's 8.3 million patients, they get myAir for free. So in a similar context, I would want patients to be able to find access to a pathway on a sort of freemium basis. If there's advanced analytics and advanced information we're doing that does. AI isn't free, a lot of engineers to write it and a lot of energy consumed in the algorithms as they run. We probably will charge for some of those advanced information similar to what we do with AirView with our providers and physicians. So sleep health concierge, there will be freemium basis and will be out there. There probably will be some pay -- for the really advanced folks. But the primary goal is to help the billion people find their path to treatment. Now to your specific questions about quantifying how many patients in the channel, how many extra have we got from consumer tech, from big pharma versus from standard referrals. We do have some analytics and measurement on that. They're internal and they're not for sort of public consumption. If I say them here on the call, they become public for them. But I can tell you we are productively paranoid about analyzing this channel. The flow of patients in where they come from and how they come from, what we can do to drive more patients in from each element of that. how we can get an ROI of either direct consumer advertising or social media-driven advertising and really track the return on that. So watch this space, a lot of investment from ResMed. It is our brand promise to help people get better sleep, better breathing and better care at home. And we're the world leader. It's our duty to do so. So I do believe, to answer the sort of third part of your question, bringing the funnel together, it is all about that. We achieved incredible growth, double-digit growth, as you said, across the business, north of 6% in devices, north of 15% in masks and incredible growth in our respiratory care -- sorry, residential care services and software at 10%. So really proud of the team. Our goal to keep doing it and keep doing it quarter in, quarter out, and the team is on it. So thanks for your question, Margaret.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Anthony Petrone from Mizuho Group. Your line is now live.\nAnthony Petrone: Thanks, Mike. Congrats on the quarter here, let me just stay on the theme high level. If you think about the debate on GLP-1, on the one hand, we still have a low diagnostic rate just for sleep apnea overall. I think it stands at 20% or so based on the last Wisconsin sleep study. So when you think about Lilly coming in here, potentially doing DTC. Where do you think the diagnostic rate can go, so that would be a huge tailwind. And then on the flip side, you think about the continuum. We have dental devices CPAP therapy, auto, CPAP, of course, in their sleep metrics on AirView, et cetera. And then we also have hypoglossal nerve stimulation. When we add in the GLP-1, how do you think the decision-making process will shake out over time? Thanks again.\nMichael Farrell: Yes. Thanks for your question, Anthony. It's a broad one. It allows me to talk about diagnostics rates, but also the different sort of, as you said, continuum of care of the therapies for obstructive sleep apnea or sleep apnea in general. So yes, the Wisconsin Cohort, The Sleep Heart Health Study is a fantastic multi-decade study and really Terry Young and her colleagues have done incredibly well to have such a broad study across the field. It does talk about the United States having diagnostic rates in that 15% to 20% rate. But it is a U.S.-based study in the Sleep Heart Health Study. It's out of Wisconsin, it's U.S. based. It doesn't talk about Europe. And in Western Europe, the diagnostic rate is well south of 10% across Europe. And in Asia Pacific, MEA and rest of world and Latin America, we're less than 5% penetrated into this. And if you just look at the macro of it, right, we've got -- and we brag about it. We're so proud of having 28 million patients in our ecosystem. That's out of one billion patients worldwide. So that's 2.8% of patients in our ecosystem. And we're the world leader. We're the world leader in digital health, not just for respiratory medicine, but across the board with 19 billion nights of data. So globally, this is a single-digit penetration market. And so, I welcome firstly, patients need treatment. I welcome all alternative therapies. We're investing in all alternative therapies. We invest in CPAP, APAP, bilevel, obviously, world leader in that. We're investing in dental therapy. We're the world leader in naval 3D printed devices for Western Europe and Northern Europe, #1 in three different dental devices in those regions. And we're investing in pharma with our at need investment and we're investing in hypoglycem with our XR investment. So we want to take care of every single patient. But the goal when you talk about the continuum of care, if you're a physician, payer provider and you're looking at the holistic system, you want lowest cost most efficacious, least invasive, most reversible and the most used in terms of data of lowering death rates 39% -- sorry, 29% reduction in mortality rates that we've seen PAP across our Alaska study. So our goal is, yes, get that patient in the sleep health concierge channel, get them to the best therapy, which is start with CPAP, as you said, probably upgrade sometimes to APAP, sometimes bilevel. If you fail all of those and maybe 10% of the patients, we just can't get there, 10% plus, we then will help them find a path to dental therapy, which is the next most efficacious therapy. Then after that, based on SIM out study, probably pharma comes a little bit ahead of hypoglossal nerve stim in efficacy, right? They're talking 60% AHI reduction versus just north of 50% for some of the surgical ones. So probably third-line therapy is going to be either GLP-1 or an apnemed-type product. And I think that all of the above are great, and we're investing in all of the above. And look, if you can't tolerate the see the dental and you won't take a pill, you probably do need to have that implant because some treatments better than no treatment. And we know that if you're treated for the suffocation, you're going to have lower incidences of heart attack, stroke, all-cause mortality and you're going to be less costly to the health care system. We have dose response relationship data showing for every hour on positive airway pressure therapy. We see 7% to 8% reduction in emergency room costs. So our goal is to continue and be part of this ecosystem and help patients find their pathway to therapy. We are seeing more patients coming from this. I hope it does increase that diagnostic percentage because it's our obligation as an industry to do so. Thanks for the question, Anthony.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey. Your line is now live.\nSaul Hadassin: Yeah, good morning, Mick, Brett and Amy. Mick, can I just get you to give some commentary around the SURMOUNT-OSA write-up in the New England Journal and particularly some of those secondary endpoints as it relates to the reduction in AHI in that no disease effectively of mild disease. You mentioned the data as it relates to resupply. I was wondering if you have any data that looks at or tracks people who are giving a script for GLP-1 and CPAPs as to how many people have actually been able to come off CPAP at the end of either 12 months or 24 months? Thanks.\nMichael Farrell: Yes, Saul, thanks for the question. And look, we're looking at the real-world evidence every single way that we can. And yes, certainly, the SURMOUNT-OSA data had a pretty extraordinary trial, right, where they had the patients with the sleep coach, a nutrition coach, an exercise coach, they were calling them and interacting with them every day. So even people in the placebo arm had incredible reductions in weight and some really big reductions in HI in the placebo one, where they got no pharmaceutical medication, whatsoever, either saline or nothing. And so look, I think that under that circumstance, there's roughly 600 patients, plus or minus. They have some extraordinary results. But even in all those circumstances, they still weren't as good as dental devices and certainly nowhere near the 95% reduction in HI that any doctor would want with positive airway pressure therapy. But look, look, it certainly was larger than many people thought in the HR reduction. So, I think it's great. I think it means that those two companies that are investing in this are going to go through, getting the indication for use, and then they're going to be out there doing DTC advertising, which in the U.S, you can do a late-night television, and they'll be out there. They'll find some catchy tune and it'll will be out there driving patients into the funnel, and I think it will be good for all of us in the therapeutic side. We're definitely looking at the churn rates and CPAP quitters, APAP quitters, bilevel quitters and really looking in detail at it. I can tell you, in aggregate, we've seen no change on the data. And as you know, the latest generation GLP-1s, some of them have been out there one year, three years, four years plus these latest gen, and we're not seeing any increase in that. We're looking at it real-world data, and we're analyzing left, right and center, but we're not seeing an increase in quitters rates. If anything, we're seeing more motivated patients come in and holding on more. The combination therapy, which is what the primary investigators in this talk about, which is CPAP plus drug therapy as in I'm managing my weight and my suffocation are really there. And the vast majority of patients have incredible residual apnea at levels that would be treated by any primary care physician in the planet even under the very controlled circumstances of this trial, let alone what's going to actually happen in the real world. So we're watching it. We have a really strong focus on it. We've got 811,000 patients in our study. and we'll continue to publish data on it. And as we get more and more, we'll go even more to publish an American Thoracic Society, European Respiratory Society and get in the Blue Journal and all the big journals to have this down there in the clinical literature as well as the subjects that we're looking at in our analysis. Thanks for the question, Saul.\nOperator: Thank you. That's all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further closing comments.\nMichael Farrell: Yes. Thanks, Kevin, and thank you to all of our stakeholders for joining us on this call. The opportunities in front of us, as you heard from all these questions, huge and largely untapped. It's an incredible runway. We see more and more people coming into the health system, and this will benefit us as we help them sleep better, breathe better and live better lives in 140 countries. Thank you to all the ResMedians, who listen to this call around the world. Many of you are also shareholders. So thank you for what you do today and every day. With that, I'll hand the call back to you, Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Mick. Thanks, everyone, for listening and your questions. We do appreciate your interest and your time. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out directly. This concludes ResMed's Fourth Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Kevin, you may now close out the call.\nOperator: Thank you. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Brett Sandercock",
            "content": "Great, thanks Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. Unless noted, all comparisons over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms were applicable. We had strong financial performance in Q4 ,group revenue for the June quarter was $1.22 billion, a 9% headline increase and 10% in constant currency terms. Revenue growth reflects positive and consistent contributions across our product and resupply portfolio. Year-over-year movements in foreign currencies had a minimal impact on revenue during the June quarter. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business, sales in US, Canada and Latin America increased by 10%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other regions increased by 8%. Globally, device sales increased by 6%, while masks and other sales increased by 15%. Breaking it down by regional areas device sales in the US, Canada and Latin America increased by 5%, supported by solid ongoing new patient diagnosis. Masks and other sales increased by 17%, reflecting growth in both resupply and new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other regions, device sales increased by 8% on a constant currency basis and masks and other sales increased by 9% on a constant currency basis. Software as a service revenue increased by 10% in the June quarter, underpinned by growth from MEDIFOX DAN and continued strong performance from our HME vertical. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release. Gross margin increased by 330 basis points to 59.1% in the June quarter. The year-over-year increase was driven by reductions in freight expense, manufacturing and component cost improvements, favourable product mix and an increase in average selling prices. Sequential gross margin improved by 60 basis points. The increase was driven by favorable product mix and manufacturing cost improvements partially offset by increased freight costs. We continue to monitor the freight cost headwinds arising from the Middle east, conflict and congestion in Asian ports. We expect increased freight cost rates will continue to impact our gross margin in fiscal year 2025. We have made good progress expanding gross margin over the last several quarters and we will continue to drive initiatives to improve gross margin. Looking forward, we estimate our gross margin will be in the range of 59% to 60% in fiscal year 2025. Moving on to operating expenses, SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter increased by 1%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 19.8% compared to 21.5% in the prior year period and reflects savings and ongoing cost discipline following restructuring actions undertaken in the December quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 20% for fiscal year 2025. Consistent with historical trends, we expect Q1 FY '25 will be at the higher end of this range. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 4% on a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.6% compared to 7% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for fiscal year 2025. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 30%, underpinned by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and modest growth in operating expenses. Our net interest expense for the quarter was 6 million. Given our lower debt levels, we expect interest expense in the range of $1 million to $3 million in Q1 FY '25. Additionally, we will likely generate net interest income in the second half of fiscal year 2025. During the quarter, we recognized unrealized losses of $15 million associated with our minority investment portfolio. This reduced our Q4 earnings per share by $0.10. Our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 18.7%. Broadly consistent with the prior year quarter, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2025 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the June quarter increased by 30% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 30%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $440 million, reflecting strong underlying earnings and improvement in our working capital position. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $25 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $44 million. We ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $238 million. During the quarter, we reduced debt by $300 million. As of June 30, we had $707 million in gross debt and $469 million in net debt. And we have approximately $1.5 billion available for drawdown under our revolver facility. We continue to maintain a healthy liquidity position. Today, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share, representing an increase of 10% over our previous quarterly dividend and reflecting the board's confidence in our operating performance. During the quarter, we purchased 232,000 shares under our previously authorised share buyback program for consideration of $50 million. We plan to continue to repurchase shares the value of approximately $50 million per quarter in fiscal year 2025. This will more than offset any dilution from the vesting of equity to employees during the year. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D, deploy further capital for tuck in acquisitions, and continue with our share buyback program. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. Yes. Thanks, Mick. Yes, Steve, we're seeing -- I mean, we're seeing pressure on freight cost, particularly around the rates, the quite significant increases. I think everyone's seen those. So that is obviously, will continue to be a headwind for us, but we think notwithstanding that, we should be in that 59% to 60% range on gross margin. There's a lot of factors, as you know, play into that. But the freight will be a headwind. In terms of -- really, I guess it depends how whether it's sort of permanent or transitory and see how the market goes in terms of freight that obviously, those costs we're bearing at the moment. So, what we do going forward, I think, is something we'll think about as the year goes on. Yes, sure. The -- you -- to clarify, you talking into the future gross margins? Yes, going forward. So going forward, I guess there's some factors at play out on the gross margin. Some of these big positive. We talked about freight, which will be a headwind. But if you -- if we look forward, we have cost optimization initiatives that we're getting back to now, whereas previously, we were really just trying to meet demand and catching up. But now we're getting back to running a more regular cost optimization programs. So, we'll do that. We're building the pipeline of those initiatives, that will be around manufacturing improvements and efficiencies. It will be around the procurement initiatives than what we do there. And also, we'll get -- with the volumes we have now, we'll also get scale benefits coming through. So, they're kind of the areas, I guess, we look at in terms of cost optimization in supply chain. Other factors the continued transition to the AS 11 platform will be supportive of gross margin into FY '25. We think product mix will likely be favorable through the course of FY '25, that will be supportive. And I guess the last one is just around new product introductions as you introduce new products that helps with less discounting and you're able to price that according to the features and the value of those products. So, there are some of the factors, I think that will play out in FY '25. Great. Thanks, Mick. Thanks, Gretel. Yes, I mean, we're at 59.1%, I guess, exit there. I think we've got a 59% to 60% and I think it's probably likely kind of be that gradual improvement as we work through FY '25, I think it's kind of our best estimate at this stage. Yes. Thanks, Mick. Yes, on inventory, we've brought the inventory levels down over the last 12 months or so. I think down to reasonably appropriate levels where we are seeing at the moment. And then inventory likely to grow more in line with revenue as we go forward. So, we feel we are in reasonable shape there. In terms of masks can accessories around that, we don't think of that too much differently. There's nothing particularly specific about it. We manage those inventory levels as we do with devices and components and so on. So, nothing particularly to call out there other than I think we've got -- we're more comfortable with inventory levels that we're at now, and we will work, for example, 12 months ago. So, I think we're in pretty good shape on inventory."

            "content": "Thanks Amy, and thank you to our shareholders for joining us as we announce results from our full fiscal year 2024 and review our fourth quarter results in more detail. Our global ResMed team executed incredibly well in our fourth quarter, producing another strong period of growth and execution across our business. With solid performance across all regions and all segments of our business and strong double-digit bottom-line growth. Ongoing new patient demand for our market leading flow generators remained robust in the quarter, even against a very tough year-over-year comparable. Media interest in sleep apnea and all the various therapies seems to be helping patients find their way to screening, diagnosis and therapy. And especially the lowest cost, most efficacious therapy with the best outcomes, which is positive airway pressure therapy. In terms of our masks and accessories, business physicians, respiratory therapists and patients are choosing ResMed masks when they start therapy and as they continue through resupply, resulting in very strong double-digit growth in our masks and accessories business. Our residential care software business delivered double-digit growth in revenue and in net operating profit. Our laser focus on operating leverage has delivered another quarter of strong, profitable growth and we're well positioned to continue on this trajectory as we launch into fiscal year 2025. Over 2.4 billion people worldwide suffer from sleep apnea, insomnia or respiratory insufficiency due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or neuromuscular disease. As the market leader in respiratory medicine and residential care globally, here at ResMed, we're uniquely positioned to drive increased market penetration through demand generation to accelerate growth. These chronic conditions in sleep health and breathing health form a global health epidemic that ResMed is well positioned to address. We believe that healthcare should be delivered in the lowest cost, lowest acuity and highest comfort location possible, in the optimal case, that's right, in a person's own home. ResMed is the clear leader in sleep apnea, a market of over 1 billion people globally. Our end markets remain significantly underpenetrated. We're leading the industry in digital health solutions, with approximately 19 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and 26 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices sold into over 140 countries worldwide. We've leveraged these de-identified data to show that our therapy solutions lower costs, improve outcomes and bend the curve of chronic disease progression. Significant opportunities remain in digital health, and we plan to be right there at the cutting edge of innovation. The latest advances in wearables from the consumer technology industry and the latest medicines from big pharmaceutical companies will bring more and more new patients into the healthcare system. We have many opportunities to add value, expanding interoperability, lowering costs and improving patient outcomes. Billions of people can benefit from our products and solutions, and we're focused on expanding our reach and growing the market to help people get on their pathway to better sleep, better breathing and better care at home. Sales of our flow generator devices, including the category leading AirSense 11 platform, grew 6% year-over-year globally. We're supporting the global market and every patient who needs a device has access to our market leading 100% cloud connectable platforms, the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11. We continue increasing the availability and production of our AirSense 11 and our AirCurve11 platforms worldwide as we secure regulatory clearances and launch these market leading technologies country by country. Our masks and accessories business grew 15% year-over-year, expanding in a competitive category globally. Our latest mask innovation, the AirFit F40, introduced last quarter, is doing extremely well in the markets that it has launched in. New patients are selecting the F40 for its comfort, fit and ease of use. It is the smallest profile oronasal mask on the market from ResMed. Patients are voting with their wallets, and respiratory therapists are voting with their setup protocols, and physicians are voting with their prescriptions. We look forward to ongoing success in the US and across global markets as we increase availability and introduce the F40 into more and more countries throughout fiscal year 2025. ResMed's clinical and commercial teams continue to partner with physicians and providers to drive resupply programs directly with their patients, and we're successfully establishing subscription programs in our cash pay countries to help consumers find their path to therapy with resupply directly. Masks and accessory resupply programs are a very important part of our offering as we serve the ongoing therapy needs of patients globally, research shows that resupply programs can both improve patient adherence and improve long-term clinical outcomes. In the US our resupply programs are powered by our digital health ecosystem, including AirView for physicians, myAir for patients and Brightree for home medical equipment providers. We will continue to develop, launch and scale these technologies and programs to help people take control of their own health, regularly refreshing their ongoing therapy needs. As the global leader in significantly underpenetrated markets, our most important opportunity is to expand and grow the market through awareness, diagnosis and seamless pathways to treatment. We aspire to be the digital health concierge for each person as they pursue their personal journey to better sleep, better breathing and better residential care. We are ramping up our demand generation initiatives to raise awareness and create pathways for patients to help them find access to care for their sleep health and their breathing health. We're serving traditional healthcare channels as well as investing in cost effective, social media driven, demand generation campaigns to help consumers who are concerned about their sleep and breathing, find ways their own personal way into appropriate screening, diagnosis, treatment and management pathways. Our physician and provider-based software ecosystem called AirView now contains over 28 million patient records. Adoption of our consumer patient engagement app, which is called myAir, where people choose to participate in their personalized sleep health journey, remains incredibly active and now includes over 8.3 million users. These digital health ecosystems are growing every quarter, showing the engagement of physicians as well as patients in accessing their own data to measure progress along their personal health journey. As we look to the future, I've discussed two global megatrends that I believe will further support ongoing growth for ResMed. Awareness of sleep health issues driven by consumer technology companies, specifically, sleep tracking wearables like the Samsung Galaxy Watch, which has a De Novo FDA clearance to screen for moderate to severe sleep apnea. And we expect similar capabilities from other wearable players in consumer tech such as the Apple Watch, Google's Fitbit, the Oura Ring, WHOOP and Garmin. In terms of the second megatrend behind future patient growth, we are seeing increased volumes of patients entering the healthcare system driven by the efforts of big pharmaceutical companies as they increase awareness of the treatments for diabetes and obesity medicines and they continue their research into the impacts of these medicines on sleep apnea. Together, we believe these two mega trends in consumer tech and big pharma will increase patient awareness and be a significant tailwind for long term growth here at ResMed, our goal is to educate people as they move from what we call sleep wellness tracking on a wearable to what we would call sleep health tracking, where they are seeking the help, advice and care of a health professional in the field of sleep medicine. This connection pathway from consumer awareness of sleep health and breathing health issues into a true healthcare pathway is what we are calling the digital health concierge opportunity. Our plan is to be there for that person as they go through the process of screening, diagnosis, treatment and ongoing management of their sleep health and their breathing health for life. Big Pharma is squarely focused on GLP-1 medications. For many people dealing with their obesity and diabetes issues, their healthcare goals are focused on losing weight while improving their diet, cardiovascular exercise and their sleep routines, something that Bill Dement called the triumvirate of health. We believe that increased utilization of GLP-1s to treat obesity will bring many new people into the healthcare funnel, activating them to see their primary care physicians as they strive to achieve and maintain weight loss. We believe this will open them up to treating other chronic diseases that they may suffer from, including increased awareness of sleep apnea, ultimately driving new patients into diagnosis and treatment pathways that they may not have previously considered or been treated for. So, it's not just driving more patients into our channel, but we believe it's also driving more motivated patients. The emphasis on GLP-1 medications and increased focus by Big Pharma has put a spotlight on sleep apnea like never before. We believe that the growth in weight loss drugs will be a net positive for our business and the data support that thesis. ResMed has added to the biggest study in the field and our data which is using real world evidence of the impact of GLP-1s through a de-identified patient analysis leveraging third party claims data. We now have an expanded cohort of over 811,000 de-identified subjects in our analysis. This analysis demonstrates that GLP-1s are having a positive impact on patients both seeking and adhering to positive airway pressure therapy. The latest numbers are an improvement from what we have presented previously. For patients prescribed a GLP-1 medication, the latest data show a 10.7 absolute percentage points higher propensity to start PAP therapy over those without a GLP-1 prescription. These data show that patients with this drug prescription are more motivated to start their CPAP, APAP or bilevel therapy. In terms of longer-term impacts on PAP therapy, we have seen that the resupply rate at T equals 12 months is 310 basis points, so 3.1 absolute percentage points higher for the patients who have a GLP-1 prescription and further at T equals 24 months, the resupply rate is 530 basis points, or 5.3 absolute percentage points higher for PAP therapy resupply for patients who have a GLP-1 prescription. These data show that the new pharmaceutical class is a clear tailwind for our business, bringing more patients into the healthcare system. And more than that, we believe it is bringing highly motivated patients into the healthcare system. We've included this updated analysis in our quarterly earnings PowerPoint deck and I encourage you to review the data there in further detail. ResMed is the clear world leader in sleep health, breathing health and healthcare delivered at home. Frankly, it's our obligation and it's our brand promise. It's the ResMed brand promise to ensure that sleep concerned consumers find their path to the highest efficacy, lowest cost and most comfortable therapy that's out there and it's best for them. Our peer reviewed and published evidence demonstrates that we can achieve over 87% to PAP technology, 87% adherence to PAP technology in the first 90 days by combining our market leading device platforms with digital health solutions, myAir and AirView. Of course, that means that 13% of patients in that scenario still need alternatives and ResMed wants to be there to help those patients too. So, we are investing in alternative therapies to help patients who can't adhere to PAP therapy to find their pathway to second line therapies. And that includes dental devices where ResMed provides Narval, the market leading 3D printed dental device for treatment of sleep apnea with dental treatment in western and northern Europe. In addition, we have investments in third-line therapies, including pharmaceutical options with our investment in ApneaMed and hyperglossal nerve stimulation technology with our investment in NIC SOA. So, let's step back and talk about broadly our digital health technology investments. Leveraging an extraordinary ecosystem of almost 19 billion nights of de-identified medical data, we are developing and continue to expand our portfolio of artificial intelligence driven capabilities, as well as customer facing AI products that we're launching into the market from our ecosystem. We continue to roll out and expand the AI products in AirView such as compliance coach in the United States and our new smart coaching pilot which is expanding into a few new countries as we go through our current quarter, which is Q1 of fiscal year 2025 and beyond. We are also progressing with our generative AI capabilities to help patients along their health journey. A project that was initially piloted within our Asia Pacific region, our generative AI sleep concierge that we call Dawn and yes, that is a reference to the sun rising at dawn after a great night of sleep. Dawn was recently expanded from Asia Pac into our US market. We'll continue to share the progress on this front of GenAI and simple ML and generic AI as well, as this tech is further developed and scaled across our business. It's going to enhance the user experience and drive consumer awareness and what we're focused on is outcomes, not the tech, but what it can do for a patient, a physician, a provider. In our residential care software as a service business, we had another strong quarter with year-over-year growth of 10%, supported by strength in our home medical equipment provider business through our Brightree brand, as well as very strong growth in our home nursing and nursing home business with our MEDIFOX DAN brand. We've made very good progress in the business segment throughout fiscal 2024 and we plan to maintain high single-digit growth to low double-digit growth throughout each quarter in fiscal year 2025. But really importantly, we're driving operating leverage and we're going to have very strong double-digit net operating profit growth from our residential care software business sector in 2025. Our residential care software business is integral to the broader ResMed growth portfolio with ongoing synergistic growth opportunities across our businesses. We are accelerating growth across our residential care software business intrinsically, but we're also helping to support the core business through mask and accessory resupply growth. We continue to drive operating leverage by managing across our businesses with capabilities managed such as cloud compute, cybersecurity, interoperability, privacy and research and development velocity across our software platforms and with our core sleep, health and breathing health businesses. We are transforming respiratory medicine and residential care software at scale. We are leading the industry in developing, applying and adopting digital health technology across the 140 plus countries that we serve. We continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our operations. We're focused on driving top line revenue growth, but with strong cost discipline and increasing efficiencies to accelerate profitability at the bottom line. We made excellent progress on that this quarter. The global team delivered growth in non-GAAP operating income of 30%. The global team also delivered growth in non-GAAP net income of 30%. I'm more than incredibly proud of our global team and their performance. We provide differentiated products and solutions for customers worldwide, driving long term sustainable value for our shareholders. We lead the industry in digital health technology with the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, most connected and most intelligent technologies. During the last 12 months, we have improved over 178 million lives by delivering a medical device directly to a patient, or a complete mask directly to a patient, or a digital health software solution that provides personal care. We've helped each person sleep better, breathe better and live higher quality lives with best-in-class healthcare delivered right where they live. In closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to 10,000 plus ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication today and every day across 140 countries. Thank you, team. With that, I'll hand the call over to our CFO Brett, who's in Sydney this morning for his remarks, and then we'll open up to Q&A with the global team here in San Diego and Sydney. Over to you Brett. Well, thanks for your question, Lyanne. That lets me talk through our really strong growth I believe in our devices business. Just to refresh in Q4 fiscal year '23 just 12 short months ago we were talking about US device growth of 30% and Europe, Asia, rest of world growth of 15%. So incredible double-digit comps that we're building these numbers off and we saw really good growth in the US of 5% growth in our US, Canada, Latin America and we saw 8% growth in Europe, Asia, rest of the world. We're in full competition with all the players out there and as you said, 6% constant currency globally. Look, you know, the market is growing in that mid-single digits and we are holding share or gaining share. But really now as the global market leader, our primary focus is on demand generation. Where are their capacities in the field for screening, diagnosis, treatment and management? That we can drive appropriate demand generation not to overflow the channel, but to make sure that any spare capacity in screening, diagnosis and treatment and management can come through. So, I was very impressed by those numbers. I think they're right in line with market and slightly ahead in Europe, Asia and rest of world. And I think the team did incredibly well. And we're doing it through patient flow, which is very strong. And yes, there are some ASP changes in there. They're kind of small. Our costs have gone up, and we did have some adjustments to pricing over the last 12 months. But the primary generator here is the flow of patients, which, as I said in the prep remarks, we're seeing really good flow of patients. And our job as the global market leader is to continue to have that grow and grow even faster as we go throughout the fiscal years ahead. Thanks for your question. So, thanks for the question, Steve. I'll hand that over to Brett to cover some issues around GM and really good accretion of our gross margin year-on-year and sequentially, Brett, over to you. So Brett, back to you, gross margin. Yes. Thanks for the question, Mike. And yes, our -- I guess I'll call them our #4 competitor right now, right, because they've dropped down to fourth in new patient share globally. That competitor is back in many markets in Europe Asia and Rest of World, we grew in the quarter, 8% in Europe, Asia, rest of the world on a comp of 15%. So, if you see which I do, the market growing in mid-single digits. ResMed is taking share in Europe, Asia, rest of the world relative to our competition. So, competitors from Europe like the one you named, but there's other ones that have higher share and competitors from Asia who have higher shares than them. And so, I think that competitor as they come back are having to earn their way back. We've got to try to repair their brand, try to repair their approach that they're going to have a safe and efficacious product, and they're competing with the Tier 2, Tier 3 players and working their way in. They had a call last week, and they sound like they're growing from a very low base to something better, and that's good on them. I love competition. ResMed is the market leader. We have the smallest, quietest, the most comfortable devices, but more important than that, they're the most connected and the most intelligent and it's all about the ecosystem of AirView and myAir and getting those data to the cloud and getting to doctors, getting to physicians. So yes, that competitor is back in a number of markets. And as we said last quarter, the quarter before, we were beating them from 2010 to 2019, 2020 before they had the recall, and we're going to beat them as they come back and we've shown that this quarter, and we'll continue to show it going forward. Look, it's a good question because we talk about mask growth being high single digits. And then obviously, in this quarter. We performed right there in Europe, Asia, rest of the world at 9%, right there in that high single digits. Then in U.S., Canada, Latin America, we performed at 17% growth. On a pretty good comp actually of 19% from the year before. So double digit on double digit. Look, you're not going to grow double digits in masks forever when the market is growing at high single digits, and you are the clear market leader. But you can drive demand generation and you can drive better resupply programs. And I said in the prep remarks, we've done a lot of investment in Brightree, Snap Technologies and all of the digital health technology that we have to support home medical equipment providers here in the U.S. market. And then globally, we've really set up some great subscription programs where people, frankly, I think, have been underserved in Europe, Asia and rest of world with the ability to get fresh equipment if they love their device and they love their mask, why isn't it super simple to just click on an app see the price and get a drop ship delivery of a device to your place in a cash pay market where those same people are doing the same and have done with Amazon and all the other WeChat in China, Amazon, the U.S., et cetera, et cetera, globally. Everyone has seen this in the consumer field. And so I think health care needs to catch up and be more consumer focused and in those cash pay markets. We've set up some great subscription programs. And in the more regulated provider-based markets like the U.S. and Europe, we're really partnering with our providers like never before. So that's how we saw the outperformance. That's how we saw the extra demand generation. That's how we saw the extra resupply. Our goal is to meet or beat market growth every quarter that we go ahead. The team did it really well this quarter, and I have confidence that we'll be able to do it going forward. Thanks for the question about masks. It's a really important part of our business. Yes, David, it's a really good question, and it's sort of the 3.5 decade question for ResMed, right, which is how do you get people screen diagnosed and treated for a disease, whether they're unconscious when they suffer from it in sleep apnea, being asleep while you have the suffocation. So, education, awareness and better protocols to get patients into the funnel screening diagnosis, treatment and management has been our decades long mission. And look, we did very well, I think, going through COVID and on the other side to apply increases in home sleep apnea testing increases in remote patient monitoring and technology that we've used to help. And so, I do think the big pharma GLP-1 trend is bringing more and more patients in and they're very motivated patients. You saw our latest update on our real-world evidence, 111,000 patients seeing 10.7 absolute percentage points, high propensity to start CPAP. These are very motivated patients over the average patient. And I think that's a big trend. You didn't mention in your question, but I will, David, consumer tech, the wearables. I mean, Samsung dropping the mic there on the other consumer tech companies to say, we've got a de novo clearance to screen for monitor severe sleep apnea from a watch, from the Samsung Galaxy Watch. And I know the Apple Watch has an oximeter on it, and they can do the same. We know Google's Fitbit team have been doing sleep architecture for years. And they will start to recognize many patients with this. So, the real question is not will there be a flow of patients from consumer tech and big pharma. That's going to happen. The real question is, can ResMed really pick up and fight and be the world leader in a digital sleep health concierge to take that sleep concern consumer and help them find a path to a health care specialist to a protocol to a system that gets them screened, diagnosed and treated. We're making good progress on it. We've got a number of experiments globally. We're partnering with an ecosystem of other smaller players out there as well as our own technology in all 140 countries. I can tell you the experiments are happening, and we're seeing some success. The question of the inflection point, look, I do think we can take market growth rate and move it up by 50, 75, 100, maybe even 125 basis points. We're not going to double it. It's a huge, huge global franchise now. Look at our trailing 12 months revenue north of $4.5 billion, but I do think we can move it up 50, 75, 125 basis points by bringing these new technologies that help with that digital sleep pathway. Yes, I'm aware I've got a disease, my watch has told me I'm at risk what do I do about it? ResMed needs to be there to help that person find their pathway through the convoluted frankly, global health care systems to therapy. For those who are coming in the big pharma one, they're already in the health care system. They're going to a primary care physician or a specialist doctor. So that's an even easier route where it's more about education and driving the traditional channels. So we're working both, social media, digital and traditional channels. And together, I do think there's opportunities to accelerate market growth and watch this space. We've done well over the years, and we've learned a lot in these last five years. And now as the global leader, it's our obligation to do this, and we're all over it. Thanks for the question, David. Yes. Good question, Gretel. Over to you, Brett. And it feels like this is the after call with modeling. But over to you, Brett. Can hear you loud and clear, Suraj. Great. Well, I'll take the first question around pricing impact. And then Brett, you'll take the sneaky second question there around -- sneaky, I mean, by getting it in upfront, Suraj, not the question itself, on inventory levels, particularly with masking accessories. And we saw the total inventory come down, but I think it's specifically Brett on masks and accessories. So firstly, on pricing impact, look, Suraj, you and all the sell side, you guys do your investigations and you look and talk to our customers, particularly in the U.S. and ask about pricing. You know that as a company, you've followed us over the last few fiscal years, we did see cost of components go up with inflation with shipping costs that have gone -- we've had increased cost of goods sold that ResMed has had to deal with, and we've shared some of that, not all of it. We've shared some of that with our customers with some increase in pricing. Often associated directly with innovation, right? The AirSense 11 was higher priced than the AirSense 10, but it's small, it's quiter. It's more comfortable. It's more connected. It has 2-way comps. It has over-the-year upgrades. It has all these advances. And so, it has a high price point. Similarly, with new mask inventions, the F40 is out there. It's a great mask. We don't need a price discount on something that is that much better than the competition. It's the smallest full-face mask, the smallest oral nasal mask in the history, a 35-year history of ResMed. So that -- those will be at price premiums. And so don't break out the exact breakdown on devices or masks of pricing or volume. But I can tell you, the vast majority of our growth was all on volumes. It's all about getting more of the one billion-plus patients with a sleep apnea, the half billion patients with insomnia and half billion with COPD into the system, so they can get better fleet and better breathing. So we focus primarily on that screening diagnosis treatment, get the volume in, and then ASP is a component in that where we have increased costs. Look, frankly, I hope inflation comes down and costs come down, and we can share some savings with our customers because they have a tough time with reimbursement often not going up. At least the U.S. Medicare went up at the start of this year, in line with an inflation adjustment, but not all insurance companies around the world do that. And so, our job is to get more patients in to make sure the channel is profitable so that we can have more money to invest in getting awareness out to all the patients who need our help. That's my answer to the first half. Brett, over to you to talk about inventory and masks and accessories, particularly. Yes, Margaret, it's a great set of questions. And it really is one question, right? It's really about that demand generation and how we can as a company best leverage what is, frankly, once in a generation in the pharmaceutical cycle. And I think maybe once in a generation on the wearable cycle from consumer tech of a bolus of patients over the coming one, three, five, 10 years. So, look, yes, we want -- we aspire to be this digital health concierge and digital health concierge specifically for sleeping and breathing. Look, I mean, obviously, when we're providing technology, if we're providing a service that is a service that's out there in the health care field, we're going to be charging for it. But in the context of helping people find access to information, ResMed has the world's leading database with 19 billion nights of medical data in the cloud. We have more knowledge than anyone on the planet. I wouldn't call it a data lake, but I'd call it a data well, it's a bunch of deep, deep information about the field of sleep and breathing and about patients how they get to sleep, how they breath all night, and how they wake up and have mask leak and/or apneas and/or issues. And so with that, we want to bring that information and bring it to the world. For instance, we don't charge patients for myAir. Patients get access because we believe they paid their insurance. They -- in markets that are cash pay, they paid for that product with their own cash. So I believe they have the right to access their own data on their myAir app. So if they sign up, there's 8.3 million patients, they get myAir for free. So in a similar context, I would want patients to be able to find access to a pathway on a sort of freemium basis. If there's advanced analytics and advanced information we're doing that does. AI isn't free, a lot of engineers to write it and a lot of energy consumed in the algorithms as they run. We probably will charge for some of those advanced information similar to what we do with AirView with our providers and physicians. So sleep health concierge, there will be freemium basis and will be out there. There probably will be some pay -- for the really advanced folks. But the primary goal is to help the billion people find their path to treatment. Now to your specific questions about quantifying how many patients in the channel, how many extra have we got from consumer tech, from big pharma versus from standard referrals. We do have some analytics and measurement on that. They're internal and they're not for sort of public consumption. If I say them here on the call, they become public for them. But I can tell you we are productively paranoid about analyzing this channel. The flow of patients in where they come from and how they come from, what we can do to drive more patients in from each element of that. how we can get an ROI of either direct consumer advertising or social media-driven advertising and really track the return on that. So watch this space, a lot of investment from ResMed. It is our brand promise to help people get better sleep, better breathing and better care at home. And we're the world leader. It's our duty to do so. So I do believe, to answer the sort of third part of your question, bringing the funnel together, it is all about that. We achieved incredible growth, double-digit growth, as you said, across the business, north of 6% in devices, north of 15% in masks and incredible growth in our respiratory care -- sorry, residential care services and software at 10%. So really proud of the team. Our goal to keep doing it and keep doing it quarter in, quarter out, and the team is on it. So thanks for your question, Margaret. Yes. Thanks for your question, Anthony. It's a broad one. It allows me to talk about diagnostics rates, but also the different sort of, as you said, continuum of care of the therapies for obstructive sleep apnea or sleep apnea in general. So yes, the Wisconsin Cohort, The Sleep Heart Health Study is a fantastic multi-decade study and really Terry Young and her colleagues have done incredibly well to have such a broad study across the field. It does talk about the United States having diagnostic rates in that 15% to 20% rate. But it is a U.S.-based study in the Sleep Heart Health Study. It's out of Wisconsin, it's U.S. based. It doesn't talk about Europe. And in Western Europe, the diagnostic rate is well south of 10% across Europe. And in Asia Pacific, MEA and rest of world and Latin America, we're less than 5% penetrated into this. And if you just look at the macro of it, right, we've got -- and we brag about it. We're so proud of having 28 million patients in our ecosystem. That's out of one billion patients worldwide. So that's 2.8% of patients in our ecosystem. And we're the world leader. We're the world leader in digital health, not just for respiratory medicine, but across the board with 19 billion nights of data. So globally, this is a single-digit penetration market. And so, I welcome firstly, patients need treatment. I welcome all alternative therapies. We're investing in all alternative therapies. We invest in CPAP, APAP, bilevel, obviously, world leader in that. We're investing in dental therapy. We're the world leader in naval 3D printed devices for Western Europe and Northern Europe, #1 in three different dental devices in those regions. And we're investing in pharma with our at need investment and we're investing in hypoglycem with our XR investment. So we want to take care of every single patient. But the goal when you talk about the continuum of care, if you're a physician, payer provider and you're looking at the holistic system, you want lowest cost most efficacious, least invasive, most reversible and the most used in terms of data of lowering death rates 39% -- sorry, 29% reduction in mortality rates that we've seen PAP across our Alaska study. So our goal is, yes, get that patient in the sleep health concierge channel, get them to the best therapy, which is start with CPAP, as you said, probably upgrade sometimes to APAP, sometimes bilevel. If you fail all of those and maybe 10% of the patients, we just can't get there, 10% plus, we then will help them find a path to dental therapy, which is the next most efficacious therapy. Then after that, based on SIM out study, probably pharma comes a little bit ahead of hypoglossal nerve stim in efficacy, right? They're talking 60% AHI reduction versus just north of 50% for some of the surgical ones. So probably third-line therapy is going to be either GLP-1 or an apnemed-type product. And I think that all of the above are great, and we're investing in all of the above. And look, if you can't tolerate the see the dental and you won't take a pill, you probably do need to have that implant because some treatments better than no treatment. And we know that if you're treated for the suffocation, you're going to have lower incidences of heart attack, stroke, all-cause mortality and you're going to be less costly to the health care system. We have dose response relationship data showing for every hour on positive airway pressure therapy. We see 7% to 8% reduction in emergency room costs. So our goal is to continue and be part of this ecosystem and help patients find their pathway to therapy. We are seeing more patients coming from this. I hope it does increase that diagnostic percentage because it's our obligation as an industry to do so. Thanks for the question, Anthony. Yes, Saul, thanks for the question. And look, we're looking at the real-world evidence every single way that we can. And yes, certainly, the SURMOUNT-OSA data had a pretty extraordinary trial, right, where they had the patients with the sleep coach, a nutrition coach, an exercise coach, they were calling them and interacting with them every day. So even people in the placebo arm had incredible reductions in weight and some really big reductions in HI in the placebo one, where they got no pharmaceutical medication, whatsoever, either saline or nothing. And so look, I think that under that circumstance, there's roughly 600 patients, plus or minus. They have some extraordinary results. But even in all those circumstances, they still weren't as good as dental devices and certainly nowhere near the 95% reduction in HI that any doctor would want with positive airway pressure therapy. But look, look, it certainly was larger than many people thought in the HR reduction. So, I think it's great. I think it means that those two companies that are investing in this are going to go through, getting the indication for use, and then they're going to be out there doing DTC advertising, which in the U.S, you can do a late-night television, and they'll be out there. They'll find some catchy tune and it'll will be out there driving patients into the funnel, and I think it will be good for all of us in the therapeutic side. We're definitely looking at the churn rates and CPAP quitters, APAP quitters, bilevel quitters and really looking in detail at it. I can tell you, in aggregate, we've seen no change on the data. And as you know, the latest generation GLP-1s, some of them have been out there one year, three years, four years plus these latest gen, and we're not seeing any increase in that. We're looking at it real-world data, and we're analyzing left, right and center, but we're not seeing an increase in quitters rates. If anything, we're seeing more motivated patients come in and holding on more. The combination therapy, which is what the primary investigators in this talk about, which is CPAP plus drug therapy as in I'm managing my weight and my suffocation are really there. And the vast majority of patients have incredible residual apnea at levels that would be treated by any primary care physician in the planet even under the very controlled circumstances of this trial, let alone what's going to actually happen in the real world. So we're watching it. We have a really strong focus on it. We've got 811,000 patients in our study. and we'll continue to publish data on it. And as we get more and more, we'll go even more to publish an American Thoracic Society, European Respiratory Society and get in the Blue Journal and all the big journals to have this down there in the clinical literature as well as the subjects that we're looking at in our analysis. Thanks for the question, Saul. Yes. Thanks, Kevin, and thank you to all of our stakeholders for joining us on this call. The opportunities in front of us, as you heard from all these questions, huge and largely untapped. It's an incredible runway. We see more and more people coming into the health system, and this will benefit us as we help them sleep better, breathe better and live better lives in 140 countries. Thank you to all the ResMedians, who listen to this call around the world. Many of you are also shareholders. So thank you for what you do today and every day. With that, I'll hand the call back to you, Amy."

During today\u2019s call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures that we believe provide useful information for investors. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review the supporting schedules in today\u2019s earnings press release to reconcile the non-GAAP measures with the GAAP reported numbers. In addition, our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We make these statements based on reasonable assumptions, however, our actual results could differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to ResMed\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Mick Farrell.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today. Our third quarter fiscal year 2024 results reflect another strong period of execution across our entire business, resulting in solid topline growth and strong double-digit bottomline growth. Our results were driven by ongoing new patient demand for our devices across global markets, high single-digit growth in our Software-as-a-Service business and double-digit global growth in our Masks and Accessories business. This is exceptional performance given that we are annualizing a very strong quarter of growth in the prior year. The recent launch of our ResMed 2030 operating model and our steady focus on driving increased operating leverage are delivering excellent bottomline results and keeping us on a clear trajectory of ongoing profitable growth. Over 2 billion people worldwide suffer from sleep apnea, what I call sleep suffocation, insomnia or respiratory insufficiency due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or neuromuscular disease. These chronic conditions form a healthcare epidemic that ResMed is uniquely positioned to address. We believe that healthcare should be delivered at the lowest cost, lowest acuity and highest comfort location possible. In the optimal case, that\u2019s in a person\u2019s own home. We are the global strategic leader in providing therapies for this epidemic, as well as market-leading enterprise software for Residential Care, including home medical equipment, home nursing and beyond. ResMed is the global leader in digital health solutions with over 18 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 24.5 million 100% cloud-connectable medical devices that have been sold into over 140 countries worldwide. We are the clear leader in sleep apnea, a market of over 1 billion people globally. Our end markets remain significantly underpenetrated. We believe the latest advances in big consumer tech and Big Pharma can potentially bring incredible numbers of new patients into the healthcare system where ResMed is uniquely positioned to provide ongoing care at home. We have a myriad of opportunities to add value, to reduce friction, to improve interoperability, to lower costs and to improve patient outcomes. We\u2019re the global strategic leader with software supporting hundreds of millions of people as they take control of their healthcare journey and navigate the complex healthcare world beyond the hospital system. Many more people can benefit from our products and solutions and we\u2019re laser-focused on growing the market to help people get on the therapy they need and on a pathway to better sleep, better health and better long-term care. Sales of our devices, including the category-leading AirSense platforms, grew 5% year-over-year globally. Excluding the one-time COVID-related ventilator sales in the third quarter of last year, global devices grew about 300 basis points higher than that, so right around 8% global devices growth. We are maintaining supply of two of the two market-leading 100% cloud-connectable platforms, the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11. We\u2019re working to increase the global availability of the AirSense 11 platform by securing market-by-market regulatory clearances. We are following a similar path with our recently launched AirCurve 11 Bilevel and non-invasive ventilator platform as we continue its launch in the U.S. and beyond in the period ahead. Our commercial teams are successfully demonstrating the clinical and economic benefits of the ResMed Mask portfolio. Our Masks and Accessories business achieved 10% growth year-over-year, expanding at or above the market in a competitive category globally. During the quarter, we introduced our latest mask innovation into the U.S. market called the AirFit F40. The F40 features a proprietary new technology that we call AdaptiSeal. It is a silicone cushion designed to create and maintain a better facial seal even when the person is moving frequently during sleep. It leverages a fully flexible frame technology to cope with such frequent nocturnal movement. Physicians, respiratory therapists and patients love the F40 for its comfort, its fit and its ease of use. It is the smallest full-face mask on the market from ResMed. Patients are voting with their wallets and respiratory therapists and physicians are voting with their recommendations and their prescriptions. We look forward to ongoing success in the U.S. and to swiftly bring the F40 to other global markets very soon. Mask and Accessory ReSupply programs are an important element of our offering, as we serve the ongoing therapy needs of patients globally. ResMed\u2019s clinical and commercial teams continue to partner with physicians and providers to drive ReSupply programs directly for their patients. In our cash pay markets, we\u2019ve established a number of subscription programs that have been adopted by consumers. Research shows that ReSupply programs lead to better patient adherence and better long-term clinical outcomes for the patient and their caregivers. In the U.S., our ReSupply programs are powered by our digital health ecosystem, including AirView for physicians, myAir for patients and Brightree for home medical equipment providers. We will continue to develop, launch and scale these technologies, as well as direct subscription programs to help people take control of their own health. Regularly refreshing ongoing therapy needs including masks, tubing, humidifiers and other accessories. Let\u2019s now turn to a discussion of our top three global strategic priorities here at ResMed. Number one is to grow and differentiate our core sleep health and breathing health business. Number two is to design, develop and deliver market-leading medtech and digital health solutions that can be scaled in 140 plus countries worldwide. Number three is to create and leverage the world\u2019s best software solutions for Residential Care. As a global market leader in these significantly underpenetrated markets, our most significant opportunity is actually to expand and grow the market itself through awareness, diagnosis and pathways to treatment. We aspire to be the digital health concierge for each person as they pursue their personal journey to better sleep, better breathing and better care where they live. We are ramping up our demand generation initiatives to do just that. The ResMed 2030 operating model changes that we made recently position us for success as a product-led, customer-centric, brand-enhanced leader in health tech. We\u2019re raising awareness and creating pathways for patients to find access to care for their sleep health and their breathing health across the globe. We are leveraging traditional market channels and investing in cost-effective, social media-driven demand generation campaigns. The goal is to help consumers concerned about their sleep and breathing find their way into appropriate screening, diagnostic, treatment and management pathways. As we continue on our journey to create this digital health concierge for individuals, we are tracking progress with hard metrics. We are looking at new patient starts in our physician and provider-based ecosystem, including AirView, which now contains more than 27 million patient records. We\u2019re also tracking new starts in myAir, our consumer patient engagement app, where people choose to participate in their personalized healthcare journey to better sleep and better breathing. myAir now includes a population of 7.8 million users. We will drive more and more of the over 1 billion people worldwide who need our help for their sleep suffocation into the health care system. We believe two global megatrends will further support our ongoing growth. Awareness driven by consumer tech, specifically sleep tracking wearables like the Samsung Galaxy Watch which has a de novo FDA clearance to screen for sleep apnea. We expect similar capabilities from other wearables from Big Tech including the Apple Watch and Google\u2019s Fitbit. In addition, we believe that the population of patients, the other megatrend, the population of patients coming from Big Pharma as they focus on obesity and related impacts on health, including sleep health, will bring an incredible volume of patients into the healthcare system and the patients will have clinically significant sleep apnea that is best addressed by our therapies post these other therapies. We love this attention from big consumer tech on the field of sleep wellness tracking and we believe that many of these wearable technologies will help consumers find out if they have issues with breathing during sleep or maintaining high quality sleep. This could be one of the biggest waves of people taking control of their own pathway for discovering they have sleep issues like sleep apnea or insomnia or both, a new disease state that has been called by the physicians COMISA. Ultimately, we believe that this will lead to increased patient awareness and sustainable long-term growth for ResMed. Our goal is to educate people as they move from sleep wellness tracking with these wearables to what I call sleep health tracking and from consumer awareness to a true healthcare pathway for screening, diagnosis, treatment and ultimately ongoing management of their sleep health and breathing health. We believe that here at ResMed we are uniquely positioned to help. Big Pharma is squarely focused on GLP-1 medications right now. For many people dealing with their obesity, their healthcare goals are focused on losing weight while improving their diet, exercise and their sleep routines. We believe that increased utilization of GLP-1s to treat obesity will bring many new people into the healthcare funnel, activating them to see their primary care physicians as they strive for weight loss and other medical health. We believe this will open these patients up to knowledge of their other chronic diseases from their primary care physicians, including awareness of chronic diseases such as sleep apnea, ultimately driving new patients into diagnosis and treatment pathways that may not have previously been considered or been treated for those patients. So we believe this will drive not just more patients into our channel, but also more motivated patients into our channel. ResMed has been tracking the impact of GLP-1s through a de-identified patient analysis using an overlap of our data and third-party claims data. With another quarter of data analyzed, we are now up to an incredible N equals 660,000 subjects in our analysis. The bottomline is that the data show that GLP-1s are having a positive impact on patients seeking and adhering to positive airway pressure therapy. The latest numbers are an improvement from what we presented previously. For patients prescribed a GLP-1 medication, the latest data show a 10.5% higher propensity to start positive airway pressure therapy over those not taking the drug. As we follow these patients longitudinally, the ReSupply rate at T equals 12 months is 310 basis points higher. That\u2019s 3.1 absolute basis percentage points higher for patients who have a GLP-1 prescription. And then at T equals 24 months, the ReSupply rate is 500 basis points. So 5.0 absolute percentage points higher for patients who have a GLP-1 prescription. These data show clearly that these new GLP-1 pharmaceutical class is actually a tailwind for our ResMed business, bringing more patients and more motivated patients into the healthcare system. We\u2019ve included the full analysis of these data in our investor deck and I encourage you to review the data there. It\u2019s very positive information and very thorough and detailed work by our healthcare economics and outcomes research, as well as our digital health analytics teams here at ResMed. Existing clinical studies show many factors impact sleep apnea epidemiology, including craniofacial anatomy, age of the subject, gender and weight. With over 1 billion people on the planet with sleep apnea right now, 80% plus of them are undiagnosed in our biggest market, the United States and over 90% of patients are undiagnosed globally. There remains an incredible opportunity to help people sleep and breathe better through positive airway pressure therapy, the universally recognized gold standard for treating sleep apnea. We look forward to more patients entering the healthcare system for care and more motivated patients who can get on our therapy faster and stay on it longer. In terms of best-in-class treatments for sleep apnea, achieving that goal of good sleep and good breathing, we have peer-reviewed and published evidence demonstrating that we can achieve over 87% of patients\u2019 adherent to our positive airway pressure technology by combining our market-leading device platforms, our market-leading masks, with our digital health solutions. Even with this best-in-class global tech, just over 10% of patients still need alternative therapies, and we have a very high volume of patients coming through these days. We\u2019re investing in alternative therapies and we\u2019re working to help patients who just can\u2019t adhere to positive airway pressure therapy despite the latest technology to find their path to second-line therapies, such as dental devices, where ResMed has the market-leading 3D printed dental device on the planet for sleep apnea in Western Europe and Northern Europe. That\u2019s called Narval. In addition, we have investments in third-line therapies, including pharmaceutical options. We\u2019re an investor in Apnimed, and we\u2019re also an investor in hypoglossal nerve-stimulation technology through our investment in a company called Nyxoah. ResMed is about sleep health, it\u2019s about breathing health and it\u2019s about delivering the best care right where you live. We make sure the person finds the path to the highest efficacy, lowest cost, most comfortable therapy that\u2019s best for them. Let\u2019s pivot now to talk about our digital health technology investments, leveraging our 18 billion nights of de-identified medical data in the cloud and our 24.5 100% cloud-connectable devices that are out there in our ecosystem across 140 countries. We are investing in a portfolio of artificial intelligence-driven capabilities, as well as customer-facing AI products in our ecosystem. We continue to roll out these products in our AirView ecosystem, such as Compliance Coach, that I talked about last quarter, that\u2019s rolling out in the United States. We\u2019re also progressing well with our generative AI capabilities to help patients along their journey, really people before they\u2019re patients and then they become people seeking sleep health and breathing health solutions, and then on their journey they become patients. And we\u2019re rolling out that gen AI capability in the Asia-Pac region for now and we\u2019ll look to scale that as we move forward. We\u2019ll continue to share progress on this front, as this revolutionary tech is developed and scaled across our business and many of medtech and health tech peers are doing the same and our ecosystem will move forward. Our Respiratory Health business continues to be supported by sustained activity across our non-invasive ventilator platforms and our life-support ventilator platforms. We continue to invest in clinical and economic trials for high-flow therapy that we call HFT to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at home at a cost-effective rate. This is a long-term opportunity focused on generating evidence, developing pathways and driving new reimbursement options. We are focused on driving adoption of these technologies for treatment at home. The prevalence of respiratory insufficiency due to COPD, as well as neuromuscular diseases, continues to increase, and we have low-cost, high-efficacy and high-tech treatments in HFT and beyond to address this healthcare epidemic. Turning to our Software-as-a-Service business in the field of Residential Care, we have another strong quarter with year-over-year growth of 8%. We plan to maintain high single-digit growth in the remainder of fiscal year 2024 and we plan to accelerate to double-digit growth for our Residential Care Software-as-a-Service business on an organic basis throughout fiscal year 2025. We are seeing ongoing customer-facing synergies between our Brightree offering in the U.S. and our core home medical equipment channel and its ReSupply capabilities. We are driving good growth across both our Residential Care SaaS and our core sleep health and breathing health businesses while serving many hundreds of thousands of patients. Our Residential Care SaaS business is integral to ResMed\u2019s growth portfolio and we\u2019re excited to have created a global business that will achieve double-digit growth on an organic basis throughout fiscal year 2025. We continue to drive OpEx leverage by managing our capabilities for cloud compute, cybersecurity, interoperability, privacy and R&D across our go-to-market brands that include Brightree, MatrixCare, and MEDIFOX DAN. And those synergies go not just across the SaaS businesses, but also directly into our core sleep health and breathing health business. And beyond this infrastructure leverage, our Residential Care SaaS business drives platform development synergies and customer engagement facilities and capabilities that are synergies as well, and these highly complement the market-leading medtech and software solutions capability that\u2019s there right in our core sleep health and breathing health business ecosystem, including products like AirView and myAir and beyond. We are transforming Respiratory Medicine and Residential Care at scale. We are leading the industry in developing, applying and adopting digital health technology across our markets. We continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our operations. We\u2019re focused on driving topline revenue growth, focused cost discipline and increased efficiencies to accelerate profitability all the way to the bottomline, and we made very good progress on that this quarter. The team delivered non-GAAP operating income up 23% and non-GAAP net income up 27%. We have created differentiated products and solutions for customers worldwide, driving long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. We lead the industry in digital health technology with the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, most connected, and most intelligent medtech solutions. During the last 12 months, we have improved over 174 million lives by delivering a medical device directly to a patient, a complete mask system to a patient or a digital health software solution that provides personal care for a patient right where they live. We\u2019ve helped each person sleep better, breathe better and live higher quality lives with best-in-class healthcare. In closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the more than 10,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication today and every day. Thank you. With that, I\u2019ll hand over the call to Brett in Sydney for his remarks and then we\u2019ll open up to Q&A with the entire team between Sydney and San Diego. Over to you, Brett.\nBrett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I\u2019ll provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 and let\u2019s note that all comparisons out of the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms were applicable. We had strong financial performance in Q3. Group revenue for the March quarter was $1.2 billion, a 7% headline increase and a 7% increase in constant currency terms. Revenue growth reflects positive and consistent contributions across our product and ReSupply portfolio. Year-over-year movements in foreign currencies had a negligible impact on revenue during the March quarter. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 9%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 3%. Globally, device sales increased by 5%, while masks and other sales increased by 10%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 7%, supported by solid ongoing new patient diagnosis, while masks and other sales increased by 12%, reflecting growth in both ReSupply and new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales increased by 1% on a constant currency basis. Year-over-year growth moderated due to incremental revenue in the prior year quarter of approximately $15 million from COVID-related demand. Excluding the COVID-related sales, device revenue increased by 8% on a constant currency basis. Masks and other sales increased by 6% on a constant currency basis. Software-as-a-Service revenue increased by 8% in the March quarter, underpinned by growth from MEDIFOX DAN and continued strong performance from our HME Vertical. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release. Gross margin increased by 240 basis points to 58.5% in the March quarter. The increase was driven by reductions in freight expense, manufacturing cost improvements, favorable product mix and an increase in device average selling prices. Sequential gross margin improved by 160 basis points. We continue to monitor potential headwinds that could arise from the Middle East conflict. Disruptions in the Red Sea have increased freight costs and shipping lead times. We estimate this will negatively impact our Q4 gross margin by around 30 basis points to 50 basis points. Moving on to operating expenses, SG&A expenses for the third quarter increased by 1%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 19.2%, compared to 20.5% in the prior year period and reflect savings and ongoing cost discipline following restructuring actions undertaken early in the December quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 20% for the balance of fiscal year 2024. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 2% on a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.4%, compared to the 6.8% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for the balance of fiscal year 2024. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 23%, underpinned by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and modest growth in our operating expenses. Our net interest expense for the quarter was $11 million. Given our lower debt levels, we expect interest expense to be in the range of $7 million to $9 million in the final quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 20.3%, broadly consistent with the prior year quarter. We continue to estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the March quarter increased by 27% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 27%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $402 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings and improvement in our working capital position. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $21 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $43 million. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $238 million. On March 31 we had $1 billion in gross debt and $676, sorry, $769 million in net debt. During the quarter we reduced our debt by $220 million. On March 31 we had approximately $1.2 billion available for drawdown under our revolver facility and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Today our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share. During the quarter we purchased 261,000 shares under our previously authorized share buyback program for consideration of $50 million. We plan to continue to purchase shares for the value of approximately $50 million per quarter for the balance of fiscal year 2024. This will more than offset any dilution from the vesting of equity to employees during the year. Going forward we plan to continue to reinvest in gross through R&D, pay down outstanding debt and deploy further capital for tucking acquisitions. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Brett. Thanks Mick. Kevin, let\u2019s go ahead and turn the call back over to you to provide the instructions and then run the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Dan Hurren from MST Marquee. Your line is now live.\nDan Hurren: Thanks very much and good morning. Look, I just wanted to ask about that gross margin predictably. That recovery is pretty sharp whereas I think you had perhaps talked to a more modest gross margin recovery in the second half. So I just wanted to ask how sustainable that recovery is into fourth quarter and into 2025?\nMick Farrell: Yeah. Thanks Dan. It\u2019s a good question and obviously as we talked about on the call a quarter ago and two quarters ago we\u2019ve got long-term programs and short-term programs that are moving very carefully to move our gross margin up. Some -- very long-term as we walk through the launch of our AirSense 11 platform which is at a better cost point, a better price point. Launch of our new masks, the F40 last quarter and these have effects that go over long-term. Some of the faster impacts we\u2019re able to do is working through the inventory that were high freight costs from the semiconductor crisis and the supply chain crisis from six months, nine months, 12 months, 18 months ago that are flowing through our system. So look, I\u2019m not upset when the team overperforms my expectations as they did here. As Brett said in Q4 we\u2019ll see some moderation of that due to Red Sea impacts of a couple of tens of basis points, sort of 30 basis points, 40 basis points. Brett can give more detail on that. But look Dan, I\u2019m very, what I\u2019m excited about...\nOperator: Please stand by. We appear to be having technical difficulties. Please stand by.\nMick Farrell: He cannot. Brett says he can\u2019t hear us.\nOperator: Please proceed.\nBrett Sandercock: Okay.\nOperator: Please proceed.\nBrett Sandercock: Can you hear me now, Kevin?\nOperator: We can now. Please proceed. We did lose your audio briefly. We do apologies. Please proceed.\nMick Farrell: Okay. Great. Well I\u2019ll hand over to Brett to answer the question on gross margin and then I\u2019ll follow up. I don\u2019t know where I got cut off there. Brett, you do. Over to you.\nBrett Sandercock: Yes. Thanks, Mick. I\u2019m not sure where that landed, but, yeah, in terms of gross margin, it is hard to predict given the movements in, we have product mix, geographic mix, timing of cost improvements, FX, freight costs. So it\u2019s all into the mix that we had pretty strong improvement through freight expense, through manufacturing efficiencies and so on coming through and that helped a lot. Stable component costs also means that\u2019s no longer a headwind there. So I think that\u2019s all reflected in the gross margin improvement. And as Mick said, in the short-term, there is some Red Sea freight cost impacts that will come through in Q4 but our goal remains to improve gross margin over the course of FY 2025.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Laura Sutcliffe from UBS. Your line is now live.\nLaura Sutcliffe: Hello. Thanks for taking my question. Just sticking with gross margin, could you possibly give us an indication of how much of that 240-basis-point improvement in core gross margin was freighting and how much was manufacturing? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Brett, you can answer that.\nBrett Sandercock: Sure. Yeah. Thanks, Mick. Yeah. I mean, that -- of that year-on-year, the 240 basis points, the biggest contributors were the freight cost reduction and also the manufacturing cost improvements were the biggest drivers there. We saw some benefit or some favorable product mix playing out there and a little bit in terms of ASP increases, but by far the most significant two, which were significantly contributed in their own right, were the freight expense reduction and the manufacturing cost improvements.\nLaura Sutcliffe: Are you able to tell us sort of how it falls between freighting and manufacturing cost improvement?\nBrett Sandercock: I would say -- I wouldn\u2019t get drawn into specifics of each of the components, but I would say, both of those are material in their own right of contributing to that 240 basis points.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Craig Wong-Pan from RBC. Your line is now live.\nCraig Wong-Pan: Thank you. I just wanted to touch on the rest of world markets to see whether you\u2019re seeing much impact from business there and if any benefit was coming through from the backlog of activity with home care companies?\nMick Farrell: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Craig. And yeah, no, we really didn\u2019t see, I mean, look, we\u2019ve got many competitors out there in Europe, Asia, rest of the world, including the one you mentioned, and it\u2019s a full playing field. It has been the whole time on masks, so there\u2019s no change to anyone coming back or leaving on the mask side. On the device side, no huge impacts. We were comping a very large device number, Europe, Asia, rest of the world, this quarter last year, we had a 36% growth that we\u2019re comping. And so we had good growth there on a 36% comp at plus 1%. And if you take out from last year, a large ventilation provision in China, this time a year ago, China had a big COVID impact on ventilator purchase. If you take that out, the year-on-year growth would have been 8% in Europe, Asia, rest of world devices. So up 700 basis points. So look, the way I look at it is, we\u2019re maintaining or growing share in all of our markets on the device side. We\u2019re the market leader with the AirSense 11 platform. And we\u2019ve got the second best platform in the world with the AirSense 10 platform against all competitors and so really strong there. So no major impacts from restocking and no major impacts from competitive activity and I think we had a very, very strong performance from the team in terms of their ability to ramp up the supply over the last period and get it all out there. And we\u2019re not -- no customer is not being able to fulfill an order. If they have an order for devices, we fill it up as much as we can with AirSense 11s and then we fill up the remainder with AirSense 10s and we\u2019re able to take care of those customer needs and so really good quarter of execution by our supply chain teams, as well as our delivery teams and our commercial teams out there.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from David Bailey from Macquarie. Your line is now live.\nDavid Bailey: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Mick and Brett. I just want to touch on new patient starts, maybe focusing on the U.S. if we can. Obviously, COVID had the impact of closing sleep labs and then followed on by some supply constraints around devices. Can you just give us a bit of a sense as to how you\u2019re seeing new patient starts at the moment versus a trend, perhaps, and then also just touching on trends around home sleep testing versus PSG and how that might be impacting people coming to the system?\nMick Farrell: Yeah. Two great components to the same question there, David. In terms of new patient starts, as you saw in U.S., Canada, Latin America, we achieved pretty strong growth of 7% of devices in the quarter and that was on a comp, this time last year of 49%. So what I\u2019d say is, and this is what we say, is that the market is sort of, if ResMed doesn\u2019t do enough around demand gen, the market will grow at mid-single digits on devices and high-single digits on masks. Obviously, we beat that this quarter with our device growth in the U.S, Canada, Latin America at 7%. So new patient starts are strong. There is some repat there, but it\u2019s a minority, and I can tell you that new patient flow into our channel has been steady. And we said this last quarter that we\u2019re starting to get back to that steady flow of patients. We\u2019ve sort of gone through the perturbations of the COVID dip, the COVID rebound, the supply chain dip, the supply chain rebound, and now we\u2019re at steady state. So seeing really good flow of patients into the U.S. As I said on the prepared remarks, we are seeing these patients who come in on the GLP-1s and it\u2019s only N equals 660,000 patients that we\u2019re looking at, but that\u2019s quite a big cohort. And as we look at those patients, their propensity to start being 10.5% above people without a prescription for that drug, I actually think we\u2019re seeing a really good flow that I think will be a long-term, I think, there\u2019s a long period of time, the S-curve of penetration of these GLP-1s, and I think, that\u2019s going to be a long cohort of patients coming into the channel. So really good on new patient starts. And in terms of ReSupply, yeah, look, we\u2019ve got really good capabilities in the U.S., particularly with Brightree and Snap technologies and Brightree ReSupply, and our subscription models and our cash pay markets around the world. But there\u2019s a lot more runway left. There\u2019s many patients who aren\u2019t yet on a subscription program and cash pay markets, and there\u2019s many patients who aren\u2019t yet on appropriate resupply in our large and developed markets. So I would say new patient flow in is very solid. ReSupply, whether it\u2019s REPAP or reestablishing masks and accessories, is good, but a lot of runway left, a lot of runway left on both in terms of demand gen and resupply.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Anthony Petrone from Mizuho Group. Your line is now live.\nAnthony Petrone: Thanks, everyone, and congrats on a strong quarter here. Maybe, Mick, just staying on the GLP-1 topic, maybe just the House views on the SURMOUNT-OSA headline readout and as we look to the ADA meeting in June there, anything that you\u2019re really paying attention to and honing in on when we get the final data readout, are there specific secondary endpoints or sub-analyses that we should be focused in on? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Anthony. And yeah, certainly we saw the headline results from that SURMOUNT-OSA trial, and look, since they had, just to be really clear, their study had that at least seven-day washout at the end on the study that had patients that had been using CPAP. So with that seven-day to nine-day washout period at the end, this was really a trial laser-focused on comparing their drug to placebo. And what it showed is somewhere in that sort of 59% to 63% reduction of AHI, and if you do the math on it and you look at the sort of average AHI coming in of around 50%, the average AHI coming out is sort of in the low 20%s. So patients were, at the end of the study, on average, were suffocating every 3 minutes of sleep after treatment for this drug, right? And so AHI of 20% or more, moderate plus sleep apnea, these patients would be treated by any sleep physician on the planet and really require positive airway pressure treatment. So I think that\u2019s the most important thing to say right up front. And so as we look at the readout that\u2019ll come in June when they release the full analysis here and the primary investigators get up and we see all the sub-analysis data, what will be interesting is to look at, because the combination therapy of CPAP plus CAPAP plus these GLP-1s had a slightly higher efficacy, if you like, it had a higher reduction in AHI. I\u2019ll be interested to look on the secondary outcomes, were there more blood pressure reductions and other cardiovascular improvements, heart remodeling and things like that happen over time and the washout period might have diluted that a little bit, it\u2019ll depend on where they took them. But those would be the things that I\u2019d be interested in on this study. As we see it, we\u2019re seeing new patients come in on this and not just anecdotally from the letters I get from patients saying, I\u2019ve been using a GLP-1 and now I\u2019m using a PAP, this combination therapy is great, I\u2019m taking care of my diet, my exercise and my sleep. But we\u2019re seeing real world evidence, real world data that we\u2019re presenting, N equals 660,000 patients and these patients start CPAP more, they adhere more. I mean, the fact that at 12 months ReSupply goes up 3.1%, 310 basis points. The fact that ReSupply at 24 months goes up 500 basis points, 5 absolute percentage points higher, means that this is not only more patients into the funnel from this drug and not just this particular drug from this particular company, but this class of drugs. We included tirzepatide and semaglutide in our analysis and others. All new gen, vast majority new gen tech. And I can tell you, we are going to do our own social media driven demand gen, but the fact that Big Tech with the Samsung Watch, the Apple Watch and Google\u2019s Fitbit are going to be bringing patients in and Big Pharma, and this is trillions of dollars of capital between these companies are going to be doing advertising to drive patients into the funnel. We think this is a net tailwind for our business. We\u2019ve started to see it somewhat now at the very early stages and we think it\u2019ll be there in the future. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be looking for from this study, Anthony.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.\nSuraj Kalia: Mick, can you hear me all right?\nMick Farrell: Yes, I can, Suraj. Hopefully your phone and our phone are good throughout this question and answer.\nSuraj Kalia: So forgive me if there is any background noise. Mick, first and foremost, congratulations on this quarter. Mick, specifically, and I -- forgive me for belaboring this, gross margins, a nice uptick in the quarter. Mick, if I recall correctly, a couple of quarters ago, gross margins were soft and one of the reasons cited was a higher U.S. contribution, which intrinsically has lower margins than OUS. This quarter also, U.S. has ticked up nicely. Contribution has picked up. Maybe I\u2019m missing a key aspect here. Can you help us reconcile those two? Thank you for taking my questions.\nMick Farrell: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Suraj. I\u2019ll have a go first and I\u2019ll hand over to Brett for detail. But as I look at it from my perspective, there are a number of factors that were positives to have such a great gross margin number this quarter. The first one was that we had excellent work by our global supply chain teams to work on getting our cost of goods sold down, not just direct COGS but OCOGS as well. And so we worked through some of that high inventory -- high cost inventory stock moved through the system, and some of the reengineering work and revalidation and verification work we\u2019ve done has been able to bring new product to market. We have a good flow between the AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 platforms. But look, if you look at the growth from like 12 months ago and some of the issues, I mean, we had -- as I said earlier, we had 49% growth in our U.S., Canada, Latin America flow generators a year ago. That has a very big impact on margin as it\u2019s, lower margin than our masks business and other businesses, certainly in our ventilation and software around the world. This quarter, we\u2019re sort of back to a steady state where ResMed\u2019s growing well. We\u2019re growing at mid-to-high single digits in parts of our business and double digits in the masks and accessory side. And I think we\u2019re just back to our core execution, something that ResMed\u2019s done in our 35-year history is have operating excellence and operational excellence as a core competency. We were able to, after all those perturbations of COVID, supply chain, cost of inventory, we\u2019re able to get back to what we do really well. So that\u2019s what I\u2019d say are the main factors for us achieving such great gross margin in the quarter. Brett, do you want to provide any further detail?\nBrett Sandercock: Yeah. Thanks, Mick. I mean, the only thing I would add is the geographic mix impacts tend to be pretty modest. You do see that, but for example, product mixes usually has much more impact than geographic mix. So it\u2019s less of an impact on our margin either way from geographic mix. It\u2019s there, but it\u2019s not substantial.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Margaret Kaczor-Andrew from William Blair. Your line is now live.\nMargaret Kaczor-Andrew: Hey. Good afternoon. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to maybe touch on the market demand drivers and demand gen that you referenced earlier on the call. My recollection can tell me if I\u2019m wrong, but I think you guys have sporadically maybe invested in understanding market growth drivers and the Verily partnership is the one that kind of comes to mind on that. But as you think of demand gen, can you give us any data from those programs that might help inform the demand gen that you\u2019re trying to create? Over what time period can these efforts make that impact on market growth? And again, key sources, is it local level, podcasts, newsletters, global level, celebrity, partnerships? Again, any details would be helpful. Thanks, guys.\nMick Farrell: Well, yeah. Thanks, Margaret. It\u2019s a great question on how we\u2019re going to learn from our many years of experience of getting patients in the funnel and taking it to the next level and scaling globally. As you know, we\u2019ve had sort of direct to consumer campaigns in our cash paid countries, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and others around the world. One of the big changes we made in our 2030 operating model was to establish a Global Chief Product Officer, Global Chief Revenue Officer, but also a Global Chief Marketing Officer. And I think bringing that marketing function to be across the whole of the sleep health and breathing health business, and really across our whole ResMed business, is going to allow us to bring. Yeah, as you said, we did experiments in that joint venture where, by the way, we own all the intellectual property and capability of that joint venture, the assets and capability that we learned over those last many years in that JV. We\u2019ve now taken that on board and we\u2019ve said, okay, let\u2019s not just do that in one metropolitan statistical area in the United States or within one country like Australia or another country like Singapore or Korea. Let\u2019s look at ways we can scale that globally. So without signaling directly and exactly how, where, and when we\u2019re going to do it, I can tell you we\u2019ve got a global team looking at this, Margaret, and as we go throughout fiscal year 2025, we\u2019re going to talk about, as they go public, this is the campaign. One thing that is different from what we did before is that I believe in what gets measured gets done and every single campaign we\u2019re going to do is going to have hardcore metrics of sponsorship here, driven here and influence it there, this social media impact there. We\u2019ll look at the ROI, and before it scales, we\u2019re going to analyze that portfolio of primarily social media but other media-driven demand gen, and yes, it will be local, but it\u2019ll also be national, and there\u2019ll be global. The platforms will be global, the cultural impacts will be national, and then the impact will be local, and we\u2019ll be measuring that direct ROI of that marketing spend. As you saw in the quarter, we were very efficient on SG&A this quarter. We will go back to our steady state on that, not growing at revenue, well below, but getting up to better growth and those investments will go in areas like this, in demand gen on SG&A, and of course, our core R&D growth will go back into AI and generative AI. I can tell you some of our work on generative AI in Asia-Pacific, helping a patient in that digital health concierge through the channel will be a big part of our demand gen as well, so a combination between R&D and SG&A there, but great question, Margaret, and we\u2019ll update you as we move through fiscal year 2025 and beyond on our demand gen initiatives.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Gretel Janu from E&P. Your line is now live.\nGretel Janu: Thanks. Good morning. I just want to go back to the gross margin and more just thinking about the gross margin trajectory into FY 2025, so how should we think about the quantum of improvement likely to be achieved into FY 2025, and where\u2019s that additional step up going to come from now that you\u2019ve kind of normalized a lot of the headwinds that we\u2019ve seen in the last 12 months? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Gretel. Brett, with this great performance from your finance and our global supply chain team, you\u2019re getting all the questions this quarter, so over to you on projections for gross margin for FY 2025 to answer Gretel\u2019s question.\nBrett Sandercock: Yeah. Thanks, Mick. Yeah. Gretel, I mean, there is -- yeah, there\u2019s been quite a good increase year-on-year and freight and some manufacturing efficiencies, cost improvements there, obviously played a big part. We\u2019re also not so much facing the headwinds of these component cost increases that we saw sort of six months to 12 months ago as well. But if you look forward, and it\u2019s always hard to predict, as I mentioned earlier, there\u2019s a lot that plays out on the gross margin, product mix, the timing of the cost improvements or the continuous improvement programs that we\u2019re now running, and we\u2019ve had an opportunity to do that. We\u2019re really, really focused on supply and getting devices into the market. So now as that stabilizes, then that gives us an opportunity to work on cost improvement programs. So we\u2019re focusing on that. So the goal, without being specific on targets, but certainly our goal is to improve gross margin over the course of FY 2025. And we\u2019ve got, probably need to do that on a number of fronts, which is more around a continuous improvement or gradual improvement program now, I think, as we work through FY 2025.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Brett Fishbin from KeyBanc. Your line is now live.\nBrett Fishbin: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Really appreciate some of the updates that you guys have provided on the data front. And I think what stood out to me a lot with the last couple of updates was the 10% plus type of increase that you\u2019re seeing in PAP initiation rates for the GLP users. And then especially considering this isn\u2019t really even reflecting some of the likely marketing activity from pharma. So curious, some of the factors that you think might be driving this correlation and then maybe looking ahead where this number could potentially go once we\u2019re actually seeing patients that are prescribed with under an OSA indication and diagnosed with OSA?\nMick Farrell: Yeah. Brett, it\u2019s a really good question. It\u2019s quite a complex one and I think it\u2019ll play out over time. We\u2019ve obviously got very strong quantitative data with the 660,000 subjects that we\u2019re following in that analysis. But we get a lot of anecdotal information from folks, all the way from folks who are involved in the clinical research to frontline physicians through our network and we position this across 140 countries. These new medications are primarily focused on the U.S. and Western Europe right now. But as we watch, our hypothesis is that this new therapy is bringing people into the healthcare system who weren\u2019t previously there. They weren\u2019t choosing to go as frequently to their GP or their primary care physician. They are now seeing that PCP, that GP, and now they are getting treated for not only their obesity, but now other chronic diseases and we\u2019ve seen this in other disease states from some of our peers here in medtech. But yeah, it\u2019s quite extraordinary to have 10.5% higher propensity to start positive airway pressure therapy. There are not many other factors recently in terms of innovations from biotech and pharma that we\u2019ve seen that could drive this level. And so it is early days as those drugs are penetrated in the U.S., Western Europe, and beyond. But we\u2019re watching it very closely. I do think that these trillions of dollars worth of capital will bring lots of advertising and will bring lots of patients into the funnel. And then our job will be to help those patients to find the best path to the best therapy and the best therapy is positive airway pressure therapy and we\u2019re seeing that in these early days. And yeah, I think as we move forward, we\u2019ll learn more and we\u2019ll keep updating as we go every quarter on our flow of patients that come into the funnel, how we\u2019re seeing them and how we\u2019re taking care of them through our own demand gen, through the demand gen that will be driven by this Big Pharma. And one that we didn\u2019t get a question on, but I talked about on my prepared remarks there on Big Tech. I think the fact that there\u2019ll be wearables on tens of millions, maybe hundreds of millions of people\u2019s wrists, looking at oximetry, looking at nocturnal sleep, looking at nocturnal breathing and helping patients find out if they\u2019re not sleeping well, they\u2019re not breathing well. I think that might actually be a higher tidal wave than the Big Pharma tidal wave. But we\u2019ll watch that as we move forward, DAN. Thanks for the question, Brett.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live.\nMike Matson: Yeah. So with the news that Coops [ph] is exiting the non-invasive ventilation market, is there an opportunity for ResMed to pick up some share in this category? And if so, can you maybe talk about how big you think that market is?\nMick Farrell: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Mike. And the competitor you mentioned is leaving the U.S. market for life support ventilation. They will still, at this point, I think, claim to be coming back with CPAP, APAP and Bilevel. So that Bilevels are non-invasive ventilation. They reach an area of non-invasive ventilation. So we expect them back in that market. Look, I think there are opportunities in ventilation. Obviously, we saw through the COVID crisis, there was a very large volume of ventilators sold into the world in 2020, 2021, 2022. We talked about even just in 2023, we\u2019re lapping a quarter where there were large sales a year ago into China of ventilators. And so I think, if you like, the supply of ventilators into the market is quite high. So there\u2019s no huge sort of immediate opportunity by our competitor leaving life support ventilation in the U.S. But we are there to take care of our customers wherever they are, whatever country they\u2019re in and whatever needs they have. For us, the more material growth is really around driving our CPAP, our APAP and our Bilevels with AirSense 11 and AirCurve 11. And the AirCurve 11, in terms of your question, non-invasive ventilation, has AirCurve S, AirCurve ST and AirCurve FTI. And at the highest level, it has an AirCurve ASV, which is the highest level of adaptive server ventilation. All these together form types of non-invasive ventilation to treat patients with COPD or neuromuscular disease that leads to respiratory insufficiency. And ResMed has the best platform in the planet to treat them. We think it\u2019s a huge opportunity. Many hundreds of millions of patients worldwide have COPD, neuromuscular disease and respiratory insufficiency and ResMed is there for them now and will be for them there in the future. It\u2019s a long-term growth opportunity. It\u2019s not a short-term pop. It\u2019s a long-term growth opportunity for us to take care of these patients and help them sleep better, breathe better and our AirCurve platform is going to be fantastic to do that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nLyanne Harrison: Good morning, all. I might come back to the real-world data, Mick. Obviously, some good resupply improvements there, 300 basis points and 500 basis points. But is there anything you can share on the data or the trend for lower severity OSA patients, sort of the mild to moderate categories? And then also, secondly, on the data, whether we do this or a separate data set, what trend are you seeing in the percentage of patients who have ceased CPAP therapy as a result of weight loss drugs? Yeah. So it\u2019s a good question, Lyanne, and there are sort of multiple parts to it. I\u2019ll address it at a high level, which is to say, yeah, look, the real-world data is excellent. It\u2019s the largest data set out there with 660,000 patients that have been prescribed a GLP-1 and are on positive airway pressure therapy and we\u2019re really laser-focused on tracking that cohort very carefully. We can and will look to, in the future, slice and dice it by AHI, 5 to 15, 15 to 30, 30 plus. We\u2019ll look to slice and dice it by age, by gender, by geography and others. A lot of that will be for our internal work so that we can best drive social media marketing and know which patients to go after. For instance, the public information out there is that women are using GLP-1s more than men, and they\u2019re more adherent to the GLP-1s than men are. The rate that people quit the GLP-1 therapy is a lot higher in men than women. And so we\u2019re tracking a lot of that information publicly and we will, over time, release it. We haven\u2019t seen at all a correlation or information around people quitting PAP therapy because of a GLP-1. It just doesn\u2019t compute in the data we\u2019ve got. It\u2019s the other way that it\u2019s a huge tailwind for people coming in. Look, when we see -- as we say, we get 87% adherence. We\u2019re very proud of that. For the 13% that don\u2019t get there, we look at all the reasons why. Is it claustrophobia? Is it insomnia, where they have a psychological condition where they can\u2019t fall asleep and then they blame it on the CPAP mask when it\u2019s really a fact of a need to have treatment or their insomnia, as well as or in parallel to or even before their OSA. So we\u2019re looking at all types of reasons for that. But, look, we\u2019ll continue to update you and the rest of the world as we do the slice and dice by HI, by age, by gender, to find the best way to help patients find the best path to therapy. But right now, we\u2019re seeing a huge trend of more patients coming in, more motivated patients, and our challenge is to keep up with that and make sure that we can scale and help them get on that great digital health journey.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden. Your line is now live.\nSteve Wheen: Yeah. Thanks very much. I just had a question around the AirSense 11 and its availability and the pathway to it being kind of the platform that you 100% rely upon. If you could just give us an update as to how that looks for the remainder of this year and perhaps into 2025?\nMick Farrell: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Steve. I\u2019ll start out with this fact that we\u2019re still selling the S9 product in China right now. And so, getting rid of it completely, right, the AirSense 10, will take a while because there\u2019s great markets around the world where technology is useful for a long period of time. But I think what you\u2019re talking to is the materiality of the AirSense 11 becoming the primary in global markets. I can tell you this, the AirSense 11 is already the primary platform in our biggest market in the U.S. It\u2019s already well into the majority and growing quickly. And no customer who wants to order from ResMed can\u2019t get AirSense 11s, as well as AirSense 10s. We do limit sometimes the AirSense 11s, because there\u2019s so many customers from small, large regionals to statewide groups to nationals and we\u2019ve got to balance the flow to make sure every person has a fair chance to get an AirSense 11 and then we cover the difference with the awesome AirSense 10s. So, we\u2019re already over the majority in the U.S. As we look at other big markets around the world, you know, Germany, Japan, France, U.K., and beyond, the AirSense 11s are ramping very quickly and they\u2019ll quickly get to the majority across those areas. As we look to more of the countries, hundreds more countries around the world than those top 20, our job is, as I said in the prep remarks, to get the regulatory clearances. Some of these countries require all separate paperwork and time and effort, and so we have to analyze how quickly we can do that and we are also working with authorities to see if we can get clearances that can be used across multiple regions. And so, Steve, we\u2019re working very hard to get AirSense 11 in all countries and to the majority in all countries. I hope that answers your question.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey Capital. Your line is now live.\nSaul Hadassin: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Just another quick one for Brett. Brett, just looking at the inventory balance, it came down quite significantly into the third quarter. It\u2019s the lowest inventory has been, I think, since 2022. Just wondering where you think inventory goes from here. Do you think you need to start to sort of rebuild as it relates to sort of product demand or do you think you can drive that dollar value down further? Thanks.\nBrett Sandercock: Yeah. Hi, Saul. I think, yeah, we had -- I mean, the team\u2019s been working hard on that for a while now, so you\u2019re starting to see the results there in the balance sheet and in the inventory, which is great. We\u2019re getting pretty close to our targets on inventory, so I\u2019d say it\u2019s -- there could be modest reductions, there could be modest gains there. It\u2019s more around making sure we\u2019re balancing supply and demand now. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty close to targets on kind of where we\u2019re at now for the inventory.\nSaul Hadassin: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Matthew Taylor from Jefferies. Your line is now live.\nMike Toomey: Hi, guys. It\u2019s Mike Toomey covering for Matt Taylor. Thanks for taking my question and fitting me in here. Coming back to Philips, I know you said you\u2019re maintaining or growing share in the markets where they\u2019re returning, but are you seeing any significant pricing pressure or pricing discounts from them and any thoughts on when they might return to the U.S. market based on the consent decree? Thanks.\nMick Farrell: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Mike. And no, look, what we\u2019re seeing in the markets where that competitor\u2019s returned is that they\u2019re pricing for value and they\u2019re trying to compete on value. And primarily as they come back from sort of zero percent share with new patients as they start in the market, they\u2019re competing with the sort of Tier 2 and Tier 3 players, so a local player in Europe or a local player in Asia, and they\u2019re not touching our share as the global market leader and global technology leader in this space. And the work that we\u2019ve been able to do these number of years that they were out of each market is to really entrench ourselves because we\u2019ve got the lowest cost, the highest efficacy, the best technology, and physicians love our digital data, patients love the engagement with myAir and the whole ecosystem creates that value. So we really have seen, you know, as they come in, they\u2019re pricing for value and competing with Tier 2, Tier 3 players in those markets. As to when they\u2019ll re-enter from zero percent new patient share into the U.S. market, I don\u2019t know. You can do your own analysis on consent decrees. This one\u2019s a very severe one. It has a lot of inspectors, sort of five times the normal number of inspectors. I think five versus one and a lot of constraints on that. I look forward to great competition. We\u2019ve got good competition from the players there now. When they come back, they\u2019ll have to compete with them first and us after that. But, no, look, we were winning and taking share from that competitor in 2019 all the way from 2010 to 2019. We\u2019ll continue to do that and beat them whenever they come back to market. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further closing comments.\nMick Farrell: Great. Well, thanks, Kevin, and thanks to all of our stakeholders for joining this call, especially our shareholders. The opportunity in front of ResMed is huge and largely untapped. It\u2019s an incredible runway. We see more and more people coming into the healthcare system. This will benefit us as we help them sleep better, breathe better, and to live better and healthier and happier lives in over 140 countries. Thank you to 10,000 ResMedians, many of whom listened to this call and are also shareholders, for all that you do today and every day. With that, I\u2019ll hand the call back to Amy and we can close it out.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Mick, and thanks, everyone, for listening. We do appreciate your interest and your time. If you have any additional questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out directly. This concludes ResMed\u2019s third quarter 2024 conference call. Kevin, I\u2019ll turn it back to you to officially close us out.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes ResMed\u2019s third quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 and let's note that all comparisons out of the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms were applicable. We had strong financial performance in Q3. Group revenue for the March quarter was $1.2 billion, a 7% headline increase and a 7% increase in constant currency terms. Revenue growth reflects positive and consistent contributions across our product and ReSupply portfolio. Year-over-year movements in foreign currencies had a negligible impact on revenue during the March quarter. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 9%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 3%. Globally, device sales increased by 5%, while masks and other sales increased by 10%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 7%, supported by solid ongoing new patient diagnosis, while masks and other sales increased by 12%, reflecting growth in both ReSupply and new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales increased by 1% on a constant currency basis. Year-over-year growth moderated due to incremental revenue in the prior year quarter of approximately $15 million from COVID-related demand. Excluding the COVID-related sales, device revenue increased by 8% on a constant currency basis. Masks and other sales increased by 6% on a constant currency basis. Software-as-a-Service revenue increased by 8% in the March quarter, underpinned by growth from MEDIFOX DAN and continued strong performance from our HME Vertical. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release. Gross margin increased by 240 basis points to 58.5% in the March quarter. The increase was driven by reductions in freight expense, manufacturing cost improvements, favorable product mix and an increase in device average selling prices. Sequential gross margin improved by 160 basis points. We continue to monitor potential headwinds that could arise from the Middle East conflict. Disruptions in the Red Sea have increased freight costs and shipping lead times. We estimate this will negatively impact our Q4 gross margin by around 30 basis points to 50 basis points. Moving on to operating expenses, SG&A expenses for the third quarter increased by 1%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 19.2%, compared to 20.5% in the prior year period and reflect savings and ongoing cost discipline following restructuring actions undertaken early in the December quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 20% for the balance of fiscal year 2024. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 2% on a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.4%, compared to the 6.8% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for the balance of fiscal year 2024. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 23%, underpinned by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and modest growth in our operating expenses. Our net interest expense for the quarter was $11 million. Given our lower debt levels, we expect interest expense to be in the range of $7 million to $9 million in the final quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 20.3%, broadly consistent with the prior year quarter. We continue to estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the March quarter increased by 27% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 27%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $402 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings and improvement in our working capital position. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $21 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $43 million. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $238 million. On March 31 we had $1 billion in gross debt and $676, sorry, $769 million in net debt. During the quarter we reduced our debt by $220 million. On March 31 we had approximately $1.2 billion available for drawdown under our revolver facility and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Today our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share. During the quarter we purchased 261,000 shares under our previously authorized share buyback program for consideration of $50 million. We plan to continue to purchase shares for the value of approximately $50 million per quarter for the balance of fiscal year 2024. This will more than offset any dilution from the vesting of equity to employees during the year. Going forward we plan to continue to reinvest in gross through R&D, pay down outstanding debt and deploy further capital for tucking acquisitions. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. Okay. Can you hear me now, Kevin? Yes. Thanks, Mick. I'm not sure where that landed, but, yeah, in terms of gross margin, it is hard to predict given the movements in, we have product mix, geographic mix, timing of cost improvements, FX, freight costs. So it's all into the mix that we had pretty strong improvement through freight expense, through manufacturing efficiencies and so on coming through and that helped a lot. Stable component costs also means that's no longer a headwind there. So I think that's all reflected in the gross margin improvement. And as Mick said, in the short-term, there is some Red Sea freight cost impacts that will come through in Q4 but our goal remains to improve gross margin over the course of FY 2025. Sure. Yeah. Thanks, Mick. Yeah. I mean, that -- of that year-on-year, the 240 basis points, the biggest contributors were the freight cost reduction and also the manufacturing cost improvements were the biggest drivers there. We saw some benefit or some favorable product mix playing out there and a little bit in terms of ASP increases, but by far the most significant two, which were significantly contributed in their own right, were the freight expense reduction and the manufacturing cost improvements. I would say -- I wouldn't get drawn into specifics of each of the components, but I would say, both of those are material in their own right of contributing to that 240 basis points. Yeah. Thanks, Mick. I mean, the only thing I would add is the geographic mix impacts tend to be pretty modest. You do see that, but for example, product mixes usually has much more impact than geographic mix. So it's less of an impact on our margin either way from geographic mix. It's there, but it's not substantial. Yeah. Thanks, Mick. Yeah. Gretel, I mean, there is -- yeah, there's been quite a good increase year-on-year and freight and some manufacturing efficiencies, cost improvements there, obviously played a big part. We're also not so much facing the headwinds of these component cost increases that we saw sort of six months to 12 months ago as well. But if you look forward, and it's always hard to predict, as I mentioned earlier, there's a lot that plays out on the gross margin, product mix, the timing of the cost improvements or the continuous improvement programs that we're now running, and we've had an opportunity to do that. We're really, really focused on supply and getting devices into the market. So now as that stabilizes, then that gives us an opportunity to work on cost improvement programs. So we're focusing on that. So the goal, without being specific on targets, but certainly our goal is to improve gross margin over the course of FY 2025. And we've got, probably need to do that on a number of fronts, which is more around a continuous improvement or gradual improvement program now, I think, as we work through FY 2025. Yeah. Hi, Saul. I think, yeah, we had -- I mean, the team's been working hard on that for a while now, so you're starting to see the results there in the balance sheet and in the inventory, which is great. We're getting pretty close to our targets on inventory, so I'd say it's -- there could be modest reductions, there could be modest gains there. It's more around making sure we're balancing supply and demand now. So I'd say it's pretty close to targets on kind of where we're at now for the inventory."

            "name": "Mick Farrell",
            "content": "Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today. Our third quarter fiscal year 2024 results reflect another strong period of execution across our entire business, resulting in solid topline growth and strong double-digit bottomline growth. Our results were driven by ongoing new patient demand for our devices across global markets, high single-digit growth in our Software-as-a-Service business and double-digit global growth in our Masks and Accessories business. This is exceptional performance given that we are annualizing a very strong quarter of growth in the prior year. The recent launch of our ResMed 2030 operating model and our steady focus on driving increased operating leverage are delivering excellent bottomline results and keeping us on a clear trajectory of ongoing profitable growth. Over 2 billion people worldwide suffer from sleep apnea, what I call sleep suffocation, insomnia or respiratory insufficiency due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or neuromuscular disease. These chronic conditions form a healthcare epidemic that ResMed is uniquely positioned to address. We believe that healthcare should be delivered at the lowest cost, lowest acuity and highest comfort location possible. In the optimal case, that's in a person's own home. We are the global strategic leader in providing therapies for this epidemic, as well as market-leading enterprise software for Residential Care, including home medical equipment, home nursing and beyond. ResMed is the global leader in digital health solutions with over 18 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 24.5 million 100% cloud-connectable medical devices that have been sold into over 140 countries worldwide. We are the clear leader in sleep apnea, a market of over 1 billion people globally. Our end markets remain significantly underpenetrated. We believe the latest advances in big consumer tech and Big Pharma can potentially bring incredible numbers of new patients into the healthcare system where ResMed is uniquely positioned to provide ongoing care at home. We have a myriad of opportunities to add value, to reduce friction, to improve interoperability, to lower costs and to improve patient outcomes. We're the global strategic leader with software supporting hundreds of millions of people as they take control of their healthcare journey and navigate the complex healthcare world beyond the hospital system. Many more people can benefit from our products and solutions and we're laser-focused on growing the market to help people get on the therapy they need and on a pathway to better sleep, better health and better long-term care. Sales of our devices, including the category-leading AirSense platforms, grew 5% year-over-year globally. Excluding the one-time COVID-related ventilator sales in the third quarter of last year, global devices grew about 300 basis points higher than that, so right around 8% global devices growth. We are maintaining supply of two of the two market-leading 100% cloud-connectable platforms, the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11. We're working to increase the global availability of the AirSense 11 platform by securing market-by-market regulatory clearances. We are following a similar path with our recently launched AirCurve 11 Bilevel and non-invasive ventilator platform as we continue its launch in the U.S. and beyond in the period ahead. Our commercial teams are successfully demonstrating the clinical and economic benefits of the ResMed Mask portfolio. Our Masks and Accessories business achieved 10% growth year-over-year, expanding at or above the market in a competitive category globally. During the quarter, we introduced our latest mask innovation into the U.S. market called the AirFit F40. The F40 features a proprietary new technology that we call AdaptiSeal. It is a silicone cushion designed to create and maintain a better facial seal even when the person is moving frequently during sleep. It leverages a fully flexible frame technology to cope with such frequent nocturnal movement. Physicians, respiratory therapists and patients love the F40 for its comfort, its fit and its ease of use. It is the smallest full-face mask on the market from ResMed. Patients are voting with their wallets and respiratory therapists and physicians are voting with their recommendations and their prescriptions. We look forward to ongoing success in the U.S. and to swiftly bring the F40 to other global markets very soon. Mask and Accessory ReSupply programs are an important element of our offering, as we serve the ongoing therapy needs of patients globally. ResMed's clinical and commercial teams continue to partner with physicians and providers to drive ReSupply programs directly for their patients. In our cash pay markets, we've established a number of subscription programs that have been adopted by consumers. Research shows that ReSupply programs lead to better patient adherence and better long-term clinical outcomes for the patient and their caregivers. In the U.S., our ReSupply programs are powered by our digital health ecosystem, including AirView for physicians, myAir for patients and Brightree for home medical equipment providers. We will continue to develop, launch and scale these technologies, as well as direct subscription programs to help people take control of their own health. Regularly refreshing ongoing therapy needs including masks, tubing, humidifiers and other accessories. Let's now turn to a discussion of our top three global strategic priorities here at ResMed. Number one is to grow and differentiate our core sleep health and breathing health business. Number two is to design, develop and deliver market-leading medtech and digital health solutions that can be scaled in 140 plus countries worldwide. Number three is to create and leverage the world's best software solutions for Residential Care. As a global market leader in these significantly underpenetrated markets, our most significant opportunity is actually to expand and grow the market itself through awareness, diagnosis and pathways to treatment. We aspire to be the digital health concierge for each person as they pursue their personal journey to better sleep, better breathing and better care where they live. We are ramping up our demand generation initiatives to do just that. The ResMed 2030 operating model changes that we made recently position us for success as a product-led, customer-centric, brand-enhanced leader in health tech. We're raising awareness and creating pathways for patients to find access to care for their sleep health and their breathing health across the globe. We are leveraging traditional market channels and investing in cost-effective, social media-driven demand generation campaigns. The goal is to help consumers concerned about their sleep and breathing find their way into appropriate screening, diagnostic, treatment and management pathways. As we continue on our journey to create this digital health concierge for individuals, we are tracking progress with hard metrics. We are looking at new patient starts in our physician and provider-based ecosystem, including AirView, which now contains more than 27 million patient records. We're also tracking new starts in myAir, our consumer patient engagement app, where people choose to participate in their personalized healthcare journey to better sleep and better breathing. myAir now includes a population of 7.8 million users. We will drive more and more of the over 1 billion people worldwide who need our help for their sleep suffocation into the health care system. We believe two global megatrends will further support our ongoing growth. Awareness driven by consumer tech, specifically sleep tracking wearables like the Samsung Galaxy Watch which has a de novo FDA clearance to screen for sleep apnea. We expect similar capabilities from other wearables from Big Tech including the Apple Watch and Google's Fitbit. In addition, we believe that the population of patients, the other megatrend, the population of patients coming from Big Pharma as they focus on obesity and related impacts on health, including sleep health, will bring an incredible volume of patients into the healthcare system and the patients will have clinically significant sleep apnea that is best addressed by our therapies post these other therapies. We love this attention from big consumer tech on the field of sleep wellness tracking and we believe that many of these wearable technologies will help consumers find out if they have issues with breathing during sleep or maintaining high quality sleep. This could be one of the biggest waves of people taking control of their own pathway for discovering they have sleep issues like sleep apnea or insomnia or both, a new disease state that has been called by the physicians COMISA. Ultimately, we believe that this will lead to increased patient awareness and sustainable long-term growth for ResMed. Our goal is to educate people as they move from sleep wellness tracking with these wearables to what I call sleep health tracking and from consumer awareness to a true healthcare pathway for screening, diagnosis, treatment and ultimately ongoing management of their sleep health and breathing health. We believe that here at ResMed we are uniquely positioned to help. Big Pharma is squarely focused on GLP-1 medications right now. For many people dealing with their obesity, their healthcare goals are focused on losing weight while improving their diet, exercise and their sleep routines. We believe that increased utilization of GLP-1s to treat obesity will bring many new people into the healthcare funnel, activating them to see their primary care physicians as they strive for weight loss and other medical health. We believe this will open these patients up to knowledge of their other chronic diseases from their primary care physicians, including awareness of chronic diseases such as sleep apnea, ultimately driving new patients into diagnosis and treatment pathways that may not have previously been considered or been treated for those patients. So we believe this will drive not just more patients into our channel, but also more motivated patients into our channel. ResMed has been tracking the impact of GLP-1s through a de-identified patient analysis using an overlap of our data and third-party claims data. With another quarter of data analyzed, we are now up to an incredible N equals 660,000 subjects in our analysis. The bottomline is that the data show that GLP-1s are having a positive impact on patients seeking and adhering to positive airway pressure therapy. The latest numbers are an improvement from what we presented previously. For patients prescribed a GLP-1 medication, the latest data show a 10.5% higher propensity to start positive airway pressure therapy over those not taking the drug. As we follow these patients longitudinally, the ReSupply rate at T equals 12 months is 310 basis points higher. That's 3.1 absolute basis percentage points higher for patients who have a GLP-1 prescription. And then at T equals 24 months, the ReSupply rate is 500 basis points. So 5.0 absolute percentage points higher for patients who have a GLP-1 prescription. These data show clearly that these new GLP-1 pharmaceutical class is actually a tailwind for our ResMed business, bringing more patients and more motivated patients into the healthcare system. We've included the full analysis of these data in our investor deck and I encourage you to review the data there. It's very positive information and very thorough and detailed work by our healthcare economics and outcomes research, as well as our digital health analytics teams here at ResMed. Existing clinical studies show many factors impact sleep apnea epidemiology, including craniofacial anatomy, age of the subject, gender and weight. With over 1 billion people on the planet with sleep apnea right now, 80% plus of them are undiagnosed in our biggest market, the United States and over 90% of patients are undiagnosed globally. There remains an incredible opportunity to help people sleep and breathe better through positive airway pressure therapy, the universally recognized gold standard for treating sleep apnea. We look forward to more patients entering the healthcare system for care and more motivated patients who can get on our therapy faster and stay on it longer. In terms of best-in-class treatments for sleep apnea, achieving that goal of good sleep and good breathing, we have peer-reviewed and published evidence demonstrating that we can achieve over 87% of patients' adherent to our positive airway pressure technology by combining our market-leading device platforms, our market-leading masks, with our digital health solutions. Even with this best-in-class global tech, just over 10% of patients still need alternative therapies, and we have a very high volume of patients coming through these days. We're investing in alternative therapies and we're working to help patients who just can't adhere to positive airway pressure therapy despite the latest technology to find their path to second-line therapies, such as dental devices, where ResMed has the market-leading 3D printed dental device on the planet for sleep apnea in Western Europe and Northern Europe. That's called Narval. In addition, we have investments in third-line therapies, including pharmaceutical options. We're an investor in Apnimed, and we're also an investor in hypoglossal nerve-stimulation technology through our investment in a company called Nyxoah. ResMed is about sleep health, it's about breathing health and it's about delivering the best care right where you live. We make sure the person finds the path to the highest efficacy, lowest cost, most comfortable therapy that's best for them. Let's pivot now to talk about our digital health technology investments, leveraging our 18 billion nights of de-identified medical data in the cloud and our 24.5 100% cloud-connectable devices that are out there in our ecosystem across 140 countries. We are investing in a portfolio of artificial intelligence-driven capabilities, as well as customer-facing AI products in our ecosystem. We continue to roll out these products in our AirView ecosystem, such as Compliance Coach, that I talked about last quarter, that's rolling out in the United States. We're also progressing well with our generative AI capabilities to help patients along their journey, really people before they're patients and then they become people seeking sleep health and breathing health solutions, and then on their journey they become patients. And we're rolling out that gen AI capability in the Asia-Pac region for now and we'll look to scale that as we move forward. We'll continue to share progress on this front, as this revolutionary tech is developed and scaled across our business and many of medtech and health tech peers are doing the same and our ecosystem will move forward. Our Respiratory Health business continues to be supported by sustained activity across our non-invasive ventilator platforms and our life-support ventilator platforms. We continue to invest in clinical and economic trials for high-flow therapy that we call HFT to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at home at a cost-effective rate. This is a long-term opportunity focused on generating evidence, developing pathways and driving new reimbursement options. We are focused on driving adoption of these technologies for treatment at home. The prevalence of respiratory insufficiency due to COPD, as well as neuromuscular diseases, continues to increase, and we have low-cost, high-efficacy and high-tech treatments in HFT and beyond to address this healthcare epidemic. Turning to our Software-as-a-Service business in the field of Residential Care, we have another strong quarter with year-over-year growth of 8%. We plan to maintain high single-digit growth in the remainder of fiscal year 2024 and we plan to accelerate to double-digit growth for our Residential Care Software-as-a-Service business on an organic basis throughout fiscal year 2025. We are seeing ongoing customer-facing synergies between our Brightree offering in the U.S. and our core home medical equipment channel and its ReSupply capabilities. We are driving good growth across both our Residential Care SaaS and our core sleep health and breathing health businesses while serving many hundreds of thousands of patients. Our Residential Care SaaS business is integral to ResMed's growth portfolio and we're excited to have created a global business that will achieve double-digit growth on an organic basis throughout fiscal year 2025. We continue to drive OpEx leverage by managing our capabilities for cloud compute, cybersecurity, interoperability, privacy and R&D across our go-to-market brands that include Brightree, MatrixCare, and MEDIFOX DAN. And those synergies go not just across the SaaS businesses, but also directly into our core sleep health and breathing health business. And beyond this infrastructure leverage, our Residential Care SaaS business drives platform development synergies and customer engagement facilities and capabilities that are synergies as well, and these highly complement the market-leading medtech and software solutions capability that's there right in our core sleep health and breathing health business ecosystem, including products like AirView and myAir and beyond. We are transforming Respiratory Medicine and Residential Care at scale. We are leading the industry in developing, applying and adopting digital health technology across our markets. We continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our operations. We're focused on driving topline revenue growth, focused cost discipline and increased efficiencies to accelerate profitability all the way to the bottomline, and we made very good progress on that this quarter. The team delivered non-GAAP operating income up 23% and non-GAAP net income up 27%. We have created differentiated products and solutions for customers worldwide, driving long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. We lead the industry in digital health technology with the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, most connected, and most intelligent medtech solutions. During the last 12 months, we have improved over 174 million lives by delivering a medical device directly to a patient, a complete mask system to a patient or a digital health software solution that provides personal care for a patient right where they live. We've helped each person sleep better, breathe better and live higher quality lives with best-in-class healthcare. In closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the more than 10,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication today and every day. Thank you. With that, I'll hand over the call to Brett in Sydney for his remarks and then we'll open up to Q&A with the entire team between Sydney and San Diego. Over to you, Brett. Yeah. Thanks Dan. It's a good question and obviously as we talked about on the call a quarter ago and two quarters ago we've got long-term programs and short-term programs that are moving very carefully to move our gross margin up. Some -- very long-term as we walk through the launch of our AirSense 11 platform which is at a better cost point, a better price point. Launch of our new masks, the F40 last quarter and these have effects that go over long-term. Some of the faster impacts we're able to do is working through the inventory that were high freight costs from the semiconductor crisis and the supply chain crisis from six months, nine months, 12 months, 18 months ago that are flowing through our system. So look, I'm not upset when the team overperforms my expectations as they did here. As Brett said in Q4 we'll see some moderation of that due to Red Sea impacts of a couple of tens of basis points, sort of 30 basis points, 40 basis points. Brett can give more detail on that. But look Dan, I'm very, what I'm excited about... He cannot. Brett says he can't hear us. Okay. Great. Well I'll hand over to Brett to answer the question on gross margin and then I'll follow up. I don't know where I got cut off there. Brett, you do. Over to you. Brett, you can answer that. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Craig. And yeah, no, we really didn't see, I mean, look, we've got many competitors out there in Europe, Asia, rest of the world, including the one you mentioned, and it's a full playing field. It has been the whole time on masks, so there's no change to anyone coming back or leaving on the mask side. On the device side, no huge impacts. We were comping a very large device number, Europe, Asia, rest of the world, this quarter last year, we had a 36% growth that we're comping. And so we had good growth there on a 36% comp at plus 1%. And if you take out from last year, a large ventilation provision in China, this time a year ago, China had a big COVID impact on ventilator purchase. If you take that out, the year-on-year growth would have been 8% in Europe, Asia, rest of world devices. So up 700 basis points. So look, the way I look at it is, we're maintaining or growing share in all of our markets on the device side. We're the market leader with the AirSense 11 platform. And we've got the second best platform in the world with the AirSense 10 platform against all competitors and so really strong there. So no major impacts from restocking and no major impacts from competitive activity and I think we had a very, very strong performance from the team in terms of their ability to ramp up the supply over the last period and get it all out there. And we're not -- no customer is not being able to fulfill an order. If they have an order for devices, we fill it up as much as we can with AirSense 11s and then we fill up the remainder with AirSense 10s and we're able to take care of those customer needs and so really good quarter of execution by our supply chain teams, as well as our delivery teams and our commercial teams out there. Yeah. Two great components to the same question there, David. In terms of new patient starts, as you saw in U.S., Canada, Latin America, we achieved pretty strong growth of 7% of devices in the quarter and that was on a comp, this time last year of 49%. So what I'd say is, and this is what we say, is that the market is sort of, if ResMed doesn't do enough around demand gen, the market will grow at mid-single digits on devices and high-single digits on masks. Obviously, we beat that this quarter with our device growth in the U.S, Canada, Latin America at 7%. So new patient starts are strong. There is some repat there, but it's a minority, and I can tell you that new patient flow into our channel has been steady. And we said this last quarter that we're starting to get back to that steady flow of patients. We've sort of gone through the perturbations of the COVID dip, the COVID rebound, the supply chain dip, the supply chain rebound, and now we're at steady state. So seeing really good flow of patients into the U.S. As I said on the prepared remarks, we are seeing these patients who come in on the GLP-1s and it's only N equals 660,000 patients that we're looking at, but that's quite a big cohort. And as we look at those patients, their propensity to start being 10.5% above people without a prescription for that drug, I actually think we're seeing a really good flow that I think will be a long-term, I think, there's a long period of time, the S-curve of penetration of these GLP-1s, and I think, that's going to be a long cohort of patients coming into the channel. So really good on new patient starts. And in terms of ReSupply, yeah, look, we've got really good capabilities in the U.S., particularly with Brightree and Snap technologies and Brightree ReSupply, and our subscription models and our cash pay markets around the world. But there's a lot more runway left. There's many patients who aren't yet on a subscription program and cash pay markets, and there's many patients who aren't yet on appropriate resupply in our large and developed markets. So I would say new patient flow in is very solid. ReSupply, whether it's REPAP or reestablishing masks and accessories, is good, but a lot of runway left, a lot of runway left on both in terms of demand gen and resupply. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Anthony. And yeah, certainly we saw the headline results from that SURMOUNT-OSA trial, and look, since they had, just to be really clear, their study had that at least seven-day washout at the end on the study that had patients that had been using CPAP. So with that seven-day to nine-day washout period at the end, this was really a trial laser-focused on comparing their drug to placebo. And what it showed is somewhere in that sort of 59% to 63% reduction of AHI, and if you do the math on it and you look at the sort of average AHI coming in of around 50%, the average AHI coming out is sort of in the low 20%s. So patients were, at the end of the study, on average, were suffocating every 3 minutes of sleep after treatment for this drug, right? And so AHI of 20% or more, moderate plus sleep apnea, these patients would be treated by any sleep physician on the planet and really require positive airway pressure treatment. So I think that's the most important thing to say right up front. And so as we look at the readout that'll come in June when they release the full analysis here and the primary investigators get up and we see all the sub-analysis data, what will be interesting is to look at, because the combination therapy of CPAP plus CAPAP plus these GLP-1s had a slightly higher efficacy, if you like, it had a higher reduction in AHI. I'll be interested to look on the secondary outcomes, were there more blood pressure reductions and other cardiovascular improvements, heart remodeling and things like that happen over time and the washout period might have diluted that a little bit, it'll depend on where they took them. But those would be the things that I'd be interested in on this study. As we see it, we're seeing new patients come in on this and not just anecdotally from the letters I get from patients saying, I've been using a GLP-1 and now I'm using a PAP, this combination therapy is great, I'm taking care of my diet, my exercise and my sleep. But we're seeing real world evidence, real world data that we're presenting, N equals 660,000 patients and these patients start CPAP more, they adhere more. I mean, the fact that at 12 months ReSupply goes up 3.1%, 310 basis points. The fact that ReSupply at 24 months goes up 500 basis points, 5 absolute percentage points higher, means that this is not only more patients into the funnel from this drug and not just this particular drug from this particular company, but this class of drugs. We included tirzepatide and semaglutide in our analysis and others. All new gen, vast majority new gen tech. And I can tell you, we are going to do our own social media driven demand gen, but the fact that Big Tech with the Samsung Watch, the Apple Watch and Google's Fitbit are going to be bringing patients in and Big Pharma, and this is trillions of dollars of capital between these companies are going to be doing advertising to drive patients into the funnel. We think this is a net tailwind for our business. We've started to see it somewhat now at the very early stages and we think it'll be there in the future. So that's what we'll be looking for from this study, Anthony. Yes, I can, Suraj. Hopefully your phone and our phone are good throughout this question and answer. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Suraj. I'll have a go first and I'll hand over to Brett for detail. But as I look at it from my perspective, there are a number of factors that were positives to have such a great gross margin number this quarter. The first one was that we had excellent work by our global supply chain teams to work on getting our cost of goods sold down, not just direct COGS but OCOGS as well. And so we worked through some of that high inventory -- high cost inventory stock moved through the system, and some of the reengineering work and revalidation and verification work we've done has been able to bring new product to market. We have a good flow between the AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 platforms. But look, if you look at the growth from like 12 months ago and some of the issues, I mean, we had -- as I said earlier, we had 49% growth in our U.S., Canada, Latin America flow generators a year ago. That has a very big impact on margin as it's, lower margin than our masks business and other businesses, certainly in our ventilation and software around the world. This quarter, we're sort of back to a steady state where ResMed's growing well. We're growing at mid-to-high single digits in parts of our business and double digits in the masks and accessory side. And I think we're just back to our core execution, something that ResMed's done in our 35-year history is have operating excellence and operational excellence as a core competency. We were able to, after all those perturbations of COVID, supply chain, cost of inventory, we're able to get back to what we do really well. So that's what I'd say are the main factors for us achieving such great gross margin in the quarter. Brett, do you want to provide any further detail? Well, yeah. Thanks, Margaret. It's a great question on how we're going to learn from our many years of experience of getting patients in the funnel and taking it to the next level and scaling globally. As you know, we've had sort of direct to consumer campaigns in our cash paid countries, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and others around the world. One of the big changes we made in our 2030 operating model was to establish a Global Chief Product Officer, Global Chief Revenue Officer, but also a Global Chief Marketing Officer. And I think bringing that marketing function to be across the whole of the sleep health and breathing health business, and really across our whole ResMed business, is going to allow us to bring. Yeah, as you said, we did experiments in that joint venture where, by the way, we own all the intellectual property and capability of that joint venture, the assets and capability that we learned over those last many years in that JV. We've now taken that on board and we've said, okay, let's not just do that in one metropolitan statistical area in the United States or within one country like Australia or another country like Singapore or Korea. Let's look at ways we can scale that globally. So without signaling directly and exactly how, where, and when we're going to do it, I can tell you we've got a global team looking at this, Margaret, and as we go throughout fiscal year 2025, we're going to talk about, as they go public, this is the campaign. One thing that is different from what we did before is that I believe in what gets measured gets done and every single campaign we're going to do is going to have hardcore metrics of sponsorship here, driven here and influence it there, this social media impact there. We'll look at the ROI, and before it scales, we're going to analyze that portfolio of primarily social media but other media-driven demand gen, and yes, it will be local, but it'll also be national, and there'll be global. The platforms will be global, the cultural impacts will be national, and then the impact will be local, and we'll be measuring that direct ROI of that marketing spend. As you saw in the quarter, we were very efficient on SG&A this quarter. We will go back to our steady state on that, not growing at revenue, well below, but getting up to better growth and those investments will go in areas like this, in demand gen on SG&A, and of course, our core R&D growth will go back into AI and generative AI. I can tell you some of our work on generative AI in Asia-Pacific, helping a patient in that digital health concierge through the channel will be a big part of our demand gen as well, so a combination between R&D and SG&A there, but great question, Margaret, and we'll update you as we move through fiscal year 2025 and beyond on our demand gen initiatives. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Gretel. Brett, with this great performance from your finance and our global supply chain team, you're getting all the questions this quarter, so over to you on projections for gross margin for FY 2025 to answer Gretel's question. Yeah. Brett, it's a really good question. It's quite a complex one and I think it'll play out over time. We've obviously got very strong quantitative data with the 660,000 subjects that we're following in that analysis. But we get a lot of anecdotal information from folks, all the way from folks who are involved in the clinical research to frontline physicians through our network and we position this across 140 countries. These new medications are primarily focused on the U.S. and Western Europe right now. But as we watch, our hypothesis is that this new therapy is bringing people into the healthcare system who weren't previously there. They weren't choosing to go as frequently to their GP or their primary care physician. They are now seeing that PCP, that GP, and now they are getting treated for not only their obesity, but now other chronic diseases and we've seen this in other disease states from some of our peers here in medtech. But yeah, it's quite extraordinary to have 10.5% higher propensity to start positive airway pressure therapy. There are not many other factors recently in terms of innovations from biotech and pharma that we've seen that could drive this level. And so it is early days as those drugs are penetrated in the U.S., Western Europe, and beyond. But we're watching it very closely. I do think that these trillions of dollars worth of capital will bring lots of advertising and will bring lots of patients into the funnel. And then our job will be to help those patients to find the best path to the best therapy and the best therapy is positive airway pressure therapy and we're seeing that in these early days. And yeah, I think as we move forward, we'll learn more and we'll keep updating as we go every quarter on our flow of patients that come into the funnel, how we're seeing them and how we're taking care of them through our own demand gen, through the demand gen that will be driven by this Big Pharma. And one that we didn't get a question on, but I talked about on my prepared remarks there on Big Tech. I think the fact that there'll be wearables on tens of millions, maybe hundreds of millions of people's wrists, looking at oximetry, looking at nocturnal sleep, looking at nocturnal breathing and helping patients find out if they're not sleeping well, they're not breathing well. I think that might actually be a higher tidal wave than the Big Pharma tidal wave. But we'll watch that as we move forward, DAN. Thanks for the question, Brett. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Mike. And the competitor you mentioned is leaving the U.S. market for life support ventilation. They will still, at this point, I think, claim to be coming back with CPAP, APAP and Bilevel. So that Bilevels are non-invasive ventilation. They reach an area of non-invasive ventilation. So we expect them back in that market. Look, I think there are opportunities in ventilation. Obviously, we saw through the COVID crisis, there was a very large volume of ventilators sold into the world in 2020, 2021, 2022. We talked about even just in 2023, we're lapping a quarter where there were large sales a year ago into China of ventilators. And so I think, if you like, the supply of ventilators into the market is quite high. So there's no huge sort of immediate opportunity by our competitor leaving life support ventilation in the U.S. But we are there to take care of our customers wherever they are, whatever country they're in and whatever needs they have. For us, the more material growth is really around driving our CPAP, our APAP and our Bilevels with AirSense 11 and AirCurve 11. And the AirCurve 11, in terms of your question, non-invasive ventilation, has AirCurve S, AirCurve ST and AirCurve FTI. And at the highest level, it has an AirCurve ASV, which is the highest level of adaptive server ventilation. All these together form types of non-invasive ventilation to treat patients with COPD or neuromuscular disease that leads to respiratory insufficiency. And ResMed has the best platform in the planet to treat them. We think it's a huge opportunity. Many hundreds of millions of patients worldwide have COPD, neuromuscular disease and respiratory insufficiency and ResMed is there for them now and will be for them there in the future. It's a long-term growth opportunity. It's not a short-term pop. It's a long-term growth opportunity for us to take care of these patients and help them sleep better, breathe better and our AirCurve platform is going to be fantastic to do that. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Steve. I'll start out with this fact that we're still selling the S9 product in China right now. And so, getting rid of it completely, right, the AirSense 10, will take a while because there's great markets around the world where technology is useful for a long period of time. But I think what you're talking to is the materiality of the AirSense 11 becoming the primary in global markets. I can tell you this, the AirSense 11 is already the primary platform in our biggest market in the U.S. It's already well into the majority and growing quickly. And no customer who wants to order from ResMed can't get AirSense 11s, as well as AirSense 10s. We do limit sometimes the AirSense 11s, because there's so many customers from small, large regionals to statewide groups to nationals and we've got to balance the flow to make sure every person has a fair chance to get an AirSense 11 and then we cover the difference with the awesome AirSense 10s. So, we're already over the majority in the U.S. As we look at other big markets around the world, you know, Germany, Japan, France, U.K., and beyond, the AirSense 11s are ramping very quickly and they'll quickly get to the majority across those areas. As we look to more of the countries, hundreds more countries around the world than those top 20, our job is, as I said in the prep remarks, to get the regulatory clearances. Some of these countries require all separate paperwork and time and effort, and so we have to analyze how quickly we can do that and we are also working with authorities to see if we can get clearances that can be used across multiple regions. And so, Steve, we're working very hard to get AirSense 11 in all countries and to the majority in all countries. I hope that answers your question. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Mike. And no, look, what we're seeing in the markets where that competitor's returned is that they're pricing for value and they're trying to compete on value. And primarily as they come back from sort of zero percent share with new patients as they start in the market, they're competing with the sort of Tier 2 and Tier 3 players, so a local player in Europe or a local player in Asia, and they're not touching our share as the global market leader and global technology leader in this space. And the work that we've been able to do these number of years that they were out of each market is to really entrench ourselves because we've got the lowest cost, the highest efficacy, the best technology, and physicians love our digital data, patients love the engagement with myAir and the whole ecosystem creates that value. So we really have seen, you know, as they come in, they're pricing for value and competing with Tier 2, Tier 3 players in those markets. As to when they'll re-enter from zero percent new patient share into the U.S. market, I don't know. You can do your own analysis on consent decrees. This one's a very severe one. It has a lot of inspectors, sort of five times the normal number of inspectors. I think five versus one and a lot of constraints on that. I look forward to great competition. We've got good competition from the players there now. When they come back, they'll have to compete with them first and us after that. But, no, look, we were winning and taking share from that competitor in 2019 all the way from 2010 to 2019. We'll continue to do that and beat them whenever they come back to market. Thanks for the question. Great. Well, thanks, Kevin, and thanks to all of our stakeholders for joining this call, especially our shareholders. The opportunity in front of ResMed is huge and largely untapped. It's an incredible runway. We see more and more people coming into the healthcare system. This will benefit us as we help them sleep better, breathe better, and to live better and healthier and happier lives in over 140 countries. Thank you to 10,000 ResMedians, many of whom listened to this call and are also shareholders, for all that you do today and every day. With that, I'll hand the call back to Amy and we can close it out."

[Operator Instructions] A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Amy Wakeham. Please go ahead, Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Kevin. Hi, everyone, and welcome to ResMed's second quarter earnings call for fiscal year 2024. We are live webcasting this call and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today along with a copy of the earnings press release and presentation, both of these are now available. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures that we believe provide useful information for investors. This information is non-intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the GAAP reported numbers. In addition to our discussion today, it will include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We make these statements based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results could differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now turn our call over to ResMed's CEO, Mick Farrell.\nMichael Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today. Our second quarter fiscal year 2024 results reflect strong execution across our entire business, driving double-digit top and bottom line growth. These results are a testament to the incredible efforts of the global ResMed team. Our results were driven by double-digit global growth in both devices and our Software-as-a-Service business together with high single-digit global growth in our masks and accessories business, holding our leading market share amongst high comps from the same quarter a year ago. In terms of bottom line leverage, our reorganization efforts and efficiency efforts in the quarter have set us on a clear trajectory of profitable growth. Taking a step back, all 10,000 ResMedians are energized about the opportunities in front of us. There are over 2 billion people worldwide suffering from sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular disease or insomnia. These chronic conditions form a healthcare epidemic in which ResMed is uniquely positioned to help. We believe that healthcare should be delivered in the lowest cost, lowest security and highest comfort location possible. Very often, that is a patient's own home. Our end markets remain underpenetrated with many opportunities to add value, reduce friction, lower costs and improve patient outcomes. We support hundreds of millions of people as they take control of their healthcare journey and navigate the complex healthcare world outside the hospital system. ResMed is the global leader in digital health solutions with over 17 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 23.5 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices sold into over 140 countries worldwide. We are the clear market leader in sleep apnea, a huge and growing market with over 1 billion people impacted globally. Our category-leading flow generator platforms grew 11% year-over-year. We have achieved and are maintaining supply of our two 100% connectable AirSense platforms, with unconstrained supply of the AirSense 10 platform globally. Every quarter, we continue to gain regulatory approvals to launch and to increase delivery volumes of the best-in-class AirSense 11 platform on our pathway to support more and more patients worldwide. Our commercial teams are successfully demonstrating the clinical and economic benefits of the ResMed mask portfolio. During the quarter, our masks and accessories business grew 9% year-over-year in a highly competitive market, maintaining good market share with all players in the field in this category globally. We are excited to have achieved regulatory and reimbursement approval for our latest and greatest mask innovation and we look forward to bringing this technology to market soon. I have personally worn this new mask and our test data show, not just n equals one from the CEO, that it is highly favored by physicians, respiratory therapists and especially the most important customer, our patients. In terms of maintaining our momentum of mask and accessory growth, our clinical and commercial teams continue to partner with physicians and providers to drive resupply programs directly with their patients. Peer-reviewed and published clinical evidence shows that using resupply programs leads to better patient adherence and to better patient outcomes. This is proving out in the real-world customer by customer. We continue to see strong growth in the U.S. mask and accessories business, where resupply programs are powered by our digital health ecosystem, including AirView for physicians, Brightree for home care medical equipment providers and myAir for patients. Outside the U.S., we are focused on developing, launching and scaling our direct outreach and subscription programs, to help consumers take control of their own health and engage directly in refreshing their own mask, their own tubing, their own humidifier and other accessories. The importance of respiratory health and respiratory hygiene in the eyes of consumers has seen a permanent uptick since four years ago when the COVID-19 epidemic started. We are supporting our customers with digital solutions and services to meet their needs and to ensure they have clean and fresh equipment to best treat their sleep suffocation and improve their health. Before I review updates on our key strategic priorities, I'd like to discuss recent actions we have taken to accelerate profitable growth across ResMed and to power our long-term success. Last quarter, I discussed the steps we've taken to ensure that we can refocus and drive even more profitable growth. We stopped some projects that were not working out and we increased investment in areas that will be pivotal to our long-term success, including our digital health technology investments as well as focused device platform and mask technology development. We have introduced a new operating model centered on making ResMed even more product-led, even more customer-centric and even more brand enhanced. We will measure the success of this new 2030 operating model by an increase in the velocity of new product innovation as well as enhanced value in the ResMed brand while accelerating profitable growth. As the founder of ResMed states, innovation is not just invention of a great new technology is when a customer loves it, adopts it and chooses to pay for it. We have an incredible legacy and an exciting product pipeline to bring to market. Let's now turn to a discussion of our three key strategic priorities. Number one is to grow and differentiate our core sleep health and breathing health business. Number two is to design and develop and deliver market-leading med tech and digital health solutions that can be scaled in 140 countries plus worldwide. Number three is to create and leverage the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and preferably in the home. In terms of addressing strategic priority, number one, as the world's clear leader in the field of sleep apnea and breathing health, we are laser-focused in 2024 on ramping up our demand generation initiatives. We are raising awareness and creating pathways for patients to find access to care for sleep suffocation across specific global markets. We are leveraging traditional healthcare channels and investing in cost-effective social media-driven demand generation campaigns to help consumers who are concerned about their own sleep and breathing to find their way into screening, diagnostic, treatment and management pathways. Our goal is to provide a digital healthcare concierge service to help guide people on that journey. We are tracking new patient starts in our physician and provider-based ecosystem, which now contains more than 26 million patient records as well as the new user starts in myAir, which is a patient app where patients choose to participate in their own personalized healthcare journey to better sleep and better breathing. Our goal is to cost effectively drive more and more of the over 1 billion people worldwide who need our help into the channel. There are two megatrends that can have an influence on increasing that patient flow, one from big consumer tech and one from Big Pharma. Let me talk briefly about each of these megatrends. Many of the big consumer tech companies are increasing their focus on the area of sleep wellness. Apple has sleep wellness tracking built into its latest-generation Apple Watch and has plans to enhance that capability with further sleep quality assessment. Google's Fitbit division has sleep wellness tracking built into its platform. WHOOP is doing the same. Samsung have not only built sleep wellness tracking into its latest operating platform, but is helping to define sleep personas to help consumers better understand a 30% of their lives they spend in the state of sleep. We love this attention on the field of sleep wellness and many of these technologies will help each person find out if they have issues with sleep architecture, issues with breathing during sleep, or issues maintaining high quality sleep. This could be one of the biggest waves of people taking control of their own pathway for discovering they have sleep apnea or they have insomnia, well, maybe they have both, a state that is called COMISA for co-morbid insomnia and sleep apnea. Ultimately, this will lead to increasing patient growth for ResMed overall. And our goal is to best educate the person as they move from sleep wellness tracking to sleep health tracking and from consumer awareness into a true healthcare pathway for screening, diagnosis, treatment and ongoing management of their chronic condition. ResMed plans to be there with the person through that entire journey. In terms of the impact of megatrends from Big Pharma, the current focus is squarely on GLP-1 medications. Let me take some time to address what we are seeing in the market with patients on latest-generation GLP-1 therapies and positive airway pressure therapy. We are tracking a cohort of over 0.5 million patients with prescriptions for both GLP-1 medications and positive airway pressure therapy. These data are included in our investor deck, so you can review them there on our website, but I'll briefly summarize what we have observed. Around six months ago, there was a thought among some in the market that patients on GLP-1 medications would be less likely to start positive airway pressure therapy. We stated at the time and still do, that this was not likely the case as important risk factors such as craniofacial geometry, gender, age and the basic physics and anatomy of the upper airway would remain unchanged despite this new pharmaceutical therapy option. Still, the theory remained. So now we have real-world data and real-world evidence at scale. Our analysis of over 529,000 patients with GLP-1 prescriptions shows that not only is there not a reduction in the propensity to start positive airway pressure therapy, it is the exact opposite. For patients who have been prescribed a GLP-1, there is an increase of 10% of the absolute percentage of patients that commence positive airway pressure therapy. So as an example, if you take a baseline of 75% of patients that commence PAP therapy after their prescription on average in a certain group, that would become 85% of those same patients who were on a GLP-1 that would commence positive airway pressure therapy. And by the way, the vast, vast majority of these GLP-1s are the latest generation medications. Another hypothesis about six months ago was that patients on GLP-1 therapy and PAP therapy would quit their PAP therapy, their CPAP or their APAP at a higher rate than the general population over time. The real world data, again, with a cohort of over 0.5 million patients shows the exact opposite. At T equals 12 months after therapy commencement on PAP, the delta from general PAP population to a PAP plus GLP-1 prescribed population shows an increase in the resupply rate of 300 basis points. So again, as an example, if the general population resupply rate at 12 months was, say, 70%, it would then become 73% for the population that was prescribed to both PAP and GLP-1 therapy. This delta actually increases over time going further with the delta from the general PAP population receiving resupply at 12 months being 500 basis points higher for a population prescribed both PAP and GLP-1s. Here at ResMed, we believe in treating the whole person, including a combination of what Professor Bill Dement, one of the founders of the field of sleep medicine, may he rest in peace, called the Triumvirate of Health. That triumvirate is one, regular cardiovascular exercise; two, balanced diet and nutrition; and three, good sleep and breathing. We believe that addressing all three aspects results in the best patient outcomes. In terms of best-in-class treatment for sleep apnea, achieving that goal of good sleep and good breathing, we have peer-reviewed and published research demonstrating that we can achieve over 87% of patients adherent to our PAP technology by combining our market-leading device platforms with digital health solutions, including AirView for physicians and myAir for patients. Even with this best-in-class global technology, we still have more than 10% of patients that need alternatives. We just can't get them adherent those 10%. We are investing in these alternative therapies and we are working to help patients who do not adhere to positive airway pressure to find their path to second-tier therapies, such as dental devices where ResMed has invested and scaled the market-leading 3D printed dental device for sleep apnea in Europe called Narval. In addition, we have investments in other third-tier therapies, including pharmaceutical agents with our Apnimed investment as well as hypoglossal nerve stimulation technology with our Nyxoah investment. ResMed stands for respiratory medicine, not CPAP company, and we want to take care of the patient. We obviously start with the lowest cost, highest efficacy therapies, including CPAP, APAP and bilevel therapies. And we then work through the alternatives to help the person sleep better and breathe better. The bottom line is this, a huge number of people need our sleep apnea treatment solutions today and for the next decade, two decades, three decades and beyond. We want every patient to find a path to good breathing and good sleep. Let's pivot for a moment to talk about our digital health technology investments, leveraging the 17 billion nights of de-identified medical data and the 23.5 million 100% cloud connectable devices in our ecosystem. We are investing in several artificial intelligence-driven data products and capabilities in that ecosystem that we call Air Solutions. We are continuing to roll out, one publicly we are talking about, which is called Compliance Coach to customers in the U.S. market in a controlled market launch. Compliance Coach is a solution that helps home medical equipment providers to prioritize both digital and personal outreach to improve patient compliance and drive better patient outcomes at a lower cost. Compliance Coach models and predict the likelihood that a particular patient will or will not adhere to therapy based on algorithms built on billions of data points. The AI product then identifies for the HME provider, the key patients who may struggle to meet compliance requirements and takes a step further to drive digital and/or human actions to maximize the probability of adherence across the group. Customers using the product in its initial launch are excited and are starting to see very positive results across their business and for their patients. One final update on AI technology for this quarter. We recently launched an in-market trial of a ResMed developed generative AI product that serves as a digital concierge to help a group of people that we call sleep-concerned consumers, to best navigate as they search for their sleep-related information and they ask questions about their sleep wellness and potential treatment options. This generative AI tool helps the person identify, engage and enroll on their personal journey to better sleep and better breathing. We are currently beta test marking this product in Asia Pacific, and we will look to scale globally over time. Our goal is to develop and scale this digital sleep concierge so that all those seeking better sleep and better breathing can find their personal pathway for the best outcome, the best treatment and the best long-term care. Our Respiratory Health business continues to be supported by sustained activity across our non-invasive ventilator platforms as well as our life support ventilator platforms. We continue to invest in clinical and economic trials for high flow therapy that we call HFT to even more cost effectively treat COPD in the home. As we develop these next-generation therapies, we will generate strong clinical evidence and economic outcomes that will support broader adoption of these innovations for treating respiratory conditions at home. The prevalence of respiratory insufficiency due to COPD as well as neuromuscular disease continues to increase, and we offer low-cost, high-quality treatments to help address this healthcare epidemic. Turning to our Residential Care Software-as-a-Service business. We had another great quarter with year-over-year growth of 24%. Organic growth of our SaaS business was solid across our Brightree and our MatrixCare brands with another full quarter contribution from our MEDIFOX DAN brand in Germany. Ongoing customer-facing synergies between our Brightree offering in the U.S. and our home medical equipment resupply revenue remains very strong, driving good growth across both our SaaS business and our core sleep health business. We expect to have sustainable organic growth across our portfolio of SaaS solutions in home medical equipment, home health, home nursing and beyond to be in the high-single digits as we continue through this fiscal year and to achieve stable double-digit organic growth through fiscal year 2025 and beyond. We continue to drive operating expense leverage through management of our capabilities for cloud compute, our capabilities for cybersecurity, interoperability and technology development and we plan to accelerate net operating profit growth across our SaaS portfolio and across the entire ResMed business. Our residential care SaaS business remains an integral part of ResMed's growth strategy. This business complements the market-leading software and the market-leading device solutions that we have in our sleep health and breathing health business, and we are well positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for residential care. We are transforming respiratory medicine and residential care at scale. We are leading the industry in developing, applying and adopting digital health technology across our markets. We continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our operations. We are focused on driving topline revenue growth, focused cost discipline and increased efficiencies to accelerate profitability. We have created differentiated products and solutions for customers worldwide, driving long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. We lead the industry in digital health technology with the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, most connected and most intelligent solutions, and we don't plan to stop innovating anytime soon. We invest around 7% of our revenues straight back into market-leading research and development. ResMed's mission remains crystal clear to improve 250 million lives through better residential healthcare in 2025. This patient-centric mission motivates me and ResMedians every day. During the last 12 months, we have improved over 170 million lives by delivering a medical device directly to a patient or a complete mask system to a patient or a digital health software solution that provides personal care for a patient. We've helped each person to sleep better, to breathe better or to live higher-quality lives with best-in-class healthcare delivered right where they live. I'm very excited about the opportunities in front of us and the pipeline we have ahead. In closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the more than 10,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, their hard work and dedication today and every day. Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks, and then we'll open up to Q&A for Brett and me and the team. Over to you, Brett.\nBrett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms, where applicable. We had strong financial performance in Q2. Group revenue for the December quarter was $1.16 billion, a 12% headline increase and 11% in constant currency terms. Revenue growth reflects the ongoing combined availability of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 sleep devices to support solid underlying global demand and continued growth across our mask portfolio. Year-over-year movements in foreign currencies positively impacted revenue by approximately $11 million in the December quarter. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries increased by 9%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 12%. Globally, device sales increased by 11%, while masks and other sales increased by 9%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 7%, masks and other sales increased by 10%, reflecting growth in resupply and new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales increased by 16%, again, reflecting strong demand and significantly improved availability of cloud connected devices. Mask and other sales increased by 4%, reflecting the impact of a strong prior year comparable growth rate. Software-as-a-Service revenue increased by 24% in the December quarter, reflecting the contribution from our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, and continued strong performance from our HME vertical. Excluding our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, SaaS revenue grew by 10% in the December quarter. MEDIFOX DAN contributed revenue of $28 million in the December quarter, consistent with our expectations at the time of the acquisition. Note as we have now passed the first year anniversary of our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, our future SaaS revenue year-over-year will reflect organic growth. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Gross margin increased by 10 basis points to 56.9% in the December quarter. The increase primarily reflects a decrease in freight costs and increase in average selling prices and favorable foreign currency movements. The benefits are partially offset by unfavorable product mix. Sequential gross margin increased by 90 basis points, primarily driven by a reduction in freight costs and an increase in average selling prices for our devices, partially offset by unfavorable product mix. We remain confident of a positive gross margin trajectory. Like many companies, we are monitoring potential headwinds that could arise in the Middle East conflict. Disruptions in the Red Sea will likely increase sea freight costs and shipping lead times. We're closely tracking the situation and taking action to mitigate potential impacts where we can. Moving on to operating expenses. SG&A expenses for the second quarter increased by 4%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related costs. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 19.1% compared to 20.5% in the prior year period and reflects savings and cost discipline following specific actions taken early in the December quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 20% for the second half of fiscal year 2024. This guidance reflects the impact of our restructuring activities that resulted in a reduction in our workforce of approximately 5% during the quarter. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 6%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.4% compared to the 6.8% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for the second half of fiscal year 2024. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 20%, underpinned by strong revenue growth and modest growth in our operating expenses. Following the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, our net interest expense for the quarter was $14 million. And as we continue to pay down debt, we expect interest expense to be in the range of $10 million to $12 million per quarter in the second half of fiscal year 2024. Our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 20.7% compared to 18.3% in the prior year quarter. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a significant reduction in the tax benefit associated with employee equity compensation this quarter compared to the prior year quarter. We continue to estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the December quarter increased by 13% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 13%. During the quarter, we recorded $64.2 million of restructuring-related charges following an evaluation of our existing operations and actions undertaken to improve operational efficiency and increase profitability. Restructuring charges included $28.6 million of employee severance and other onetime termination benefits, $33.2 million of intangible asset impairments associated with the wind down of certain business activities and $2.4 million of other asset impairments. The restructure charge has been treated as a non-GAAP item in our Q2 financial results. During the quarter, we also recorded a provision of $6.4 million for expected costs associated with the recently announced Masks with magnets field safety notification. This expense has been treated as a non-GAAP item in our Q2 financial results. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $273 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings and relatively stable working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $23 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $45 million. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $210 million. On December 31, we have $1.2 billion in gross debt and $1 billion in net debt. During the quarter, we reduced our debt by $130 million. On December 31, we had approximately $955 million available for drawdown under our revolver facility, and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share. As we advised last quarter, as part of our capital management activities, we resumed our previously authorized share buyback program in the December quarter. We purchased 335,000 shares for consideration of $50 million. We intend to continue to purchase approximately $50 million per quarter in the second half of fiscal year 2024. This will more than offset any dilution from the vesting of equity to employees during the year. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D, pay down outstanding debt and deploy further capital for tuck-in acquisitions. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Brett, and thank you, Mick. Let's go ahead and turn to the Q&A portion of our call. Kevin, I'd like to turn it over to you to provide the instructions and then run this part of the call.\nOperator: Certainly, we'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Margaret Andrew from William Blair. Your line is now live. We do ask you ask limit yourselves to one question please.\nMargaret Andrew: Great. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Good morning to everyone on the call. I wanted to maybe follow-up on your comments on GLP-1, even more so than the quarter. And I look at that 10% greater likelihood of folks starting CPAP when you're on a GLP, it seems like it could have a pretty meaningful impact for growth. And again, looking at it to say, if you're going from 75 patient new starts in a given period to 85, that's a 13% bigger market every year. So I guess conceptually, is that something that you agree with? Would it have a greater or less benefit impact if that trend continues? And I guess any comments on a real impact is over the next three years as GLP adoption grows? Thanks.\nMichael Farrell: Yes, Margaret. Look, it's a great question. And as a biomedical engineer, I look at this, and I don't know causality, I just know the correlation. And so we've now got data, the 529,000 data points that show that there's a 10% higher propensity to start PAP therapy if you prescribe the GLP-1 before and then you get the PAP therapy, 10 absolute percentage points higher of the cohort will start PAP therapy. My thought is that this is a more motivated patient, a more engaged patient in the health care system, and they've been brought in by this new therapeutic tool. And so I do think that it will lead to greater growth. This megatrend of GLP-1s will lead to greater growth of patients coming into our treatment pool over time. And certainly, the data is showing that with that cohort of patients. Yes, your quick math there of an increase, I think, is that if there's full penetration across the whole patient cohort and full adoption GLP-1s across every patient coming through. Of course, that's the maximum state. But I think realistically, as we see this pretty fast rollout of this new pharmaceutical class, we will start to see more patients come into the health care system. Everyone is seeing that across medtech and across health care. They are more engaged and they do seem to be getting prescriptions for many different chronic diseases. Sleep apnea is non-exception. And we've got probably one of the highest number of patients in that cohort of over 0.5 million patients that we're tracking. And of course, we've got 26 million patients in our database. So this is a minority of patients that we're seeing on these, but it is interesting within that cohort to see a higher participation rate. Look, our goal will be to leverage that megatrend and to make sure that ResMed is there with the best tools for screening, diagnosis, treatment and management. And we've done that over decades, and we plan to do it ahead. I think maybe the consumer big tech trend of sleep wellness tracking might be slightly higher in its impact over time, maybe not as quick adoption, but these sleep wellness tools come across all consumer tech applications is incredibly exciting. ResMed's goal is there to leverage this demand gen that's coming to us from Big Pharma and big consumer tech, but then more importantly, to get that personalized health journey so that ResMed can be truly the concierge for that person if they find their path to better sleep and better health. So we do expect these trends to be positive. They won't be immediate. And our job is to drive it over time.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Anthony Petrone from Mizuho Group. Your line is now live.\nAnthony Petrone: Thank you for taking my questions. Congrats on a good quarter here. Maybe Mick will stay on GLP-1s, we're getting a lot of attention turning toward the Eli Lilly SURMOUNT-OSA study. And maybe the KPIs that you're looking for in that study how relevant do you think the primary endpoint is? Are there other secondary endpoints that are more important? And do you think over time you can collaborate with Lilly to drive the effort of using CPAP with the GLP-1? Thanks.\nMichael Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Anthony. And it's a really pertinent one. Certainly, we're watching this SURMOUNT-OSA trial. It's a pretty small trial. It's less than 500 patients, 500, 600 patients, I believe. So it's not sort of the order of the real world event, real-world data that we have, like 500,000 patients we're talking about there. But I think it will be very interesting to see the presumption is given it's the same biochemical compound as in other trials used for diabetes treatment and weight loss that it will have somewhere in the order of 10%, 20%, maybe even 30% weight loss reduction in this cohort. So that's a metric that's sort of well-known from prior studies. The best evidence from the primary investigator on this Professor Atul Malhotra from University of California, San Diego. His assessment is that, that should lead to pretty significant AHI reductions in the treatment cohort versus placebo, maybe in the order of to maybe 65% AHI reductions in the cohort of these quite high BMI and quite high AHI patients. If you listen to a great podcast between Professor Malhotra and Dr. Carlos Nunez, our Chief Medical Officer, which are available on our website. When you've got to spare 45 minutes, but there are some cliff notes that I think are worth sharing here in this investor call is that Professor Malhotra was asked what's the best therapy to treat sleep apnea. Is it, a, weight loss? Or is it b, CPAP. And he said, \"Well, that's a false dichotomy, this question, it's a false competition. It's a plus b. It has been for decades and will be for decades in the future. And as a PI on that study, he says, look, we have a new pharmaceutical agent that's going to help with treatment a. And of course, that will be used in combination with treatment B. So the PI on the study is saying that he thinks the combination treatment of a weight loss medication similar to prior work and bariatric surgery that had much higher weight loss numbers or diet and exercise that had all the variance that we've seen over decades of different methodologies there. But this one does seem to be a good agent for treatment a. And then will need to be combined with treatment b to fully treat the sleep suffocation that the patients will have. So don't trust me, the CEO of the company that makes the therapeutic, trust the primary investigator that's saying, combination treatment has worked for decades and will work for decades. I would expect that to be the outcome the trial. And in terms of working with Big Pharma on this, I think they're very focused on other areas like obesity and diabetes, but as much as we can get their attention to talk about sleep and sleep health and to do their D2P advertising to talk about the importance of sleep and sleep health. I think combined with the Apples and the Samsungs and the Googles of the world talking about it, it will be a huge positive for of us in the sleep apnea treatment industry. Thanks for the question, Anthony.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live.\nMichael Matson: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I'll just ask one on Philips. So I think they've talked about relaunching their flow generators in some of the OUS markets, just curious what you're seeing there? Have you seen that happening? And have they been able to recapture share anywhere?\nMichael Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Mike. And yes, certainly in tens of countries in Europe and Asia. We are in full competition with all the global players, including the company you mentioned and the large regionals from Europe and from Asia and have been for many quarters. So they've come back in masks and devices across tens of countries in Europe and Asia. And their goal there when they come back, if they've been out for a year or two, depending on the time they're out of each market is to fight their way from the bottom. They've got zero percent new patient start share when they first come back in and they're trying to fight their way up. And in general, they had to fight against the number two, the number three and the number four player who don't have like ResMed has the leading technology, the best AirSense platform, right. The AirSense 11 globally is the best platform in all 140 countries. The second best platform in, I would say, all 140 countries is the AirSense 10 platform. So their goal is to then fight against regional player from Europe with the number three or a regional player from Asia, with the number four in the country that they're coming back. And so we're seeing that country by country. We're seeing them fight for that share at the low end. It's our focus as the market leader is on growing the market. And I think they're a fair competitor. We've competed against them for decades since they bought Respironics. And in general, we've won and taken share. We were winning and taking share from them in 2019. We're winning and taking share from the 2023 and 2024 as they come back country by country. And if and when they come back to the U.S. marketing devices, by the way, they're already here on masks, never left, and we've been competing and leading them there. I look forward to them coming back to the U.S. market so we can get any stock overhang away about what's it going to look like and what it's going to look like is what it looks like in all the other tens of countries where they fight for share from the bottom and work their way up. And I look forward to competition, a healthy competition. And we seem to do very well in it because we've got the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, most connected and most intelligent solutions, and it's really about that. It's about the value you provide getting that patient to the right care, lowering the cost and improving adherence. And we've done a great job, and I like all global competition in the space.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.\nSuraj Kalia: Hey, Mick, can you hear me all right?\nMichael Farrell: Got you loud and clear, Suraj.\nSuraj Kalia: Congrats on the nice quarter. So Mick, in the 2030 operating model, right? If I got your commentary right, ResMed brand and profitability, velocity of product control some of these things that you highlighted, I guess, way does Compliance Coach fit within the 2030 strategic model? More specifically, I'm just trying to understand how do you measure the ROI in the Compliance Coach. And I presume this is going to be a primarily a reactive AI model. Any additional clarity would be great? Thanks.\nMichael Farrell: Well, thanks, Suraj. I could spend the rest of the time answering that call around the 2030 operating model. I'll just briefly talk about it and then talk specifically about Compliance Coach. Our 2030 operating model, yes, it's the three tenets, right? The three tenets product-led, customer-centric brand enhanced. ResMed has always been product led, but now we have a Global Chief Product Officer, whose sole role is to curate that product portfolio with an amazing team of hundreds of engineers and marketers to bring the great innovation to market. So we'll measure the success on that on product velocity, how quickly do we bring innovation to market, time to market, time to success. Customer-centric. We've always been customer-centric. But we have always done the best of analyzing the Net Promoter Scores of patients, Net Promoter Scores of physicians, home care providers. Physician payer providers and so on. So really understanding the marketing metrics around that, having our first Chief Marketing Officer sit at the top table and really be laser-focused on those NPS scores and driving them up and really valuing the multibillion-dollar ResMed brand and enhancing that over time. And the third part around focusing on profitable growth and driving that leverage with our first Chief Revenue Officer, it's really around that profitable growth. And if the title was used broadly, I would call it the Chief Profitable Growth Officer rather than Chief Revenue Officer, but really, it's around keeping that discipline on the great growth we've had on the topline, but ensuring we get that leverage through OpEx R&D and particularly on SG&A in the new world to do things differently with tech.  And that segues into the second part of your question, Compliance Coach. Yes, look, this is a great AI tool. By the way, it's not generative AI Compliance Coach. The other one that we launched in Asia Pacific, the digital concierge is generative AI and has that extra capability. Compliance Coach is [garden-variety], what would have been called machine learning is now artificial intelligence, it's a great algorithm, and it's out there. The measure of that one, success on that one, Suraj, is does it lower the cost to serve at that HME or with the same labor force of respiratory therapists and pulmonary doctors can they serve more patients. So lower cost, higher efficiency, and really, the key metric is what's the adherence rate at day 90, day 365, year two, year three, in that patient cohort that's gone through Compliance Coach. Is it statistically and significantly higher than what that customer was getting before? If they're a best-in-class ResMed customer getting 87% adherence at day 90, does it go up to 90, does it go up to 92. And by the way, those customers are very sophisticated in understanding what that means for their business, what it means for them showing the payers that they reduce costs in hospital care and that they improve outcomes for the patient and how they feel and of course, how they improve their own revenue and hours through replenishment supplies. Anyway, that's my \u2013 the briefest answer I could do to that great question. Thanks, Suraj.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden. Your line is now live.\nSteven Wheen: Yes. Good morning. Just a question for Brett. Brett, I was just wondering if we could look into the gross margin a little bit further and trying to understand, are we seeing in \u2013 across that quarter, the full benefit of the price that you've taken? Or is that some annualization effect as some customers perhaps roll off contracts and whether or not from a rate perspective, could you just kind of reiterate what your expectations are there, what you're seeing with regard to the pricing following the conflict?\nBrett Sandercock: Yes. Sure, Steve. So yes, I mean, on the gross margin and recent price increases we put through during the quarter, some of those are obviously be contractual arrangements there as well. So we've put some \u2013 some of it's gone through as a general increase, and then there will be specific contractual arrangements that means those pricing will be a little bit progressive. I guess if you look over the back half of fiscal 2024 on that. So let's call that be kind of progressively roll through. But we're definitely seeing some of that impact already on that. I think the second part of your question was around \u2013 is that around the sort of freight Red Sea disruptions and so on?\nSteven Wheen: Yes. Just what you were sort of intimating, if you could just repeat that commentary, what you're seeing in the market and how you actually are trying to anticipate or protect yourselves against that?\nBrett Sandercock: Yes. Yes. So we're definitely seeing the impact there and a lot of that shipping is obviously not going through the Red Sea, but then going around kind of good hope. So that's happening certainly increased lead times, I think, probably you could be looking at two to three weeks on that. Particularly, this is a particularly trading to Europe in particular, but also to some extent, to the U.S. where you've got to find alternate freight paths, if you like. So that's having an impact. And we're also seeing some increase in actual freight rates as well. And I think this is an industry wide not just ourselves. So we're looking at that closely. We're looking at alternative routes. We're looking at multimodal distribution there. So there's a number of things we're looking at to mitigate that where we can. But it realistically probably see some uptick in freight cross. It would not manifest in our P&L in Q3, but there could be some headwinds in Q4 on that. But again, I think we've just got to see how that evolves over the next little while.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey Capital. Your line is now live.\nSaul Hadassin: Thanks. Good afternoon, good morning. Just another question for Brett. Brett, just regarding the restructuring charges and also the charge for the Mask recall. Is that done now in terms of those P&L costs? Or do you expect any further costs to be incurred in third quarter or indeed fourth quarter this fiscal year? Thanks.\nBrett Sandercock: Yes we\u2019re largely through that. I mean, I can't \u2013 I don't think you can rule out restructures from time to time, but I think the material restructure that we did is behind us now. So going \u2013 anything going forward, I think, would be pretty minor on that. So I would say \u2013 I'd characterize that as saying, yes, we've done the big restructure, and that should clear us now for the next\u2026\nMichael Farrell: Just to jump in there, Brett, a little bit specifically to Saul's question about the mask with magnets upgrade of our labeling, which was classed as a recall in the U.S. and some other jurisdictions. That cost was fully taken account of in this quarter. We're not expecting to add anything more on the mask with magnets action relabel and recall in certain jurisdictions.\nBrett Sandercock: Yes, absolutely.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Mathieu Chevrier from Citi. Your line is now live.\nMathieu Chevrier: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Simple one, when do you expect to be fully transitioned the AirSense 11 platform?\nMichael Farrell: Mathieu, a very simple question, but rather complex answer in that we sell in 140 countries worldwide, and each of them most of them have their own regulatory pathway and often very different and complex and obviously, labeling language customization of the product for all regulatory requirements needed in all those 140 countries. So we clearly launched in our top countries were launched in the U.S. many countries in Europe. We just got Japan last quarter, the quarter before and we're starting to ramp up there. And you saw that in the good growth numbers in devices in Europe, Asia and other in the quarter of 16%, there was some good sort of starting that ramp there in a place like Japan, which, as you know, is a fleet driven market versus a by-quarter driven market. And so great to see Japan \u2013 the citizens of Japan to be able to get access to the best in the world technology in the AirSense 11. But look, we've got hundreds of countries \u2013 over 100 countries, we still have to go there. And so we've got to get regulatory country by country. And we care about people suffocating in all of those 140 countries in the same way. And so our regulatory and quality team with Dawn Haake, our Chief Quality and Regulatory Officer working intensely with all the regulatory authorities in those countries and we have to ramp that up. And then in addition, we're ramping up supply. The good news is that we have the second best platform in the world in the AirSense 10, and that is completely unconstrained. So you do suffocate and get a prescription in the country that AirSense 11 is not cleared yet, you can get access to incredibly small, quiet and efficacious therapy in the AirSense 10 platform and our best in the world mask platform. And so there's no simple answer to when it will be completely done in 100% in all countries because I think as indifferent to maybe the AirSense 7 to AirSense 8, AirSense 8 to AirSense 9 and AirSense 9 to AirSense 10 generations is that we have a pretty unique situation with our global citizenship here. We are the global leader, and we've got a different responsibility to maintain our second best platform, which is the second best in the world for a little longer. And so that will be out. And I'm not going to give a defined end date now, but I will tell you this. We're going country by country, we're driving regulatory and we're scaling manufacturing as fast as we can on AirSense 11 because it is better technology, is low cost to make, and we are able to have a premium for it in pricing. So it makes sense for us, the customers and for our shareholders.\nOperator: Next question today is coming from Matt Taylor from Jefferies. Your line is now live.\nMatt Taylor: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a follow-up question on the SURMOUNT study. I think you outlined a lot of the high-level stuff there really well. My question is a little more specific. I wanted to ask about what you thought you could see in terms of comparing the two arms of GLP-1 versus CPAP plus GLP-1? Do you think you'll see a difference there what would you make of their results if there is a different one way or the other?\nMichael Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Matt. And so for those of you who haven't read through the nih.gov, feel free to go. But my reading, I'm a visual learner. There's a split chart that the top half of it on the trial is a GLP-1 side and the bottom half is a placebo side. And so they have this 600-odd or less than 600 patients split between those two in a certain proportion. And then within the GLP-1 arm, they split to those on CPAP and those not on CPAP and the same within the placebo. So there ends up being four arms if you look at it. But if you go to the end of it, there's an arm that's placebo, no CPAP. So I'd just call that the placebo arm. And then there's placebo plus CPAP arm and then there's GLP alone arm and GLP plus PAP arm. So you start to get down to the subanalyses, it gets less powered. I actually \u2013 I'm reading what you are on nih.gov. So my presumption is at the highest level, they want to show that a GLP-1 is better than placebo for lowering weight and improving AHI. I think they'll achieve that primary outcome. I mean all the data show that there's 10%, 20%, 30% weight loss reduction and that should correlate to significant AI reduction. So I think they'll show that. As opposed to then the sub-studies of CPAP versus no CPAP within each of those, look, we've got 35 years of history knowing that CPAP doesn't half treat, right? I mean, the best that I've seen from weight loss reductions in bariatric surgeries and the best the GLP-1 prelim data is that it can half treat, right? Maybe 50% reduction in AHI. I'd call that half treatment. I don't think any pulmonary physician in the world would be happy with half treating an AHI with positive airway pressure. Frankly, if you're not turning the AHI to less than five, you're not truly treating the patient. And if it's higher than five, it might be residual centrals and you have to move them to a bilevel or it might be complex sleep apnea have to move them to adaptive servo-ventilation. So there's so many options between CPAP, APAP bilevel ASV that the physicians should walk through, but they wouldn't be happy unless the AHI is less than 5%. I think the probability \u2013 and don't trust me and my quote on this, Matt. Again, the primary investigator on the study, Professor Malhotra said, the idea that weight loss alone can treat sleep apnea is preposterous. That was the word he used. So you can use \u2013 and he's the PI on this study. You can use his thoughts to what he thinks between the PAP arm and the non-PAP arm. So he's sort of leaning towards what he said earlier, that best treatment for sleep apnea is not a) weight loss or b) CPAP, it's a plus b. And so that's what I expect this study to show. And we'll see the data. They will be out there in three weeks and whatever they want to release in headline and we'll continue to go. We'll continue to grow. We'll continue to drive patients into the funnel, and I think this therapeutic class will help us over the coming decade to bring more patients into the funnel.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nLyanne Harrison: Yes. Good morning, Mike. So, Mick, Brett, and Amy. I might ask a question about your device and mask sales there. So obviously, strong device sales, your resupply programs, obviously, giving that some focus. But masks this quarter came out weaker than where we expected. Can you talk us through where the disconnect there might be?\nMichael Farrell: Thanks for the question, Lyanne. And yes, really, really happy to take questions and talk about our devices business and our mask business. So look, devices growth globally, incredibly strong in the quarter at 11%. Masks growth globally incredibly strong at 9%. We talk about the market being mid-single-digit growth for devices, so we\u2019re clearly well ahead of that with the launch of AirSense 11 in Japan and Europe, Asia Rest of World and doing well in the U.S. a couple of hundred basis points above. And then in masks and accessory, you talked about global growth being in high single digits. And so beating that in U.S., Canada, Latin America, but what you're probably focusing on is the Europe, Asia and Rest of World growth there in Q2 FY2024 being 4%, right? And just to be clear, the Q2 FY2023 growth in that same category was 14%. And we were taking 500 basis points a share 12 months ago and then losing it this quarter. I really think if you look at the weighted average over that, which is, what, 18 divided by 2 is 9% is sort of more in line with the market growth in that mid- to high single-digit growth of masks there. And look, there's some things around some contracts with the particular countries that were moved from December to January and others. I'm not going to go to all the details other than to say, we look really closely at share. We look really closely at what we're doing. And this 90-day snapshot four quarters ago, which showed 14%. We weren't taking 500 basis points a share. We were holding share, growing in a little \u2013 a category here or there. And now this quarter at 4%, we're not losing 500 bps a share. We're actually holding share across that and it's due to some of those shipping areas \u2013 launch areas and frankly, a couple of tenders that will move from one month to another. So really not much to see in that. But what I will say is that as we move forward, maintaining that high single-digit growth in devices globally, and the high \u2013 sorry, mid-single-digit growth in devices globally and high single-digit growth in masks globally is not a given. We've got to drive that demand. We've got to leverage this Big Pharma trend. We've got to leverage the big tech trend \u2013 and we've got to get better at doing demand generation in the areas where we know we can push it up. And so that's what we're going to be focused on going forward. I hope that answers your question, Lyanne.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Michael Polark from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live.\nMichael Polark: Hey, good afternoon. I will ask a mask question as well following up there in a slightly different way. So the U.S. number was up 2% sequentially. Normally, you see a high single-digit increase Q-over-Q kind of year-end seasonality in the U.S. deductible flush, that kind of thing. Kind of what are the puts and takes in that number? And the specific question is, did the Magnet field safety notice kind of limit your ability to fully capture mass demand in the quarter? Or were there other influences? Thank you so much.\nMichael Farrell: Yes. Great question, Michael. So yes, U.S., Canada and Latin America, a 10% growth in the mask in the quarter. It was actually a very strong market growth rate, high single digits, holding share there. We do see that December, particularly for U.S. markets where high deductibles and deductibles reset December 31, some good revenue there. And so we had good comp from the year before, and both solid numbers there from the comp year before this 10% U.S. Canada Latin America growth. So I think we did really well there as we closed out the quarter. In terms of any impact from the masks with magnets update on our labeling class in the U.S. by the U.S. FDA as a recall. I got to tell you, there was no product removed from the market. This was about having our plastic clips as an option, which we scaled up manufacturing and have them as an option. So when a patient is set up, if they're a very, very small minority of people who haven't implanted pacemaker or other metal device in their upper chest or craniofacial area, then those patients are offered an upgrade to the plastic clips. For everyone else, the other 95%, 99% of patients they keep the convenience of the magnet. So that if they go to the bathroom in the night, they can come back in the dark and just clip it on and not have to seek for plastic clips to click together the magnet completely goes on there. And so as we've done that labeling upgrade, and we had a competitor do this similar one about 12 months ago, the market has been very trained in knowing to ask questions about implants to ask questions about our partner's implants. And if they have that to offer the plastics clips, which are fully available on ResMed masks as an alternative to our mass with magnets. The masks with magnets are so convenient. They're doing so well and for 99% of people, they're great. For that 1%, the HMEs are very comfortable now to ask those questions. And the other 140 countries we are working through the appropriate ways to ask the questions and get people the best mask and have the best fit and drive the best adherence over time. But they had no impact on the quarterly sales whatsoever. And we don't expect an impact going forward because this was an upgrade to a labeling that was actually in line with clinical practice over the last 12 months. And it just makes sense to do that. Thanks a lot for the question, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further or closing comments.\nMichael Farrell: Thanks, Kevin, and thank you again to all of our stakeholders for joining us on this call. The opportunity in front of us is huge and largely untapped. It's an incredible runway. We see more and more people coming into the health care system, and this will benefit us as we seek to help them sleep better, breathe better and live better lives in 140 countries. Thank you to all 10,000 ResMedians. Many of you are also shareholders for what you do today and every day. With that, I'll hand the call back to Amy to close this out.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Mick. Thanks, everyone, for listening. We do appreciate your time and your interest. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out directly. This does conclude our second quarter 2024 conference call. Kevin, you can go ahead and close this out.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Brett Sandercock",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms, where applicable. We had strong financial performance in Q2. Group revenue for the December quarter was $1.16 billion, a 12% headline increase and 11% in constant currency terms. Revenue growth reflects the ongoing combined availability of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 sleep devices to support solid underlying global demand and continued growth across our mask portfolio. Year-over-year movements in foreign currencies positively impacted revenue by approximately $11 million in the December quarter. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries increased by 9%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 12%. Globally, device sales increased by 11%, while masks and other sales increased by 9%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 7%, masks and other sales increased by 10%, reflecting growth in resupply and new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales increased by 16%, again, reflecting strong demand and significantly improved availability of cloud connected devices. Mask and other sales increased by 4%, reflecting the impact of a strong prior year comparable growth rate. Software-as-a-Service revenue increased by 24% in the December quarter, reflecting the contribution from our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, and continued strong performance from our HME vertical. Excluding our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, SaaS revenue grew by 10% in the December quarter. MEDIFOX DAN contributed revenue of $28 million in the December quarter, consistent with our expectations at the time of the acquisition. Note as we have now passed the first year anniversary of our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, our future SaaS revenue year-over-year will reflect organic growth. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Gross margin increased by 10 basis points to 56.9% in the December quarter. The increase primarily reflects a decrease in freight costs and increase in average selling prices and favorable foreign currency movements. The benefits are partially offset by unfavorable product mix. Sequential gross margin increased by 90 basis points, primarily driven by a reduction in freight costs and an increase in average selling prices for our devices, partially offset by unfavorable product mix. We remain confident of a positive gross margin trajectory. Like many companies, we are monitoring potential headwinds that could arise in the Middle East conflict. Disruptions in the Red Sea will likely increase sea freight costs and shipping lead times. We're closely tracking the situation and taking action to mitigate potential impacts where we can. Moving on to operating expenses. SG&A expenses for the second quarter increased by 4%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related costs. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 19.1% compared to 20.5% in the prior year period and reflects savings and cost discipline following specific actions taken early in the December quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 20% for the second half of fiscal year 2024. This guidance reflects the impact of our restructuring activities that resulted in a reduction in our workforce of approximately 5% during the quarter. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 6%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.4% compared to the 6.8% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for the second half of fiscal year 2024. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 20%, underpinned by strong revenue growth and modest growth in our operating expenses. Following the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, our net interest expense for the quarter was $14 million. And as we continue to pay down debt, we expect interest expense to be in the range of $10 million to $12 million per quarter in the second half of fiscal year 2024. Our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 20.7% compared to 18.3% in the prior year quarter. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a significant reduction in the tax benefit associated with employee equity compensation this quarter compared to the prior year quarter. We continue to estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the December quarter increased by 13% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 13%. During the quarter, we recorded $64.2 million of restructuring-related charges following an evaluation of our existing operations and actions undertaken to improve operational efficiency and increase profitability. Restructuring charges included $28.6 million of employee severance and other onetime termination benefits, $33.2 million of intangible asset impairments associated with the wind down of certain business activities and $2.4 million of other asset impairments. The restructure charge has been treated as a non-GAAP item in our Q2 financial results. During the quarter, we also recorded a provision of $6.4 million for expected costs associated with the recently announced Masks with magnets field safety notification. This expense has been treated as a non-GAAP item in our Q2 financial results. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $273 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings and relatively stable working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $23 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $45 million. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $210 million. On December 31, we have $1.2 billion in gross debt and $1 billion in net debt. During the quarter, we reduced our debt by $130 million. On December 31, we had approximately $955 million available for drawdown under our revolver facility, and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share. As we advised last quarter, as part of our capital management activities, we resumed our previously authorized share buyback program in the December quarter. We purchased 335,000 shares for consideration of $50 million. We intend to continue to purchase approximately $50 million per quarter in the second half of fiscal year 2024. This will more than offset any dilution from the vesting of equity to employees during the year. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D, pay down outstanding debt and deploy further capital for tuck-in acquisitions. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. Yes. Sure, Steve. So yes, I mean, on the gross margin and recent price increases we put through during the quarter, some of those are obviously be contractual arrangements there as well. So we've put some \u2013 some of it's gone through as a general increase, and then there will be specific contractual arrangements that means those pricing will be a little bit progressive. I guess if you look over the back half of fiscal 2024 on that. So let's call that be kind of progressively roll through. But we're definitely seeing some of that impact already on that. I think the second part of your question was around \u2013 is that around the sort of freight Red Sea disruptions and so on? Yes. Yes. So we're definitely seeing the impact there and a lot of that shipping is obviously not going through the Red Sea, but then going around kind of good hope. So that's happening certainly increased lead times, I think, probably you could be looking at two to three weeks on that. Particularly, this is a particularly trading to Europe in particular, but also to some extent, to the U.S. where you've got to find alternate freight paths, if you like. So that's having an impact. And we're also seeing some increase in actual freight rates as well. And I think this is an industry wide not just ourselves. So we're looking at that closely. We're looking at alternative routes. We're looking at multimodal distribution there. So there's a number of things we're looking at to mitigate that where we can. But it realistically probably see some uptick in freight cross. It would not manifest in our P&L in Q3, but there could be some headwinds in Q4 on that. But again, I think we've just got to see how that evolves over the next little while. Yes we're largely through that. I mean, I can't \u2013 I don't think you can rule out restructures from time to time, but I think the material restructure that we did is behind us now. So going \u2013 anything going forward, I think, would be pretty minor on that. So I would say \u2013 I'd characterize that as saying, yes, we've done the big restructure, and that should clear us now for the next... Yes, absolutely."

            "name": "Michael Farrell",
            "content": "Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today. Our second quarter fiscal year 2024 results reflect strong execution across our entire business, driving double-digit top and bottom line growth. These results are a testament to the incredible efforts of the global ResMed team. Our results were driven by double-digit global growth in both devices and our Software-as-a-Service business together with high single-digit global growth in our masks and accessories business, holding our leading market share amongst high comps from the same quarter a year ago. In terms of bottom line leverage, our reorganization efforts and efficiency efforts in the quarter have set us on a clear trajectory of profitable growth. Taking a step back, all 10,000 ResMedians are energized about the opportunities in front of us. There are over 2 billion people worldwide suffering from sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular disease or insomnia. These chronic conditions form a healthcare epidemic in which ResMed is uniquely positioned to help. We believe that healthcare should be delivered in the lowest cost, lowest security and highest comfort location possible. Very often, that is a patient's own home. Our end markets remain underpenetrated with many opportunities to add value, reduce friction, lower costs and improve patient outcomes. We support hundreds of millions of people as they take control of their healthcare journey and navigate the complex healthcare world outside the hospital system. ResMed is the global leader in digital health solutions with over 17 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 23.5 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices sold into over 140 countries worldwide. We are the clear market leader in sleep apnea, a huge and growing market with over 1 billion people impacted globally. Our category-leading flow generator platforms grew 11% year-over-year. We have achieved and are maintaining supply of our two 100% connectable AirSense platforms, with unconstrained supply of the AirSense 10 platform globally. Every quarter, we continue to gain regulatory approvals to launch and to increase delivery volumes of the best-in-class AirSense 11 platform on our pathway to support more and more patients worldwide. Our commercial teams are successfully demonstrating the clinical and economic benefits of the ResMed mask portfolio. During the quarter, our masks and accessories business grew 9% year-over-year in a highly competitive market, maintaining good market share with all players in the field in this category globally. We are excited to have achieved regulatory and reimbursement approval for our latest and greatest mask innovation and we look forward to bringing this technology to market soon. I have personally worn this new mask and our test data show, not just n equals one from the CEO, that it is highly favored by physicians, respiratory therapists and especially the most important customer, our patients. In terms of maintaining our momentum of mask and accessory growth, our clinical and commercial teams continue to partner with physicians and providers to drive resupply programs directly with their patients. Peer-reviewed and published clinical evidence shows that using resupply programs leads to better patient adherence and to better patient outcomes. This is proving out in the real-world customer by customer. We continue to see strong growth in the U.S. mask and accessories business, where resupply programs are powered by our digital health ecosystem, including AirView for physicians, Brightree for home care medical equipment providers and myAir for patients. Outside the U.S., we are focused on developing, launching and scaling our direct outreach and subscription programs, to help consumers take control of their own health and engage directly in refreshing their own mask, their own tubing, their own humidifier and other accessories. The importance of respiratory health and respiratory hygiene in the eyes of consumers has seen a permanent uptick since four years ago when the COVID-19 epidemic started. We are supporting our customers with digital solutions and services to meet their needs and to ensure they have clean and fresh equipment to best treat their sleep suffocation and improve their health. Before I review updates on our key strategic priorities, I'd like to discuss recent actions we have taken to accelerate profitable growth across ResMed and to power our long-term success. Last quarter, I discussed the steps we've taken to ensure that we can refocus and drive even more profitable growth. We stopped some projects that were not working out and we increased investment in areas that will be pivotal to our long-term success, including our digital health technology investments as well as focused device platform and mask technology development. We have introduced a new operating model centered on making ResMed even more product-led, even more customer-centric and even more brand enhanced. We will measure the success of this new 2030 operating model by an increase in the velocity of new product innovation as well as enhanced value in the ResMed brand while accelerating profitable growth. As the founder of ResMed states, innovation is not just invention of a great new technology is when a customer loves it, adopts it and chooses to pay for it. We have an incredible legacy and an exciting product pipeline to bring to market. Let's now turn to a discussion of our three key strategic priorities. Number one is to grow and differentiate our core sleep health and breathing health business. Number two is to design and develop and deliver market-leading med tech and digital health solutions that can be scaled in 140 countries plus worldwide. Number three is to create and leverage the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and preferably in the home. In terms of addressing strategic priority, number one, as the world's clear leader in the field of sleep apnea and breathing health, we are laser-focused in 2024 on ramping up our demand generation initiatives. We are raising awareness and creating pathways for patients to find access to care for sleep suffocation across specific global markets. We are leveraging traditional healthcare channels and investing in cost-effective social media-driven demand generation campaigns to help consumers who are concerned about their own sleep and breathing to find their way into screening, diagnostic, treatment and management pathways. Our goal is to provide a digital healthcare concierge service to help guide people on that journey. We are tracking new patient starts in our physician and provider-based ecosystem, which now contains more than 26 million patient records as well as the new user starts in myAir, which is a patient app where patients choose to participate in their own personalized healthcare journey to better sleep and better breathing. Our goal is to cost effectively drive more and more of the over 1 billion people worldwide who need our help into the channel. There are two megatrends that can have an influence on increasing that patient flow, one from big consumer tech and one from Big Pharma. Let me talk briefly about each of these megatrends. Many of the big consumer tech companies are increasing their focus on the area of sleep wellness. Apple has sleep wellness tracking built into its latest-generation Apple Watch and has plans to enhance that capability with further sleep quality assessment. Google's Fitbit division has sleep wellness tracking built into its platform. WHOOP is doing the same. Samsung have not only built sleep wellness tracking into its latest operating platform, but is helping to define sleep personas to help consumers better understand a 30% of their lives they spend in the state of sleep. We love this attention on the field of sleep wellness and many of these technologies will help each person find out if they have issues with sleep architecture, issues with breathing during sleep, or issues maintaining high quality sleep. This could be one of the biggest waves of people taking control of their own pathway for discovering they have sleep apnea or they have insomnia, well, maybe they have both, a state that is called COMISA for co-morbid insomnia and sleep apnea. Ultimately, this will lead to increasing patient growth for ResMed overall. And our goal is to best educate the person as they move from sleep wellness tracking to sleep health tracking and from consumer awareness into a true healthcare pathway for screening, diagnosis, treatment and ongoing management of their chronic condition. ResMed plans to be there with the person through that entire journey. In terms of the impact of megatrends from Big Pharma, the current focus is squarely on GLP-1 medications. Let me take some time to address what we are seeing in the market with patients on latest-generation GLP-1 therapies and positive airway pressure therapy. We are tracking a cohort of over 0.5 million patients with prescriptions for both GLP-1 medications and positive airway pressure therapy. These data are included in our investor deck, so you can review them there on our website, but I'll briefly summarize what we have observed. Around six months ago, there was a thought among some in the market that patients on GLP-1 medications would be less likely to start positive airway pressure therapy. We stated at the time and still do, that this was not likely the case as important risk factors such as craniofacial geometry, gender, age and the basic physics and anatomy of the upper airway would remain unchanged despite this new pharmaceutical therapy option. Still, the theory remained. So now we have real-world data and real-world evidence at scale. Our analysis of over 529,000 patients with GLP-1 prescriptions shows that not only is there not a reduction in the propensity to start positive airway pressure therapy, it is the exact opposite. For patients who have been prescribed a GLP-1, there is an increase of 10% of the absolute percentage of patients that commence positive airway pressure therapy. So as an example, if you take a baseline of 75% of patients that commence PAP therapy after their prescription on average in a certain group, that would become 85% of those same patients who were on a GLP-1 that would commence positive airway pressure therapy. And by the way, the vast, vast majority of these GLP-1s are the latest generation medications. Another hypothesis about six months ago was that patients on GLP-1 therapy and PAP therapy would quit their PAP therapy, their CPAP or their APAP at a higher rate than the general population over time. The real world data, again, with a cohort of over 0.5 million patients shows the exact opposite. At T equals 12 months after therapy commencement on PAP, the delta from general PAP population to a PAP plus GLP-1 prescribed population shows an increase in the resupply rate of 300 basis points. So again, as an example, if the general population resupply rate at 12 months was, say, 70%, it would then become 73% for the population that was prescribed to both PAP and GLP-1 therapy. This delta actually increases over time going further with the delta from the general PAP population receiving resupply at 12 months being 500 basis points higher for a population prescribed both PAP and GLP-1s. Here at ResMed, we believe in treating the whole person, including a combination of what Professor Bill Dement, one of the founders of the field of sleep medicine, may he rest in peace, called the Triumvirate of Health. That triumvirate is one, regular cardiovascular exercise; two, balanced diet and nutrition; and three, good sleep and breathing. We believe that addressing all three aspects results in the best patient outcomes. In terms of best-in-class treatment for sleep apnea, achieving that goal of good sleep and good breathing, we have peer-reviewed and published research demonstrating that we can achieve over 87% of patients adherent to our PAP technology by combining our market-leading device platforms with digital health solutions, including AirView for physicians and myAir for patients. Even with this best-in-class global technology, we still have more than 10% of patients that need alternatives. We just can't get them adherent those 10%. We are investing in these alternative therapies and we are working to help patients who do not adhere to positive airway pressure to find their path to second-tier therapies, such as dental devices where ResMed has invested and scaled the market-leading 3D printed dental device for sleep apnea in Europe called Narval. In addition, we have investments in other third-tier therapies, including pharmaceutical agents with our Apnimed investment as well as hypoglossal nerve stimulation technology with our Nyxoah investment. ResMed stands for respiratory medicine, not CPAP company, and we want to take care of the patient. We obviously start with the lowest cost, highest efficacy therapies, including CPAP, APAP and bilevel therapies. And we then work through the alternatives to help the person sleep better and breathe better. The bottom line is this, a huge number of people need our sleep apnea treatment solutions today and for the next decade, two decades, three decades and beyond. We want every patient to find a path to good breathing and good sleep. Let's pivot for a moment to talk about our digital health technology investments, leveraging the 17 billion nights of de-identified medical data and the 23.5 million 100% cloud connectable devices in our ecosystem. We are investing in several artificial intelligence-driven data products and capabilities in that ecosystem that we call Air Solutions. We are continuing to roll out, one publicly we are talking about, which is called Compliance Coach to customers in the U.S. market in a controlled market launch. Compliance Coach is a solution that helps home medical equipment providers to prioritize both digital and personal outreach to improve patient compliance and drive better patient outcomes at a lower cost. Compliance Coach models and predict the likelihood that a particular patient will or will not adhere to therapy based on algorithms built on billions of data points. The AI product then identifies for the HME provider, the key patients who may struggle to meet compliance requirements and takes a step further to drive digital and/or human actions to maximize the probability of adherence across the group. Customers using the product in its initial launch are excited and are starting to see very positive results across their business and for their patients. One final update on AI technology for this quarter. We recently launched an in-market trial of a ResMed developed generative AI product that serves as a digital concierge to help a group of people that we call sleep-concerned consumers, to best navigate as they search for their sleep-related information and they ask questions about their sleep wellness and potential treatment options. This generative AI tool helps the person identify, engage and enroll on their personal journey to better sleep and better breathing. We are currently beta test marking this product in Asia Pacific, and we will look to scale globally over time. Our goal is to develop and scale this digital sleep concierge so that all those seeking better sleep and better breathing can find their personal pathway for the best outcome, the best treatment and the best long-term care. Our Respiratory Health business continues to be supported by sustained activity across our non-invasive ventilator platforms as well as our life support ventilator platforms. We continue to invest in clinical and economic trials for high flow therapy that we call HFT to even more cost effectively treat COPD in the home. As we develop these next-generation therapies, we will generate strong clinical evidence and economic outcomes that will support broader adoption of these innovations for treating respiratory conditions at home. The prevalence of respiratory insufficiency due to COPD as well as neuromuscular disease continues to increase, and we offer low-cost, high-quality treatments to help address this healthcare epidemic. Turning to our Residential Care Software-as-a-Service business. We had another great quarter with year-over-year growth of 24%. Organic growth of our SaaS business was solid across our Brightree and our MatrixCare brands with another full quarter contribution from our MEDIFOX DAN brand in Germany. Ongoing customer-facing synergies between our Brightree offering in the U.S. and our home medical equipment resupply revenue remains very strong, driving good growth across both our SaaS business and our core sleep health business. We expect to have sustainable organic growth across our portfolio of SaaS solutions in home medical equipment, home health, home nursing and beyond to be in the high-single digits as we continue through this fiscal year and to achieve stable double-digit organic growth through fiscal year 2025 and beyond. We continue to drive operating expense leverage through management of our capabilities for cloud compute, our capabilities for cybersecurity, interoperability and technology development and we plan to accelerate net operating profit growth across our SaaS portfolio and across the entire ResMed business. Our residential care SaaS business remains an integral part of ResMed's growth strategy. This business complements the market-leading software and the market-leading device solutions that we have in our sleep health and breathing health business, and we are well positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for residential care. We are transforming respiratory medicine and residential care at scale. We are leading the industry in developing, applying and adopting digital health technology across our markets. We continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our operations. We are focused on driving topline revenue growth, focused cost discipline and increased efficiencies to accelerate profitability. We have created differentiated products and solutions for customers worldwide, driving long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. We lead the industry in digital health technology with the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, most connected and most intelligent solutions, and we don't plan to stop innovating anytime soon. We invest around 7% of our revenues straight back into market-leading research and development. ResMed's mission remains crystal clear to improve 250 million lives through better residential healthcare in 2025. This patient-centric mission motivates me and ResMedians every day. During the last 12 months, we have improved over 170 million lives by delivering a medical device directly to a patient or a complete mask system to a patient or a digital health software solution that provides personal care for a patient. We've helped each person to sleep better, to breathe better or to live higher-quality lives with best-in-class healthcare delivered right where they live. I'm very excited about the opportunities in front of us and the pipeline we have ahead. In closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the more than 10,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, their hard work and dedication today and every day. Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks, and then we'll open up to Q&A for Brett and me and the team. Over to you, Brett. Yes, Margaret. Look, it's a great question. And as a biomedical engineer, I look at this, and I don't know causality, I just know the correlation. And so we've now got data, the 529,000 data points that show that there's a 10% higher propensity to start PAP therapy if you prescribe the GLP-1 before and then you get the PAP therapy, 10 absolute percentage points higher of the cohort will start PAP therapy. My thought is that this is a more motivated patient, a more engaged patient in the health care system, and they've been brought in by this new therapeutic tool. And so I do think that it will lead to greater growth. This megatrend of GLP-1s will lead to greater growth of patients coming into our treatment pool over time. And certainly, the data is showing that with that cohort of patients. Yes, your quick math there of an increase, I think, is that if there's full penetration across the whole patient cohort and full adoption GLP-1s across every patient coming through. Of course, that's the maximum state. But I think realistically, as we see this pretty fast rollout of this new pharmaceutical class, we will start to see more patients come into the health care system. Everyone is seeing that across medtech and across health care. They are more engaged and they do seem to be getting prescriptions for many different chronic diseases. Sleep apnea is non-exception. And we've got probably one of the highest number of patients in that cohort of over 0.5 million patients that we're tracking. And of course, we've got 26 million patients in our database. So this is a minority of patients that we're seeing on these, but it is interesting within that cohort to see a higher participation rate. Look, our goal will be to leverage that megatrend and to make sure that ResMed is there with the best tools for screening, diagnosis, treatment and management. And we've done that over decades, and we plan to do it ahead. I think maybe the consumer big tech trend of sleep wellness tracking might be slightly higher in its impact over time, maybe not as quick adoption, but these sleep wellness tools come across all consumer tech applications is incredibly exciting. ResMed's goal is there to leverage this demand gen that's coming to us from Big Pharma and big consumer tech, but then more importantly, to get that personalized health journey so that ResMed can be truly the concierge for that person if they find their path to better sleep and better health. So we do expect these trends to be positive. They won't be immediate. And our job is to drive it over time. Yes. Thanks for the question, Anthony. And it's a really pertinent one. Certainly, we're watching this SURMOUNT-OSA trial. It's a pretty small trial. It's less than 500 patients, 500, 600 patients, I believe. So it's not sort of the order of the real world event, real-world data that we have, like 500,000 patients we're talking about there. But I think it will be very interesting to see the presumption is given it's the same biochemical compound as in other trials used for diabetes treatment and weight loss that it will have somewhere in the order of 10%, 20%, maybe even 30% weight loss reduction in this cohort. So that's a metric that's sort of well-known from prior studies. The best evidence from the primary investigator on this Professor Atul Malhotra from University of California, San Diego. His assessment is that, that should lead to pretty significant AHI reductions in the treatment cohort versus placebo, maybe in the order of to maybe 65% AHI reductions in the cohort of these quite high BMI and quite high AHI patients. If you listen to a great podcast between Professor Malhotra and Dr. Carlos Nunez, our Chief Medical Officer, which are available on our website. When you've got to spare 45 minutes, but there are some cliff notes that I think are worth sharing here in this investor call is that Professor Malhotra was asked what's the best therapy to treat sleep apnea. Is it, a, weight loss? Or is it b, CPAP. And he said, \"Well, that's a false dichotomy, this question, it's a false competition. It's a plus b. It has been for decades and will be for decades in the future. And as a PI on that study, he says, look, we have a new pharmaceutical agent that's going to help with treatment a. And of course, that will be used in combination with treatment B. So the PI on the study is saying that he thinks the combination treatment of a weight loss medication similar to prior work and bariatric surgery that had much higher weight loss numbers or diet and exercise that had all the variance that we've seen over decades of different methodologies there. But this one does seem to be a good agent for treatment a. And then will need to be combined with treatment b to fully treat the sleep suffocation that the patients will have. So don't trust me, the CEO of the company that makes the therapeutic, trust the primary investigator that's saying, combination treatment has worked for decades and will work for decades. I would expect that to be the outcome the trial. And in terms of working with Big Pharma on this, I think they're very focused on other areas like obesity and diabetes, but as much as we can get their attention to talk about sleep and sleep health and to do their D2P advertising to talk about the importance of sleep and sleep health. I think combined with the Apples and the Samsungs and the Googles of the world talking about it, it will be a huge positive for of us in the sleep apnea treatment industry. Thanks for the question, Anthony. Yes. Thanks for the question, Mike. And yes, certainly in tens of countries in Europe and Asia. We are in full competition with all the global players, including the company you mentioned and the large regionals from Europe and from Asia and have been for many quarters. So they've come back in masks and devices across tens of countries in Europe and Asia. And their goal there when they come back, if they've been out for a year or two, depending on the time they're out of each market is to fight their way from the bottom. They've got zero percent new patient start share when they first come back in and they're trying to fight their way up. And in general, they had to fight against the number two, the number three and the number four player who don't have like ResMed has the leading technology, the best AirSense platform, right. The AirSense 11 globally is the best platform in all 140 countries. The second best platform in, I would say, all 140 countries is the AirSense 10 platform. So their goal is to then fight against regional player from Europe with the number three or a regional player from Asia, with the number four in the country that they're coming back. And so we're seeing that country by country. We're seeing them fight for that share at the low end. It's our focus as the market leader is on growing the market. And I think they're a fair competitor. We've competed against them for decades since they bought Respironics. And in general, we've won and taken share. We were winning and taking share from them in 2019. We're winning and taking share from the 2023 and 2024 as they come back country by country. And if and when they come back to the U.S. marketing devices, by the way, they're already here on masks, never left, and we've been competing and leading them there. I look forward to them coming back to the U.S. market so we can get any stock overhang away about what's it going to look like and what it's going to look like is what it looks like in all the other tens of countries where they fight for share from the bottom and work their way up. And I look forward to competition, a healthy competition. And we seem to do very well in it because we've got the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, most connected and most intelligent solutions, and it's really about that. It's about the value you provide getting that patient to the right care, lowering the cost and improving adherence. And we've done a great job, and I like all global competition in the space. Got you loud and clear, Suraj. Well, thanks, Suraj. I could spend the rest of the time answering that call around the 2030 operating model. I'll just briefly talk about it and then talk specifically about Compliance Coach. Our 2030 operating model, yes, it's the three tenets, right? The three tenets product-led, customer-centric brand enhanced. ResMed has always been product led, but now we have a Global Chief Product Officer, whose sole role is to curate that product portfolio with an amazing team of hundreds of engineers and marketers to bring the great innovation to market. So we'll measure the success on that on product velocity, how quickly do we bring innovation to market, time to market, time to success. Customer-centric. We've always been customer-centric. But we have always done the best of analyzing the Net Promoter Scores of patients, Net Promoter Scores of physicians, home care providers. Physician payer providers and so on. So really understanding the marketing metrics around that, having our first Chief Marketing Officer sit at the top table and really be laser-focused on those NPS scores and driving them up and really valuing the multibillion-dollar ResMed brand and enhancing that over time. And the third part around focusing on profitable growth and driving that leverage with our first Chief Revenue Officer, it's really around that profitable growth. And if the title was used broadly, I would call it the Chief Profitable Growth Officer rather than Chief Revenue Officer, but really, it's around keeping that discipline on the great growth we've had on the topline, but ensuring we get that leverage through OpEx R&D and particularly on SG&A in the new world to do things differently with tech.  And that segues into the second part of your question, Compliance Coach. Yes, look, this is a great AI tool. By the way, it's not generative AI Compliance Coach. The other one that we launched in Asia Pacific, the digital concierge is generative AI and has that extra capability. Compliance Coach is [garden-variety], what would have been called machine learning is now artificial intelligence, it's a great algorithm, and it's out there. The measure of that one, success on that one, Suraj, is does it lower the cost to serve at that HME or with the same labor force of respiratory therapists and pulmonary doctors can they serve more patients. So lower cost, higher efficiency, and really, the key metric is what's the adherence rate at day 90, day 365, year two, year three, in that patient cohort that's gone through Compliance Coach. Is it statistically and significantly higher than what that customer was getting before? If they're a best-in-class ResMed customer getting 87% adherence at day 90, does it go up to 90, does it go up to 92. And by the way, those customers are very sophisticated in understanding what that means for their business, what it means for them showing the payers that they reduce costs in hospital care and that they improve outcomes for the patient and how they feel and of course, how they improve their own revenue and hours through replenishment supplies. Anyway, that's my \u2013 the briefest answer I could do to that great question. Thanks, Suraj. Just to jump in there, Brett, a little bit specifically to Saul's question about the mask with magnets upgrade of our labeling, which was classed as a recall in the U.S. and some other jurisdictions. That cost was fully taken account of in this quarter. We're not expecting to add anything more on the mask with magnets action relabel and recall in certain jurisdictions. Mathieu, a very simple question, but rather complex answer in that we sell in 140 countries worldwide, and each of them most of them have their own regulatory pathway and often very different and complex and obviously, labeling language customization of the product for all regulatory requirements needed in all those 140 countries. So we clearly launched in our top countries were launched in the U.S. many countries in Europe. We just got Japan last quarter, the quarter before and we're starting to ramp up there. And you saw that in the good growth numbers in devices in Europe, Asia and other in the quarter of 16%, there was some good sort of starting that ramp there in a place like Japan, which, as you know, is a fleet driven market versus a by-quarter driven market. And so great to see Japan \u2013 the citizens of Japan to be able to get access to the best in the world technology in the AirSense 11. But look, we've got hundreds of countries \u2013 over 100 countries, we still have to go there. And so we've got to get regulatory country by country. And we care about people suffocating in all of those 140 countries in the same way. And so our regulatory and quality team with Dawn Haake, our Chief Quality and Regulatory Officer working intensely with all the regulatory authorities in those countries and we have to ramp that up. And then in addition, we're ramping up supply. The good news is that we have the second best platform in the world in the AirSense 10, and that is completely unconstrained. So you do suffocate and get a prescription in the country that AirSense 11 is not cleared yet, you can get access to incredibly small, quiet and efficacious therapy in the AirSense 10 platform and our best in the world mask platform. And so there's no simple answer to when it will be completely done in 100% in all countries because I think as indifferent to maybe the AirSense 7 to AirSense 8, AirSense 8 to AirSense 9 and AirSense 9 to AirSense 10 generations is that we have a pretty unique situation with our global citizenship here. We are the global leader, and we've got a different responsibility to maintain our second best platform, which is the second best in the world for a little longer. And so that will be out. And I'm not going to give a defined end date now, but I will tell you this. We're going country by country, we're driving regulatory and we're scaling manufacturing as fast as we can on AirSense 11 because it is better technology, is low cost to make, and we are able to have a premium for it in pricing. So it makes sense for us, the customers and for our shareholders. Yes. Thanks for the question, Matt. And so for those of you who haven't read through the nih.gov, feel free to go. But my reading, I'm a visual learner. There's a split chart that the top half of it on the trial is a GLP-1 side and the bottom half is a placebo side. And so they have this 600-odd or less than 600 patients split between those two in a certain proportion. And then within the GLP-1 arm, they split to those on CPAP and those not on CPAP and the same within the placebo. So there ends up being four arms if you look at it. But if you go to the end of it, there's an arm that's placebo, no CPAP. So I'd just call that the placebo arm. And then there's placebo plus CPAP arm and then there's GLP alone arm and GLP plus PAP arm. So you start to get down to the subanalyses, it gets less powered. I actually \u2013 I'm reading what you are on nih.gov. So my presumption is at the highest level, they want to show that a GLP-1 is better than placebo for lowering weight and improving AHI. I think they'll achieve that primary outcome. I mean all the data show that there's 10%, 20%, 30% weight loss reduction and that should correlate to significant AI reduction. So I think they'll show that. As opposed to then the sub-studies of CPAP versus no CPAP within each of those, look, we've got 35 years of history knowing that CPAP doesn't half treat, right? I mean, the best that I've seen from weight loss reductions in bariatric surgeries and the best the GLP-1 prelim data is that it can half treat, right? Maybe 50% reduction in AHI. I'd call that half treatment. I don't think any pulmonary physician in the world would be happy with half treating an AHI with positive airway pressure. Frankly, if you're not turning the AHI to less than five, you're not truly treating the patient. And if it's higher than five, it might be residual centrals and you have to move them to a bilevel or it might be complex sleep apnea have to move them to adaptive servo-ventilation. So there's so many options between CPAP, APAP bilevel ASV that the physicians should walk through, but they wouldn't be happy unless the AHI is less than 5%. I think the probability \u2013 and don't trust me and my quote on this, Matt. Again, the primary investigator on the study, Professor Malhotra said, the idea that weight loss alone can treat sleep apnea is preposterous. That was the word he used. So you can use \u2013 and he's the PI on this study. You can use his thoughts to what he thinks between the PAP arm and the non-PAP arm. So he's sort of leaning towards what he said earlier, that best treatment for sleep apnea is not a) weight loss or b) CPAP, it's a plus b. And so that's what I expect this study to show. And we'll see the data. They will be out there in three weeks and whatever they want to release in headline and we'll continue to go. We'll continue to grow. We'll continue to drive patients into the funnel, and I think this therapeutic class will help us over the coming decade to bring more patients into the funnel. Thanks for the question, Lyanne. And yes, really, really happy to take questions and talk about our devices business and our mask business. So look, devices growth globally, incredibly strong in the quarter at 11%. Masks growth globally incredibly strong at 9%. We talk about the market being mid-single-digit growth for devices, so we're clearly well ahead of that with the launch of AirSense 11 in Japan and Europe, Asia Rest of World and doing well in the U.S. a couple of hundred basis points above. And then in masks and accessory, you talked about global growth being in high single digits. And so beating that in U.S., Canada, Latin America, but what you're probably focusing on is the Europe, Asia and Rest of World growth there in Q2 FY2024 being 4%, right? And just to be clear, the Q2 FY2023 growth in that same category was 14%. And we were taking 500 basis points a share 12 months ago and then losing it this quarter. I really think if you look at the weighted average over that, which is, what, 18 divided by 2 is 9% is sort of more in line with the market growth in that mid- to high single-digit growth of masks there. And look, there's some things around some contracts with the particular countries that were moved from December to January and others. I'm not going to go to all the details other than to say, we look really closely at share. We look really closely at what we're doing. And this 90-day snapshot four quarters ago, which showed 14%. We weren't taking 500 basis points a share. We were holding share, growing in a little \u2013 a category here or there. And now this quarter at 4%, we're not losing 500 bps a share. We're actually holding share across that and it's due to some of those shipping areas \u2013 launch areas and frankly, a couple of tenders that will move from one month to another. So really not much to see in that. But what I will say is that as we move forward, maintaining that high single-digit growth in devices globally, and the high \u2013 sorry, mid-single-digit growth in devices globally and high single-digit growth in masks globally is not a given. We've got to drive that demand. We've got to leverage this Big Pharma trend. We've got to leverage the big tech trend \u2013 and we've got to get better at doing demand generation in the areas where we know we can push it up. And so that's what we're going to be focused on going forward. I hope that answers your question, Lyanne. Yes. Great question, Michael. So yes, U.S., Canada and Latin America, a 10% growth in the mask in the quarter. It was actually a very strong market growth rate, high single digits, holding share there. We do see that December, particularly for U.S. markets where high deductibles and deductibles reset December 31, some good revenue there. And so we had good comp from the year before, and both solid numbers there from the comp year before this 10% U.S. Canada Latin America growth. So I think we did really well there as we closed out the quarter. In terms of any impact from the masks with magnets update on our labeling class in the U.S. by the U.S. FDA as a recall. I got to tell you, there was no product removed from the market. This was about having our plastic clips as an option, which we scaled up manufacturing and have them as an option. So when a patient is set up, if they're a very, very small minority of people who haven't implanted pacemaker or other metal device in their upper chest or craniofacial area, then those patients are offered an upgrade to the plastic clips. For everyone else, the other 95%, 99% of patients they keep the convenience of the magnet. So that if they go to the bathroom in the night, they can come back in the dark and just clip it on and not have to seek for plastic clips to click together the magnet completely goes on there. And so as we've done that labeling upgrade, and we had a competitor do this similar one about 12 months ago, the market has been very trained in knowing to ask questions about implants to ask questions about our partner's implants. And if they have that to offer the plastics clips, which are fully available on ResMed masks as an alternative to our mass with magnets. The masks with magnets are so convenient. They're doing so well and for 99% of people, they're great. For that 1%, the HMEs are very comfortable now to ask those questions. And the other 140 countries we are working through the appropriate ways to ask the questions and get people the best mask and have the best fit and drive the best adherence over time. But they had no impact on the quarterly sales whatsoever. And we don't expect an impact going forward because this was an upgrade to a labeling that was actually in line with clinical practice over the last 12 months. And it just makes sense to do that. Thanks a lot for the question, Michael. Thanks, Kevin, and thank you again to all of our stakeholders for joining us on this call. The opportunity in front of us is huge and largely untapped. It's an incredible runway. We see more and more people coming into the health care system, and this will benefit us as we seek to help them sleep better, breathe better and live better lives in 140 countries. Thank you to all 10,000 ResMedians. Many of you are also shareholders for what you do today and every day. With that, I'll hand the call back to Amy to close this out."

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Chief Communications and Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Kevin. Hi, everyone. Good morning and good afternoon. Welcome to ResMed's First Quarter Earnings Call for Fiscal Year 2024. We are live webcasting this call and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate Web site later today along with a copy of the earnings press release and presentation, both of which are available now. On the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. Following our prepared remarks, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer, to answer any questions you may have. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. We encourage you to review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the GAAP reported numbers. In addition, our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We make these statements based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results could differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.\nMick Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today. Our first quarter fiscal year 2024 results reflect strong growth across our entire business with double digit top line growth. This growth was driven by double digit global growth in the masks category and double digit growth in our software as a service business. We also achieved high single digit global growth in devices even as that category annualizes very high growth in the prior year period. The flexible and agile work of our supply chain, manufacturing and distribution teams has enabled us to provide ongoing global availability of our market leading 100% cloud connectable flow generator platforms. We have unconstrained supply of our AirSense platforms enabled by excellent volumes of the AirSense 10 platform globally and fast ramping approvals, launches and delivery of the best-in-class AirSense 11 platform country by country. During the quarter, we accelerated delivery of the AirSense 11 in Japan, and we launched the AirSense 11 in Australia and New Zealand. We have plenty of runway ahead on our pathway to launch in all of the 140 countries where we sell our solutions. We are very proud to be able to support all global demand for flow generators through a combination of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 platforms. We remain laser focused on accelerating the production and delivery of the AirSense 11 platform. We are moving swiftly on that front. Our Masks and Accessories business grew 21% year-over-year, amongst a highly competitive market with all global players on the field in this category. Our commercial teams are doing an amazing job of showing the clinical and economic benefits of the ResMed mask portfolio. Our clinical and commercial teams are also partnering with physicians and provider customers to drive resupply programs directly with patients. The peer reviewed and published clinical evidence showing that adoption of a resupply program leads to better patient outcomes is proving itself out in the real world customer by customer. We continue to see strong growth in the US mask business where provider resupply programs can scale, powered by our digital health ecosystem, including AirView for physicians and providers and myAir for patients. For patients around the world, especially in nonreimbursed markets, we are developing, launching and scaling outreach and subscription programs to help the consumer who is the ultimate customer to take control of their own health and engage directly in refreshing their mask, tubing, humidifier and other accessories. This has been a permanent uptick since COVID-19. People care about respiratory health and respiratory hygiene and they are taking action, and we are supporting them with digital solutions and services to meet their needs. Before I turn to review updates on our key strategic priorities, I'd like to spend a little time discussing actions we've taken to accelerate profitable growth across ResMed and to power our long term success. We've taken immediate steps to ensure we're prioritizing the right things to drive profitable growth and our leadership teams have carefully reviewed opportunities to improve our performance. We have stopped some projects that were not working out as well as we thought. We've increased investment in areas that we believe will be pivotal to long term success, such as our digital health tech investments as well as focused hardware and software development. Creating the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable, the most connected and the most intelligent healthcare solutions in the market. These changes have impacted some of our teams. And this week, we have taken actions that resulted in a reduction of our global workforce by 5%. Decisions like this that impact people are never easy. However, we know that we are doing the right thing, and we're doing the right thing to accelerate our growth and to refocus on our long term mission. I feel more strongly than ever that we are well positioned with an incredibly long runway of profitable growth and value creation for all of our stakeholders as we move forward. Let's now turn to a discussion of our three key strategic priorities: number one, to grow and differentiate our core Sleep Apnea and Respiratory Care business; number two, to design, develop and deliver market leading medical technology as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and number three, to create, innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital, a field that we call residential medicine. There are over 2 billion people worldwide suffering from sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular disease and insomnia. There are millions more that we can support as they navigate the complex outside hospital healthcare system. We believe that healthcare should be delivered in the lowest cost, lowest acuity and highest comfort location possible. Very often, that is a patient's own home. We have a massive opportunity ahead of us to help hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Our end markets remain incredibly underpenetrated with many opportunities to add value, reduce friction, lower costs and improve patient outcomes. Now that we've been able to comfortably support overall global market demand for sleep devices for the last few quarters, we're ramping up our demand generation initiatives. We're investing in marketing efforts to raise awareness and patient engagement across specific global markets. We are leveraging traditional healthcare channels as well as investing in cost effective direct-to-consumer demand gen campaigns to help what we call sleep concern consumers, find their way into the screening, diagnostic, treatment and management pathway. We will act as a digital concierge to guide patients on that journey. In terms of analyzing the results of these efforts to date and ongoing, we are tracking new patient starts in our physician and provider based ecosystem, AirView, which now has more than 22.5 million patients, as well as the new user starts in myAir where patients themselves choose to participate in their personalized healthcare journey to better breathing and better sleep. Patient flow into the funnel is at an all time high. We are well above the rates that we saw pre-COVID in 2019 across all geographies, triple digits across the board. The bottom line is that we are driving strong growth of patients into the funnel. We believe the work that's being done in the pharmaceutical industry right now with obesity drugs will be a net positive for patient flow and patient growth in sleep apnea, COPD and for ResMed overall. In terms of existing patients in our installed base, we are actively tracking a cohort of many thousands of patients on these GLP-1 medications and LPAT therapy. We are not seeing any significant change in the PAP adherence rates nor any reduced participation in resupply programs versus control groups. These data indicate that there is a cohort of patients on combined therapies in a stable state. In terms of new patients activated into the funnel, we are seeing the number of new patients activated into the healthcare funnel picking up. We see patient flow is not only strong but increasing. We believe in treating the whole person here at ResMed, including a combination of cardiovascular exercise, diet and nutrition as well as good sleep and breathing. That combination was called the Triumvirate of Health by Professor Bill Dement from Stanford, may he rest in peace. And we think a combination of these three elements will result in the best outcomes for patients. It is quite possible that this new class of drugs may become as large or even larger than the cholesterol class or the blood pressure treatment class of pharmaceuticals. If this is the case, we will see a whole new population of patients activated with their primary care providers that we may never have seen in the healthcare system. If this comes to pass, we may see benefits for the entire health system and for the people being treated themselves and for ResMed, as more and more people are evaluated and screened for sleep apnea, respiratory insufficiency and other key chronic conditions as part of their primary care evaluations. Our data are showing an all time high of patient flow and that supports this thesis. Stepping back and looking at the science in the field of respiratory medicine, we have created a forward-looking epidemiology model for our core market sleep apnea, spanning over two to three decades into the future. We have assumed an aggressive case for high market penetration of this new class of pharmaceuticals. We will publish the epidemiology model in our investor deck straight after this call. The model starts using a baseline of the global prevalence of sleep apnea, which was 936 million people in 2015. And this is based on peer reviewed and published data from the Journal Lancet in 2019. Our epidemiology model grows with conservative population and aging assumptions to a prevalence of around 1.4 billion people suffering from sleep apnea in 2050. We then overlaid an aggressive assumption for the adoption of this new pharmaceutical class globally. We assumed some of the highest penetration rates that we have seen reported by analysts in the industry. With this aggressive and sustained adoption of the new drug class, we forecast that the global prevalence of sleep apnea will still be around 1.2 billion people in 2050. Now in terms of the market penetration of our PAP therapy into this population, we have assumed market growth from our 22.5 million patients with PAP therapy here at the end of calendar year 2023 using steady state market growth rates that we saw in the years leading up to 2019, that is mid single digit growth for devices and high single digit growth for masks. With these growth rates, we reached around 109 million patients on our PAP therapy by 2050. That leaves 1.1 billion people remaining in the addressable market in 2050, over and above those already on our PAP treatment. We will continue to update our epidemiology model with all the new data as they arise. However, the bottom line is that there remains a huge number of people needing our sleep apnea treatment solutions today and for the next two to three decades and beyond. While we're proud that we have peer reviewed and published data showing that we can achieve over 87% adherence of patients to our PAP technology, combining our best-in-class med tech hardware with our digital health solutions AirView and myAir, that still means 10% of our patients on an annual basis will need alternatives. We are investing in those alternative therapies, and we are actively working with direct -- to direct patients who do not adhere to pack that 10%-plus to second line therapies, such as dental devices, where we have invested and scaled the market leading 3D printed dental device for sleep apnea in Europe called [Narval]. In addition, we have investments in other second line therapies, including pharmaceuticals and hypoglossal nerve stem technology. We want every patient who suffocates at night to find a path to good breathing and good sleep, and it looks like there's 1 billion of them we need to help. We start with the highest efficacy and lowest cost therapy, which is PAP technology, where we have very high adherence rates and the best outcomes for patients and we go from there. Given this incredible multiple decades long plus runway of growth and as part of our ongoing efforts to improve and streamline that end-to-end patient pathway and to make it easier for sleep physicians and sleep labs to diagnose and manage these patients, we're excited about our Somnoware acquisition that we closed during the last quarter. Somnoware is software for pulmonary and really all sleep physicians. And it complements our current portfolio of software offerings for physicians, homecare providers and patients, including AirView, Brightree and myAir, respectively. The goal is to ultimately drive greater efficiency and better patient care by helping physicians to take best-in-class care of their patients with increased efficiency and a better overall experience for the doctor and for the patient. We're making progress across several digital health technology initiatives to drive the value proposition of our cloud connected devices even higher. We are investing in several artificial intelligence driven data products and capabilities in our Air Solutions ecosystem. This quarter, we started rolling out a digital product in our US market called Compliance Coach. Compliance Coach is built for home care providers to help them efficiently focus efforts and prioritize outreach to increase patient compliance and ultimately to drive better patient outcomes by helping them meet and beat 90-day adherence goals. The application utilizes ResMed's many billions of nights of de-identified sleep and respiratory care data in the cloud to predict the likelihood that a patient will be adherent to therapy or not. The AI product then advises and coaches the home care provider to best identify the patients who may struggle and to meet compliance requirements where they can so they can prioritize their interventions and outreach to the best probabilities to support patient success. It's early in our rollout program of Compliance Coach. However, customers using the product are excited and engaged and are starting to see results. Watch this space for many more ways that we can work with all of our customers to unlock value from incredible depth of de-identified data using tech like AI and ML for the ultimate benefit of physicians, providers and patients. Let me discuss the forward pathway stemming from our joint venture with Verily right now that was called Primasun. Based on a mutual agreement between ResMed and Verily, we've made the decision to unwind the joint venture's day-to-day operations. We expect this to be complete by the end of the current quarter. Over the past years of this partnership, we've learned how to leverage technology to better identify, engage, diagnose and manage sleep concern consumers in our US market. We expect to take ownership of key assets of the Primasun developed model so that we can build on the investment and the learnings and ultimately accelerate our ongoing demand generation efforts with sleep apnea patients across ResMed. It is exciting to take the learning from demand gen work in one project and in one country and to now look to apply that on a global scale across the 140 countries where we provide solutions. Our growing Respiratory Care business continues to be supported by the increased adoption of both noninvasive and life support ventilator solutions. In terms of next-gen respiratory care therapies, we continue to invest in clinical and economic trials for high flow therapy, that we call HFT, with the goal of cost effectively treating COPD in the home. We continue to generate strong clinical evidence and economic outcomes that we believe will support broader adoption of these technology innovations for treating lung disease in the home. We believe this has the potential for future growth for ResMed over the medium to long term. We remain focused on addressing COPD as one of the top three chronic diseases for hospitalization and the number one cause of rehospitalization. The prevalence of respiratory insufficiency due to COPD as well as neuromuscular disease continues to increase and we are focusing and developing and plan to offer low cost, high quality solutions to address this healthcare epidemic. Our SaaS business had another great quarter with year-over-year growth of 32%. SaaS business growth was powered by another full quarter contribution from our fast growing MEDIFOX DAN business in Germany, as well as high single-digit organic growth across our Brightree and MatrixCare brands in the US market. The sustained high single digit organic growth in our SaaS business is driven by strength in the HME segment and stability as well as increased tech adoption by customers in the facilities segment. We see a pathway to stable double digit organic growth across the SaaS business, as well as increased net operating profit performance from this part of our business. The ongoing synergies between our digital health solutions in SaaS and our core business remains strong, and we continue to leverage that through combined management of cloud compute, cyber security, interoperability, tech dev as well as customer facing synergies, including patient resupply technology in our core business. During the quarter, we appointed Greg Timmons as the new General Manager of our Brightree business. I'm excited to support Greg and Bobby to continue to drive growth in our home medical equipment providers and to help our customers across the US market. This quarter, I traveled to Hildesheim, Germany to meet in person with the entire team from our MEDIFOX DAN business. The growth in tech solutions for ambulant home nursing as well as stationary nursing home businesses is very strong in Germany with an aging population in that country and a government that is driving care to be more home based through their policies and more digital through their policies. We see a long runway for growth with our MEDIFOX DAN team and across our global software as a service business. Our SaaS business remains an integral part of ResMed's growth strategy. This business complements the market leading software and device solutions we have in our respiratory medicine business. And we are well positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for residential medicine globally. And we have created differentiated value for customers and will drive long term sustainable growth for our shareholders. Before we get into a detailed update on our financials, let me say this here at ResMed. We are transforming respiratory medicine and residential medicine at scale. We are leading the market in digital health technology across our markets. As we continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our operations, we will leverage appropriate pricing and cost reductions to drive profitable growth. We're focused on driving top line revenue and tight cost discipline as well as increased efficiencies so that we can accelerate profitability, delivering value for all of our stakeholders and especially the 2 billion patients plus worldwide who need our help. As we move through fiscal year 2024, I'm confident on laser focus that we will continue to see improvements in our gross margin with GM leverage programs focused on five key areas. Number one, to drive the launch of AirSense 11 into new global markets and to increase the availability of AirSense 11 ultimately in all the country markets that we serve. Number two, to drive ongoing strong mask growth with a combination of resupply programs, subscription programs and new product launches, and you can see that's working this quarter. Number three, to increase software solutions growth, moving from high single digit organic growth to double digit organic growth with increased net operating profit leverage in that segment. Number four, to move the higher cost components and freight costs that we've seen through our legacy through our P&L, turning what was a supply chain crisis headwind into a steady tailwind as we move through fiscal year 2024. And number five, to implement cost reduction actions in noncore areas of our business to free up cash and to accelerate investments in market leading medtech and digital health solutions. So in terms of Digital Health Investments and Solutions, we now have over 16 billion nights of de-identified medical data in the cloud and over 22.5 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices sold in more than 140 countries worldwide. We continue to lead the industry in digital health technology and we don't plan to stop anytime soon. There is so much opportunity ahead of us. ResMed's mission and key goal remain crystal clear to improve 250 million lives through better residential healthcare in 2025. This patient centric mission drives and motivates ResMed-ians every day. During the last 12 months, we have improved over 165 million lives with the delivery of a medical device directly to a patient, a complete mask system to a patient or a digital health software solution, helping each person to sleep better, to breathe better and to live high quality lives with best in class healthcare delivered right where they live. I'm very excited about the opportunities in front of us. In closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the 10,000 ResMed-ians for their perseverance, their hard work, their dedication, both today and every day. Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney. And after Brett's remarks, we will open up for Q&A from the entire group. Brett, over to you.\nBrett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. We had strong financial performance in Q1. Group revenue for the September quarter was $1.1 billion, an increase of 16%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 15%. Revenue growth reflected the ongoing combined availability of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 sleep devices to support solid underlying global demand as well as strong growth across our mask product portfolio. Year-on-year movements in foreign currencies positively impacted revenue by approximately $10 million in the September quarter. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business, sales in US, Canada and Latin America countries increased by 10%. In constant currency terms, sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 18%. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other sales increased by 21%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the US, Canada and Latin America increased by 2%, which reflects the fact that we are cycling a particularly higher prior year comparable that was driven by sales of our card to cloud devices. Masks and other sales increased by 23%, reflecting growth in resupply and new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales increased by 20% in constant currency terms, again, reflecting strong demand and significantly improved availability of cloud connected devices [Technical Difficulty] these patient setups. Software as a service revenue increased by 32% in the September quarter, reflecting the contribution from our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition and continued strong performance from our HME vertical. Excluding our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, SaaS revenue grew by 7% in the September quarter. MEDIFOX DAN contributed revenue of $25.7 million for the September quarter, consistent with our expectations at the time of the acquisition. Note, we will anniversary this acquisition in Q2 FY24, so our headline SaaS growth rate will moderate in Q2. Turning to my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers where we\u2019ve provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Gross margin declined by 160 basis points to 56% in the September quarter. The decrease primarily reflects an increase in component and manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable product mix due to the increase in mask growth relative to device growth and favorable foreign currency movements. Sequential gross margin improved by 20 basis points, driven primarily by favorable product mix. Moving on to operating expenses. SG&A expenses for the first quarter increased by 15% or in constant currency terms increased by 14%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee related costs as well as the incremental SG&A expense associated with the MEDIFOX DAN that we acquired in November 2022. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue was 20.2% compared to the 20.3% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 20% for fiscal year '24. This guidance also reflects the impact of restructuring we initiated earlier this week and we estimate this will result in a reduction in our workforce of approximately 5%. We expect to complete the restructure during our second quarter of fiscal year '24. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 20% or in constant currency terms increased by 21%. The R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.9% compared to the 6.6% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for fiscal year '24. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 10%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by a lower gross margin. Our net interest expense for the quarter was $15 million and we expect interest expense to be in the range of $12 million to $14 million per quarter over the balance of fiscal year '24. Our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 20.1%, broadly consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year '24 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the September quarter increased by 9% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.64 also increased by 9%. During the quarter, we recorded a provision of $8 million associated with the expected cost of the recently announced Astral field safety notification. We also recorded acquisition related expenses of $0.5 million during the quarter. These both have been treated as non-GAAP items in our Q1 financial results. We recorded losses of $4.5 million in our September quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. As Mick discussed, the joint venture will be winding down operations and we will incur no further losses going forward in relation to Primasun. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $286 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings and stable working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $30 million and depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $45 million. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $209 million, and at September 30, we had $1.4 billion in gross debt and $1.2 billion in net debt. During the quarter, we reduced our debt by $80 million. At September 30, we had approximately $825 million available for drawdown under our revolver facility, and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. During the quarter, we also closed our previously announced Somnoware acquisition, a company that provides an upstream diagnostic management platform that is complementary to our current AirView and Brightree solutions. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share. As part of our capital management activities, we plan to resume our previously authorized share buyback program starting in our second quarter. We expect to purchase shares to the value of approximately $50 million per quarter. This will more than offset any dilution from the issue of employee equity during the year. Finally, concurrent with our capital management activities, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D and expect to deploy further capital for tuck-in acquisitions. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Brett, and thank you, Mick. Kevin, let's go ahead and turn the call back over to you to remind participants about instructions for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from David Bailey from Macquarie.\nDavid Bailey: Mick, I'd just like to press a bit more on some of the comments around the market to 2050. Just interested in your thoughts around GLP-1s as potentially being complementary to CPAP as opposed to being a substitution for. And maybe just giving some thoughts around the upcoming clinical trials and how that could influence that will take going forward?\nMick Farrell: And I'm just happy that we've had 90 days and we put some sites behind the analysis of this as the world leader in the field of respiratory medicine and sleep apnea, we really know these prevalence numbers really well. And so that baseline of 936 million patients from 2015, growing to 1.4 billion through 2050 is really, I think, pretty conservative in its assumption of the growth rate of populations and aging populations in lower growth areas. But what that shows is 1.4 billion available in that time, not including any impact from any of these GLP-1 class of drug. And we took really the maximum aggressive efforts, including all current indications and some future ones to assess what the impact could be on the potential of patients in terms of sleep apnea prevalence worldwide, really aggressive and assume not only aggressive penetration but sustained that the adherence rate would stay sort of 80% to 100% on these drugs, which they're not achieving out there in the market, but we just said, let's take that high penetration case and that showed 1.2 billion patients in 2050. And so we will look at every update that comes from the pharma industry. They're very active in this class of GLP-1 but we think we're taking a very high penetration analysis to get there. And so we'll continue to look at any new data that come on and every quarter, we'll update that epidemiology model and move it around. But what it shows is a huge opportunity, 1.1 billion patients above our penetration at quite high growth rates through the next number of decades. To your question around concomitant therapy and use what we've been seeing in the last two years since a number of these have been out there in the diabetes side and on the obese indications, it's obviously early days, but we're tracking many thousands of patients on GLP-1s and PAP and we're seeing maintenance of adherence, we're seeing maintenance of resupply programs and really no change. When you look at -- so that\u2019s at the aggregate level, we are seeing no change there. We are seeing more patients coming into the funnel. Look, we know we're doing our awareness programs, our demand gen programs and there are other alternative therapies doing demand gen that bring patients into the funnel that we get a benefit from. But we truly believe that this idea that you could come in to the healthcare system, someone who's maybe obese, moderately obese and likely avoiding the healthcare system, there's a high avoidance of people with BMI of 30, 32, 35 of the primary care system. And so we believe it will bring more patients in. We're seeing that with our very high patient flow. So look, we're just looking at the data we're observing, which is patients on concomitant therapies there multiple years, and we're going to track those and track the adherence and we'll publish that every quarter. We're seeing actually our adherence rates steady and resupply rates steady in that installed base. And in the new patient flow side, we're actually seeing increased all-time highs of patients coming into the funnel. So we're watching all of these above and we're looking for two to three decades and still see with highest case penetration, you can roll in any study like you're still going to see north of hundreds of millions to 1 billion patients between the likely penetration in our disease state and beyond. But David, thanks for the question, and I look forward to ongoing discussions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from David Low from JPMorgan.\nDavid Low: If I could stick on the same topic. Mick, could I get you to talk a little bit to the 22.5 million patients that you've got on myAir? It would be really good to understand how they sort of fit into the categories of mild, moderate and severe sleep apnea. Because as much as you've given us some very big numbers, we're fully aware that about half of those patients are in the mild category. And it's unclear to me that many of those patients are currently seeking treatment or will seek treatment in future. So if you could just help us with what you can see in the data and so we can make an assessment as well, please.\nMick Farrell: Yes, David, look, thanks for the question. And as you look at the epidemiology data, there's a number of splits on AHI. What we're lacking in the market is a split around symptomatology and how patients feel. And as we're looking at the data, patients with AHIs, 5 to 15, 15 to 30 and 30 plus and overlapping that with concomitant therapy, we'll be peer reviewing and publishing data at upcoming conferences in 2024 on this to show some of these nuances of deltas. But on the aggregate group, we're not seeing changes in adherence. And even in the subsets of mild to moderate, we're not seeing significant changes in adherence rates or new patients coming into the funnel. AHI is a great measure of the number of suffocation episodes per hour. Just to remind people, an AHI 14, just under 15, which is considered mild is suffocating every four minutes of sleep. So a doctor may call that mild, but to a patient who's suffocating every four minutes of sleep, in 15 -- 14 times an hour, and you're sleeping all through the not having 80, 90 suffocation episodes, they stick on the therapy and new patients coming in as well. So look, we're watching this really carefully, and we're really analyzing by AHI, by symptomatology, by craniofacial distance between the tongue and the uvula and actually size of time because there's a whole lot of factors that go into go into the prevalence of sleep apnea and obviously, the issues around hypopneas, which are far more prevalent in women and lead to worse excessive daytime sleepiness, headache and comorbidities that are not associated with weight at all. But look, we're looking through all of these data. And as we look forward over the next number of decades, there will be an impact. There's no question by these weight loss medications. But it will be on the margin and it won't be -- I mean, certainly, the market believes it's going to be dramatic given the last 90 days of our stock. And I can tell you, every bit of clinical data that we have going forward and every bit we have going retrospectively, we've got the biggest database in the world and it's 21.5 million patients. As we look at that split between mild, moderate and severe, we're not seeing changes. But look, every quarter, we'll continue to update that, and we'll do more and more splits on severity. We published this epidemiology model this quarter and we'll continue to update it and continue to provide data. I'm also making sure that we keep some of those data so we can get them into the peer reviewed and published press like the Lancet article that started the epidemiology model, and so we'll be publishing the information that we can. And then every quarter here on the -- on our investor site, but they will also be running the real sites in epidemiology models and health econ and outcomes research work and making sure that gets into the peer reviewed and published press as well.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST.\nDan Hurren: I was going to ask some questions about the results rather than GLP-1 drugs, if that's okay?\nMick Farrell: Dan, that would be delightful.\nDan Hurren: Look, just a question for Brett. Could you walk us -- can you just walk us through the headwinds and tailwinds for gross margin over the balance of FY24. And maybe we're seeing some pricing increases out there in the market and product mix shifting around. Could you just perhaps walk through those factors?\nBrett Sandercock: As we look forward on GM, I mean, Mick mentioned it in his remarks as well. But if you look at it in terms of GM, we do feel that we're going to see improvements in our gross margin over FY24. And those tailwinds are really going to be around improved product mix, manufacturing improvements and efficiencies that we think we can drive. Freight cost reductions are still making their way through inventory and some of that will manifest in FY24. We're seeing stabilized component costs now, that was a headwind even for this quarter but we're cycling, largely cycling that, particularly in the second half FY '24. And then we have, obviously, the AS10 to AS11 transition that will be progressive over FY24 as well and then your point mentioning a little bit around pricing as well. So a combination of those factors will give us confidence, I think, in the gross margin through FY24.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs.\nChris Cooper: Sorry come back to it, guys, but I think it is an important topic. So just on the patient data mix that you're tracking CPAP patients also in GLP-1s. Can you just update us on how many patients you're tracking there, and when you intend on publishing that? I know Rob foreshadowed last month that you would be sort of releasing that data? Would it make sense to do that before, or do you think maybe after the major study that's going to read out next year? And just any high level thoughts you have on the outcome of that study would be helpful at this stage.\nMick Farrell: And so yes, there will be ongoing longitudinal studies that will get out to the peer-reviewed press, but obviously, look, it's an urgent issue. And if you look at the market reaction the last 90 days, there's an assumption of 30%, 40% reduction in immediate TAM, right? If you look at that market cap change and it's just in congress with every piece of scientific evidence that we've looked at historically and going forward. So there's many thousands of patients on our GLP-1 plus PAP database. We also have 17,000 patients that we're tracking that have had gone through bariatric surgery and are on PAP therapy post surgery with 50%-plus weight loss reductions in that cohort. So we're tracking much stronger weight loss cohort and this sort of -- depending on which type of GLP-1, 10, 20, 30, plus percent weight loss reductions in the extreme case of the 50% weight loss reductions. And so we'll be are publishing data in the peer reviewed and clinical press across all of those cohorts as we go forward. Yes, we will choose -- as we keep putting out the epidemiology data, we will choose to put some of those data, which aren't going into the peer-reviewed press, right? So we don't those studies that we actually want to get into the clinical information that can really be out there versus just the stuff that we put together for an investor, which then would prohibit those same data going into a clinical paper. But we are finding the balance between those and we definitely hear that the market is looking for those data. I can tell you now that the data on aggregate are showing no change despite how you look which GLP-1 class, which AHI group for adherence and resupply. But I will start to find the right division between the information we can get out on the short to medium term basis and the information that needs to go in those longitudinal studies to really show the sites behind this and really balance it out. One of the best ways we're doing it every quarter is to show the incredible growth that we're getting in our devices and our masks and particularly the resupply of masks, right? There's no impact of anyone's recall, there's no impact of any drug therapy and you just look at the replenishment rate of masks, if you're not on therapy, you're not ordering masks. And we're seeing really strong resupply. The other fact to bring into this that we can publish and do publish is the number of patients in our Air Solutions ecosystem, 22.5 million patients that continues to go up. We had record numbers of new patients starting up. And in addition to that record numbers of patients themselves engaging with myAir and that's driven by AirSense 11 being far more digitally engaged and higher rates of adoption of that. But we're seeing a really strong uptake of patients and flow in and patients on adherence, but we'll continue to publish every quarter those data and the appropriate data we can from the clinical, and we'll definitely update the epidemiology model every quarter.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Craig Wong-Pan from RBC.\nCraig Wong-Pan: Just on your Americas mask growth, could you provide some more details on where that additional growth in resupply has been coming from, and how long do you think you can sustain that strong year-on-year growth in mask revenues?\nMick Farrell: It's a really good question because the mask growth across the group was 21% on constant currency. Europe was incredibly strong at 15% constant currency growth in a full competition market with everybody on the field and 23% in US, Canada, Latin America. Look, as I said in my description in the prepared remarks on our look forward over the next n number of decades, the stable market growth in our field was mid single digits on the device side and high single digits on the mask side. If you look at the five year CAGR, three year CAGR leading into 2019 pre COVID. And that's sort of what we're looking at that epidemiology model that mid single digit growth on devices and high single digit growth on masks. So if you think of that as the market growth in a stable state, it then comes up to, well, what can ResMed do in market demand? What can we do in demand gen? What can we do to get patients into the funnel? I truly believe to the three questions focused on this new class of drugs. I do believe we are seeing more patients come into the funnel, more patients into primary care. That's great. I mean I think there's $1 trillion worth of market cap now from these companies and they will turn that into marketing to bring people in for the miracle drug, and that will absolutely bring patients in for assessment for all the comorbidities that are associated with a patient that might have been severely overweight and now likely on the other side of these will still be overweight, including sleep apnea, COPD and other cardiovascular diseases and beyond. So we're watching that really closely. Look, we've consistently over decades that we've been in business, not just accepted mask growth rates from the market, we said, let's drive it higher and higher. The 23% is extraordinary and very strong in a highly competitive market. But I look at what we're doing with resupply, I look at what we're doing with new product launches, I look at what we're doing to drive patients into the funnel. And I think we can meet and beat that high single digits that the market would grow at. And with us being such a strong share, we get to -- when we do demand gen, we get to get a very good share of those patients through the funnel. So there's more of an incentive for ResMed to drive demand gen initiatives when we get such a good share of it on the device and mask side, and we're seeing that in many of the markets we operate in worldwide. But it's a great question.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley.\nSean Laaman: Mick, really good OpEx control in the quarter. And I think Brett mentioned, if I pick it up correctly, 18% to 20% as a guide on revenue going forward. I'm just wondering if there is more restructuring to done or to be done or you think you're rightsized at the moment?\nMick Farrell: And as I said in the prepared remarks, stuff that impacts our people are the toughest decisions to make, and we did this week, have a change in 5% of our global workforce reduction of 5% of our global workforce and tough decisions to make. I really think that, that is -- if you think about it, that is the restructuring. There are some changes I'm looking at it in the operating model, sort and roles and responsibilities and a focus on a more product-led and brand-led company that will come over time, but they're not massive restructures. And I think what that 18% to 20% revenues that Brett talked about in SG&A is indicative of the change that we've made here and reestablished a new base and a push for, as you said, really strong profitable growth across our business. But look, the world has changed. We are already a product led organization but our brand has increased in its value across the world, and we need to document and understand that and understand how to engage people in nonreimbursed markets as consumers into the funnel. And we've already invested in a number of our D2C markets in that, and we're driving that. And in our B2B and B2B2C markets, we're also working with our healthcare partners and distributors in the channel to work out how to best get patients into the funnel. So we're sort of, if you like, we're freeing up cash to reinvest in demand gen, reinvest in getting patients into the funnel. And we think there's a billion reasons in terms of the patients that need our help to get out there and do it. And that's going to be there for decades and we've got to find better ways to do it. But to answer your question directly, yes, that restructure is done and we're now focused on moving forward.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Margarette Kaczor from William Blair.\nMargarette Kaczor: I wanted to focus on the quarter as well. You guys talked about this all time high patient flow number, which is notable. When you said the channel, I guess, were you referencing those are CPAP prescriptions or folks getting tests? And any color you can give us on how that growth profile compared to recent quarters, and anything kind of on the US device growth this quarter as well?\nMick Farrell: So look, we have a relatively low share of the diagnostic space in home sleep apnea testing with our ApneaLink Air product. So we are tracking that,those are up. The best data we have is through Air Solutions System. So we talk about the 22.5 million patients on our Air Solutions platform and almost 7 million patients that we now have on myAir patients directly engaged in. So we watch those starts very closely. We also do have de-identified and objective data from Brightree showing across the whole industry, patients coming into the funnel in sleep apnea but also across other home medical equipment categories. And I can tell you the patients are getting engaged and finding their way into the to the primary care treatment funnel and specifically in sleep apnea. And we believe it's not short term that this is a sustainable rate of growth for patients coming in, and I think it's really exciting to see that. To your question specifically about device growth, yes, so it's 8% globally. I mean I got to say I'm incredibly proud of our Europe, Asia and rest of world markets growing 20% this quarter year-on-year, that's where we're competing directly with our competitor that was out for their recall. They're back in many countries, in Europe, Asia and rest of world, and meeting and beating them head-to-head, I think, proves out the thesis that ResMed has the best-in-class products, but services and solutions, not just the hardware but the software and the capability we've been investing in that for a long period of time. This period a year ago, the September quarter 2022, we had just unleashed card to cloud on an unallocated basis, and it took off despite usually what is quite a low growth quarter in September, given that summer here in the US. We had incredible growth last summer with our card to cloud solutions, so we're lapping that growth. I think the team with that device growth of 2% is building on what was an extraordinary uptick from card to cloud. But when we look at the number of patients coming through, the diagnostic funnel and the setups coming into AirView and the setups of the patients coming into myAir, the growth rate of patients is mid single digits plus and with recap really up there. And so I think that's why I can say that I think it's sustainable for us to meet and beat sort of the pre-COVID 2019 earlier CAGR of mid single digit growth for devices, we can meet and beat that throughout demand gen and high single digit growth in masks. We can definitely meet and beat that through our work and experience and expertise now on resupply, engagement with patients and the changes that happen during COVID are focused on respiratory health and respiratory hygiene. So I hope that answers your question, Margaret. Thanks to that.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden.\nSteve Wheen: Just a question back on to the gross margin. When we think about fourth quarter's growth margin, it went down largely because of FX and mix and yet we've got that going in your favor in this quarter. I'm just curious as to really what is holding that gross margin back when you do have such a strong mix geographically with devices in rest of world up but also masks as a category overall up and you've got the FX tailwind as well? And just to clarify, the Astral field safety notice cost is not in the 56% gross margin from what I can work out, if that's correct as well?\nBrett Sandercock: Yes, that's correct, that's excluded as a non-GAAP item from 56%. But if you're talking year-on-year on the gross margin, really the biggest impact coming through was component cost increases that we're still cycling through and working through inventory. So that was the biggest factor. We did see some product mix favorability there, but not enough to offset those component cost increases, for example. That was the biggest impact on the year-on-year reduction in GM.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey Capital.\nSaul Hadassin: Mick, you've kind of commented on sustainability of US flow gen growth. I just wanted to ask you, so the growth rate based on revenues this quarter implies about a 17% CAGR going back to 1Q fiscal '20, so the September '19 quarter. So I'm just wondering if you think you can sustain sort of the dollars of flow gen sales that you reported this quarter, or if you think sales are going to step down as we work through the rest of fiscal '24? Just wondering if you can sustain the level of sales in dollar terms?\nMick Farrell: It's a good question, but it's a complicated answer, because there's so many moving pieces between that baseline you took there for that CAGR number '19 and '20 with the COVID shutdowns, our spin-up on ventilators with 150,000 vents at the start 2020 and then the slowdown and the restart-up of the sleep apnea funnel and the shift that happened through 2020, 2021. And then, of course, the perturbation that made it a perfect storm of a competitor with a recall of 5.5 million devices and '21 through '23 and ongoing. So with all that, I'll just talk to the market growth rate that we saw stable pre-2019, right, of that mid single digit growth of devices and high single digit growth in masks. We think that where we're at now taking our baseline of now we can meet and beat that growth rate, right? And so that definitely doesn't mean going backwards. You can take what we've got now, which is, I believe, a very strong share of the US market and in the 140 countries we're in competition, but it's a good place for us to be. We are looking at from where we are achieving mid single digit plus growth in our devices and high single-digit growth on our masks. And no, we don't intend to go backwards at all. In fact, we intend to not only go forward but go forward strongly. And I think what was shown up in the numbers this quarter is our incredibly strong growth. I talked earlier that our incredibly strong growth in devices of 20% in Europe, Asia and rest of world. We had 15% growth in masks in Europe, Asia and around the other countries. And so I think what it's shown is that ResMed is going to go head-to-head with full competition out there and be able to meet and beat the competition, because we've got the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, most connected and the most intelligent health systems, and it's that whole combination of not just the product, but the solution, the service and how it's embedded in the healthcare system to the patient to the physician that allows us to achieve that. So we're not going backwards, we're going forward, Saul, and we're going to grow at or ahead of market. And in many countries, we're going to drive demand gen to increase the whole aggregate market growth rate and pull more patients into the funnel, because now we've got a greater incentive than ever to do that. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Matthew Chevrier from Citi.\nMatthew Chevrier: One on SaaS, please. So what will drive the SaaS revenue to now grow double digits from high single digit previously?\nMick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Matthew, and welcome to covering ResMed. Yes. So look, what's going to happen is with our organic SaaS business, as you saw in the quarter, we had good high single-digit growth at 7%. And we've sort of been in that sort of 7% to 8% in our organic growth across our US franchise really MatrixCare plus Brightree. And with the MEDIFOX DAN group, we haven't sort of been breaking out organic growth within that. But it is going to be incremental to that group. But in addition to that, there's a great product pipeline at both Brightree and MatrixCare that I feel confident and some portfolio focuses on the high growth parts of their portfolio and moving out or backing up with some of the low growth areas in that portfolio of MatrixCare that gives me great confidence as I look forward over the fiscal year and beyond that we're going to turn organic growth from sort of where it is now in the high single digits to double double digit growth on a stable organic basis across that SaaS business. So Matthew, it's a combination of MEDIFOX DAN increase in the group but also some great product pipelines in the current business to be able to get us there. And the final punchline I'll put there is, in addition to that, driving that better top line growth, we're working -- we restructured as well on SG&A and some R&D in our SaaS business this week, this quarter. And that will allow us to get good leverage on the net operating profit bottom line. And I see that moving closer and closer to the ResMed group and even being a strong contributor, an even stronger contributor for us as we look to maximize our long term EPS and return on invested capital across our group. So great question, Matthew, but we're very confident we can achieve that as we go through fiscal year '24, '25 and beyond in our SaaS business.\nOperator: We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further or closing comments.\nMick Farrell: Well, thanks, everybody, for attending this call and for the great detailed questions. And thanks, Kevin. Yes. Look, I'll close with this. ResMed is well positioned for ongoing future success and accelerated profitable growth. We're taking actions to prioritize on the right initiatives and we're optimizing costs to fuel our long term growth. The opportunity in front of us is huge and largely untapped and it's an incredible runway. We see more and more people coming into the healthcare system every quarter and we'll benefit and help them sleep better, breathe better and live better lives in 140 countries. And we'll keep proving it to you every quarter as we go forward. Thanks to all the 10,000 ResMed-ians, many of whom are also shareholders, for all that you do today and every day. And with that, I'll hand the call back to you, Amy, to close us out.\nAmy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Mick. Thanks, everyone. We appreciate your interest and your time. As always, if you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly. This does conclude ResMed's first quarter 2024 conference call. Kevin, you can now end the call.\nOperator: Thank you. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "content": "Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. We had strong financial performance in Q1. Group revenue for the September quarter was $1.1 billion, an increase of 16%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 15%. Revenue growth reflected the ongoing combined availability of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 sleep devices to support solid underlying global demand as well as strong growth across our mask product portfolio. Year-on-year movements in foreign currencies positively impacted revenue by approximately $10 million in the September quarter. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business, sales in US, Canada and Latin America countries increased by 10%. In constant currency terms, sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 18%. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other sales increased by 21%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the US, Canada and Latin America increased by 2%, which reflects the fact that we are cycling a particularly higher prior year comparable that was driven by sales of our card to cloud devices. Masks and other sales increased by 23%, reflecting growth in resupply and new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales increased by 20% in constant currency terms, again, reflecting strong demand and significantly improved availability of cloud connected devices [Technical Difficulty] these patient setups. Software as a service revenue increased by 32% in the September quarter, reflecting the contribution from our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition and continued strong performance from our HME vertical. Excluding our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, SaaS revenue grew by 7% in the September quarter. MEDIFOX DAN contributed revenue of $25.7 million for the September quarter, consistent with our expectations at the time of the acquisition. Note, we will anniversary this acquisition in Q2 FY24, so our headline SaaS growth rate will moderate in Q2. Turning to my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers where we've provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Gross margin declined by 160 basis points to 56% in the September quarter. The decrease primarily reflects an increase in component and manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable product mix due to the increase in mask growth relative to device growth and favorable foreign currency movements. Sequential gross margin improved by 20 basis points, driven primarily by favorable product mix. Moving on to operating expenses. SG&A expenses for the first quarter increased by 15% or in constant currency terms increased by 14%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee related costs as well as the incremental SG&A expense associated with the MEDIFOX DAN that we acquired in November 2022. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue was 20.2% compared to the 20.3% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 20% for fiscal year '24. This guidance also reflects the impact of restructuring we initiated earlier this week and we estimate this will result in a reduction in our workforce of approximately 5%. We expect to complete the restructure during our second quarter of fiscal year '24. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 20% or in constant currency terms increased by 21%. The R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.9% compared to the 6.6% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for fiscal year '24. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 10%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by a lower gross margin. Our net interest expense for the quarter was $15 million and we expect interest expense to be in the range of $12 million to $14 million per quarter over the balance of fiscal year '24. Our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 20.1%, broadly consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year '24 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the September quarter increased by 9% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.64 also increased by 9%. During the quarter, we recorded a provision of $8 million associated with the expected cost of the recently announced Astral field safety notification. We also recorded acquisition related expenses of $0.5 million during the quarter. These both have been treated as non-GAAP items in our Q1 financial results. We recorded losses of $4.5 million in our September quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. As Mick discussed, the joint venture will be winding down operations and we will incur no further losses going forward in relation to Primasun. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $286 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings and stable working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $30 million and depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $45 million. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $209 million, and at September 30, we had $1.4 billion in gross debt and $1.2 billion in net debt. During the quarter, we reduced our debt by $80 million. At September 30, we had approximately $825 million available for drawdown under our revolver facility, and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. During the quarter, we also closed our previously announced Somnoware acquisition, a company that provides an upstream diagnostic management platform that is complementary to our current AirView and Brightree solutions. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share. As part of our capital management activities, we plan to resume our previously authorized share buyback program starting in our second quarter. We expect to purchase shares to the value of approximately $50 million per quarter. This will more than offset any dilution from the issue of employee equity during the year. Finally, concurrent with our capital management activities, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D and expect to deploy further capital for tuck-in acquisitions. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. As we look forward on GM, I mean, Mick mentioned it in his remarks as well. But if you look at it in terms of GM, we do feel that we're going to see improvements in our gross margin over FY24. And those tailwinds are really going to be around improved product mix, manufacturing improvements and efficiencies that we think we can drive. Freight cost reductions are still making their way through inventory and some of that will manifest in FY24. We're seeing stabilized component costs now, that was a headwind even for this quarter but we're cycling, largely cycling that, particularly in the second half FY '24. And then we have, obviously, the AS10 to AS11 transition that will be progressive over FY24 as well and then your point mentioning a little bit around pricing as well. So a combination of those factors will give us confidence, I think, in the gross margin through FY24. Yes, that's correct, that's excluded as a non-GAAP item from 56%. But if you're talking year-on-year on the gross margin, really the biggest impact coming through was component cost increases that we're still cycling through and working through inventory. So that was the biggest factor. We did see some product mix favorability there, but not enough to offset those component cost increases, for example. That was the biggest impact on the year-on-year reduction in GM."

            "name": "Mick Farrell",
            "content": "Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today. Our first quarter fiscal year 2024 results reflect strong growth across our entire business with double digit top line growth. This growth was driven by double digit global growth in the masks category and double digit growth in our software as a service business. We also achieved high single digit global growth in devices even as that category annualizes very high growth in the prior year period. The flexible and agile work of our supply chain, manufacturing and distribution teams has enabled us to provide ongoing global availability of our market leading 100% cloud connectable flow generator platforms. We have unconstrained supply of our AirSense platforms enabled by excellent volumes of the AirSense 10 platform globally and fast ramping approvals, launches and delivery of the best-in-class AirSense 11 platform country by country. During the quarter, we accelerated delivery of the AirSense 11 in Japan, and we launched the AirSense 11 in Australia and New Zealand. We have plenty of runway ahead on our pathway to launch in all of the 140 countries where we sell our solutions. We are very proud to be able to support all global demand for flow generators through a combination of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 platforms. We remain laser focused on accelerating the production and delivery of the AirSense 11 platform. We are moving swiftly on that front. Our Masks and Accessories business grew 21% year-over-year, amongst a highly competitive market with all global players on the field in this category. Our commercial teams are doing an amazing job of showing the clinical and economic benefits of the ResMed mask portfolio. Our clinical and commercial teams are also partnering with physicians and provider customers to drive resupply programs directly with patients. The peer reviewed and published clinical evidence showing that adoption of a resupply program leads to better patient outcomes is proving itself out in the real world customer by customer. We continue to see strong growth in the US mask business where provider resupply programs can scale, powered by our digital health ecosystem, including AirView for physicians and providers and myAir for patients. For patients around the world, especially in nonreimbursed markets, we are developing, launching and scaling outreach and subscription programs to help the consumer who is the ultimate customer to take control of their own health and engage directly in refreshing their mask, tubing, humidifier and other accessories. This has been a permanent uptick since COVID-19. People care about respiratory health and respiratory hygiene and they are taking action, and we are supporting them with digital solutions and services to meet their needs. Before I turn to review updates on our key strategic priorities, I'd like to spend a little time discussing actions we've taken to accelerate profitable growth across ResMed and to power our long term success. We've taken immediate steps to ensure we're prioritizing the right things to drive profitable growth and our leadership teams have carefully reviewed opportunities to improve our performance. We have stopped some projects that were not working out as well as we thought. We've increased investment in areas that we believe will be pivotal to long term success, such as our digital health tech investments as well as focused hardware and software development. Creating the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable, the most connected and the most intelligent healthcare solutions in the market. These changes have impacted some of our teams. And this week, we have taken actions that resulted in a reduction of our global workforce by 5%. Decisions like this that impact people are never easy. However, we know that we are doing the right thing, and we're doing the right thing to accelerate our growth and to refocus on our long term mission. I feel more strongly than ever that we are well positioned with an incredibly long runway of profitable growth and value creation for all of our stakeholders as we move forward. Let's now turn to a discussion of our three key strategic priorities: number one, to grow and differentiate our core Sleep Apnea and Respiratory Care business; number two, to design, develop and deliver market leading medical technology as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and number three, to create, innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital, a field that we call residential medicine. There are over 2 billion people worldwide suffering from sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular disease and insomnia. There are millions more that we can support as they navigate the complex outside hospital healthcare system. We believe that healthcare should be delivered in the lowest cost, lowest acuity and highest comfort location possible. Very often, that is a patient's own home. We have a massive opportunity ahead of us to help hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Our end markets remain incredibly underpenetrated with many opportunities to add value, reduce friction, lower costs and improve patient outcomes. Now that we've been able to comfortably support overall global market demand for sleep devices for the last few quarters, we're ramping up our demand generation initiatives. We're investing in marketing efforts to raise awareness and patient engagement across specific global markets. We are leveraging traditional healthcare channels as well as investing in cost effective direct-to-consumer demand gen campaigns to help what we call sleep concern consumers, find their way into the screening, diagnostic, treatment and management pathway. We will act as a digital concierge to guide patients on that journey. In terms of analyzing the results of these efforts to date and ongoing, we are tracking new patient starts in our physician and provider based ecosystem, AirView, which now has more than 22.5 million patients, as well as the new user starts in myAir where patients themselves choose to participate in their personalized healthcare journey to better breathing and better sleep. Patient flow into the funnel is at an all time high. We are well above the rates that we saw pre-COVID in 2019 across all geographies, triple digits across the board. The bottom line is that we are driving strong growth of patients into the funnel. We believe the work that's being done in the pharmaceutical industry right now with obesity drugs will be a net positive for patient flow and patient growth in sleep apnea, COPD and for ResMed overall. In terms of existing patients in our installed base, we are actively tracking a cohort of many thousands of patients on these GLP-1 medications and LPAT therapy. We are not seeing any significant change in the PAP adherence rates nor any reduced participation in resupply programs versus control groups. These data indicate that there is a cohort of patients on combined therapies in a stable state. In terms of new patients activated into the funnel, we are seeing the number of new patients activated into the healthcare funnel picking up. We see patient flow is not only strong but increasing. We believe in treating the whole person here at ResMed, including a combination of cardiovascular exercise, diet and nutrition as well as good sleep and breathing. That combination was called the Triumvirate of Health by Professor Bill Dement from Stanford, may he rest in peace. And we think a combination of these three elements will result in the best outcomes for patients. It is quite possible that this new class of drugs may become as large or even larger than the cholesterol class or the blood pressure treatment class of pharmaceuticals. If this is the case, we will see a whole new population of patients activated with their primary care providers that we may never have seen in the healthcare system. If this comes to pass, we may see benefits for the entire health system and for the people being treated themselves and for ResMed, as more and more people are evaluated and screened for sleep apnea, respiratory insufficiency and other key chronic conditions as part of their primary care evaluations. Our data are showing an all time high of patient flow and that supports this thesis. Stepping back and looking at the science in the field of respiratory medicine, we have created a forward-looking epidemiology model for our core market sleep apnea, spanning over two to three decades into the future. We have assumed an aggressive case for high market penetration of this new class of pharmaceuticals. We will publish the epidemiology model in our investor deck straight after this call. The model starts using a baseline of the global prevalence of sleep apnea, which was 936 million people in 2015. And this is based on peer reviewed and published data from the Journal Lancet in 2019. Our epidemiology model grows with conservative population and aging assumptions to a prevalence of around 1.4 billion people suffering from sleep apnea in 2050. We then overlaid an aggressive assumption for the adoption of this new pharmaceutical class globally. We assumed some of the highest penetration rates that we have seen reported by analysts in the industry. With this aggressive and sustained adoption of the new drug class, we forecast that the global prevalence of sleep apnea will still be around 1.2 billion people in 2050. Now in terms of the market penetration of our PAP therapy into this population, we have assumed market growth from our 22.5 million patients with PAP therapy here at the end of calendar year 2023 using steady state market growth rates that we saw in the years leading up to 2019, that is mid single digit growth for devices and high single digit growth for masks. With these growth rates, we reached around 109 million patients on our PAP therapy by 2050. That leaves 1.1 billion people remaining in the addressable market in 2050, over and above those already on our PAP treatment. We will continue to update our epidemiology model with all the new data as they arise. However, the bottom line is that there remains a huge number of people needing our sleep apnea treatment solutions today and for the next two to three decades and beyond. While we're proud that we have peer reviewed and published data showing that we can achieve over 87% adherence of patients to our PAP technology, combining our best-in-class med tech hardware with our digital health solutions AirView and myAir, that still means 10% of our patients on an annual basis will need alternatives. We are investing in those alternative therapies, and we are actively working with direct -- to direct patients who do not adhere to pack that 10%-plus to second line therapies, such as dental devices, where we have invested and scaled the market leading 3D printed dental device for sleep apnea in Europe called [Narval]. In addition, we have investments in other second line therapies, including pharmaceuticals and hypoglossal nerve stem technology. We want every patient who suffocates at night to find a path to good breathing and good sleep, and it looks like there's 1 billion of them we need to help. We start with the highest efficacy and lowest cost therapy, which is PAP technology, where we have very high adherence rates and the best outcomes for patients and we go from there. Given this incredible multiple decades long plus runway of growth and as part of our ongoing efforts to improve and streamline that end-to-end patient pathway and to make it easier for sleep physicians and sleep labs to diagnose and manage these patients, we're excited about our Somnoware acquisition that we closed during the last quarter. Somnoware is software for pulmonary and really all sleep physicians. And it complements our current portfolio of software offerings for physicians, homecare providers and patients, including AirView, Brightree and myAir, respectively. The goal is to ultimately drive greater efficiency and better patient care by helping physicians to take best-in-class care of their patients with increased efficiency and a better overall experience for the doctor and for the patient. We're making progress across several digital health technology initiatives to drive the value proposition of our cloud connected devices even higher. We are investing in several artificial intelligence driven data products and capabilities in our Air Solutions ecosystem. This quarter, we started rolling out a digital product in our US market called Compliance Coach. Compliance Coach is built for home care providers to help them efficiently focus efforts and prioritize outreach to increase patient compliance and ultimately to drive better patient outcomes by helping them meet and beat 90-day adherence goals. The application utilizes ResMed's many billions of nights of de-identified sleep and respiratory care data in the cloud to predict the likelihood that a patient will be adherent to therapy or not. The AI product then advises and coaches the home care provider to best identify the patients who may struggle and to meet compliance requirements where they can so they can prioritize their interventions and outreach to the best probabilities to support patient success. It's early in our rollout program of Compliance Coach. However, customers using the product are excited and engaged and are starting to see results. Watch this space for many more ways that we can work with all of our customers to unlock value from incredible depth of de-identified data using tech like AI and ML for the ultimate benefit of physicians, providers and patients. Let me discuss the forward pathway stemming from our joint venture with Verily right now that was called Primasun. Based on a mutual agreement between ResMed and Verily, we've made the decision to unwind the joint venture's day-to-day operations. We expect this to be complete by the end of the current quarter. Over the past years of this partnership, we've learned how to leverage technology to better identify, engage, diagnose and manage sleep concern consumers in our US market. We expect to take ownership of key assets of the Primasun developed model so that we can build on the investment and the learnings and ultimately accelerate our ongoing demand generation efforts with sleep apnea patients across ResMed. It is exciting to take the learning from demand gen work in one project and in one country and to now look to apply that on a global scale across the 140 countries where we provide solutions. Our growing Respiratory Care business continues to be supported by the increased adoption of both noninvasive and life support ventilator solutions. In terms of next-gen respiratory care therapies, we continue to invest in clinical and economic trials for high flow therapy, that we call HFT, with the goal of cost effectively treating COPD in the home. We continue to generate strong clinical evidence and economic outcomes that we believe will support broader adoption of these technology innovations for treating lung disease in the home. We believe this has the potential for future growth for ResMed over the medium to long term. We remain focused on addressing COPD as one of the top three chronic diseases for hospitalization and the number one cause of rehospitalization. The prevalence of respiratory insufficiency due to COPD as well as neuromuscular disease continues to increase and we are focusing and developing and plan to offer low cost, high quality solutions to address this healthcare epidemic. Our SaaS business had another great quarter with year-over-year growth of 32%. SaaS business growth was powered by another full quarter contribution from our fast growing MEDIFOX DAN business in Germany, as well as high single-digit organic growth across our Brightree and MatrixCare brands in the US market. The sustained high single digit organic growth in our SaaS business is driven by strength in the HME segment and stability as well as increased tech adoption by customers in the facilities segment. We see a pathway to stable double digit organic growth across the SaaS business, as well as increased net operating profit performance from this part of our business. The ongoing synergies between our digital health solutions in SaaS and our core business remains strong, and we continue to leverage that through combined management of cloud compute, cyber security, interoperability, tech dev as well as customer facing synergies, including patient resupply technology in our core business. During the quarter, we appointed Greg Timmons as the new General Manager of our Brightree business. I'm excited to support Greg and Bobby to continue to drive growth in our home medical equipment providers and to help our customers across the US market. This quarter, I traveled to Hildesheim, Germany to meet in person with the entire team from our MEDIFOX DAN business. The growth in tech solutions for ambulant home nursing as well as stationary nursing home businesses is very strong in Germany with an aging population in that country and a government that is driving care to be more home based through their policies and more digital through their policies. We see a long runway for growth with our MEDIFOX DAN team and across our global software as a service business. Our SaaS business remains an integral part of ResMed's growth strategy. This business complements the market leading software and device solutions we have in our respiratory medicine business. And we are well positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for residential medicine globally. And we have created differentiated value for customers and will drive long term sustainable growth for our shareholders. Before we get into a detailed update on our financials, let me say this here at ResMed. We are transforming respiratory medicine and residential medicine at scale. We are leading the market in digital health technology across our markets. As we continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our operations, we will leverage appropriate pricing and cost reductions to drive profitable growth. We're focused on driving top line revenue and tight cost discipline as well as increased efficiencies so that we can accelerate profitability, delivering value for all of our stakeholders and especially the 2 billion patients plus worldwide who need our help. As we move through fiscal year 2024, I'm confident on laser focus that we will continue to see improvements in our gross margin with GM leverage programs focused on five key areas. Number one, to drive the launch of AirSense 11 into new global markets and to increase the availability of AirSense 11 ultimately in all the country markets that we serve. Number two, to drive ongoing strong mask growth with a combination of resupply programs, subscription programs and new product launches, and you can see that's working this quarter. Number three, to increase software solutions growth, moving from high single digit organic growth to double digit organic growth with increased net operating profit leverage in that segment. Number four, to move the higher cost components and freight costs that we've seen through our legacy through our P&L, turning what was a supply chain crisis headwind into a steady tailwind as we move through fiscal year 2024. And number five, to implement cost reduction actions in noncore areas of our business to free up cash and to accelerate investments in market leading medtech and digital health solutions. So in terms of Digital Health Investments and Solutions, we now have over 16 billion nights of de-identified medical data in the cloud and over 22.5 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices sold in more than 140 countries worldwide. We continue to lead the industry in digital health technology and we don't plan to stop anytime soon. There is so much opportunity ahead of us. ResMed's mission and key goal remain crystal clear to improve 250 million lives through better residential healthcare in 2025. This patient centric mission drives and motivates ResMed-ians every day. During the last 12 months, we have improved over 165 million lives with the delivery of a medical device directly to a patient, a complete mask system to a patient or a digital health software solution, helping each person to sleep better, to breathe better and to live high quality lives with best in class healthcare delivered right where they live. I'm very excited about the opportunities in front of us. In closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the 10,000 ResMed-ians for their perseverance, their hard work, their dedication, both today and every day. Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney. And after Brett's remarks, we will open up for Q&A from the entire group. Brett, over to you. And I'm just happy that we've had 90 days and we put some sites behind the analysis of this as the world leader in the field of respiratory medicine and sleep apnea, we really know these prevalence numbers really well. And so that baseline of 936 million patients from 2015, growing to 1.4 billion through 2050 is really, I think, pretty conservative in its assumption of the growth rate of populations and aging populations in lower growth areas. But what that shows is 1.4 billion available in that time, not including any impact from any of these GLP-1 class of drug. And we took really the maximum aggressive efforts, including all current indications and some future ones to assess what the impact could be on the potential of patients in terms of sleep apnea prevalence worldwide, really aggressive and assume not only aggressive penetration but sustained that the adherence rate would stay sort of 80% to 100% on these drugs, which they're not achieving out there in the market, but we just said, let's take that high penetration case and that showed 1.2 billion patients in 2050. And so we will look at every update that comes from the pharma industry. They're very active in this class of GLP-1 but we think we're taking a very high penetration analysis to get there. And so we'll continue to look at any new data that come on and every quarter, we'll update that epidemiology model and move it around. But what it shows is a huge opportunity, 1.1 billion patients above our penetration at quite high growth rates through the next number of decades. To your question around concomitant therapy and use what we've been seeing in the last two years since a number of these have been out there in the diabetes side and on the obese indications, it's obviously early days, but we're tracking many thousands of patients on GLP-1s and PAP and we're seeing maintenance of adherence, we're seeing maintenance of resupply programs and really no change. When you look at -- so that's at the aggregate level, we are seeing no change there. We are seeing more patients coming into the funnel. Look, we know we're doing our awareness programs, our demand gen programs and there are other alternative therapies doing demand gen that bring patients into the funnel that we get a benefit from. But we truly believe that this idea that you could come in to the healthcare system, someone who's maybe obese, moderately obese and likely avoiding the healthcare system, there's a high avoidance of people with BMI of 30, 32, 35 of the primary care system. And so we believe it will bring more patients in. We're seeing that with our very high patient flow. So look, we're just looking at the data we're observing, which is patients on concomitant therapies there multiple years, and we're going to track those and track the adherence and we'll publish that every quarter. We're seeing actually our adherence rates steady and resupply rates steady in that installed base. And in the new patient flow side, we're actually seeing increased all-time highs of patients coming into the funnel. So we're watching all of these above and we're looking for two to three decades and still see with highest case penetration, you can roll in any study like you're still going to see north of hundreds of millions to 1 billion patients between the likely penetration in our disease state and beyond. But David, thanks for the question, and I look forward to ongoing discussions. Yes, David, look, thanks for the question. And as you look at the epidemiology data, there's a number of splits on AHI. What we're lacking in the market is a split around symptomatology and how patients feel. And as we're looking at the data, patients with AHIs, 5 to 15, 15 to 30 and 30 plus and overlapping that with concomitant therapy, we'll be peer reviewing and publishing data at upcoming conferences in 2024 on this to show some of these nuances of deltas. But on the aggregate group, we're not seeing changes in adherence. And even in the subsets of mild to moderate, we're not seeing significant changes in adherence rates or new patients coming into the funnel. AHI is a great measure of the number of suffocation episodes per hour. Just to remind people, an AHI 14, just under 15, which is considered mild is suffocating every four minutes of sleep. So a doctor may call that mild, but to a patient who's suffocating every four minutes of sleep, in 15 -- 14 times an hour, and you're sleeping all through the not having 80, 90 suffocation episodes, they stick on the therapy and new patients coming in as well. So look, we're watching this really carefully, and we're really analyzing by AHI, by symptomatology, by craniofacial distance between the tongue and the uvula and actually size of time because there's a whole lot of factors that go into go into the prevalence of sleep apnea and obviously, the issues around hypopneas, which are far more prevalent in women and lead to worse excessive daytime sleepiness, headache and comorbidities that are not associated with weight at all. But look, we're looking through all of these data. And as we look forward over the next number of decades, there will be an impact. There's no question by these weight loss medications. But it will be on the margin and it won't be -- I mean, certainly, the market believes it's going to be dramatic given the last 90 days of our stock. And I can tell you, every bit of clinical data that we have going forward and every bit we have going retrospectively, we've got the biggest database in the world and it's 21.5 million patients. As we look at that split between mild, moderate and severe, we're not seeing changes. But look, every quarter, we'll continue to update that, and we'll do more and more splits on severity. We published this epidemiology model this quarter and we'll continue to update it and continue to provide data. I'm also making sure that we keep some of those data so we can get them into the peer reviewed and published press like the Lancet article that started the epidemiology model, and so we'll be publishing the information that we can. And then every quarter here on the -- on our investor site, but they will also be running the real sites in epidemiology models and health econ and outcomes research work and making sure that gets into the peer reviewed and published press as well. Dan, that would be delightful. And so yes, there will be ongoing longitudinal studies that will get out to the peer-reviewed press, but obviously, look, it's an urgent issue. And if you look at the market reaction the last 90 days, there's an assumption of 30%, 40% reduction in immediate TAM, right? If you look at that market cap change and it's just in congress with every piece of scientific evidence that we've looked at historically and going forward. So there's many thousands of patients on our GLP-1 plus PAP database. We also have 17,000 patients that we're tracking that have had gone through bariatric surgery and are on PAP therapy post surgery with 50%-plus weight loss reductions in that cohort. So we're tracking much stronger weight loss cohort and this sort of -- depending on which type of GLP-1, 10, 20, 30, plus percent weight loss reductions in the extreme case of the 50% weight loss reductions. And so we'll be are publishing data in the peer reviewed and clinical press across all of those cohorts as we go forward. Yes, we will choose -- as we keep putting out the epidemiology data, we will choose to put some of those data, which aren't going into the peer-reviewed press, right? So we don't those studies that we actually want to get into the clinical information that can really be out there versus just the stuff that we put together for an investor, which then would prohibit those same data going into a clinical paper. But we are finding the balance between those and we definitely hear that the market is looking for those data. I can tell you now that the data on aggregate are showing no change despite how you look which GLP-1 class, which AHI group for adherence and resupply. But I will start to find the right division between the information we can get out on the short to medium term basis and the information that needs to go in those longitudinal studies to really show the sites behind this and really balance it out. One of the best ways we're doing it every quarter is to show the incredible growth that we're getting in our devices and our masks and particularly the resupply of masks, right? There's no impact of anyone's recall, there's no impact of any drug therapy and you just look at the replenishment rate of masks, if you're not on therapy, you're not ordering masks. And we're seeing really strong resupply. The other fact to bring into this that we can publish and do publish is the number of patients in our Air Solutions ecosystem, 22.5 million patients that continues to go up. We had record numbers of new patients starting up. And in addition to that record numbers of patients themselves engaging with myAir and that's driven by AirSense 11 being far more digitally engaged and higher rates of adoption of that. But we're seeing a really strong uptake of patients and flow in and patients on adherence, but we'll continue to publish every quarter those data and the appropriate data we can from the clinical, and we'll definitely update the epidemiology model every quarter. It's a really good question because the mask growth across the group was 21% on constant currency. Europe was incredibly strong at 15% constant currency growth in a full competition market with everybody on the field and 23% in US, Canada, Latin America. Look, as I said in my description in the prepared remarks on our look forward over the next n number of decades, the stable market growth in our field was mid single digits on the device side and high single digits on the mask side. If you look at the five year CAGR, three year CAGR leading into 2019 pre COVID. And that's sort of what we're looking at that epidemiology model that mid single digit growth on devices and high single digit growth on masks. So if you think of that as the market growth in a stable state, it then comes up to, well, what can ResMed do in market demand? What can we do in demand gen? What can we do to get patients into the funnel? I truly believe to the three questions focused on this new class of drugs. I do believe we are seeing more patients come into the funnel, more patients into primary care. That's great. I mean I think there's $1 trillion worth of market cap now from these companies and they will turn that into marketing to bring people in for the miracle drug, and that will absolutely bring patients in for assessment for all the comorbidities that are associated with a patient that might have been severely overweight and now likely on the other side of these will still be overweight, including sleep apnea, COPD and other cardiovascular diseases and beyond. So we're watching that really closely. Look, we've consistently over decades that we've been in business, not just accepted mask growth rates from the market, we said, let's drive it higher and higher. The 23% is extraordinary and very strong in a highly competitive market. But I look at what we're doing with resupply, I look at what we're doing with new product launches, I look at what we're doing to drive patients into the funnel. And I think we can meet and beat that high single digits that the market would grow at. And with us being such a strong share, we get to -- when we do demand gen, we get to get a very good share of those patients through the funnel. So there's more of an incentive for ResMed to drive demand gen initiatives when we get such a good share of it on the device and mask side, and we're seeing that in many of the markets we operate in worldwide. But it's a great question. And as I said in the prepared remarks, stuff that impacts our people are the toughest decisions to make, and we did this week, have a change in 5% of our global workforce reduction of 5% of our global workforce and tough decisions to make. I really think that, that is -- if you think about it, that is the restructuring. There are some changes I'm looking at it in the operating model, sort and roles and responsibilities and a focus on a more product-led and brand-led company that will come over time, but they're not massive restructures. And I think what that 18% to 20% revenues that Brett talked about in SG&A is indicative of the change that we've made here and reestablished a new base and a push for, as you said, really strong profitable growth across our business. But look, the world has changed. We are already a product led organization but our brand has increased in its value across the world, and we need to document and understand that and understand how to engage people in nonreimbursed markets as consumers into the funnel. And we've already invested in a number of our D2C markets in that, and we're driving that. And in our B2B and B2B2C markets, we're also working with our healthcare partners and distributors in the channel to work out how to best get patients into the funnel. So we're sort of, if you like, we're freeing up cash to reinvest in demand gen, reinvest in getting patients into the funnel. And we think there's a billion reasons in terms of the patients that need our help to get out there and do it. And that's going to be there for decades and we've got to find better ways to do it. But to answer your question directly, yes, that restructure is done and we're now focused on moving forward. So look, we have a relatively low share of the diagnostic space in home sleep apnea testing with our ApneaLink Air product. So we are tracking that,those are up. The best data we have is through Air Solutions System. So we talk about the 22.5 million patients on our Air Solutions platform and almost 7 million patients that we now have on myAir patients directly engaged in. So we watch those starts very closely. We also do have de-identified and objective data from Brightree showing across the whole industry, patients coming into the funnel in sleep apnea but also across other home medical equipment categories. And I can tell you the patients are getting engaged and finding their way into the to the primary care treatment funnel and specifically in sleep apnea. And we believe it's not short term that this is a sustainable rate of growth for patients coming in, and I think it's really exciting to see that. To your question specifically about device growth, yes, so it's 8% globally. I mean I got to say I'm incredibly proud of our Europe, Asia and rest of world markets growing 20% this quarter year-on-year, that's where we're competing directly with our competitor that was out for their recall. They're back in many countries, in Europe, Asia and rest of world, and meeting and beating them head-to-head, I think, proves out the thesis that ResMed has the best-in-class products, but services and solutions, not just the hardware but the software and the capability we've been investing in that for a long period of time. This period a year ago, the September quarter 2022, we had just unleashed card to cloud on an unallocated basis, and it took off despite usually what is quite a low growth quarter in September, given that summer here in the US. We had incredible growth last summer with our card to cloud solutions, so we're lapping that growth. I think the team with that device growth of 2% is building on what was an extraordinary uptick from card to cloud. But when we look at the number of patients coming through, the diagnostic funnel and the setups coming into AirView and the setups of the patients coming into myAir, the growth rate of patients is mid single digits plus and with recap really up there. And so I think that's why I can say that I think it's sustainable for us to meet and beat sort of the pre-COVID 2019 earlier CAGR of mid single digit growth for devices, we can meet and beat that throughout demand gen and high single digit growth in masks. We can definitely meet and beat that through our work and experience and expertise now on resupply, engagement with patients and the changes that happen during COVID are focused on respiratory health and respiratory hygiene. So I hope that answers your question, Margaret. Thanks to that. It's a good question, but it's a complicated answer, because there's so many moving pieces between that baseline you took there for that CAGR number '19 and '20 with the COVID shutdowns, our spin-up on ventilators with 150,000 vents at the start 2020 and then the slowdown and the restart-up of the sleep apnea funnel and the shift that happened through 2020, 2021. And then, of course, the perturbation that made it a perfect storm of a competitor with a recall of 5.5 million devices and '21 through '23 and ongoing. So with all that, I'll just talk to the market growth rate that we saw stable pre-2019, right, of that mid single digit growth of devices and high single digit growth in masks. We think that where we're at now taking our baseline of now we can meet and beat that growth rate, right? And so that definitely doesn't mean going backwards. You can take what we've got now, which is, I believe, a very strong share of the US market and in the 140 countries we're in competition, but it's a good place for us to be. We are looking at from where we are achieving mid single digit plus growth in our devices and high single-digit growth on our masks. And no, we don't intend to go backwards at all. In fact, we intend to not only go forward but go forward strongly. And I think what was shown up in the numbers this quarter is our incredibly strong growth. I talked earlier that our incredibly strong growth in devices of 20% in Europe, Asia and rest of world. We had 15% growth in masks in Europe, Asia and around the other countries. And so I think what it's shown is that ResMed is going to go head-to-head with full competition out there and be able to meet and beat the competition, because we've got the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, most connected and the most intelligent health systems, and it's that whole combination of not just the product, but the solution, the service and how it's embedded in the healthcare system to the patient to the physician that allows us to achieve that. So we're not going backwards, we're going forward, Saul, and we're going to grow at or ahead of market. And in many countries, we're going to drive demand gen to increase the whole aggregate market growth rate and pull more patients into the funnel, because now we've got a greater incentive than ever to do that. Thanks for the question. Thanks for the question, Matthew, and welcome to covering ResMed. Yes. So look, what's going to happen is with our organic SaaS business, as you saw in the quarter, we had good high single-digit growth at 7%. And we've sort of been in that sort of 7% to 8% in our organic growth across our US franchise really MatrixCare plus Brightree. And with the MEDIFOX DAN group, we haven't sort of been breaking out organic growth within that. But it is going to be incremental to that group. But in addition to that, there's a great product pipeline at both Brightree and MatrixCare that I feel confident and some portfolio focuses on the high growth parts of their portfolio and moving out or backing up with some of the low growth areas in that portfolio of MatrixCare that gives me great confidence as I look forward over the fiscal year and beyond that we're going to turn organic growth from sort of where it is now in the high single digits to double double digit growth on a stable organic basis across that SaaS business. So Matthew, it's a combination of MEDIFOX DAN increase in the group but also some great product pipelines in the current business to be able to get us there. And the final punchline I'll put there is, in addition to that, driving that better top line growth, we're working -- we restructured as well on SG&A and some R&D in our SaaS business this week, this quarter. And that will allow us to get good leverage on the net operating profit bottom line. And I see that moving closer and closer to the ResMed group and even being a strong contributor, an even stronger contributor for us as we look to maximize our long term EPS and return on invested capital across our group. So great question, Matthew, but we're very confident we can achieve that as we go through fiscal year '24, '25 and beyond in our SaaS business. Well, thanks, everybody, for attending this call and for the great detailed questions. And thanks, Kevin. Yes. Look, I'll close with this. ResMed is well positioned for ongoing future success and accelerated profitable growth. We're taking actions to prioritize on the right initiatives and we're optimizing costs to fuel our long term growth. The opportunity in front of us is huge and largely untapped and it's an incredible runway. We see more and more people coming into the healthcare system every quarter and we'll benefit and help them sleep better, breathe better and live better lives in 140 countries. And we'll keep proving it to you every quarter as we go forward. Thanks to all the 10,000 ResMed-ians, many of whom are also shareholders, for all that you do today and every day. And with that, I'll hand the call back to you, Amy, to close us out."
