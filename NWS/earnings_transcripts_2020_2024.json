And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mike Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMichael Florin: Thank you very much, Nicole. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp\u2019s Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about an hour ago, and it\u2019s now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We\u2019ll open with some prepared remarks, and then we\u2019ll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp\u2019s business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp\u2019s Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release. With that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\nRobert Thomson: Thank you, Mike. Let me say initially that I trust all on the call and your families are faring well. These are certainly complex times, and there are few who have not been touched in some manner. The coronavirus has irrevocably changed businesses and our businesses in expediting pre-existing digital trends, in challenging established practices and in prompting necessary introspection about work habits and the workplace itself. There has been much agility and adaptation at News Corp. The vast majority of our employees across the world have been working at home, and the resilience of the company\u2019s culture has been a core component in continuity. Without doubt, digitization has accelerated. And without doubt, all of our businesses have been affected and responded with customary ingenuity. I would like to express my sincere thanks to each of our employees and their families for having responded so promptly, so intelligently and so thoughtfully to these testing circumstances. Evidence of that response was seen in the fourth quarter, when virtually all of our businesses prudently reduced costs, sometimes painfully to ensure that they were robust enough to cope with volatility and disruption. Preserving cash was a priority, and it is worth noting that our cash balance increased in the last quarter by $129 million to over $1.5 billion as of June 30. Revenue comparisons are obviously made complex by the sale of News America Marketing and Unruly, plus the consequences of COVID. But our adjusted revenue for the quarter declined by 13%. Obviously, the net income and EPS were affected by non-cash impairments, primarily at our UK and Australian businesses. And Susan will be able to provide more details momentarily. However, our adjusted total segment EBITDA declined by a modest 10%. This is particularly significant and a somewhat historic earnings call. Regular listeners will recall that we had pledged to simplify the company and make the results more transparent. The sale of News America Marketing and Unruly certainly simplified the structure. And in the quest for transparency, beginning this quarter, we are presenting Dow Jones as a separate segment. This will highlight what we believe are two incontrovertible facts: the substantial and growing value of that company and its superior profit profile and prospects to those in the New York Times. In what has been a difficult year for many media companies, Dow Jones reported a 13% increase in segment EBITDA based on the strength of its professional information business and the preeminence of the Wall Street Journal. Our other global mastheads and digital information properties are gathered in the News Media segment, which will include our Australian titles, many of which are now digital-only: The Times, The Sun and Sunday Times as well as Talksport and Virgin Radio. It may be called News Media, but obviously, the segment is increasingly digital in personality, and virtually all of our mastheads had record audiences during the year. Our journalists have performed admirably in providing crucial insights to readers during the COVID crisis, delivering accurate information and analysis and providing an antidote to conspiracy theories and noxious nonsense proliferating elsewhere on the web. We are continuing to focus on acquiring digital subscribers and audience while rightsizing our businesses to be digital-first, which is necessarily resulting in significant cost reductions. The closure in Australia of many of our storied print editions and the emphasis on digital was further evidence of our willingness to be decisive at an epochal moment. We are very proud of our traditions, and we will always invest in the very best journalism. But the format is less important than the function. And we firmly believe that the digital reincarnation of these titles will ensure a profitable future and a continuing role in their community. We are also constantly restlessly reviewing our portfolio with a view to ensuring that we have the optimum asset mix. All of our executives understand that these are testing times and many of our executives around our businesses internationally have volunteered hefty cuts to their bonuses, which form a large part of their compensation. The Executive Chairman has forsaken 100% of his bonus, and Susan Panuccio and David Pitofsky, our General Counsel, who are with me on this call have also voluntarily given up a meaningful chunk of their bonus. All understand the importance of a stringent cost strategy, so we have launched a genuinely meaningful shared service program that we believe will transform the company by centralizing many of our functions. The mission is being led by two of our most talented executives, Damian Eales from Australia and Jane Viner from the UK, in tandem with our CTO, the Global Head of HR, and CFO, in other words, Susan. The early indications are that the shared service program should be able to appreciably reduce our costs and we expect it to have a materially positive impact on our bottom line. We will always emphasize integrity and creativity, but our ability to prioritize imperative projects will be enhanced by the program. We expect our technology platforms to be the best-in-class at the lowest available price. And the overall level of cooperation coordination among our businesses will certainly be enhanced. This is not an ephemeral project, but one that we believe will have a fundamental impact on the way we do business and on our earnings. One other trend is already having an appreciable impact on our earnings, the change in terms of trade with the digital platforms. Those of you who watched the congressional testimony last week by the tech titans would have noticed overall that the political understanding of the issues has vastly improved. That is also true in Brussels, London and Australia, where the ACCC has just introduced a draft mandatory code of contact. I recommend that anyone seeking enlightenment, Google the name Rod Sims and read a few of his recent interviews. Mr. Sims chairs the ACCC. It is fair to say, without revealing details that we are deep in discussion with these companies and that the ecosystem has absolutely begun to evolve. For News Corp, which has been pursuing this issue for well over a decade, this favorable outcome would simply not have been possible without the leadership of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and the support of a board which backed advocacy even when News Corp often stood alone in pursuit of the principle of a premium for premium content. Now for the numbers. At the new Dow Jones segment, revenues improved in fiscal year 2020 and profitability was up 13%, as I\u2019ve mentioned. At $236 million, Dow Jones full segment \u2013 full year segment EBITDA was the highest in separation, as were margins. Digital revenue surpassed $1 billion in fiscal 2020 for the first time and represented 66% of total revenues, rising to 70% for the fourth quarter. We saw strong circulation volume growth, with digital-only subscriptions increasing 23% year-over-year for the Wall Street Journal in Q4 and 51% for the Barron\u2019s Group. MarketWatch, our finance website reported the highest annual revenue numbers in the brand\u2019s history, making it the third year in a row of record-breaking results. Equally impressive, unique users more than doubled to $62 million in the month of June. In contrast to most COVID affected media sites, digital advertising was down only 7% in the quarter and the general shift towards digital as a source of revenue continues, with that segment representing 54% of advertising revenues in the quarter. We expect that digital will continue to outpace print, given we are seeing robust digital advertising despite the social and commercial volatility that has prompted many companies to be cautious in marketing spend. Even with the pandemic impact, digital advertising at Dow Jones was 4% higher for the year. Full year revenues for the professional information business rose 7% year-over-year, driven by Risk & Compliance, which surged 20%. We remain particularly excited by the prospects for our Risk & Compliance business, given the intensification of regulatory scrutiny around the world. As we have noted on this call in the past, who among you does not want to minimize risk and maximize compliance? We are expanding our risk-related product lines, enhancing our software and ensuring that the increased flow of actionable intelligence is complemented by thoughtful analysis and compelling news feeds for our growing audience of clients. We contend that the all digital Risk & Compliance business is a highly undervalued part of a highly undervalued company, given the revenue trajectory, the still expanding market and the necessity for companies and individuals to have an audit trial of compliance. The creation of the Dow Jones segment allows us to make a direct comparison with The New York Times, and on most important measures, the Wall Street Journal and the Board of Dow Jones performed far better. The Journal is both the most trusted general newspaper in the U.S. according to Reuters Institute and the world\u2019s leading business use provider. And a vast, well-healed, well-informed audience provides an opportunity to upsell value-added lucrative business products to serve a specialist need. Here are a few metrics comparing the two companies for the quarter. Dow Jones segment EBITDA of $60 million was higher than in New York Times, having benefited from the stability of our vibrant professional information business. While Dow Jones segment EBITDA expanded by 13% year-over-year, New York Times declined by 6%. Dow Jones EBITDA margins were 15.7%, about 3 percentage points higher than the New York Times. In this time of COVID, Dow Jones revenue decline moderated at a higher rate than the New York times at 4% versus down over 7% for The Times. Dow Jones COVID-affected advertising revenue declined at a much lower rate than The Times, thanks largely to significant outperformance in digital advertising which was down just 7% at Dow Jones versus down 32% at The New York Times. In fact, Dow Jones generated more total ad dollars than The New York Times. We feel strongly that we should explain the virtues of Dow Jones to shareholders and potential shareholders so we will have an Investor Day in mid-September at which Dow Jones Chief Executive, Almar Latour, and other Dow Jones Executives and myself, will give you a more granular explanation of the company\u2019s extraordinary potential and an opportunity for you to interrogate. The News Media segment, of course, had a challenging year, and we took prompt measures to confront those challenges. These included the aforementioned sales of NAM and Unruly as well as immediate cost reductions and the launch of strategic shared service project. In Australia, apart from migrating publications to digital only, we also sold our investment in the Australian associated press newswire and unfortunately, implemented hundreds of redundancies. The end of the relationship with AAP was both necessary and historic as the service was founded in 1935 by Sir Keith Murdoch. Digital subscriptions across News Corp Australia rose 25% to nearly 650,000 by the end of the fiscal year. Meanwhile, at News UK, The Times and The Sunday Times paid subscribers rose to 336,000, an increase of 11% year-over-year and benefited from a focus on attracting premium subscribers with a concomitant improvement in retention rates. The Sun\u2019s online audience expanded markedly during the year, including with the launch of a U.S. edition. In toto, The Sun reported 133 million unique users globally in June for 1 month, which also reflects our expansion in the U.S. Importantly, The Sun remains as the leading news brand in the UK according to Pamco. The sheer scale of our collective reach should not be underestimated. In the U.S., The New York Post digital network reached 177 million monthly unique users during the fourth quarter. It has long been known that The Post has been loss-making, but those losses have fallen dramatically in the past 18 months as we increased cover prices and benefited from ad revenue for our expanding digital readership and reduced the cost base. We can now see a clear path to profitability for The Post. In book publishing, despite the viral vicissitudes, which included the near shutdown of U.S. physical stores, profitability was up in Q4. This is a testament to the resourcefulness of the team at HarperCollins, which moved quickly to bolster supply chains and emphasize e-books and online sales. These actions allowed us to make the most of changes in reading behavior during the pandemic. As we had indicated on previous calls, the second half of the fiscal year at HarperCollins was more propitious than the first half, with segment EBITDA improvement in both Q3 and Q4. Among the titles that performed well were the latest installment of Joanna Gaines' highly successful Magnolia Table series, Dutch House by Ann Patchett, The One and Only Bob by Katherine Applegate and World\u2019s Worst Parents by David Williams. Looking ahead to fiscal 2021, we\u2019re already eagerly anticipating the release of Tiger Woods' autobiography, and expect strong results from the upcoming launch of Jenna Bush Hager\u2019s, Everything Beautiful in Its Time. We\u2019re certainly pleased by the early performance of Daniel Silver\u2019s, The Order and Ben Shapiro\u2019s, How to Destroy America in three Easy Steps, and we expect much from Lebron James' first children\u2019s book, I Promise, scheduled for release next Tuesday. In digital real estate services, REA\u2019s traffic and lead volume have rebounded in the wake of the shutdown in Australia, with record audiences in June and a dramatic increase in users potentially interested in a house move. There is simply no doubt that the COVID crisis has prompted many families to consider their housing circumstances, and that ultra-low interest rates have made a move more possible. We noted similar trends in the U.S. at realtor.com, and we saw a significant improvement in profitability at Move, which runs the realtor.com site in the fourth quarter and for the year as a whole. The new leadership team at Move is working closely with the Dow Jones' executive team as the combined audience and lucrative demographic of the two sites in the U.S. is a hefty $124 million based on comScore statistics as of June. We are confident that the Dow Jones sites will provide a flow of potential buyers for realtor.com and that realtor.com will provide a flow of potential subscriptions for the WSJ and Barron\u2019s. Also in Australia, at Foxtel, our emphasis on streaming has brought a leap in new customers for both Kayo, the sports streaming service, and Binge, our entertainment offering, which has just launched. As of August 4, Kayo, showing great resilience, had 590,000 subscribers, including 48,000 trialists, while Binge had 217,000 subscribers, which includes 185,000 paying, just a short time after its formal launch. Both services are making the most of our existing rights without incurring extra content expenses and are certainly expanding the reach of Foxtel, which has now approached a new record number of total subscribers following an acceleration in July. Just this week, we crossed the 1 million OTT paying subscriber mark, setting a new record, thanks to our expanded streaming strategy. While there is certainly seasonality to Kayo, given the scheduling of the popular winter sports, we are reassured that so many subscribers have returned to the service so promptly and particularly encouraged by the early rush of subscribers at Binge. Our past acquisition of cricket rights means that we are well positioned when the Indian cricket teams arrive in Australia later this year. On our last call, you will recall that I insisted that there would be a reset of sports prices. And in the midst of this year\u2019s shortened season, that has absolutely come to pass. While negotiations with some sports continue, deals already completed will reduce the cost of sports rights at Foxtel by at least AUD 180 million over the next three years as compared to the prior contracted value. This reset will have a positive long-term impact on Foxtel\u2019s profitability. No doubt, the events of the first half of calendar year 2020 will remain resonant in our memories. I am particularly proud of the performance of all those who work at News Corp for showing professionalism, passion and compassion throughout these most difficult of times. Our reporters and opinion writers around the world have provided a profoundly important service, and many of our employees have contributed to their communities through philanthropic service in recent months. And now for more granular detail and customary insight, Susan.\nSusan Panuccio: Thank you, Robert. Before talking through our fiscal 20 results, I would like to recap on the actions we\u2019ve taken this past year to better position News Corp for long-term success with a focus on increasing shareholder value and transparency. Firstly, the company has taken significant action on our cost base. Our publishing business in Australia has been significantly restructured with 112 of our regional and community markets transitioning to digital or closed. The cost base at Foxtel has been restructured with savings across programming and support functions. With increasing OTT scale and a lower cost base, Foxtel is better positioned for success, and I would like to reiterate that we have no plans to provide additional funding. Our digital real estate businesses have also been proactive in reducing headcount to confront the challenges of COVID-19. In addition, we took quick and decisive action to reduce OpEx and CapEx in the fourth quarter with CapEx reducing by 1/3 year-on-year and total costs decreasing 21% year-on-year, partially due to divestments in FX, but primarily due to active cost management. We are also close to finalizing our savings opportunities for global shared services across the company as we look to leverage our global scale and reduce duplication. These collective actions resulted in a 7% reduction in headcount this year across the businesses, excluding the NAM and Unruly sales. Secondly, Dow Jones results are now reported as a separate segment, which better highlights its performance and provides a more complete comparison with its peers. The business saw record subscriptions and achieved growth in both revenue and EBITDA for the year. Thirdly, we are taking tangible steps to stabilize our newly formed News Media segment through digital subscriber growth, cover price increases and aggressive cost targets, which will be further enhanced by our global shared service initiative. In relation to liquidity, the only debt exposures we have are at our non 100% owned subsidiaries, Foxtel and REA, and these are non-recourse to News Corp. Finally, as part of our simplification efforts, we continue to reshape News Corp\u2019s portfolio this year with the divestments of News America Marketing and Unruly. With that as a backdrop, I will now discuss our latest financial results. Fiscal 2020 fourth quarter total revenues were approximately $1.9 billion, down 22% versus the prior year, reflecting the impacts of COVID-19 and the divestment of News America Marketing in early May. Total segment EBITDA was $195 million, down 28% versus the prior year. Excluding the divestment of NAM, acquisitions, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, adjusted revenues fell 13% and adjusted total segment EBITDA decreased 10% as growth in segment EBITDA at the Dow Jones, book Publishing and subscription video services segments were outweighed by the negative impact of COVID-19. Our best estimate for the revenue impact of COVID-19 for the quarter was negative $330 million or 13%, together with a negative impact on total segment EBITDA estimated to be between $40 million to $55 million or 15% to 20%. For the quarter, we reported a net loss per share of $0.67 as compared to a net loss per share of $0.09 in the prior year. The loss includes $292 million of non-cash impairment charges primarily related to fixed assets in the UK and Australia. Adjusted earnings per share were negative $0.03 in the quarter compared to positive $0.07 in the prior year. Moving on to the quarterly results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Dow Jones. Revenues for the quarter were $381 million, down 4% compared to the prior year, with digital revenues accounting for a record 71% of total revenues this quarter. Circulation revenues rose 2% due to robust growth in digital circulation revenues, partially offset by lower print circulation revenues, which were impacted by the decline in newsstand sales and fewer amenity copies primarily related to COVID-19. As Robert mentioned, Dow Jones again achieved record subscriptions in the quarter and saw an acceleration in year-over-year growth compared to the prior quarter. Dow Jones average subscriptions for the quarter were almost 3.8 million, up 15% from the prior year. And of that, digital-only subscriptions were 2.8 million, up 28% year-over-year. For the Wall Street Journal, there were approximately 3 million total subscriptions for the quarter, up 15% from the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions growing 23% to more than 2.2 million, improving from the 15% year-over-year growth rate in the prior quarter. To frame the improvement, we added 203,000 Wall Street Journal digital-only subscriptions this quarter compared to 112,000 in the third quarter and 43,000 in the prior year. Revenues from Dow Jones Professional Information business rose 6% year-over-year, slightly higher than the third quarter rate, driven by 14% revenue growth at Risk & Compliance. Consistent with our expectations, Risk & Compliance revenues reached approximately $160 million for fiscal 2020. As we mentioned last quarter, advertising revenues, which accounted for only 19% of revenues this quarter were impacted by COVID-19 and declined 28% to $71 million. For the first time, digital advertising revenue was greater than print, accounting for 54% of total advertising revenues for the quarter. Digital advertising revenues fell 7%, helped by strong growth in programmatic while print advertising was down 43%, which included the impact from the cancellation of live events. Total unique visitors across our Dow Jones Digital platforms more than doubled in the quarter versus the prior year. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 13% to $60 million. Turning to our other news segment, News Media, which primarily includes News Australia, News UK and the New York Post and the News America Marketing and Unruly companies prior to their disposal. Revenues for the quarter were $490 million, down 41% versus the prior year, of which the impact from the divestment of News America Marketing accounted for over half of the total revenue decline. On an adjusted basis, which excludes NAM, Unruly and the other items mentioned in our release, revenues declined 22%. Advertising revenue fell 58% on a reported basis, of which $179 million or 36% of the decline was from the sale of News America Marketing, and the rest of the decline was driven by the negative impact from COVID-19, weaknesses in the print advertising market and a $20 million or 4% negative impact related to the suspension of certain community titles in Australia. Advertising revenues at News UK fell 46% on a reported basis and 45% in local currency, relatively consistent with our April commentary, with lower print trends, partially offset by strong digital advertising growth at The Sun. Performance was similar in Australia, with advertising down 46% on a reported basis and 42% in local currency, which includes the negative impact related to the suspension of certain community titles. Circulation and subscription revenues declined 9%, impacted by lower news stand sales related to COVID-19, partially offset by strong digital paid subscriber growth and cover price increases in Australia. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was a loss of $44 million, down $95 million from the prior year. The divestment of News America Marketing accounted for $43 million of the year-over-year decline. Also included in the results are approximately $8 million of additional cost related to the decommissioning of print operations in Australia. It is important to note that we do not expect this to be the new normal, and we are taking significant and decisive steps to improve the trajectory of the segment, including better monetizing our growing and global audience and further cost reductions. These include leveraging existing content to source incremental licensing revenues. We believe that we are very well positioned to benefit from incremental licensing revenues as early as this fiscal year, which should have a meaningful impact on EBITDA. Our biggest source of revenues in the News Media segment is now circulation and subscription. We expect continued growth in our digital subscriptions, and we will be looking at cover and subscription prices to help offset print advertising declines. Our global shared service initiative, which we expect to centralize many of our back-office functions and remove duplication. We\u2019ll also continue to work on newsroom transformation and the ongoing review of our printing sites and office space. We have reduced our total headcount within the segment by 12% in fiscal 2020, which will lower our cost base going forward, and we expect additional reductions in fiscal 2021. The impact of COVID-19 remains uncertain, and we do expect continued advertising challenges. However, we will continue to focus on the digital transformation of this segment, new ways to monetize our content and continue to take aggressive cost measures as we look to provide a more stable outlook. At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues decreased 16% to $238 million, primarily due to a decline in listings in Australia and the U.S. related to COVID-19 and associated customer support measures. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 13%. Segment EBITDA fell 10% to $71 million or 5% on an adjusted basis. REA Group revenues fell 21%, primarily reflecting FX, lower developer revenues and a 14% decline in residential listing volumes for the quarter. REA saw improvements in listings as the quarter progressed, with 11% listing volume growth in June, combined with record traffic. The volume growth was partly related to easier year-on-year comparisons which included the impact from the federal election in the prior year. Please refer to REA\u2019s earnings release and their conference call immediately following this call for more details. Move revenues declined 10% to $111 million, with real estate revenues down 5%. However, the decline in real estate revenues was almost entirely due to an estimated $13 million impact related to the customer billing relief initiative. Move is also still being impacted by the transition to the referral model, given the longer time period by which revenues are recognized. Despite the transition, we remain very confident in the long-term growth potential of the referral model, including upside through incremental ancillary services. Similar to REA, we are also seeing record traffic at REALTOR with June achieving 86 million monthly unique users, up 18% year-over-year, combined with a greater than 50% year-on-year increase in core real estate lead volumes in June. Despite the revenue impact from COVID-19 for both the quarter and the full year, Move increased its contribution to segment EBITDA year-on-year, benefiting from the restructuring of the organization, including the integration of the teams at REALTOR and Opcity. Turning to the subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $407 million, down 24% versus $536 million in the prior year, which included a negative 5% impact from FX. The revenue decline was driven by fewer residential subscribers, a reduction in commercial subscribers related to the suspension of billings due to the closing of licensed venues and a decline in advertising revenues. Approximately half of the year-over-year revenue decline in the quarter was due to commercial and advertising revenues, which we believe was mostly a function of the impact from COVID-19. Foxtel\u2019s closing paid subscriber base was approximately 2.8 million as of June 30, down 12%, which reflects the decline in commercial subscribers, which fell to 86,000 from 264,000 in the prior year, primarily associated with COVID-19 restrictions. We expect improvements as licensed commercial venues begin to reopen, although timing is still uncertain given the recent spikes in infections in Victoria. Foxtel Now subscribers were also impacted by a difficult year ago comparison as the prior year benefited from the final season of Game of Thrones, but the number was stable sequentially. Pleasingly, we saw a significant decline in broadcast churn down to 13.2% compared to 14.7% in the prior year, which was the lowest in seven quarters. The improvement was supported by the implementation of several COVID-19 mitigation measures, including opening up content tiers and offer extensions and favorable impacts from a slowdown in Telstra\u2019s NBN migration activity. Broadcast ARPU was relatively stable at AUD 78. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $104 million, up 24% from the prior year, driven by lower costs. Overall expenses declined about $145 million, which includes approximately $70 million of lower sports rights costs, primarily related to the suspension of live sports. Results include 1 month of expense related to the NRL and AFL, and the majority of the deferred sports costs will be recognized in fiscal 2021. I will discuss this further in the outlook commentary. Foxtel also benefited from lower entertainment costs from renegotiated affiliate and output deals, lower transmission costs and lower overheads due to staff reductions. As Robert mentioned, we are pleased with the resilience of Kayo and the early progress and level of engagement for Binge, Foxtel\u2019s new entertainment streaming service. We look forward to building on Foxtel\u2019s expanding OTT subscriber base in the year ahead. During the quarter, Foxtel also accelerated its cost transformation plan for the business, reducing its headcount by approximately 17%. This action, together with other operational efficiencies and content renegotiations will help put Foxtel in a better position longer term. At book publishing, HarperCollins had a strong quarter with revenues down only 3% to $407 million and segment EBITDA up 9% to $47 million despite significant bricks-and-mortar store closures, which was a far better performance than we had anticipated. We saw the strongest digital growth in recent years with total digital sales up 26% to represent 29% of consumer revenues. With the shelter in place orders related to COVID-19, e-book sales returned to robust growth, increasing 31% year-over-year with downloadable audio books also growing at a healthy 17%, despite an initial dip due to the falling individuals commuting to work. As Robert noted, HarperCollins benefited from a strong release slate, which included Joanna Gaines\u2019 Magnolia Table Volume 2 and a great performance from our Children\u2019s division. I would now like to talk about some themes in the upcoming quarter. Forecasting remains challenging, so I will discuss the trends we have seen in July. At Digital Real Estate services, as noted in their release, July new buy listings at REA were up 16%. However, residential revenue growth is expected to be offset by a reduction in development projects, listing declines in Commercial and Asia businesses and the recent government restrictions in Victoria. Please refer to REA\u2019s press release for more details. REALTOR is facing lower industry-wide real estate transactions, but encouragingly, lead volume and unique users remained strong, similar to June. In Subscription Video Services, advertising in July improved modestly with the return of live sports. We expect gradual recovery of commercial subscribers but timing will largely be dictated by government restrictions and the broader impact from COVID-19. Broadcast churn is modestly higher versus the prior year and the fourth quarter. On sports costs, assuming no further disruption of play, we will recognize approximately $55 million or AUD 78 million of additional sports programming rights costs, the majority of which is related to the NRL and AFL rights costs that were deferred from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 due to the temporary sport suspension. However, we expect at least $100 million or AUD 160 million of overall savings, net of the increase in sports cost for the full year in fiscal 2021 as a result of the cost-out initiatives taken during fiscal 2020. At Dow Jones, subscription trends in July continued to be strong with over 25% growth in digital-only subscriptions at The Wall Street Journal. Advertising trends improved modestly in July, but with digital up very strongly. In book publishing, similar to the fourth quarter, HarperCollins continued to see strong growth in online sales in July. Retail stores are slowly reopening, albeit likely at a reduced foot traffic and continued risk from any recurrence of COVID. At News Media, we continue to expect advertising and single copy sales revenues to be adversely affected due to COVID-19. Advertising revenues in July at the newspaper mastheads in the segment declined 25% to 30% in total compared to the prior year. As a reminder, advertising revenues in the prior year included the results from News America Marketing. Overall decline in circulation volumes for July improved from the lows experienced early in the fourth quarter, particularly for the weekend papers. Pleasingly, we have continued to see strong digital subscriber growth at the Australian mastheads and at The Times and The Sunday Times, and we will continue to focus on cost transformation to mitigate the revenue headwinds. CapEx for the year is expected to be approximately $400 million compared to $434 million in fiscal 2020, subject to foreign currency fluctuations. We will be monitoring this number very closely throughout the year and will take necessary actions to reduce this amount as needed. And as a reminder, we have a strong balance sheet with over $1.5 billion of cash and access to a $750 million revolving credit facility. The COVID-19 crisis has presented challenges across all of our businesses, and we are very pleased with the actions that our businesses have taken to ensure they are well positioned to withstand the ongoing volatility as we move through the next 12 months. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Kane Hannan with Goldman Sachs.\nKane Hannan: Robert, Susan, just two for me on the cost program for Foxtel. So just around those $100 million in savings you\u2019re talking to next year. Does that have all of the sports rights savings that you think you can get across the various codes in that number? And are they all confirmed? And then how should we be thinking about the cost of Binge and the launch of some of your OTT platforms into 2021? And then secondly, just around the simplification agenda. Should we be thinking that\u2019s roughly on hold through this crisis? Or how do we think about the next steps from here and things like the Foxtel IPO that you\u2019ve spoken about previously?\nRobert Thomson: It\u2019s Robert here. I\u2019ll take the simplification question first. Simplification is a continuing process, and it must be. As you can see, we\u2019ve appointed a global Head of Digital Real Estate, Tracey Fellows, formerly the Head of REA, and that\u2019s given us a much more focused international approach and intensified the dialogue and sharing between REALTOR and REA. And as you can see, we are constantly reviewing our portfolio. We sold Amplify, the digital education business. We sold our local papers in the U.S. well ahead of the present downturn. We sorted out and simplified the ownership of Foxtel. We sold News America Marketing. We sold Unruly. We\u2019ve closed the print editions of most regional community papers in Australia, and these will actually not be the last changes that we make.\nSusan Panuccio: And Kane, just in relation to the cost program. So the $100 million net number, yes, it does include \u2013 it\u2019s net of the sports cost increase, so that\u2019s approximately $55 million. And so we have factored the savings into that number. And when we think about the OTT cost, in relation to Binge and Kayo, again, that number is net of any investment that we would expect to see within those products. I\u2019m largely, clearly it would be marketing because we scale given we\u2019ve got the content.\nRobert Thomson: But just to complement Susan\u2019s comment. We are indeed pleased with: one, how quickly the subscription growth has picked up at Kayo after the COVID interruption. And secondly, the early numbers for Binge, the entertainment streaming service are particularly encouraging.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Entcho Raykovski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nEntcho Raykovski: I\u2019ve got a couple of as well. The first one is just around the $40 million to $55 million negative COVID impact, which you flagged for the quarter. I just wanted to clarify, does this take into account some of the positive benefits of lower sports rights costs that you\u2019ve seen over the course of the quarter? So it\u2019s basically a net number. Or it\u2019s perhaps a large number, and we need to take those benefits separately into account. Just interested to what extent you can recoup in the future years. And then just secondly, advertising trends over the course of the quarter seem to get slightly worse at Dow Jones. I mean, obviously, very strong performance in the segment as a whole. But if I look at advertising, I think it was tracking at 20% down in April and then down 28% for the quarter, whereas the market improved. So just interested in whether there was anything specific, which might be driving that.\nSusan Panuccio: So just in relation to the first question. So the impact in relation to COVID is net of all the potential costs and revenue impacts that we could see across the business. So yes, it does include the impact from Foxtel. In relation to going forward, clearly, we\u2019ll have a double up of costs for a period of two months in the next financial year in relation to Foxtel for those sport rates, as I\u2019ve outlined. But the overarching and underlying cost base will decrease, notwithstanding that. And we expect to see within sports rights as well as right across the organization. So it\u2019s in relation to the first question. And maybe if you could just repeat the second question. It\u2019s quite lengthy.\nEntcho Raykovski: Yes, sorry. So the second question, money collection loss in April, at the last set of results, you mentioned that revenue was down \u2013 or ad revenue was down 20% in ad fills from Dow Jones. It seems to have gotten a little bit worse, down 28% for the quarter. So it looks like the trends have deteriorated. And if I look at the underlying market, that seems to have actually gotten better. So just wondering whether there is anything specific within Dow Jones which might be driving that.\nRobert Thomson: Entcho, what you saw in particular was the onset of the COVID crisis in May. So May was a tough month, June was better and July better again. And so we are, in particular, seeing strong digital advertising. Clearly, as in many countries around the world, print is affected. But generally speaking, the trend has been positive since May.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.\nAlexia Quadrani: My question actually following up on your comments on digital advertising trends at Dow Jones. It has remarkably outperformed some of your peers. And I\u2019m curious, is it the vertical SKU? Or if there\u2019s any color you can give on why you think you\u2019re relatively doing quite well on the digital advertising front. And then just sort of staying on Dow Jones. Would love to hear more if you can tell us about the strong digital subscriber growth we\u2019re seeing at The Wall Street Journal, how much it you think is driven by the elevated news cycle and sort of what promotional strategies you might have in place.\nRobert Thomson: Alexia, I think it\u2019s fair to say that Dow Jones is a unique media property. It\u2019s clearly got both a consumer business and a professional business, and the two complement each other. And that helps us certainly with subscriptions, but also in terms of contracts with potential advertisers. So \u2013 and in terms of a subscription funnel, we certainly have continuing faith in the growth potential for subscriptions at The Wall Street Journal. And as Susan mentioned, the trend in July has again been positive. And also the Barron\u2019s Group where subs rose 49% in Q4 compared to a year earlier. And what we have in Dow Jones is a continuing funnel of potential clients coming in through MarketWatch, which, as you know, the free financial news site. At MarketWatch in Q4, traffic rose 143%. So a MarketWatch user can easily graduate to be a Wall Street Journal subscriber, who can become a Barron\u2019s subscriber, who can become a subscriber to our high-end financial information intelligence in the professional information division. And it\u2019s really a unique opportunity in that we have a digital daisy chain, and each product in the chain is higher yielding.\nSusan Panuccio: And just in relation to the actual advertising question on what was driving the digital growth. So we actually did see much stronger-than-expected performance in programmatic, largely as a consequence of increased volume, and we had higher display CPMs. And just in relation to, I guess, our competitors, we\u2019re less exposed to luxury entertainment. So we have more dependency on tech, finance, B2C, B2B, and that\u2019s been driving the performance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.\nCraig Huber: My first question, you mentioned \u2013 Susan, you guys took 112-year mastheads at the smaller papers down in Australia, either shut them down or transitioned them to digital. I was just wondering, what percent of revenues did that represent down there in the Australian newspapers? The first question. About 5% to 10%?\nSusan Panuccio: So in relation to Q4, it was about $20 million, impact in Q4, given we closed them down sort of midway through the quarter. We don\u2019t disclose, obviously, the full number of revenue for that, but $20 million should give you a guide.\nCraig Huber: You closed in mid-4Q, okay. And my other question or maybe request. I was very happy to see you guys are breaking out the Dow Jones numbers, the revenues and obviously, the EBITDA here, the detail, obviously, for the fourth quarter and maybe for this year, a year ago, fourth quarter, to the full year as well. I was wondering, would it be possible \u2013 would you seriously consider doing it for all three quarters so we would have it for all eight quarters? And I could sort of estimate it, but it would very helpful if you\u2019re going this far to take one more step here, the last 5%, just put it together for the other three quarters and they put out an 8-K or something. Is that fair to ask you?\nSusan Panuccio: Craig, I think we\u2019re going to have an Investor Day in September, which Robert mentioned. And so we\u2019ll certainly be able to do that at the Investor Day for you.\nOperator: Fraser McLeish from MST Marquee has our next question.\nFraser McLeish: Great. Just a very basic one for you just for Susan, if that\u2019s okay. Just on the Binge subscriber numbers, Susan, I would imagine numbers at Telstra is quite important for driving those. Are you just able to confirm whether anything with Telstra is going into paid subscriber or as a non-paid subscriber in those August Q4 numbers you\u2019ve disclosed?\nSusan Panuccio: If Telstra are providing the sales channel, yes, we do include those numbers within the Binge numbers, yes. So yes, I can confirm that.\nFraser McLeish: Would that come as a paying \u2013 into what you\u2019re calling a paying subscriber?\nSusan Panuccio: Correct. Correct.\nOperator: Our question comes from Alan Gould from Loop Capital.\nAlan Gould: Robert, I noticed that The New York Times dropped Apple News. I was wondering if you can help us frame of how we should think about how big the opportunity could be of getting paid premium payments for premium content?\nRobert Thomson: Yes. It\u2019s a really good question. For us, it\u2019s been a beneficial experience. And if you look at the Wall Street Journal, it\u2019s really two papers in one, both a general news service and business-specific news service. In that sense, there are a lot of potential readers and potential subscribers out there who don\u2019t understand the quality of the general news coverage, the politics, the economics, the arts, the lifestyle, the weekend section, the magazine. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a regular reader. You understand what I\u2019m talking about. And so that Apple News partnership allows us to focus on that tier of content and bring in a significantly new audience that we would hope to graduate to a paid WSJ subscription over time. And it is a genuinely different audience. It\u2019s actually, of late, more women than men. For the Wall Street Journal itself, it\u2019s more men than women. It\u2019s a younger demographic. And it is obviously a source of potential subscribers for us.\nAlan Gould: Yes. If I can just follow up. When we think of just broader than just Apple, when we look at the whole digital universe and getting paid premium \u2013 getting paid for your premium content, how should we frame that? How should we be thinking about what the potential is there?\nRobert Thomson: Well, one way of framing it would be to think of it as the contemporary equivalent of carriage fees or retrans for all broadcasters. Because there\u2019s no doubt that these deals will add up. What\u2019s public is the deal we have with Facebook, the deal we have with Apple. And of course, this is paying for content. And much of that money drops to the bottom line. And it\u2019s also fair to say that negotiations are going on with other companies and other regions. I can\u2019t go into detail at the moment because we\u2019re in the midst of them. But when you combine these deals, they are having a significant impact on our revenue and on our profitability. And it\u2019s frankly true for all media companies. So if any executives of other media companies would like to send News Corp a commission check, we\u2019d be happy to receive it. That, too, may be a source of revenue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Han from Morningstar.\nBrian Han: Just a quick question. The newspapers in the News Media division, did they fall into losses this June quarter because of the virus? Or were they loss-making even before then?\nSusan Panuccio: No, it was because of the COVID impact for the quarter. Clearly, a very disruptive quarter for that segment.\nRobert Thomson: And also, Brian, don\u2019t forget, you\u2019ve got the NAM numbers taken out. So it\u2019s not a like-for-like comparison. What I would say is that, essentially, the breaking out of Dow Jones is doing two things. It is providing more scrutiny generally for each of those segments, Dow Jones and News media. And scrutiny has to be a good thing. Because we are very confident that our news media executives will continue the transition to digital, which they are certainly on the pathway to doing. And sorts of deals that we\u2019ve been discussing today are of themselves helpful. And then Dow Jones, Dow Jones is a uniquely undervalued property in what I would argue is a uniquely undervalued News Corp.\nSusan Panuccio: I think maybe just to add just some further context. So if you look even at the year-on-year decline, which we\u2019re talking about, the sort of the $95 million movement, probably 75% of that comes from NAM and the closure of the regional communities or the suspension of the mastheads down there. So actually a really big bulk of that number. Does come from that. And then clearly, you\u2019ve got the impact of advertising and print circulation on that, which we will expect to pick up as we move through the coming year.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Andrew Levy from Macquarie.\nAndrew Levy: If I could sneak in three. The first one is, Robert, I\u2019d just be interested in your thoughts on the digital platforms review in Australia, and particularly on the structure of the News Media bargaining code, if that\u2019s a structure that News is supportive of and works for you guys in its current form. The second was also you made a reference to licensing news media content globally. Is that a discussion around extracting dollars from the digital platforms? Or is there a broader sort of mandate or avenues that you think you can license from the news media content. Any thoughts would be helpful on that one. And the third one, Susan, just sorry to come back to it, but just on the COVID impacts on the quarter, if I wrote it down correctly, you\u2019re saying $330 million revenues and $40 million to $50 million of EBITDA. And obviously, a large chunk of the cost impacts of COVID are the sporting rights. So I was wondering if you could give us some color on what else is in the cost offsets for the period and how we should think about outside of sports, which you\u2019ve obviously discussed, what\u2019s sustainable? Or what sort of bounces back into the cost base in 2021?\nRobert Thomson: I\u2019ll talk about the Australian regulations or the draft mandatory code of conduct, which is particularly important. It\u2019s important in two ways. One, for what it defines in terms of remedies and in particular, for what it defines in terms as an industry. But it\u2019s also part of a global discussion, whether it be the consideration in Brussels, the hearings here last week in Congress with the big four digital heads giving testimony, and in London. And so what you\u2019re seeing, and this is crucial, is the increase in content consciousness among regulators around the world. These are no longer mystifying issues. The issues have been clearly defined. And you saw that in Congress last week. And you see that in the ACCC Report, the original digital report, and now the draft mandatory code of conduct, which I think is quite a moment of itself, a real Internet inflection point. And this \u2013 essentially, we are talking about carriage fees or retrans payments for premium journalism. And there are obviously more deals to come. Now some of those deals will be outside Australia. But I suspect, in some ways, influenced by Australian regulatory thinking. But I can assure you that not only regulators but media companies around the world and the digital platforms are watching Australia closely. Now we\u2019ve obviously been fighting this fight for well over a decade. And the News Corp Board has supported the quest because it was absolutely crucial to the future of journalism. Newspapers delivered in whatever format are vital to a well-informed society. And what\u2019s obvious is the collective understanding of issues is past the point of no return, the point of no action, shall we say. But there are obviously regulatory changes to come in Australia. And the commercial landscape is not yet fully formed, but it will be a landscape far more hospitable to journalism and to News Media and to News Corp. Now as for your a question about the licensing of content. Clearly, we\u2019re always looking for opportunities to monetize our content. But in a digital context, we have a unique comparative advantage with global properties, which often write about similar subjects. So not only in licensing in a traditional subscription sense, but think a little bit about the segmentation of digital products, products around sport, products around lifestyle, around food, around puzzles even. So it\u2019s a real opportunity for us to divide up our content in a different way, monetize that content and provide compelling digital opportunities for potential subscribers at different price points for different content sets.\nSusan Panuccio: I\u2019ll just jump in on the cost side. So if I have a look at the expenses for the quarter on an adjusted basis, they were down $273 million or 14%. So the bulk of that reduction between reported and adjusted was due to NAM and FX. The COVID impact we\u2019re predicting in about $270 million odd, $280 odd million in order to get you to that EBITDA impact. We were expecting costs to increase slightly for the quarter because we did have increased revenue at Dow Jones and HarperCollins and some of our businesses. And what I would say in relation to the COVID impact cost is, clearly, there\u2019s a lot that are related to volume, so particularly on our mastheads around the globe. And we would expect to see those scale obviously, as those businesses scale back up. But we have also reduced headcount by 7% across the business, excluding NAM and Unruly, and that\u2019s savings that we would certainly expect to continue into the next year. We\u2019ve made significant cuts on marketing. We clearly will have a look at what we think is an appropriate level for marketing going forward, and it may never be back to the level that we had pre COVID. Likewise, with most companies, we\u2019ve got a lot of cost cuts coming through on TNE and other discretionary spend, which, again, when we think forward, we will review exactly what we think we need as a business in order to continue spending within that area. We\u2019ve clearly got compensation cost reductions as well as a result of lower bonuses. And outside of the OpEx impact, we\u2019ve got the cuts that came through in CapEx. I think I mentioned that we\u2019ve cut that by third year-on-year. So clearly, as we move forward into next year, it\u2019s difficult to predict exactly that cost base is going to look like because it will all depend on the revenue trends. But we are confident that there\u2019s a significant amount of reoccurring costs that will go into next year from a cost reduction perspective. And we do actually believe that we can continue to take costs out, as we\u2019ve mentioned.\nRobert Thomson: Thank you, Andrew. Thank you, Nicole, and thank you all for participating. We look forward to speaking with you soon. Have a great day. Take care.\nOperator: And once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference. We appreciate your participation today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Susan Panuccio",
            "content": "Thank you, Robert. Before talking through our fiscal 20 results, I would like to recap on the actions we've taken this past year to better position News Corp for long-term success with a focus on increasing shareholder value and transparency. Firstly, the company has taken significant action on our cost base. Our publishing business in Australia has been significantly restructured with 112 of our regional and community markets transitioning to digital or closed. The cost base at Foxtel has been restructured with savings across programming and support functions. With increasing OTT scale and a lower cost base, Foxtel is better positioned for success, and I would like to reiterate that we have no plans to provide additional funding. Our digital real estate businesses have also been proactive in reducing headcount to confront the challenges of COVID-19. In addition, we took quick and decisive action to reduce OpEx and CapEx in the fourth quarter with CapEx reducing by 1/3 year-on-year and total costs decreasing 21% year-on-year, partially due to divestments in FX, but primarily due to active cost management. We are also close to finalizing our savings opportunities for global shared services across the company as we look to leverage our global scale and reduce duplication. These collective actions resulted in a 7% reduction in headcount this year across the businesses, excluding the NAM and Unruly sales. Secondly, Dow Jones results are now reported as a separate segment, which better highlights its performance and provides a more complete comparison with its peers. The business saw record subscriptions and achieved growth in both revenue and EBITDA for the year. Thirdly, we are taking tangible steps to stabilize our newly formed News Media segment through digital subscriber growth, cover price increases and aggressive cost targets, which will be further enhanced by our global shared service initiative. In relation to liquidity, the only debt exposures we have are at our non 100% owned subsidiaries, Foxtel and REA, and these are non-recourse to News Corp. Finally, as part of our simplification efforts, we continue to reshape News Corp's portfolio this year with the divestments of News America Marketing and Unruly. With that as a backdrop, I will now discuss our latest financial results. Fiscal 2020 fourth quarter total revenues were approximately $1.9 billion, down 22% versus the prior year, reflecting the impacts of COVID-19 and the divestment of News America Marketing in early May. Total segment EBITDA was $195 million, down 28% versus the prior year. Excluding the divestment of NAM, acquisitions, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, adjusted revenues fell 13% and adjusted total segment EBITDA decreased 10% as growth in segment EBITDA at the Dow Jones, book Publishing and subscription video services segments were outweighed by the negative impact of COVID-19. Our best estimate for the revenue impact of COVID-19 for the quarter was negative $330 million or 13%, together with a negative impact on total segment EBITDA estimated to be between $40 million to $55 million or 15% to 20%. For the quarter, we reported a net loss per share of $0.67 as compared to a net loss per share of $0.09 in the prior year. The loss includes $292 million of non-cash impairment charges primarily related to fixed assets in the UK and Australia. Adjusted earnings per share were negative $0.03 in the quarter compared to positive $0.07 in the prior year. Moving on to the quarterly results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Dow Jones. Revenues for the quarter were $381 million, down 4% compared to the prior year, with digital revenues accounting for a record 71% of total revenues this quarter. Circulation revenues rose 2% due to robust growth in digital circulation revenues, partially offset by lower print circulation revenues, which were impacted by the decline in newsstand sales and fewer amenity copies primarily related to COVID-19. As Robert mentioned, Dow Jones again achieved record subscriptions in the quarter and saw an acceleration in year-over-year growth compared to the prior quarter. Dow Jones average subscriptions for the quarter were almost 3.8 million, up 15% from the prior year. And of that, digital-only subscriptions were 2.8 million, up 28% year-over-year. For the Wall Street Journal, there were approximately 3 million total subscriptions for the quarter, up 15% from the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions growing 23% to more than 2.2 million, improving from the 15% year-over-year growth rate in the prior quarter. To frame the improvement, we added 203,000 Wall Street Journal digital-only subscriptions this quarter compared to 112,000 in the third quarter and 43,000 in the prior year. Revenues from Dow Jones Professional Information business rose 6% year-over-year, slightly higher than the third quarter rate, driven by 14% revenue growth at Risk & Compliance. Consistent with our expectations, Risk & Compliance revenues reached approximately $160 million for fiscal 2020. As we mentioned last quarter, advertising revenues, which accounted for only 19% of revenues this quarter were impacted by COVID-19 and declined 28% to $71 million. For the first time, digital advertising revenue was greater than print, accounting for 54% of total advertising revenues for the quarter. Digital advertising revenues fell 7%, helped by strong growth in programmatic while print advertising was down 43%, which included the impact from the cancellation of live events. Total unique visitors across our Dow Jones Digital platforms more than doubled in the quarter versus the prior year. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 13% to $60 million. Turning to our other news segment, News Media, which primarily includes News Australia, News UK and the New York Post and the News America Marketing and Unruly companies prior to their disposal. Revenues for the quarter were $490 million, down 41% versus the prior year, of which the impact from the divestment of News America Marketing accounted for over half of the total revenue decline. On an adjusted basis, which excludes NAM, Unruly and the other items mentioned in our release, revenues declined 22%. Advertising revenue fell 58% on a reported basis, of which $179 million or 36% of the decline was from the sale of News America Marketing, and the rest of the decline was driven by the negative impact from COVID-19, weaknesses in the print advertising market and a $20 million or 4% negative impact related to the suspension of certain community titles in Australia. Advertising revenues at News UK fell 46% on a reported basis and 45% in local currency, relatively consistent with our April commentary, with lower print trends, partially offset by strong digital advertising growth at The Sun. Performance was similar in Australia, with advertising down 46% on a reported basis and 42% in local currency, which includes the negative impact related to the suspension of certain community titles. Circulation and subscription revenues declined 9%, impacted by lower news stand sales related to COVID-19, partially offset by strong digital paid subscriber growth and cover price increases in Australia. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was a loss of $44 million, down $95 million from the prior year. The divestment of News America Marketing accounted for $43 million of the year-over-year decline. Also included in the results are approximately $8 million of additional cost related to the decommissioning of print operations in Australia. It is important to note that we do not expect this to be the new normal, and we are taking significant and decisive steps to improve the trajectory of the segment, including better monetizing our growing and global audience and further cost reductions. These include leveraging existing content to source incremental licensing revenues. We believe that we are very well positioned to benefit from incremental licensing revenues as early as this fiscal year, which should have a meaningful impact on EBITDA. Our biggest source of revenues in the News Media segment is now circulation and subscription. We expect continued growth in our digital subscriptions, and we will be looking at cover and subscription prices to help offset print advertising declines. Our global shared service initiative, which we expect to centralize many of our back-office functions and remove duplication. We'll also continue to work on newsroom transformation and the ongoing review of our printing sites and office space. We have reduced our total headcount within the segment by 12% in fiscal 2020, which will lower our cost base going forward, and we expect additional reductions in fiscal 2021. The impact of COVID-19 remains uncertain, and we do expect continued advertising challenges. However, we will continue to focus on the digital transformation of this segment, new ways to monetize our content and continue to take aggressive cost measures as we look to provide a more stable outlook. At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues decreased 16% to $238 million, primarily due to a decline in listings in Australia and the U.S. related to COVID-19 and associated customer support measures. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 13%. Segment EBITDA fell 10% to $71 million or 5% on an adjusted basis. REA Group revenues fell 21%, primarily reflecting FX, lower developer revenues and a 14% decline in residential listing volumes for the quarter. REA saw improvements in listings as the quarter progressed, with 11% listing volume growth in June, combined with record traffic. The volume growth was partly related to easier year-on-year comparisons which included the impact from the federal election in the prior year. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call immediately following this call for more details. Move revenues declined 10% to $111 million, with real estate revenues down 5%. However, the decline in real estate revenues was almost entirely due to an estimated $13 million impact related to the customer billing relief initiative. Move is also still being impacted by the transition to the referral model, given the longer time period by which revenues are recognized. Despite the transition, we remain very confident in the long-term growth potential of the referral model, including upside through incremental ancillary services. Similar to REA, we are also seeing record traffic at REALTOR with June achieving 86 million monthly unique users, up 18% year-over-year, combined with a greater than 50% year-on-year increase in core real estate lead volumes in June. Despite the revenue impact from COVID-19 for both the quarter and the full year, Move increased its contribution to segment EBITDA year-on-year, benefiting from the restructuring of the organization, including the integration of the teams at REALTOR and Opcity. Turning to the subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $407 million, down 24% versus $536 million in the prior year, which included a negative 5% impact from FX. The revenue decline was driven by fewer residential subscribers, a reduction in commercial subscribers related to the suspension of billings due to the closing of licensed venues and a decline in advertising revenues. Approximately half of the year-over-year revenue decline in the quarter was due to commercial and advertising revenues, which we believe was mostly a function of the impact from COVID-19. Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base was approximately 2.8 million as of June 30, down 12%, which reflects the decline in commercial subscribers, which fell to 86,000 from 264,000 in the prior year, primarily associated with COVID-19 restrictions. We expect improvements as licensed commercial venues begin to reopen, although timing is still uncertain given the recent spikes in infections in Victoria. Foxtel Now subscribers were also impacted by a difficult year ago comparison as the prior year benefited from the final season of Game of Thrones, but the number was stable sequentially. Pleasingly, we saw a significant decline in broadcast churn down to 13.2% compared to 14.7% in the prior year, which was the lowest in seven quarters. The improvement was supported by the implementation of several COVID-19 mitigation measures, including opening up content tiers and offer extensions and favorable impacts from a slowdown in Telstra's NBN migration activity. Broadcast ARPU was relatively stable at AUD 78. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $104 million, up 24% from the prior year, driven by lower costs. Overall expenses declined about $145 million, which includes approximately $70 million of lower sports rights costs, primarily related to the suspension of live sports. Results include 1 month of expense related to the NRL and AFL, and the majority of the deferred sports costs will be recognized in fiscal 2021. I will discuss this further in the outlook commentary. Foxtel also benefited from lower entertainment costs from renegotiated affiliate and output deals, lower transmission costs and lower overheads due to staff reductions. As Robert mentioned, we are pleased with the resilience of Kayo and the early progress and level of engagement for Binge, Foxtel's new entertainment streaming service. We look forward to building on Foxtel's expanding OTT subscriber base in the year ahead. During the quarter, Foxtel also accelerated its cost transformation plan for the business, reducing its headcount by approximately 17%. This action, together with other operational efficiencies and content renegotiations will help put Foxtel in a better position longer term. At book publishing, HarperCollins had a strong quarter with revenues down only 3% to $407 million and segment EBITDA up 9% to $47 million despite significant bricks-and-mortar store closures, which was a far better performance than we had anticipated. We saw the strongest digital growth in recent years with total digital sales up 26% to represent 29% of consumer revenues. With the shelter in place orders related to COVID-19, e-book sales returned to robust growth, increasing 31% year-over-year with downloadable audio books also growing at a healthy 17%, despite an initial dip due to the falling individuals commuting to work. As Robert noted, HarperCollins benefited from a strong release slate, which included Joanna Gaines' Magnolia Table Volume 2 and a great performance from our Children's division. I would now like to talk about some themes in the upcoming quarter. Forecasting remains challenging, so I will discuss the trends we have seen in July. At Digital Real Estate services, as noted in their release, July new buy listings at REA were up 16%. However, residential revenue growth is expected to be offset by a reduction in development projects, listing declines in Commercial and Asia businesses and the recent government restrictions in Victoria. Please refer to REA's press release for more details. REALTOR is facing lower industry-wide real estate transactions, but encouragingly, lead volume and unique users remained strong, similar to June. In Subscription Video Services, advertising in July improved modestly with the return of live sports. We expect gradual recovery of commercial subscribers but timing will largely be dictated by government restrictions and the broader impact from COVID-19. Broadcast churn is modestly higher versus the prior year and the fourth quarter. On sports costs, assuming no further disruption of play, we will recognize approximately $55 million or AUD 78 million of additional sports programming rights costs, the majority of which is related to the NRL and AFL rights costs that were deferred from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 due to the temporary sport suspension. However, we expect at least $100 million or AUD 160 million of overall savings, net of the increase in sports cost for the full year in fiscal 2021 as a result of the cost-out initiatives taken during fiscal 2020. At Dow Jones, subscription trends in July continued to be strong with over 25% growth in digital-only subscriptions at The Wall Street Journal. Advertising trends improved modestly in July, but with digital up very strongly. In book publishing, similar to the fourth quarter, HarperCollins continued to see strong growth in online sales in July. Retail stores are slowly reopening, albeit likely at a reduced foot traffic and continued risk from any recurrence of COVID. At News Media, we continue to expect advertising and single copy sales revenues to be adversely affected due to COVID-19. Advertising revenues in July at the newspaper mastheads in the segment declined 25% to 30% in total compared to the prior year. As a reminder, advertising revenues in the prior year included the results from News America Marketing. Overall decline in circulation volumes for July improved from the lows experienced early in the fourth quarter, particularly for the weekend papers. Pleasingly, we have continued to see strong digital subscriber growth at the Australian mastheads and at The Times and The Sunday Times, and we will continue to focus on cost transformation to mitigate the revenue headwinds. CapEx for the year is expected to be approximately $400 million compared to $434 million in fiscal 2020, subject to foreign currency fluctuations. We will be monitoring this number very closely throughout the year and will take necessary actions to reduce this amount as needed. And as a reminder, we have a strong balance sheet with over $1.5 billion of cash and access to a $750 million revolving credit facility. The COVID-19 crisis has presented challenges across all of our businesses, and we are very pleased with the actions that our businesses have taken to ensure they are well positioned to withstand the ongoing volatility as we move through the next 12 months. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A. And Kane, just in relation to the cost program. So the $100 million net number, yes, it does include \u2013 it's net of the sports cost increase, so that's approximately $55 million. And so we have factored the savings into that number. And when we think about the OTT cost, in relation to Binge and Kayo, again, that number is net of any investment that we would expect to see within those products. I'm largely, clearly it would be marketing because we scale given we've got the content. So just in relation to the first question. So the impact in relation to COVID is net of all the potential costs and revenue impacts that we could see across the business. So yes, it does include the impact from Foxtel. In relation to going forward, clearly, we'll have a double up of costs for a period of two months in the next financial year in relation to Foxtel for those sport rates, as I've outlined. But the overarching and underlying cost base will decrease, notwithstanding that. And we expect to see within sports rights as well as right across the organization. So it's in relation to the first question. And maybe if you could just repeat the second question. It's quite lengthy. And just in relation to the actual advertising question on what was driving the digital growth. So we actually did see much stronger-than-expected performance in programmatic, largely as a consequence of increased volume, and we had higher display CPMs. And just in relation to, I guess, our competitors, we're less exposed to luxury entertainment. So we have more dependency on tech, finance, B2C, B2B, and that's been driving the performance. So in relation to Q4, it was about $20 million, impact in Q4, given we closed them down sort of midway through the quarter. We don't disclose, obviously, the full number of revenue for that, but $20 million should give you a guide. Craig, I think we're going to have an Investor Day in September, which Robert mentioned. And so we'll certainly be able to do that at the Investor Day for you. If Telstra are providing the sales channel, yes, we do include those numbers within the Binge numbers, yes. So yes, I can confirm that. Correct. Correct. No, it was because of the COVID impact for the quarter. Clearly, a very disruptive quarter for that segment. I think maybe just to add just some further context. So if you look even at the year-on-year decline, which we're talking about, the sort of the $95 million movement, probably 75% of that comes from NAM and the closure of the regional communities or the suspension of the mastheads down there. So actually a really big bulk of that number. Does come from that. And then clearly, you've got the impact of advertising and print circulation on that, which we will expect to pick up as we move through the coming year. I'll just jump in on the cost side. So if I have a look at the expenses for the quarter on an adjusted basis, they were down $273 million or 14%. So the bulk of that reduction between reported and adjusted was due to NAM and FX. The COVID impact we're predicting in about $270 million odd, $280 odd million in order to get you to that EBITDA impact. We were expecting costs to increase slightly for the quarter because we did have increased revenue at Dow Jones and HarperCollins and some of our businesses. And what I would say in relation to the COVID impact cost is, clearly, there's a lot that are related to volume, so particularly on our mastheads around the globe. And we would expect to see those scale obviously, as those businesses scale back up. But we have also reduced headcount by 7% across the business, excluding NAM and Unruly, and that's savings that we would certainly expect to continue into the next year. We've made significant cuts on marketing. We clearly will have a look at what we think is an appropriate level for marketing going forward, and it may never be back to the level that we had pre COVID. Likewise, with most companies, we've got a lot of cost cuts coming through on TNE and other discretionary spend, which, again, when we think forward, we will review exactly what we think we need as a business in order to continue spending within that area. We've clearly got compensation cost reductions as well as a result of lower bonuses. And outside of the OpEx impact, we've got the cuts that came through in CapEx. I think I mentioned that we've cut that by third year-on-year. So clearly, as we move forward into next year, it's difficult to predict exactly that cost base is going to look like because it will all depend on the revenue trends. But we are confident that there's a significant amount of reoccurring costs that will go into next year from a cost reduction perspective. And we do actually believe that we can continue to take costs out, as we've mentioned."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Robert Thomson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Let me say initially that I trust all on the call and your families are faring well. These are certainly complex times, and there are few who have not been touched in some manner. The coronavirus has irrevocably changed businesses and our businesses in expediting pre-existing digital trends, in challenging established practices and in prompting necessary introspection about work habits and the workplace itself. There has been much agility and adaptation at News Corp. The vast majority of our employees across the world have been working at home, and the resilience of the company's culture has been a core component in continuity. Without doubt, digitization has accelerated. And without doubt, all of our businesses have been affected and responded with customary ingenuity. I would like to express my sincere thanks to each of our employees and their families for having responded so promptly, so intelligently and so thoughtfully to these testing circumstances. Evidence of that response was seen in the fourth quarter, when virtually all of our businesses prudently reduced costs, sometimes painfully to ensure that they were robust enough to cope with volatility and disruption. Preserving cash was a priority, and it is worth noting that our cash balance increased in the last quarter by $129 million to over $1.5 billion as of June 30. Revenue comparisons are obviously made complex by the sale of News America Marketing and Unruly, plus the consequences of COVID. But our adjusted revenue for the quarter declined by 13%. Obviously, the net income and EPS were affected by non-cash impairments, primarily at our UK and Australian businesses. And Susan will be able to provide more details momentarily. However, our adjusted total segment EBITDA declined by a modest 10%. This is particularly significant and a somewhat historic earnings call. Regular listeners will recall that we had pledged to simplify the company and make the results more transparent. The sale of News America Marketing and Unruly certainly simplified the structure. And in the quest for transparency, beginning this quarter, we are presenting Dow Jones as a separate segment. This will highlight what we believe are two incontrovertible facts: the substantial and growing value of that company and its superior profit profile and prospects to those in the New York Times. In what has been a difficult year for many media companies, Dow Jones reported a 13% increase in segment EBITDA based on the strength of its professional information business and the preeminence of the Wall Street Journal. Our other global mastheads and digital information properties are gathered in the News Media segment, which will include our Australian titles, many of which are now digital-only: The Times, The Sun and Sunday Times as well as Talksport and Virgin Radio. It may be called News Media, but obviously, the segment is increasingly digital in personality, and virtually all of our mastheads had record audiences during the year. Our journalists have performed admirably in providing crucial insights to readers during the COVID crisis, delivering accurate information and analysis and providing an antidote to conspiracy theories and noxious nonsense proliferating elsewhere on the web. We are continuing to focus on acquiring digital subscribers and audience while rightsizing our businesses to be digital-first, which is necessarily resulting in significant cost reductions. The closure in Australia of many of our storied print editions and the emphasis on digital was further evidence of our willingness to be decisive at an epochal moment. We are very proud of our traditions, and we will always invest in the very best journalism. But the format is less important than the function. And we firmly believe that the digital reincarnation of these titles will ensure a profitable future and a continuing role in their community. We are also constantly restlessly reviewing our portfolio with a view to ensuring that we have the optimum asset mix. All of our executives understand that these are testing times and many of our executives around our businesses internationally have volunteered hefty cuts to their bonuses, which form a large part of their compensation. The Executive Chairman has forsaken 100% of his bonus, and Susan Panuccio and David Pitofsky, our General Counsel, who are with me on this call have also voluntarily given up a meaningful chunk of their bonus. All understand the importance of a stringent cost strategy, so we have launched a genuinely meaningful shared service program that we believe will transform the company by centralizing many of our functions. The mission is being led by two of our most talented executives, Damian Eales from Australia and Jane Viner from the UK, in tandem with our CTO, the Global Head of HR, and CFO, in other words, Susan. The early indications are that the shared service program should be able to appreciably reduce our costs and we expect it to have a materially positive impact on our bottom line. We will always emphasize integrity and creativity, but our ability to prioritize imperative projects will be enhanced by the program. We expect our technology platforms to be the best-in-class at the lowest available price. And the overall level of cooperation coordination among our businesses will certainly be enhanced. This is not an ephemeral project, but one that we believe will have a fundamental impact on the way we do business and on our earnings. One other trend is already having an appreciable impact on our earnings, the change in terms of trade with the digital platforms. Those of you who watched the congressional testimony last week by the tech titans would have noticed overall that the political understanding of the issues has vastly improved. That is also true in Brussels, London and Australia, where the ACCC has just introduced a draft mandatory code of contact. I recommend that anyone seeking enlightenment, Google the name Rod Sims and read a few of his recent interviews. Mr. Sims chairs the ACCC. It is fair to say, without revealing details that we are deep in discussion with these companies and that the ecosystem has absolutely begun to evolve. For News Corp, which has been pursuing this issue for well over a decade, this favorable outcome would simply not have been possible without the leadership of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and the support of a board which backed advocacy even when News Corp often stood alone in pursuit of the principle of a premium for premium content. Now for the numbers. At the new Dow Jones segment, revenues improved in fiscal year 2020 and profitability was up 13%, as I've mentioned. At $236 million, Dow Jones full segment \u2013 full year segment EBITDA was the highest in separation, as were margins. Digital revenue surpassed $1 billion in fiscal 2020 for the first time and represented 66% of total revenues, rising to 70% for the fourth quarter. We saw strong circulation volume growth, with digital-only subscriptions increasing 23% year-over-year for the Wall Street Journal in Q4 and 51% for the Barron's Group. MarketWatch, our finance website reported the highest annual revenue numbers in the brand's history, making it the third year in a row of record-breaking results. Equally impressive, unique users more than doubled to $62 million in the month of June. In contrast to most COVID affected media sites, digital advertising was down only 7% in the quarter and the general shift towards digital as a source of revenue continues, with that segment representing 54% of advertising revenues in the quarter. We expect that digital will continue to outpace print, given we are seeing robust digital advertising despite the social and commercial volatility that has prompted many companies to be cautious in marketing spend. Even with the pandemic impact, digital advertising at Dow Jones was 4% higher for the year. Full year revenues for the professional information business rose 7% year-over-year, driven by Risk & Compliance, which surged 20%. We remain particularly excited by the prospects for our Risk & Compliance business, given the intensification of regulatory scrutiny around the world. As we have noted on this call in the past, who among you does not want to minimize risk and maximize compliance? We are expanding our risk-related product lines, enhancing our software and ensuring that the increased flow of actionable intelligence is complemented by thoughtful analysis and compelling news feeds for our growing audience of clients. We contend that the all digital Risk & Compliance business is a highly undervalued part of a highly undervalued company, given the revenue trajectory, the still expanding market and the necessity for companies and individuals to have an audit trial of compliance. The creation of the Dow Jones segment allows us to make a direct comparison with The New York Times, and on most important measures, the Wall Street Journal and the Board of Dow Jones performed far better. The Journal is both the most trusted general newspaper in the U.S. according to Reuters Institute and the world's leading business use provider. And a vast, well-healed, well-informed audience provides an opportunity to upsell value-added lucrative business products to serve a specialist need. Here are a few metrics comparing the two companies for the quarter. Dow Jones segment EBITDA of $60 million was higher than in New York Times, having benefited from the stability of our vibrant professional information business. While Dow Jones segment EBITDA expanded by 13% year-over-year, New York Times declined by 6%. Dow Jones EBITDA margins were 15.7%, about 3 percentage points higher than the New York Times. In this time of COVID, Dow Jones revenue decline moderated at a higher rate than the New York times at 4% versus down over 7% for The Times. Dow Jones COVID-affected advertising revenue declined at a much lower rate than The Times, thanks largely to significant outperformance in digital advertising which was down just 7% at Dow Jones versus down 32% at The New York Times. In fact, Dow Jones generated more total ad dollars than The New York Times. We feel strongly that we should explain the virtues of Dow Jones to shareholders and potential shareholders so we will have an Investor Day in mid-September at which Dow Jones Chief Executive, Almar Latour, and other Dow Jones Executives and myself, will give you a more granular explanation of the company's extraordinary potential and an opportunity for you to interrogate. The News Media segment, of course, had a challenging year, and we took prompt measures to confront those challenges. These included the aforementioned sales of NAM and Unruly as well as immediate cost reductions and the launch of strategic shared service project. In Australia, apart from migrating publications to digital only, we also sold our investment in the Australian associated press newswire and unfortunately, implemented hundreds of redundancies. The end of the relationship with AAP was both necessary and historic as the service was founded in 1935 by Sir Keith Murdoch. Digital subscriptions across News Corp Australia rose 25% to nearly 650,000 by the end of the fiscal year. Meanwhile, at News UK, The Times and The Sunday Times paid subscribers rose to 336,000, an increase of 11% year-over-year and benefited from a focus on attracting premium subscribers with a concomitant improvement in retention rates. The Sun's online audience expanded markedly during the year, including with the launch of a U.S. edition. In toto, The Sun reported 133 million unique users globally in June for 1 month, which also reflects our expansion in the U.S. Importantly, The Sun remains as the leading news brand in the UK according to Pamco. The sheer scale of our collective reach should not be underestimated. In the U.S., The New York Post digital network reached 177 million monthly unique users during the fourth quarter. It has long been known that The Post has been loss-making, but those losses have fallen dramatically in the past 18 months as we increased cover prices and benefited from ad revenue for our expanding digital readership and reduced the cost base. We can now see a clear path to profitability for The Post. In book publishing, despite the viral vicissitudes, which included the near shutdown of U.S. physical stores, profitability was up in Q4. This is a testament to the resourcefulness of the team at HarperCollins, which moved quickly to bolster supply chains and emphasize e-books and online sales. These actions allowed us to make the most of changes in reading behavior during the pandemic. As we had indicated on previous calls, the second half of the fiscal year at HarperCollins was more propitious than the first half, with segment EBITDA improvement in both Q3 and Q4. Among the titles that performed well were the latest installment of Joanna Gaines' highly successful Magnolia Table series, Dutch House by Ann Patchett, The One and Only Bob by Katherine Applegate and World's Worst Parents by David Williams. Looking ahead to fiscal 2021, we're already eagerly anticipating the release of Tiger Woods' autobiography, and expect strong results from the upcoming launch of Jenna Bush Hager's, Everything Beautiful in Its Time. We're certainly pleased by the early performance of Daniel Silver's, The Order and Ben Shapiro's, How to Destroy America in three Easy Steps, and we expect much from Lebron James' first children's book, I Promise, scheduled for release next Tuesday. In digital real estate services, REA's traffic and lead volume have rebounded in the wake of the shutdown in Australia, with record audiences in June and a dramatic increase in users potentially interested in a house move. There is simply no doubt that the COVID crisis has prompted many families to consider their housing circumstances, and that ultra-low interest rates have made a move more possible. We noted similar trends in the U.S. at realtor.com, and we saw a significant improvement in profitability at Move, which runs the realtor.com site in the fourth quarter and for the year as a whole. The new leadership team at Move is working closely with the Dow Jones' executive team as the combined audience and lucrative demographic of the two sites in the U.S. is a hefty $124 million based on comScore statistics as of June. We are confident that the Dow Jones sites will provide a flow of potential buyers for realtor.com and that realtor.com will provide a flow of potential subscriptions for the WSJ and Barron's. Also in Australia, at Foxtel, our emphasis on streaming has brought a leap in new customers for both Kayo, the sports streaming service, and Binge, our entertainment offering, which has just launched. As of August 4, Kayo, showing great resilience, had 590,000 subscribers, including 48,000 trialists, while Binge had 217,000 subscribers, which includes 185,000 paying, just a short time after its formal launch. Both services are making the most of our existing rights without incurring extra content expenses and are certainly expanding the reach of Foxtel, which has now approached a new record number of total subscribers following an acceleration in July. Just this week, we crossed the 1 million OTT paying subscriber mark, setting a new record, thanks to our expanded streaming strategy. While there is certainly seasonality to Kayo, given the scheduling of the popular winter sports, we are reassured that so many subscribers have returned to the service so promptly and particularly encouraged by the early rush of subscribers at Binge. Our past acquisition of cricket rights means that we are well positioned when the Indian cricket teams arrive in Australia later this year. On our last call, you will recall that I insisted that there would be a reset of sports prices. And in the midst of this year's shortened season, that has absolutely come to pass. While negotiations with some sports continue, deals already completed will reduce the cost of sports rights at Foxtel by at least AUD 180 million over the next three years as compared to the prior contracted value. This reset will have a positive long-term impact on Foxtel's profitability. No doubt, the events of the first half of calendar year 2020 will remain resonant in our memories. I am particularly proud of the performance of all those who work at News Corp for showing professionalism, passion and compassion throughout these most difficult of times. Our reporters and opinion writers around the world have provided a profoundly important service, and many of our employees have contributed to their communities through philanthropic service in recent months. And now for more granular detail and customary insight, Susan. It's Robert here. I'll take the simplification question first. Simplification is a continuing process, and it must be. As you can see, we've appointed a global Head of Digital Real Estate, Tracey Fellows, formerly the Head of REA, and that's given us a much more focused international approach and intensified the dialogue and sharing between REALTOR and REA. And as you can see, we are constantly reviewing our portfolio. We sold Amplify, the digital education business. We sold our local papers in the U.S. well ahead of the present downturn. We sorted out and simplified the ownership of Foxtel. We sold News America Marketing. We sold Unruly. We've closed the print editions of most regional community papers in Australia, and these will actually not be the last changes that we make. But just to complement Susan's comment. We are indeed pleased with: one, how quickly the subscription growth has picked up at Kayo after the COVID interruption. And secondly, the early numbers for Binge, the entertainment streaming service are particularly encouraging. Entcho, what you saw in particular was the onset of the COVID crisis in May. So May was a tough month, June was better and July better again. And so we are, in particular, seeing strong digital advertising. Clearly, as in many countries around the world, print is affected. But generally speaking, the trend has been positive since May. Alexia, I think it's fair to say that Dow Jones is a unique media property. It's clearly got both a consumer business and a professional business, and the two complement each other. And that helps us certainly with subscriptions, but also in terms of contracts with potential advertisers. So \u2013 and in terms of a subscription funnel, we certainly have continuing faith in the growth potential for subscriptions at The Wall Street Journal. And as Susan mentioned, the trend in July has again been positive. And also the Barron's Group where subs rose 49% in Q4 compared to a year earlier. And what we have in Dow Jones is a continuing funnel of potential clients coming in through MarketWatch, which, as you know, the free financial news site. At MarketWatch in Q4, traffic rose 143%. So a MarketWatch user can easily graduate to be a Wall Street Journal subscriber, who can become a Barron's subscriber, who can become a subscriber to our high-end financial information intelligence in the professional information division. And it's really a unique opportunity in that we have a digital daisy chain, and each product in the chain is higher yielding. Yes. It's a really good question. For us, it's been a beneficial experience. And if you look at the Wall Street Journal, it's really two papers in one, both a general news service and business-specific news service. In that sense, there are a lot of potential readers and potential subscribers out there who don't understand the quality of the general news coverage, the politics, the economics, the arts, the lifestyle, the weekend section, the magazine. I'm sure you're a regular reader. You understand what I'm talking about. And so that Apple News partnership allows us to focus on that tier of content and bring in a significantly new audience that we would hope to graduate to a paid WSJ subscription over time. And it is a genuinely different audience. It's actually, of late, more women than men. For the Wall Street Journal itself, it's more men than women. It's a younger demographic. And it is obviously a source of potential subscribers for us. Well, one way of framing it would be to think of it as the contemporary equivalent of carriage fees or retrans for all broadcasters. Because there's no doubt that these deals will add up. What's public is the deal we have with Facebook, the deal we have with Apple. And of course, this is paying for content. And much of that money drops to the bottom line. And it's also fair to say that negotiations are going on with other companies and other regions. I can't go into detail at the moment because we're in the midst of them. But when you combine these deals, they are having a significant impact on our revenue and on our profitability. And it's frankly true for all media companies. So if any executives of other media companies would like to send News Corp a commission check, we'd be happy to receive it. That, too, may be a source of revenue. And also, Brian, don't forget, you've got the NAM numbers taken out. So it's not a like-for-like comparison. What I would say is that, essentially, the breaking out of Dow Jones is doing two things. It is providing more scrutiny generally for each of those segments, Dow Jones and News media. And scrutiny has to be a good thing. Because we are very confident that our news media executives will continue the transition to digital, which they are certainly on the pathway to doing. And sorts of deals that we've been discussing today are of themselves helpful. And then Dow Jones, Dow Jones is a uniquely undervalued property in what I would argue is a uniquely undervalued News Corp. I'll talk about the Australian regulations or the draft mandatory code of conduct, which is particularly important. It's important in two ways. One, for what it defines in terms of remedies and in particular, for what it defines in terms as an industry. But it's also part of a global discussion, whether it be the consideration in Brussels, the hearings here last week in Congress with the big four digital heads giving testimony, and in London. And so what you're seeing, and this is crucial, is the increase in content consciousness among regulators around the world. These are no longer mystifying issues. The issues have been clearly defined. And you saw that in Congress last week. And you see that in the ACCC Report, the original digital report, and now the draft mandatory code of conduct, which I think is quite a moment of itself, a real Internet inflection point. And this \u2013 essentially, we are talking about carriage fees or retrans payments for premium journalism. And there are obviously more deals to come. Now some of those deals will be outside Australia. But I suspect, in some ways, influenced by Australian regulatory thinking. But I can assure you that not only regulators but media companies around the world and the digital platforms are watching Australia closely. Now we've obviously been fighting this fight for well over a decade. And the News Corp Board has supported the quest because it was absolutely crucial to the future of journalism. Newspapers delivered in whatever format are vital to a well-informed society. And what's obvious is the collective understanding of issues is past the point of no return, the point of no action, shall we say. But there are obviously regulatory changes to come in Australia. And the commercial landscape is not yet fully formed, but it will be a landscape far more hospitable to journalism and to News Media and to News Corp. Now as for your a question about the licensing of content. Clearly, we're always looking for opportunities to monetize our content. But in a digital context, we have a unique comparative advantage with global properties, which often write about similar subjects. So not only in licensing in a traditional subscription sense, but think a little bit about the segmentation of digital products, products around sport, products around lifestyle, around food, around puzzles even. So it's a real opportunity for us to divide up our content in a different way, monetize that content and provide compelling digital opportunities for potential subscribers at different price points for different content sets. Thank you, Andrew. Thank you, Nicole, and thank you all for participating. We look forward to speaking with you soon. Have a great day. Take care."

[Operator instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mike Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMichael Florin: Thank you very much, Clowey Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp\u2019s fiscal third quarter 2020 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about half an hour ago, and it\u2019s now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We\u2019ll open with some prepared remarks, and then we\u2019ll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp\u2019s business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp\u2019s Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements, such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release. With that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\nRobert Thomson: Thanks, Mike. We are operating in a different difficult time, so this will be a rather different distant experience. Before the business of the day, I sincerely hope that all on this call, each of our investors, our business partners and their families are safe during this exacting era. Every business and family is facing challenges, and our thoughts, in particular, are for those who are suffering under the curse of COVID-19 and have had to deal with complications from this dreaded disease. For our company, the safety of our employees has obviously been paramount. And many of our journalists have displayed much courage in recent months, including reporting from Wuhan, during the intense first phase of what has become a pandemic. I would also like to honor, Anthony Causi, who passed at a relatively young age, by which time he had already become a legendary sports photographer for the New York Post. As noted in our 8-K filing with the SEC last month, we expected a broad impact on our business from the pandemic\u2019s inevitable economic consequences. We were affected somewhat in Q3, and those effects were likely to be significantly more pronounced in the fourth quarter. As we expect this impact to continue in the near-term, significant cost reductions have been implemented across the company and additional steps will be taken in coming months. These cuts are designed to deal with the short-term exigencies and to reposition the company for long-term growth. There will obviously be an impact on executive compensation. For many senior executives, bonuses are the largest component of their cash compensation, and this will be reduced by at least 20%. The cuts will be led by our Executive Chairman, Rupert Murdoch, who is voluntarily foregoing his entire cash bonus for the current fiscal year. And as Chief Executive, I will forgo 75% of my annual cash bonus. In addition, our Board of Directors have decided to reduce their cash compensation. These significant cost reductions of all kinds across the company will clearly have a positive impact on our total segment EBITDA and our cash position and help mitigate some of the effects of the pandemic. We obviously leave open the possibility of further compensation cuts next fiscal year depending on the ongoing impact of the crisis. Turning now to the third quarter results for fiscal year 2020. Our revenues declined 8% to $2.3 billion, including a $78 million, or 3% impact from adverse currency movements. Total segment EBITDA was down, although only 2% to $242 million. It is worth highlighting that operationally, adjusting for currencies, acquisitions and disposals and other items, mentioned in our release, our adjusted revenues were down 4%, but our adjusted total segment EBITDA rose 1%. Reported results also include a $1.1 billion non-cash write-down, mostly attributable to Foxtel. At the News and Information Services segment, the sale of News America Marketing has formally closed. This is a significant step in terms of enhancing shareholder value and part of the continuing simplification of our company. A thorough reevaluation of our assets continues and a strategic review of our community and regional original newspapers in Australia is at an advanced stage. We are also reviewing ways to improve transparency in our segment disclosure, which will enable investors to better appreciate the inherent value in and the growth potential of Dow Jones, which we believe is the best business news and analysis brand in the world. We are working toward making that company\u2019s potential more obvious and to highlighting its various strengths, certainly relative to other business brands and, for example, to the New York Times. Speaking of demand for premium content. As you know, we have entered into valuable partnerships with Apple and Facebook for use of our world-class journalism. Clearly, there are harbingers of positive change with Google, where the CEO, Sundar Pichai, has shown a more enlightened socially empathetic attitude to journalism. In the past, some in Silicon Valley sought to create a system of petty patronage through philanthropic handouts and contentious SOPs, seemingly designed to institutionalize a mendicant media. Enlightened executives at Google patently seek more meaningful changes to a dysfunctional ecosystem. The terms of trade in the digital world are certainly changing. The regulatory pressure is also intensifying as two weeks ago, the Australian government announced the introduction of a mandatory code that would require the larger digital companies to pay for content and to adjust their algorithms to give additional weight to original news. It is absolutely crucial that more be understood about the character, the power and the potential manipulation of algorithms and data. A recent Wall Street Journal report on Amazon\u2019s business practices showed the potential danger of companies having a dominant horizontal marketplace and selling their own products in segment verticals. In essence, exploiting proprietary marketplace data and competing with and potentially undermining their clients. In the third quarter, News and Information Services improved in profitability for the second straight quarter with 15% growth in segment EBITDA. Dow Jones recorded a particularly strong performance. Our digital paid subscriptions rose 20% year-on-year to more than 2.5 million average daily subs at quarter-end. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s digital paid subs were up 15% to more than 2 million, also a record. In recent days, The Journal has shown further acceleration, with total subscriptions reaching approximately 3 million for the first time, including 2.2 million digital-only. Overall, at the end of April, digital subscriptions rose over 20% year-on-year. Digital advertising at Dow Jones rose 25% year-over-year, despite the challenges we faced with ad sales later in March. This is in strikingly marked contrast to the performance of the New York Times, where digital ad revenue actually declined 8%. I should repeat those figures for the purpose of clarity. Digital advertising rose 25% at Dow Jones and it fell 8% at the New York Times. Dow Jones profit contribution improved and was a significant contributor to segment EBITDA growth, while EBITDA slumped 15% at the New York Times. We announced earlier this week that the Head of the Barron\u2019s Group, Almar Latour, will replace, Will Lewis, as CEO from the middle of this month. We will certainly leave Dow Jones in fine fettle and with enormous capacity for future growth. Speaking of Barron, subscriptions rose 14% year-over-year. And over the past four years, under Almar\u2019s leadership, the digital audience at Barron\u2019s Group Brands has quadrupled. During the quarter, the Wall Street digital network broke records and hit 196 million unique users in March, up 155% versus the prior year. Traffic was particularly strong at MarketWatch in March, where users more than tripled to 90 million compared to the prior year. The Professional Information Business reported a 5% increase in revenues, with risk and compliance, once again, demonstrating strength, rising 18% year-over-year. Elsewhere in the segment, newspaper digital subscriptions at News Corp Australia were up 24% year-over-year, rising to more than 613,000 a quarter, and with two-thirds of subscriptions at the Australian now are digital-only. At News UK, The Sun reached 164 million global unique visitors in March, representing a 17% increase over December, according to Google Analytics. While at The Times and Sunday Times, digital subscriptions grew 21% year-over-year to 345,000 and now account for nearly 60% of the base. Meanwhile, the New York Post advertising revenues in the quarter rose 19% and the post digital network had 169 million average monthly unique visitors, according to Google Analytics, up from 107 million in Q2. Turning now to book publishing. Revenue declines moderate at HarperCollins in the quarter compared to the first-half, while segment EBITDA grew year-over-year despite very difficult comparisons. As more people have moved to work and study from home, we\u2019ve seen a revival in e-book sales. We are particularly pleased with early sales for Joanna Gaines, Magnolia Table, Volume 2, which already sits atop the U.S. best-seller lists. Digital real estate were showing solid progress through January and February, but began experiencing pandemic-related declines in March. Business at REA and realtor.com will depend on the reopening of the Australian and U.S. economies, but traffic to both sites remains encouraging. And realtor.com is outperforming the traffic trends of its house flipping competitor, according to the March ComScore data. In the Subscription Video Services segment, Kayo subscriptions rose to 444,000 in Q3, including trialist, which was more than double the prior year, and Kayo also showed strong growth over the prior quarter. That figure has obviously been adversely affected in recent weeks by the suspension of sports in Australia, as we disclosed in the earnings release. We are in serious negotiations with the major sports over a fundamental reset of rights costs. Susan will discuss the possible accounting impacts shortly. In coming weeks, we plan to launch our entertainment streaming product and expect that there will be strong demand, given the power of our media portfolio\u2019s marketing platform and the nascent demand in Australia. We\u2019re also very excited by the multi-year deal with WarnerMedia announced this week. That means Foxtel will be the exclusive home in Australia for HBO, this is soon to launch HBO Max and other WarnerMedia hits. Let me now turn to the lingering impact of COVID-19, which began to have an effect towards third quarter\u2019s end, but clearly will be a major factor in our Q4 results, as we signaled in our 8-K filing last month. I would first like to commend our leaders and our employees around the globe as we rapidly and successfully moved approximately 90% of our workforce, around 25,000 people into a work from in-home environment. Looking at the longer-term, we have clear plans for addressing the immediate challenges we face and for emerging vigorously on the other side of this crisis. This will not be done by random cost-cutting, but by strategic decisions about the business we need to fashion for a profitable future. That strategy is informed by a candid, assessment of our capabilities and deficiencies and a clear sense that the business environment will be very different when the world finally returns to the new abnormal. It is worth noting at this crucial time that News Corp continues to have a strong balance sheet. As of March 31, we have $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents. And in addition, we have access to a $750 million corporate revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. That bedrock of financial stability will help us weather the category-5 storm, as will the power of our brands and the energy and the creativity of our people. The headwinds will buffer the company in the short-term, but I\u2019m extremely positive about our prospects for delivering long-term growth and increasing shareholder value. Now for more particulars on our results in this quarter, I turn to Susan Panuccio.\nSusan Panuccio: Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2020 third quarter total revenues were approximately $2.3 billion, down 8% versus the prior year and total segment EBITDA was $242 million, down 2% versus the prior year. Currency headwinds negatively impacted revenues and total segment EBITDA by 3% and 6%, respectively. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues fell 4% and total segment EBITDA increased 1%. For the quarter, we reported losses per share of $1.24, as compared to earnings per share of $0.02 in the prior year. The loss includes $1.1 billion of non-cash impairment charges, primarily related to a write-down of goodwill intangible assets of Foxtel and the reclassification of News America Marketing to assets held for sale. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.03 in the quarter compared to $0.04 in the prior year. Before going into the quarterly detail, I will add to Robert\u2019s comments on the COVID-19 pandemic, which is expected to have a significant impact on near-term operating results. Immediate cost actions are under way. Variable costs have obviously been reduced with a heightened focus on the reduction of discretionary spend and non-essential CapEx, together with a thorough review of all headcount requirements. We are accelerating plans to reduce costs across the business in the medium-term, particularly at our News and Information Services segment. These initiatives include, but are not limited to, global shared services to centralize our back-office functions, a thorough review of our property and office footprint and reviewing our printing operations around the globe, whereby we have already announced the printing suspension of 60 community newspapers in Australia. Finally, in relation to companywide liquidity, it is important to note the only debt exposures we have are at our non-100%-owned subsidiaries, Foxtel and REA, and these are non-recalls to News Corp. We are not anticipating any covenant issues at Foxtel over the next 12 months, and we have no plans to provide any additional shareholder funding. With that as a backdrop, I will now discuss the quarterly results for the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.1 billion, down 8% versus the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 5%. Advertising revenues fell 14%, with declines most notably at News America Marketing and in News Australia, while circulation and subscription revenue grew 1%. Currency negatively impacted segment revenues by 2%. Results were also impacted by $14 million from the outbreak of COVID-19. Digital revenues for Dow Jones and the newspaper mastheads represented 42% of their combined revenues, up from 36% in the prior year. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $75 million, up 15% from $65 million in the prior year, benefiting from increased contributions at Dow Jones, improvements at the New York Post and the absence of losses from unruly, partially offset by lower contribution from NAM. At Dow Jones, consumer circulation revenues grew a healthy 4%, reflecting a 20% growth in digital paid subscribers across Dow Jones consumer products, including a 15% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at the Wall Street Journal. Total Wall Street Journal subscribers exceeded 2.8 million in the quarter, an 8% increase from the prior year, which is an acceleration from the second quarter\u2019s growth rate. Professional Information Business revenues accounted for 29% of Dow Jones revenues this quarter, growing 5% to $114 million, reflecting an 18% growth in risk and compliance revenues. Advertising revenues at Dow Jones fell 2% this quarter. But as Robert mentioned, we saw a sharp acceleration in digital advertising revenues, posting 25% year-over-year growth. Digital advertising represented 47% of Dow Jones advertising revenues. Overall, Dow Jones had revenue growth of 5% and another quarter of positive contribution to segment EBITDA growth. Elsewhere, advertising revenues at News UK fell 10% on a reported basis and 8% in local currency, weaker than the past two quarters, despite strength in digital. Trends at News Australia have remained very challenging, with advertising revenues down 20% on a reported basis and 30% down in local currency. Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues fell 16%. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $462 million, down 14% versus $539 million in the prior year, or down 7% in local currency. The revenue decline was primarily driven by lower broadcast subscribers. Broadcast subscriber trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter, with COVID-19 restrictions in Australia coming into place in the last week of the quarter. Foxtel also faced lower advertising revenues, reflective of the overall TV marketplace. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $68 million, down 31% from the prior year, driven by the revenue decline, partially offset by renegotiated license fees and the timing of sports rights and the production costs due to COVID-19-related suspensions. Overall costs were down 11% on a reported basis. Foxtel\u2019s closing paid subscriber base was approximately 2.93 million as of March 31, reflecting a 1% year-over-year growth, driven by Kayo subscribers. Through quarter-end, Kayo\u2019s total subscriber base, including trialists, increased 444,000, up from 199,000 last year. In fact, we reached over 470,000 total Kayo subscribers by March 22, the start of the Winter Sports season. However, subscribers have declined in recent weeks with the suspension of the NRL and AFL seasons, as well as Rugby, motor sports and other international sporting codes, like the NBA. Kayo viewers remained highly engaged during the quarter and we expect an uptick in subscribers that will clearly depend on the quality and quantity of NRL and AFL games once they have resumed. As of May 2, there were more than 272,000 paying Kayo subscribers. We have been beta testing Foxtel\u2019s new drama and entertainment streaming service, and we expect to launch commercially in the coming weeks, and we\u2019re very pleased to announce the WarnerMedia deal to support the launch. In the third quarter, broadcast churn improved for the first time in almost two years to 17.5%, which was 20 basis points lower versus the prior year. Broadcast ARPU remained relatively stable at A$79. At Book Publishing, HarperCollins had a strong quarter, with revenues down 2% to $412 million and segment EBITDA up 4% to $55 million, despite a very tough comparison against the prior year, which had segment EBITDA growth of 29%. We saw improvement performance in general books, children\u2019s and in the UK. Digital sales grew 3% year-over-year to 23% of consumer revenue, which included improvements in downloadable audio books. At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues decreased 4% to $261 million due to the negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. On an adjusted basis, revenues were flat. Segment EBITDA rose 1% to $74 million, or 9% on an adjusted basis. REA Group revenues fell 5%. However, without the $12 million foreign currency impact, REA grew modestly in local currency. This is an improvement from the first-half performance, benefiting from renewed growth in financial services. Australian listing volume declines moderated to down 7%, which reflects mid single-digit growth in metro Melbourne and Sydney. REA also saw strong traffic metrics achieving record levels in visits and audience during the quarter. However, COVID-19-related government policies and restrictions, including bans on open home inspections and in-person auctions have led to reduced listing volumes in recent weeks. In response to the impacts from the pandemic, REA has implemented a number of relief packages to support its customers, including short-term pricing concessions and changes to listing products to provide greater flexibility for customers. Please refer to REA\u2019s earnings release and their conference call immediately following this call for more details. Move revenues declined 2% to $118 million, with real estate revenues relatively flat. Traffic remains strong with unique users in the quarter, up 6% to $68 million. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Move was on a solid growth trajectory in January and February, with improved growth in traffic and leads and was on pace to deliver strong second-half revenue. However, by mid-March, similar to REA and other digital real estate portals, both trends reversed. In response to the pandemic, Realtor instituted billing relief initiative in late March for its customers, which was subsequently extended into May with some modification to the offer. The initiative, together with other COVID-19-related impacts, reduced third quarter revenues by an estimated $6 million. I would now like to talk about some of the themes in the upcoming quarter. Forecasting has been challenging, so I will discuss what we have seen in April and frame the relevant risks. At News and Information Services, we expect advertising and single copy sale revenues in the segment to be adversely affected as a result of widespread business closures and social distancing measures. For a framework, advertising revenues, excluding News America Marketing, represented approximately 34% of segment revenues in the third quarter. In April, advertising revenues at Dow Jones was down more than 20% with digital down modestly. Advertising revenues at Australia and the UK were down more than 45% on a reported basis, or around 40% in local currency. As I mentioned earlier, we are taking aggressive cost action to mitigate these revenue declines within the segment. At the same time, we have also continued to see strong growth in digital subscribers across the key properties in April, including over 20% year-on-year growth in digital-only subscribers of the Wall Street Journal. In the third quarter, approximately 75% of Dow Jones revenues were subscription-based, providing much more visibility and stability. Digital revenues accounted for 68% of Dow Jones revenues and digital paid subscribers accounted for 73% of the Wall Street General subscriber base. In Subscription Video Services, we anticipate an increase in broadcast churn with the suspension of the NRL and AFL seasons. For April, broadcast churn has been fairly stable, although we have seen lower sports tier and Kayo subscribers, as you would expect. Closures of pubs and clubs and lower occupancy at hotels throughout Australia are also expected to adversely impact commercial subscription revenues, together with the downturn in advertising revenue. The team at Foxtel has implemented several initiatives, including opening up additional entertainment content to all subscribers and providing Foxtel broadband customers with unlimited data allowances for streaming. As for sports rights accounting, Foxtel amortizes event-based sports like Formula 1, which have no dedicated channels upon the occurrence of the events. Consequently, the third quarter included about US$9 million of costs, that were deferred due to events canceled or postponed. Channel-based sports rights, such as the AFL, NRL and domestic crickets are expensed on a straight-line basis over the year. The third quarter included a full amount of rights fees for all three of those sports. In the event that the NRL and AFL do not resume this season in the fourth quarter, we would plan to defer those costs until the sports regime. All the sports-based contracts have different terms and conditions, and we are currently in discussions with the leagues around the best way to move forward and to value the season that remains. As a framework, the quarterly cost between the AFL and NRL prior to the suspensions were A$95 million, or approximately US$60 million. In addition, we also expect an approximately $10 million impact from the accelerated entertainment amortization in the fourth quarter. In Book Publishing, as the retail market adjusted to stay-at-home restrictions by closing a number of bricks-and-mortar stores, HarperCollins saw strong growth in online sales with e-books returning to growth. Our release slate is largely intact, and as Robert mentioned, one of our top books for the year, Joanna Gaines, Magnolia Table, Volume 2 is selling very well. At Digital Real Estate Services, as noted in their release, REA anticipates a challenging listing environment, given the government social distancing measures with April, new buy listings falling 33%. Realtor is facing lower real estate transactions, but encouragingly, lead volume and unique users have shown improvements in recent weeks. Both companies have taken proactive relief measures to extend credit to their respective customers with discounts or other similar measures, which will have an adverse impact on revenues. CapEx for the year is expected to come down significantly to around $435 million, compared to $572 million last year, which includes a 35% to 40% decline at Foxtel. An update on our initial guidance of approximately 20% year-on-year reduction. Finally, a word about our tax rate. From a P&L perspective, we expect an unusually high tax rate for the full-year due to certain operating losses in foreign jurisdictions that we are unable to take deductions against. This is a P&L impact, not a cash impact. As I mentioned, these are unique times, but we believe with our strong liquidity position, market-leading brands, our emphasis on digital transformation, as well as a more aggressive focus on cost measures, News Corp is well positioned to weather the current crisis. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Alexia Quadrani from JP Morgan.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you very much. Can you elaborate on the strength in the digital advertising you highlighted in the quarter at the Wall Street Journal? It sounded like in April, it softened a little bit, but still seems like it\u2019s coming in probably better than what we\u2019re seeing in the industry. I\u2019m wondering if it was specific to certain verticals that continue to be strength in your product mix. And then just a follow-up on the makeup of the strong growth in digital subscribers also at The Journal. Is it international, domestic? Anything different, maybe younger? Or is it pretty much just more of everything that you\u2019ve been seeing for a while?\nRobert Thomson: Well, thanks, Alexia. Look, in terms of the subscribers are, obviously, we have had strong growth in U.S. subscriptions. And I think the thing to remember about Wall Street Journal subscriptions is that, once you have a subscriber, you also have an opportunity to up-sell. And so we\u2019re particularly seeing growth, for example, in subscriptions coming from MarketWatch to The Journal and from MarketWatch to Barron\u2019s and as well as that from The Journal to Barron\u2019s. And then for the more specialist, Wall Street Journal subscribers, there\u2019s an opportunity to sell them \u2013 to up-sell them to our premium business products, which obviously have a higher yield. In terms of advertising, clearly, traffic has been particularly strong. There had been, as you may well be aware, some concerns early in the COVID crisis about blocking of ads related to COVID crisis coverage. Gradually, that problem has diminished. And so we are noticing that the amount of advertising we\u2019re getting is matching, not quite, but to some extent, the significant increases in traffic we\u2019ve had across the Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch. We noticed that tech advertising has increased. Custom advertising is also on the rise, and to a certain extent, programmatic. But I think for our business, quite frankly, it\u2019s an extraordinary opportunity, because big clients are coming straight to the Wall Street Journal and to our other publishing houses around the world. And they want to deal directly with us rather than necessarily through an advertising agency. And while this is at the moment, a short-term phenomenon, there are indications that this may very well become a long-term trend.\nSusan Panuccio: Look, Alexia, the only other thing that I would add to that is the other pleasing thing that we\u2019ve seen is the average age is broadening out. And so we did have an average age of around 60, and it\u2019s now around 47 as a consequence of those subscribers coming in to that space in 2020.\nRobert Thomson: And if I could further complement Susan by saying that what we\u2019ve noticed, for example, among Wall Street Journal leaders on Apple News+ is that, historically, there\u2019ve been, shall we say, a disproportionate number of men reading the Wall Street Journal, the breakdown is around 75% male, 25% female. Just at this moment, the readership of the Wall Street Journal on the Apple News+ side is majority women, minority men.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Alexia. Clowey, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Absolutely. The next question comes from Entcho Raykovski from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nEntcho Raykovski: Hi, Robert. Hi, Susan. A couple for me. Just the first one, you\u2019ve obviously mentioned the sports rights deals and you\u2019ve given us a good framework on what happens on a quarterly basis. But just interested whether you see this is an opportunity to renegotiate some of those sports rights deals longer-term? Do you think they can genuinely be any longer-term savings? And yes, I mean, do you think that\u2019s warranted, given some of the fairly high costs? So interested giving your thoughts on that issue? And secondly, are you able to quantify the potential impact of the relief measures that move in Q4? And do you expect that, that\u2019ll continue to remain in place beyond that? Thank you.\nRobert Thomson: Entcho, first of all, on sports rights, obviously, it\u2019s inappropriate to go into detail at this stage. But there obviously needs to be a fundamental reset. The idea that things will suddenly turn to normal as season is absurd. It\u2019s not just the quantity of games, it\u2019s the quality of the experience, and that has obviously been diminished. And that reset has to apply longer-term to rights in Australia. In essence, there is a new reset reality.\nSusan Panuccio: And Entcho, just in relation to your question on Move, we haven\u2019t given that for Q4. But what I can say is, we implemented the measures on the 19th of March in relation to Move and the impact of that in Q3 was $6 million. So you can use that as a proxy for your run rate, and we haven\u2019t made any announcement as to any further extension in Malaysia.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Entcho. Clowey, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Absolutely. The next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners.\nCraig Huber: Thank you. Hi. On the newspaper side in Australia, on the cost-cutting side, there\u2019s a lot \u2013 decent that\u2019s been written out there about your newspapers, some of them down there, that you are shutting down the hard copy version and going digital-only and stuff. Can you just talk a little bit further about that? And just like I\u2019m curious like what percentage of your print subs down there, would you have shutdown that are moved to online-only as the business model, for example, in that market? So I mean, just like only 10%, 15%, 20% of the subs down there. I mean, how significant is it? That\u2019s my first question. And then my second question is, I guess, on newspaper side as well, just generally, do you think you have a lot more cost you can take out of the U.S. for Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones, U.K., Australia, I think, you have a lot more cost you can take out in reaction to this virus situation? Thank you.\nRobert Thomson: Well, I\u2019ll take the second question first, Craig. Clearly, we\u2019re constantly reviewing costs. And that is cost in headquarters where there have been significant reductions in recent days. And right through where we\u2019re looking for efficiencies in tax spend. We\u2019re looking for the efficiencies that come from the closer coordination that really has been under way in recent years, it\u2019s not a new phenomenon. But it gives us an opportunity to look across businesses very, very closely, measured at different cost levels and respond appropriately. What we\u2019re not going to do is cut cost in a way that undermines the editorial integrity of the leading news organization in the world.\nSusan Panuccio: And Craig, just in relation to the masthead start in Australia. So the masthead that we\u2019ve seized printing at the moment were community masthead, which are not subscription-related to their advertising-related products. And as Robert mentioned, we are undertaking a detailed strategic view of the entire regional and community portfolio down in Australia. So the regional mastheads, we\u2019ll have subs attached to them, but not the communities. And then just to supplement on the cost side. I mean, I agree and echo with Robert\u2019s point. But we do believe that across all our businesses on a global scale, particularly when we think about our back-office functions, that we do have some significant opportunities that we can unlock. We have been actively working on those measures over the course of the last 12 months, particularly looking at PEC. But we do believe that there\u2019s a lot more opportunities we can do as we broaden the scope of that as we move forward.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Craig. Clowey, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brian Han from Morningstar.\nBrian Han: Hi, Robert. Does the current environment help the simplification program that you have going for News Corp? And \u2013 or does it make it actually more complicated, especially for asset sales? And also, Susan, the impairment charge taken at Foxtel, was that more driven by changes in assumptions related to the traditional Foxtel business, or have your views for Kayo and Foxtel now also changed?\nRobert Thomson: Brian, clearly, the simplification was a preexisting program. But to a certain extent, you may well be correct in that various things have been expedited during this period of crisis. What I would like to say specifically around simplification is that, clearly, we\u2019re pleased that the NAM transaction has progressed. Actually, we had full fit the Charlesbank who have preexisting specialist expertise in that area, we\u2019ll be able to make a significant success of the business. And you can tell from the tenor of our content comments about Australia that there is obviously a strategic review of our print holdings well under way. So our simplification process is far from finished. And part of that is that we\u2019re very keen to highlight the value inherent in, for example, Dow Jones, which we reported vastly superior numbers to those of the New York Times, but whose figures are not fully obvious in the current News and Information Services segment. Now if you think of the journey in recent years, the sale of Amplify, the early sale of the local media group at Dow Jones, the NAM sale. And on the other side of the ledger, the acquisition of Realtor, the purchase of Harlequin, we are a rather different, more specialized company than we were a few years ago.\nSusan Panuccio: And then Brian, just in relation to your question on Foxtel and the impairment. We do look at this from a DCF perspective and also from a market multiple perspective. And clearly, there has been an impact that\u2019s adversely affected our trends resulting in lower expected forecast subscribers. And the impact of COVID-19 is expected to have clearly an adverse impact on advertising OTT to customers and commercial subscription revenues in the near-term. So when we combine all those, we thought it was appropriate to take an impairment on Foxtel.\nMichael Florin: Okay. Clowey, are there anymore questions?\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. And I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to you. Thank you.\nMichael Florin: Great. Well, thank you, Clowey, and thank you for all participating. Have a great day, and most importantly, stay safe. We\u2019ll talk to you soon.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Fiscal 2020 third quarter total revenues were approximately $2.3 billion, down 8% versus the prior year and total segment EBITDA was $242 million, down 2% versus the prior year. Currency headwinds negatively impacted revenues and total segment EBITDA by 3% and 6%, respectively. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues fell 4% and total segment EBITDA increased 1%. For the quarter, we reported losses per share of $1.24, as compared to earnings per share of $0.02 in the prior year. The loss includes $1.1 billion of non-cash impairment charges, primarily related to a write-down of goodwill intangible assets of Foxtel and the reclassification of News America Marketing to assets held for sale. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.03 in the quarter compared to $0.04 in the prior year. Before going into the quarterly detail, I will add to Robert's comments on the COVID-19 pandemic, which is expected to have a significant impact on near-term operating results. Immediate cost actions are under way. Variable costs have obviously been reduced with a heightened focus on the reduction of discretionary spend and non-essential CapEx, together with a thorough review of all headcount requirements. We are accelerating plans to reduce costs across the business in the medium-term, particularly at our News and Information Services segment. These initiatives include, but are not limited to, global shared services to centralize our back-office functions, a thorough review of our property and office footprint and reviewing our printing operations around the globe, whereby we have already announced the printing suspension of 60 community newspapers in Australia. Finally, in relation to companywide liquidity, it is important to note the only debt exposures we have are at our non-100%-owned subsidiaries, Foxtel and REA, and these are non-recalls to News Corp. We are not anticipating any covenant issues at Foxtel over the next 12 months, and we have no plans to provide any additional shareholder funding. With that as a backdrop, I will now discuss the quarterly results for the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.1 billion, down 8% versus the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 5%. Advertising revenues fell 14%, with declines most notably at News America Marketing and in News Australia, while circulation and subscription revenue grew 1%. Currency negatively impacted segment revenues by 2%. Results were also impacted by $14 million from the outbreak of COVID-19. Digital revenues for Dow Jones and the newspaper mastheads represented 42% of their combined revenues, up from 36% in the prior year. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $75 million, up 15% from $65 million in the prior year, benefiting from increased contributions at Dow Jones, improvements at the New York Post and the absence of losses from unruly, partially offset by lower contribution from NAM. At Dow Jones, consumer circulation revenues grew a healthy 4%, reflecting a 20% growth in digital paid subscribers across Dow Jones consumer products, including a 15% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at the Wall Street Journal. Total Wall Street Journal subscribers exceeded 2.8 million in the quarter, an 8% increase from the prior year, which is an acceleration from the second quarter's growth rate. Professional Information Business revenues accounted for 29% of Dow Jones revenues this quarter, growing 5% to $114 million, reflecting an 18% growth in risk and compliance revenues. Advertising revenues at Dow Jones fell 2% this quarter. But as Robert mentioned, we saw a sharp acceleration in digital advertising revenues, posting 25% year-over-year growth. Digital advertising represented 47% of Dow Jones advertising revenues. Overall, Dow Jones had revenue growth of 5% and another quarter of positive contribution to segment EBITDA growth. Elsewhere, advertising revenues at News UK fell 10% on a reported basis and 8% in local currency, weaker than the past two quarters, despite strength in digital. Trends at News Australia have remained very challenging, with advertising revenues down 20% on a reported basis and 30% down in local currency. Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues fell 16%. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $462 million, down 14% versus $539 million in the prior year, or down 7% in local currency. The revenue decline was primarily driven by lower broadcast subscribers. Broadcast subscriber trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter, with COVID-19 restrictions in Australia coming into place in the last week of the quarter. Foxtel also faced lower advertising revenues, reflective of the overall TV marketplace. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $68 million, down 31% from the prior year, driven by the revenue decline, partially offset by renegotiated license fees and the timing of sports rights and the production costs due to COVID-19-related suspensions. Overall costs were down 11% on a reported basis. Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base was approximately 2.93 million as of March 31, reflecting a 1% year-over-year growth, driven by Kayo subscribers. Through quarter-end, Kayo's total subscriber base, including trialists, increased 444,000, up from 199,000 last year. In fact, we reached over 470,000 total Kayo subscribers by March 22, the start of the Winter Sports season. However, subscribers have declined in recent weeks with the suspension of the NRL and AFL seasons, as well as Rugby, motor sports and other international sporting codes, like the NBA. Kayo viewers remained highly engaged during the quarter and we expect an uptick in subscribers that will clearly depend on the quality and quantity of NRL and AFL games once they have resumed. As of May 2, there were more than 272,000 paying Kayo subscribers. We have been beta testing Foxtel's new drama and entertainment streaming service, and we expect to launch commercially in the coming weeks, and we're very pleased to announce the WarnerMedia deal to support the launch. In the third quarter, broadcast churn improved for the first time in almost two years to 17.5%, which was 20 basis points lower versus the prior year. Broadcast ARPU remained relatively stable at A$79. At Book Publishing, HarperCollins had a strong quarter, with revenues down 2% to $412 million and segment EBITDA up 4% to $55 million, despite a very tough comparison against the prior year, which had segment EBITDA growth of 29%. We saw improvement performance in general books, children's and in the UK. Digital sales grew 3% year-over-year to 23% of consumer revenue, which included improvements in downloadable audio books. At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues decreased 4% to $261 million due to the negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. On an adjusted basis, revenues were flat. Segment EBITDA rose 1% to $74 million, or 9% on an adjusted basis. REA Group revenues fell 5%. However, without the $12 million foreign currency impact, REA grew modestly in local currency. This is an improvement from the first-half performance, benefiting from renewed growth in financial services. Australian listing volume declines moderated to down 7%, which reflects mid single-digit growth in metro Melbourne and Sydney. REA also saw strong traffic metrics achieving record levels in visits and audience during the quarter. However, COVID-19-related government policies and restrictions, including bans on open home inspections and in-person auctions have led to reduced listing volumes in recent weeks. In response to the impacts from the pandemic, REA has implemented a number of relief packages to support its customers, including short-term pricing concessions and changes to listing products to provide greater flexibility for customers. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call immediately following this call for more details. Move revenues declined 2% to $118 million, with real estate revenues relatively flat. Traffic remains strong with unique users in the quarter, up 6% to $68 million. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Move was on a solid growth trajectory in January and February, with improved growth in traffic and leads and was on pace to deliver strong second-half revenue. However, by mid-March, similar to REA and other digital real estate portals, both trends reversed. In response to the pandemic, Realtor instituted billing relief initiative in late March for its customers, which was subsequently extended into May with some modification to the offer. The initiative, together with other COVID-19-related impacts, reduced third quarter revenues by an estimated $6 million. I would now like to talk about some of the themes in the upcoming quarter. Forecasting has been challenging, so I will discuss what we have seen in April and frame the relevant risks. At News and Information Services, we expect advertising and single copy sale revenues in the segment to be adversely affected as a result of widespread business closures and social distancing measures. For a framework, advertising revenues, excluding News America Marketing, represented approximately 34% of segment revenues in the third quarter. In April, advertising revenues at Dow Jones was down more than 20% with digital down modestly. Advertising revenues at Australia and the UK were down more than 45% on a reported basis, or around 40% in local currency. As I mentioned earlier, we are taking aggressive cost action to mitigate these revenue declines within the segment. At the same time, we have also continued to see strong growth in digital subscribers across the key properties in April, including over 20% year-on-year growth in digital-only subscribers of the Wall Street Journal. In the third quarter, approximately 75% of Dow Jones revenues were subscription-based, providing much more visibility and stability. Digital revenues accounted for 68% of Dow Jones revenues and digital paid subscribers accounted for 73% of the Wall Street General subscriber base. In Subscription Video Services, we anticipate an increase in broadcast churn with the suspension of the NRL and AFL seasons. For April, broadcast churn has been fairly stable, although we have seen lower sports tier and Kayo subscribers, as you would expect. Closures of pubs and clubs and lower occupancy at hotels throughout Australia are also expected to adversely impact commercial subscription revenues, together with the downturn in advertising revenue. The team at Foxtel has implemented several initiatives, including opening up additional entertainment content to all subscribers and providing Foxtel broadband customers with unlimited data allowances for streaming. As for sports rights accounting, Foxtel amortizes event-based sports like Formula 1, which have no dedicated channels upon the occurrence of the events. Consequently, the third quarter included about US$9 million of costs, that were deferred due to events canceled or postponed. Channel-based sports rights, such as the AFL, NRL and domestic crickets are expensed on a straight-line basis over the year. The third quarter included a full amount of rights fees for all three of those sports. In the event that the NRL and AFL do not resume this season in the fourth quarter, we would plan to defer those costs until the sports regime. All the sports-based contracts have different terms and conditions, and we are currently in discussions with the leagues around the best way to move forward and to value the season that remains. As a framework, the quarterly cost between the AFL and NRL prior to the suspensions were A$95 million, or approximately US$60 million. In addition, we also expect an approximately $10 million impact from the accelerated entertainment amortization in the fourth quarter. In Book Publishing, as the retail market adjusted to stay-at-home restrictions by closing a number of bricks-and-mortar stores, HarperCollins saw strong growth in online sales with e-books returning to growth. Our release slate is largely intact, and as Robert mentioned, one of our top books for the year, Joanna Gaines, Magnolia Table, Volume 2 is selling very well. At Digital Real Estate Services, as noted in their release, REA anticipates a challenging listing environment, given the government social distancing measures with April, new buy listings falling 33%. Realtor is facing lower real estate transactions, but encouragingly, lead volume and unique users have shown improvements in recent weeks. Both companies have taken proactive relief measures to extend credit to their respective customers with discounts or other similar measures, which will have an adverse impact on revenues. CapEx for the year is expected to come down significantly to around $435 million, compared to $572 million last year, which includes a 35% to 40% decline at Foxtel. An update on our initial guidance of approximately 20% year-on-year reduction. Finally, a word about our tax rate. From a P&L perspective, we expect an unusually high tax rate for the full-year due to certain operating losses in foreign jurisdictions that we are unable to take deductions against. This is a P&L impact, not a cash impact. As I mentioned, these are unique times, but we believe with our strong liquidity position, market-leading brands, our emphasis on digital transformation, as well as a more aggressive focus on cost measures, News Corp is well positioned to weather the current crisis. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A. Look, Alexia, the only other thing that I would add to that is the other pleasing thing that we've seen is the average age is broadening out. And so we did have an average age of around 60, and it's now around 47 as a consequence of those subscribers coming in to that space in 2020. And Entcho, just in relation to your question on Move, we haven't given that for Q4. But what I can say is, we implemented the measures on the 19th of March in relation to Move and the impact of that in Q3 was $6 million. So you can use that as a proxy for your run rate, and we haven't made any announcement as to any further extension in Malaysia. And Craig, just in relation to the masthead start in Australia. So the masthead that we've seized printing at the moment were community masthead, which are not subscription-related to their advertising-related products. And as Robert mentioned, we are undertaking a detailed strategic view of the entire regional and community portfolio down in Australia. So the regional mastheads, we'll have subs attached to them, but not the communities. And then just to supplement on the cost side. I mean, I agree and echo with Robert's point. But we do believe that across all our businesses on a global scale, particularly when we think about our back-office functions, that we do have some significant opportunities that we can unlock. We have been actively working on those measures over the course of the last 12 months, particularly looking at PEC. But we do believe that there's a lot more opportunities we can do as we broaden the scope of that as we move forward. And then Brian, just in relation to your question on Foxtel and the impairment. We do look at this from a DCF perspective and also from a market multiple perspective. And clearly, there has been an impact that's adversely affected our trends resulting in lower expected forecast subscribers. And the impact of COVID-19 is expected to have clearly an adverse impact on advertising OTT to customers and commercial subscription revenues in the near-term. So when we combine all those, we thought it was appropriate to take an impairment on Foxtel."

            "name": "Robert Thomson",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. We are operating in a different difficult time, so this will be a rather different distant experience. Before the business of the day, I sincerely hope that all on this call, each of our investors, our business partners and their families are safe during this exacting era. Every business and family is facing challenges, and our thoughts, in particular, are for those who are suffering under the curse of COVID-19 and have had to deal with complications from this dreaded disease. For our company, the safety of our employees has obviously been paramount. And many of our journalists have displayed much courage in recent months, including reporting from Wuhan, during the intense first phase of what has become a pandemic. I would also like to honor, Anthony Causi, who passed at a relatively young age, by which time he had already become a legendary sports photographer for the New York Post. As noted in our 8-K filing with the SEC last month, we expected a broad impact on our business from the pandemic's inevitable economic consequences. We were affected somewhat in Q3, and those effects were likely to be significantly more pronounced in the fourth quarter. As we expect this impact to continue in the near-term, significant cost reductions have been implemented across the company and additional steps will be taken in coming months. These cuts are designed to deal with the short-term exigencies and to reposition the company for long-term growth. There will obviously be an impact on executive compensation. For many senior executives, bonuses are the largest component of their cash compensation, and this will be reduced by at least 20%. The cuts will be led by our Executive Chairman, Rupert Murdoch, who is voluntarily foregoing his entire cash bonus for the current fiscal year. And as Chief Executive, I will forgo 75% of my annual cash bonus. In addition, our Board of Directors have decided to reduce their cash compensation. These significant cost reductions of all kinds across the company will clearly have a positive impact on our total segment EBITDA and our cash position and help mitigate some of the effects of the pandemic. We obviously leave open the possibility of further compensation cuts next fiscal year depending on the ongoing impact of the crisis. Turning now to the third quarter results for fiscal year 2020. Our revenues declined 8% to $2.3 billion, including a $78 million, or 3% impact from adverse currency movements. Total segment EBITDA was down, although only 2% to $242 million. It is worth highlighting that operationally, adjusting for currencies, acquisitions and disposals and other items, mentioned in our release, our adjusted revenues were down 4%, but our adjusted total segment EBITDA rose 1%. Reported results also include a $1.1 billion non-cash write-down, mostly attributable to Foxtel. At the News and Information Services segment, the sale of News America Marketing has formally closed. This is a significant step in terms of enhancing shareholder value and part of the continuing simplification of our company. A thorough reevaluation of our assets continues and a strategic review of our community and regional original newspapers in Australia is at an advanced stage. We are also reviewing ways to improve transparency in our segment disclosure, which will enable investors to better appreciate the inherent value in and the growth potential of Dow Jones, which we believe is the best business news and analysis brand in the world. We are working toward making that company's potential more obvious and to highlighting its various strengths, certainly relative to other business brands and, for example, to the New York Times. Speaking of demand for premium content. As you know, we have entered into valuable partnerships with Apple and Facebook for use of our world-class journalism. Clearly, there are harbingers of positive change with Google, where the CEO, Sundar Pichai, has shown a more enlightened socially empathetic attitude to journalism. In the past, some in Silicon Valley sought to create a system of petty patronage through philanthropic handouts and contentious SOPs, seemingly designed to institutionalize a mendicant media. Enlightened executives at Google patently seek more meaningful changes to a dysfunctional ecosystem. The terms of trade in the digital world are certainly changing. The regulatory pressure is also intensifying as two weeks ago, the Australian government announced the introduction of a mandatory code that would require the larger digital companies to pay for content and to adjust their algorithms to give additional weight to original news. It is absolutely crucial that more be understood about the character, the power and the potential manipulation of algorithms and data. A recent Wall Street Journal report on Amazon's business practices showed the potential danger of companies having a dominant horizontal marketplace and selling their own products in segment verticals. In essence, exploiting proprietary marketplace data and competing with and potentially undermining their clients. In the third quarter, News and Information Services improved in profitability for the second straight quarter with 15% growth in segment EBITDA. Dow Jones recorded a particularly strong performance. Our digital paid subscriptions rose 20% year-on-year to more than 2.5 million average daily subs at quarter-end. The Wall Street Journal's digital paid subs were up 15% to more than 2 million, also a record. In recent days, The Journal has shown further acceleration, with total subscriptions reaching approximately 3 million for the first time, including 2.2 million digital-only. Overall, at the end of April, digital subscriptions rose over 20% year-on-year. Digital advertising at Dow Jones rose 25% year-over-year, despite the challenges we faced with ad sales later in March. This is in strikingly marked contrast to the performance of the New York Times, where digital ad revenue actually declined 8%. I should repeat those figures for the purpose of clarity. Digital advertising rose 25% at Dow Jones and it fell 8% at the New York Times. Dow Jones profit contribution improved and was a significant contributor to segment EBITDA growth, while EBITDA slumped 15% at the New York Times. We announced earlier this week that the Head of the Barron's Group, Almar Latour, will replace, Will Lewis, as CEO from the middle of this month. We will certainly leave Dow Jones in fine fettle and with enormous capacity for future growth. Speaking of Barron, subscriptions rose 14% year-over-year. And over the past four years, under Almar's leadership, the digital audience at Barron's Group Brands has quadrupled. During the quarter, the Wall Street digital network broke records and hit 196 million unique users in March, up 155% versus the prior year. Traffic was particularly strong at MarketWatch in March, where users more than tripled to 90 million compared to the prior year. The Professional Information Business reported a 5% increase in revenues, with risk and compliance, once again, demonstrating strength, rising 18% year-over-year. Elsewhere in the segment, newspaper digital subscriptions at News Corp Australia were up 24% year-over-year, rising to more than 613,000 a quarter, and with two-thirds of subscriptions at the Australian now are digital-only. At News UK, The Sun reached 164 million global unique visitors in March, representing a 17% increase over December, according to Google Analytics. While at The Times and Sunday Times, digital subscriptions grew 21% year-over-year to 345,000 and now account for nearly 60% of the base. Meanwhile, the New York Post advertising revenues in the quarter rose 19% and the post digital network had 169 million average monthly unique visitors, according to Google Analytics, up from 107 million in Q2. Turning now to book publishing. Revenue declines moderate at HarperCollins in the quarter compared to the first-half, while segment EBITDA grew year-over-year despite very difficult comparisons. As more people have moved to work and study from home, we've seen a revival in e-book sales. We are particularly pleased with early sales for Joanna Gaines, Magnolia Table, Volume 2, which already sits atop the U.S. best-seller lists. Digital real estate were showing solid progress through January and February, but began experiencing pandemic-related declines in March. Business at REA and realtor.com will depend on the reopening of the Australian and U.S. economies, but traffic to both sites remains encouraging. And realtor.com is outperforming the traffic trends of its house flipping competitor, according to the March ComScore data. In the Subscription Video Services segment, Kayo subscriptions rose to 444,000 in Q3, including trialist, which was more than double the prior year, and Kayo also showed strong growth over the prior quarter. That figure has obviously been adversely affected in recent weeks by the suspension of sports in Australia, as we disclosed in the earnings release. We are in serious negotiations with the major sports over a fundamental reset of rights costs. Susan will discuss the possible accounting impacts shortly. In coming weeks, we plan to launch our entertainment streaming product and expect that there will be strong demand, given the power of our media portfolio's marketing platform and the nascent demand in Australia. We're also very excited by the multi-year deal with WarnerMedia announced this week. That means Foxtel will be the exclusive home in Australia for HBO, this is soon to launch HBO Max and other WarnerMedia hits. Let me now turn to the lingering impact of COVID-19, which began to have an effect towards third quarter's end, but clearly will be a major factor in our Q4 results, as we signaled in our 8-K filing last month. I would first like to commend our leaders and our employees around the globe as we rapidly and successfully moved approximately 90% of our workforce, around 25,000 people into a work from in-home environment. Looking at the longer-term, we have clear plans for addressing the immediate challenges we face and for emerging vigorously on the other side of this crisis. This will not be done by random cost-cutting, but by strategic decisions about the business we need to fashion for a profitable future. That strategy is informed by a candid, assessment of our capabilities and deficiencies and a clear sense that the business environment will be very different when the world finally returns to the new abnormal. It is worth noting at this crucial time that News Corp continues to have a strong balance sheet. As of March 31, we have $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents. And in addition, we have access to a $750 million corporate revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. That bedrock of financial stability will help us weather the category-5 storm, as will the power of our brands and the energy and the creativity of our people. The headwinds will buffer the company in the short-term, but I'm extremely positive about our prospects for delivering long-term growth and increasing shareholder value. Now for more particulars on our results in this quarter, I turn to Susan Panuccio. Well, thanks, Alexia. Look, in terms of the subscribers are, obviously, we have had strong growth in U.S. subscriptions. And I think the thing to remember about Wall Street Journal subscriptions is that, once you have a subscriber, you also have an opportunity to up-sell. And so we're particularly seeing growth, for example, in subscriptions coming from MarketWatch to The Journal and from MarketWatch to Barron's and as well as that from The Journal to Barron's. And then for the more specialist, Wall Street Journal subscribers, there's an opportunity to sell them \u2013 to up-sell them to our premium business products, which obviously have a higher yield. In terms of advertising, clearly, traffic has been particularly strong. There had been, as you may well be aware, some concerns early in the COVID crisis about blocking of ads related to COVID crisis coverage. Gradually, that problem has diminished. And so we are noticing that the amount of advertising we're getting is matching, not quite, but to some extent, the significant increases in traffic we've had across the Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch. We noticed that tech advertising has increased. Custom advertising is also on the rise, and to a certain extent, programmatic. But I think for our business, quite frankly, it's an extraordinary opportunity, because big clients are coming straight to the Wall Street Journal and to our other publishing houses around the world. And they want to deal directly with us rather than necessarily through an advertising agency. And while this is at the moment, a short-term phenomenon, there are indications that this may very well become a long-term trend. And if I could further complement Susan by saying that what we've noticed, for example, among Wall Street Journal leaders on Apple News+ is that, historically, there've been, shall we say, a disproportionate number of men reading the Wall Street Journal, the breakdown is around 75% male, 25% female. Just at this moment, the readership of the Wall Street Journal on the Apple News+ side is majority women, minority men. Entcho, first of all, on sports rights, obviously, it's inappropriate to go into detail at this stage. But there obviously needs to be a fundamental reset. The idea that things will suddenly turn to normal as season is absurd. It's not just the quantity of games, it's the quality of the experience, and that has obviously been diminished. And that reset has to apply longer-term to rights in Australia. In essence, there is a new reset reality. Well, I'll take the second question first, Craig. Clearly, we're constantly reviewing costs. And that is cost in headquarters where there have been significant reductions in recent days. And right through where we're looking for efficiencies in tax spend. We're looking for the efficiencies that come from the closer coordination that really has been under way in recent years, it's not a new phenomenon. But it gives us an opportunity to look across businesses very, very closely, measured at different cost levels and respond appropriately. What we're not going to do is cut cost in a way that undermines the editorial integrity of the leading news organization in the world. Brian, clearly, the simplification was a preexisting program. But to a certain extent, you may well be correct in that various things have been expedited during this period of crisis. What I would like to say specifically around simplification is that, clearly, we're pleased that the NAM transaction has progressed. Actually, we had full fit the Charlesbank who have preexisting specialist expertise in that area, we'll be able to make a significant success of the business. And you can tell from the tenor of our content comments about Australia that there is obviously a strategic review of our print holdings well under way. So our simplification process is far from finished. And part of that is that we're very keen to highlight the value inherent in, for example, Dow Jones, which we reported vastly superior numbers to those of the New York Times, but whose figures are not fully obvious in the current News and Information Services segment. Now if you think of the journey in recent years, the sale of Amplify, the early sale of the local media group at Dow Jones, the NAM sale. And on the other side of the ledger, the acquisition of Realtor, the purchase of Harlequin, we are a rather different, more specialized company than we were a few years ago."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the News Corp Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. Media will be on a listen-only basis. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin. Mike, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichael Florin: Thank you very much, Eduardo. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp\u2019s Fiscal Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about an hour ago, and it\u2019s now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We\u2019ll open with some prepared remarks, and then we\u2019ll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp\u2019s business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp\u2019s Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release. With that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\nRobert Thomson: Thank you, Mike. Before we begin the formalities, I would like to express my sincere thanks to our readers, customers and employees in Australia, who have combined to respond thoughtfully and meaningfully to the tragic bushfires, which has had profound consequences for many communities. In particular, our reporters and editors and photographers have done an extraordinary job in tracking the fires and highlighting the impact of the tragedy on towns and regions that will take much time to recover. We are pleased that the company and its founders have pledged more than AUD 11 million to the cause and our company has continuing fundraising campaigns that will contribute significantly more over the coming months. We also thank the many companies, which had partnered with News Corp to make a positive difference for Australian communities. Turning to our results, as we anticipated the second quarter was somewhat soft for various businesses. However, we expect improvement in the second half as real estate markets in Australia show signs of gradual recovery, and we continue to progress with Opcity at Move, which should benefit the performance of our digital real estate businesses. We also expect faster growth in digital revenues at Dow Jones from the previously announced content licensing arrangements, particularly with Facebook, and improvement in book publishing based on the timing of the release schedule. Meanwhile, we are on the cusp of the seasonal selling peak for Foxtel, given that the main winter sports as soon to launch and Kayo, our streaming service, has already started seeing upturn in new subscribers even though we are still in the midst of the low season for sales. We took an important step on our path towards simplification with the sale of Unruly and notable development, which will yield financial benefits for us going forward. And I am pleased to say that following our strategic review of News America Marketing, we are engaged in negotiations for a sale of that business. These ongoing simplification efforts shine a brighter light on the intrinsic and increasing value of our core assets, which have been tightly unappreciated and underappreciated for too long. For the quarter, the company reported total revenues of approximately $2.5 billion with total segment EBITDA of $355 million. This represents a decline of 6% in revenues and 4% in profitability versus the prior year. Foreign exchange fluctuations affected our results with a $50 million effect on revenues, or negative 3%. As I mentioned last quarter, we are now seeing the early benefits from our long battle for equitable treatment by the dominant tech platforms. In particular, our deals with Apple and Facebook are beginning to yield financial dividends, and we welcome their respect for the premium journalism produced by the talented professionals in News Corp. There are also positive signs that Sundar Pichai at Google has a thoughtful appreciation for the profound social influence of high-quality journalism. In Digital Real Estate Services, listing volume in Australia remains challenged. But the trend improved somewhat in the quarter, particularly in Melbourne and Sydney. REA Group posted record traffic in October and buyer inquiries were up 37% in Q2 versus the prior year. These signs point to a gradual recovery this year in the Australian housing market, which will obviously be efficacious for REA\u2019s revenue. At Move, operator of realtor.com profit contribution showed a substantial improvement in the quarter. Real estate revenue grew 4% as we transition to the referral model, which had a natural impact on the timing of revenues. Key indicators for the property market are encouraging and we expect to see improvements that Move in the second half of the year largely due to the progress at Opcity. We also envisage increasing monetization of relevant adjacencies as we further leverage our deep transaction data, which is made significantly more valuable by Opcity\u2019s ability to define and refine leads. Despite Q2 being a weaker quarter seasonally, we nonetheless saw traffic up 9% year-over-year and then more than 30% increase in page views based on internal metrics. Throughout most of calendar year 2019, realtor.com continued to gain audience share relative to Zillow and Trulia according to comScore. We welcomed that David Doctorow to Move this week as the new CEO. David is savvy digital commerce leader comes from eBay and had previously worked at Expedia. His technological vision and marketing prowess will serve realtor.com and News Corp well in the years ahead. Tracey Fellows, who ably served as acting new CEO, is now focusing on her role as President of Global Digital Real Estate and will be emphasizing the development about burgeoning digital real estate assets. Speaking the new talent of News Corp, I\u2019m also pleased to note the arrival of David Kline as News Corp\u2019s Chief Technology Officer. David was at Viacom for the past decade and earlier at Discovery Communications, and he\u2019s expert at driving innovations and efficiency in global content businesses. David will ensure that our global shared services are robust at costs and manage institutely, security integrity is heightened, and technological creativity is enhanced. The News and Information Services segment showed tangible improvements in the quarter. The segment EBITDA increasing 27% versus the prior year. Dow Jones had another strong quarter with 17% growth in digital-only subscribers including 13% growth in Wall Street Journal, digital subscriptions year-over-year. The journal\u2019s total subscriber base continues to set records with almost 2.7 million subscribers as of the end of the second quarter and more recently, Dow Jones consumers\u2019 subscriptions achieved the new record surpassing 3.5 million with the journal crossing the two million digital subscriptions mark. I would like to highlight the continuing success of risk and compliance, where revenues grew a healthy 21%. In fact, Risk and Compliance has now seen over 20% revenue growth for 12 straight quarters. We believe the intrinsic value of this business is rising, validated by recent transactions in the sector, where acquisitions and commanded multiples of 20 to 25 times EBITDA. Risk and Compliance is not only a jewel in the crown at Dow Jones, but is on the way to becoming one of News Corp\u2019s most valuable assets. Our efforts to leverage The Wall Street Journal\u2019s content continue to yield benefits and are clearly seen in the success of the journal, the podcast produced with Spotify. Since September launch, there have been 20 million downloads. We still have work to do in perfecting podcast, but the acquisition of wireless in the UK has given us direct access to a professional pool of broadcast help. And at the WSJ, we have just begun recognizing revenues from our Facebook content licensing agreement with that contribution meaningfully increasing in the second half of the fiscal year under the terms of that contract. Barron\u2019s subscribers hit a record at 615,000 in Q2, up 8% over the prior year, and we launched a new show on the Fox Business Network during the quarter. Barron\u2019s Roundtable, which already has a full roster of sponsors. In the UK, where political stability and leadership have relatedly returned. News UK had a strong quarter reflected in results from The Times, Sunday Times and The Sun. We saw higher ad revenues at News UK in Q2 with digital growth outpacing print declines, led by meaningful improvement at The Sun, whose audience grew to approximately 134 million global average monthly unique users in Q2, an increase of 9% on Q1 according to Google Analytics. The Times and Sunday Times added digital readers and reached 320,000 subscriptions in Q2, up 19% year-over-year. Speaking of these publications, News UK, last week announced the creation of Times Radio, a new digital station, which will bring together the expertise of The Times and the Sunday Times, and Wireless. The Sun also moved to monetize its already substantial American audience by launching a U.S. based website last month. Early signs strongly suggest that he\u2019s tapping into an underserved growing and potentially lucrative forums. In Australia, where the economy has been a little listless and currency relatively weak. Our mastheads expanded to more than 566,000 digital subscriptions as of the end of the quarter, 23% year-over-year growth. That figure is led by the continued digital transformation at the Australia with 65% of total subscribers now, digital-only. In the U.S., New York Post revenues rose with digital advertising again, reaching over 70% of total advertising revenues and achieving more than 20% revenue growth. The post digital network had an audience of 95.2 million unique visitors in December, up over 30% year-over-year. Also in the U.S., just last week, we launched news.com in beta, delivering a uniquely-wide range of automated and curated journalism to readers on mobile and digital. news.com offers prominence for providence, and I used to bring as much data as possible to publishers, while subscription sites will not be punished in the ranking system, but combining sophisticated artificial intelligence with professional editing, news.com exposes readers to a vast array of news and views from left to right, from large publishers to small, national and regional and from every state in the country. In its first week of soft launch, news had 258,000 users according to Google Analytics. I recommend that you all downloaded the news app. If you don\u2019t use, you simply don\u2019t know. Turning to Subscription Video Services. Foxtel subscribers increased by 3% to 2.95 million. Benefiting from the launch of Kayo in November 2018. We are in the traditional low season for sports subscriptions, but Kayo had 372,000 subscribers and 350,040 paid subscribers as of the quarter\u2019s end, up from 42,000 at the same time last year. As of February 5, Kayo had over 370,000 paid subscribers. A positive trajectory as we head into the highest season for sports in Australia. Customer reviews are overwhelmingly positive, and user interface and experience of world-class, in fact, they are peerless. Foxtel remains focused on the user experience and strengthening the core foundation of its business, including its powerful entertainment lineup. Now, featuring six new Fox branded channels, more video on demand content or refresh to move the offering and a partnership with Netflix among various other streaming services. Foxtel also completed key content agreements with NBCU and Discovery in the quarter, providing more on-demand content, so that it is the go-to-provider of programming in Australia. Finally at Foxtel, we are planning our entertainment OTT product, which is built off the Kayo system and like Kayo will help maximize the value of existing rights and reach binge conscious consumers outside our traditional low. In Book Publishing, we had tough comparisons with the prior year though HarperCollins did see better growth sequentially in digital through the continued expansion of audiobooks. David Walliams\u2019 latest children\u2019s book The Beast Of Buckingham Palace did well in the UK. We are confident that we should see improvement in the second half, given the timing of the release schedule the continued popularity of the Dutch House by Ann Patchett and the recent successful release of Profiles in Corruption by Peter Schweizer. We also look forward to the April release of Volume 2 of Joanna Gaines, highly popular Magnolia Table. We have also just released books by Jessica Simpson and Carrie Underwood and in May, we expect to benefit from the release of the film, The Woman in the Window based on autonomous best seller by A. J. Finn. To summarize, the first half was as expected that had sluggish, but we see progress across many of the segments in the second half. It is increasingly clear that News Corp is harvesting benefits from being a creator of content as markets, societies and the big tech platforms appreciate its commercial value. We are simplifying the structure of the company with a view to maximizing its value for investors. As a result, for example, the inherent value of our digital real estate assets and Dow Jones will be more obvious to the benefit of all our shareholders. And now, for more details on the second quarter and financial 2020, I\u2019d turn to Susan Panuccio.\nSusan Panuccio: Thank you, Robert. turning to the financials, fiscal 2020 second quarter total revenues were approximately $2.5 billion, down 6% versus the prior year and total segment EBITDA was $355 million down 4% versus the prior year. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, currency fluctuations, and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues fell 4% and total segment EBITDA decreased 3%, a notable improvement from the prior quarters EBITDA performance. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.14 as compared to $0.16 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.18 in the quarter flat with the prior year. Turning now to the individual operating segments. in News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.2 billion, down 1% versus the prior year. on an adjusted basis, revenues were flat reflecting a material improvement from the prior quarter. Advertising fell 5% while circulation and subscriptions grew 3% despite currency headwinds, digital revenues for Dow Jones and the newspaper mastheads represented 39% of their combined revenues, up from 35% in the prior year. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $142 million, up 27% from $112 million, benefiting from the growth at News UK and Dow Jones. There was a one-time benefit of approximately $22 million due to the settlement of certain warranty-related claims in the UK. However, even absent that benefit, we saw growth in segment EBITDA. This was driven by the UK, Dow Jones and the narrowing losses at the New York post, partially offset by lower contributions from news Australia and news America Marketing. Similar to the first quarter, we reclassified approximately $8 million of cost in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 from the other segment, the News and Information Services segment. These reallocated costs are related to various initiatives including news IQ, our global programmatic effort and certain shared technology services that directly benefit the News and Information Services segment, as part of our ongoing efforts to leverage our global scale to lower cost. Turning now to the segment highlights. at Dow Jones, consumer circulation revenues grew at a healthy 5%, reflecting 17% growth in digital-paid subscribers across Dow Jones consumer products. This includes 13% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at The Wall Street Journal. In the aggregate, The Wall Street Journal subscriber base reached approximately $2.6 million. professional Information Business revenues accounted for 27% of Dow Jones revenues this quarter, growing 8% to $115 million maintaining momentum from the first quarter. As Robert mentioned, the key growth engine continues to be in risk and compliance, which grew a healthy 21% this quarter. This is a highly profitable and scalable business and is on track to approach $160 million of revenues this fiscal year. The Newswires product also showed growth benefiting from licensing deals with Bloomberg and FactSet, while Factiva was stable. advertising at Dow Jones was weaker this quarter, falling about 5% compared to the prior year. Digital accounted for 43% of advertising revenues. digital advertising was lower in the second quarter, primarily due to tough comparatives from the prior year, which showed significant programmatic growth from MarketWatch. However, we have seen a strong start so far this quarter although visibility remains limited. while it is very early days, we are making progress on monetizing valuable third-party partnerships, which is our key strategic focus as we expand the reach of Dow Jones and the Wall Street Journal across digital platforms and markets. These include deals with Twitter from WSJ; watch now videos our week-day podcast, the journal with Spotify and our recent content partnerships with Apple and Facebook. Overall, Dow Jones posted 4% revenue growth and another quarter of increased segment EBITDA contribution. elsewhere across our news portfolio, advertising conditions were mixed. News UK\u2019s advertising revenues rose 5% on both the reported and local currency basis representing the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth on a local currency basis, led by digital advertising growth at The Sun and moderating print declines. Advertising conditions in Australia remained challenging, but improved slightly from the prior quarter rate with revenues down 11% on a reported basis and down 7% in local currency. for circulation revenues, the increase in cover prices and digital subscribers that both news Australia and New UK helped mitigate print volume declines and Australian currency headwinds. Finally, at News America Marketing, revenue fell 4%, an improvement from quarter one. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $501 million, down 11% versus $562 million in the prior year, of which $25 million or 5% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency. on an adjusted basis, revenues declined 6%. Broadcast subscriber trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter with the revenue decline, driven by a lower broadcast subscriber base and changes to the broadcast subscriber package mix as well as modestly lower pay-per-view revenues. Revenue declines were partially offset by expanding OTT revenues. As a reminder, we lacked a price increase from last year, which also impacted the year-over-year comparison. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $70 million, down 17% from the prior year driven by the revenue decline, partially offset by lower total costs including programming and transmission costs as the team at Foxtel continues to focus on streamlining business. Turning to the KPIs. Foxtel\u2019s closing paid subscriber base was approximately $3 million as of December 31, reflecting a 3% growth with 96,000 subscribers versus the prior year driven by the launch of Kayo in November 2018. total paying OTT subscribers reached 684,000, up 73% versus last year. We have seen over the past year that Kayo\u2019s paid customers will increase around key exclusive events with the conclusion of Australia\u2019s popular winter sports and the Rugby World Cup. The number of paid subscribers in Kayo fell from the prior quarter. notwithstanding Kayo viewer engagement continues to be strong to the subscribers watching an average of 5.3 weekly hours with the average customer watching seven of the 50 different sports available on Kayo each week. We\u2019ve also been pleased with increasing brand awareness, the stability of the platform and more importantly, customer feedback in relation to the user experience. Kayo\u2019s solid subscriber base gives us optimism as it enters its second year ahead of the prime winter sports selling season. The team continues to work on a new OTT entertainment product built on the Kayo technology platform with the commercial launch anticipation in the fourth quarter. in the second quarter, broadcast churn is 16%, which is slightly higher than the 15.6% in the prior year. Foxtel direct channel churn of 14% with 2.5 points lower than the prior year, which was the lowest second quarter rating for year. like last quarter, the main driver behind the higher churn is coming from the lower ARPU Telstra wholesale customers on the expiring contracts from the past 12 to 24 months. broadcast ARPU declined about 1% to over AUD 77 per month. In November, we completed the refinancing of a significant portion of Foxtel debt, which extended maturities for at least three years. more details will be available in the 10-Q filing. At Book Publishing, HarperCollins revenues for the quarter fell 11%, $442 million and segment EBITDA fell 28% to $63 million. As we have previously indicated, the revenue decline this quarter was primarily due to a tough comparison with the prior year, which included Homebody by Joanna Gaines, Girl, Wash Your Face by Rachel Hollis, The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas and hired back with sales from the subtle art by Mark Manson. The declines were partially offset by new releases, which includes the Pioneer Woman Cooks: The New Frontier by Ree Drummond and The Beast of Buckingham Palace by David Walliams. We saw a 5% improvement in digital sales compared to the prior year, primarily due to the 17% growth in downloadable audio books. Overall digital sales represented 19% of consumer revenues for the quarter. Progress is being made with our non-publishing ventures. We expect the partnerships with Elizabeth Gabler\u2019s group of Sony pictures and Bell Media to provide a longer-term payoff. These partnerships underscore the value of our intellectual property and should allow us to capitalize on other revenue streams with very modest capital outlay. At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues were down 5% to $294 million, of which foreign currency fluctuations had a negative impact of $8 million or 2%. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 3%. REA Group revenues were down 8% or down 4% in local currency. The decline moderated from last quarter, but the benefit from higher yield and improved product mix in the residential business were more than offset by a 12% year-over-year decline in the new listing volume during the quarter although the rate improved in each month during the quarter. Traffic page views, app launches, all trends at higher and we are seeing key indicators pointing to a gradual property market recovery. in the developer market, new project commencements fell 33% in the quarter and the associated revenues have remained challenged. Please refer to REA\u2019s earnings release and a conference call that just concluded for additional details and comments on the outlook. move revenues declined 1% to $121 million, although importantly, real estate revenues grew 4%. revenue trends slowed in the quarter, primarily due to the lapping at the Opcity acquisition in October 2018 and the subsequent transition of leads from the core league model to the referral model, which has a tiny impact as revenue is recognized when a transaction closes. the increasing real estate revenues, which represented 82% of total move revenues was led by growth in audience and high lead volume together with an increased penetration of local expert, a local branded product. Results at Opcity remain encouraging as we saw improvement in the KPIs across the 17 markets we are testing including and most importantly close rates. We are very encouraged by the results and continued to anticipate improvements at move in the second half. on audience, average monthly unique users for the quarter at realtor.com were $59 million rising 9% versus the prior year and a gainful, very strong year-over-year growth in page views and time spent on site. segment EBITDA sell 2% or $118 million; however, on an adjusted basis, EBITDA rose 2%. results reflect increased profit contribution at move, benefiting from phasing of marketing, restructuring changes implemented late last year and the lapping of investment costs at opcity, offset by lower REA revenues. I would now like to talk about some of the themes in the upcoming quarter. at News and Information Services, overall advertising trends thus far remain similar to the prior quarter levels, although visibility remains limited, we expect to see improvements at Dow Jones from increased licensing revenues from previously announced content licensing agreements notably from Facebook. As I noted, we have also seen a pickup in digital advertising at Dow Jones so far this quarter. Overall, we would expect to see improvements compared to the prior year among our news brands although news America Marketing likely remains challenged. in Subscription Video Services for the third quarter, we expect approximately $10 million of costs related to the accelerated amortization that we previously noted and modestly higher marketing costs in front of the key winter sports selling season. However, we expect full-year costs to be relatively stable with the prior year in local currency given the lower total expenses this quarter as I noted earlier. in Book Publishing, as Robert mentioned, we expect the timing and slate of new releases combined with less challenging prior-year comparisons in the fourth quarter to lead to improvement in book publishing in the second half. and at Digital Real Estate Services, as noted in their release, REA anticipates more favorable listing conditions in the second half of financial year 2020 to deliver a stronger revenue outcome. Please see their release for more details. We also expect improvements in the second half with the ongoing progress at Opcity. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] All right. And I\u2019ll take our first question from Kane Hannan at Goldman Sachs. please go ahead.\nKane Hannan: Good morning. Just two from me please. Firstly, to ease up those around the expected timing on that NAM final negotiations. And also your latest thoughts around the use of these proceeds. Now, the Foxtel debt financing has been finalized? And then secondly, just on the entertainment OTT plans. What should we read into the HBO max trademark that was recently filed in Australia? And can you comment on how you think about the importance of HBO OTT or Foxtel\u2019s entertainment offering? Thanks.\nRobert Thomson: First of all, News America Marketing was indeed marketed. We\u2019re engaged in active negotiations for the sale of the company. And I\u2019m happy to report that those discussions are well advanced. Frankly, the company\u2019s balance of revenues have shifted from being a newspaper insert company to being more of an installed marketing company. The letter is certainly a profitable business, but not core to our competencies. I won\u2019t comment on the use of the funds. as for HBO-related questions, you really should pose those to HBO. What I would say is that we have an unparalleled collection of programming at foxtel, where unlike U.S. cable companies in the past week ranges across a real range of providers. And there\u2019s no doubt, for example, with recent renewals of Fox, NBCU, Sony, Discovery, BBC, we still have two more years of HBO that we\u2019re in very good shape.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Kane. Eduardo, we\u2019ll take our next question please.\nOperator: Yes. I\u2019ll take the next question from Entcho Raykovski of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nEntcho Raykovski: Hi, Robert. Hi, Susan. My question is around Kayo, obviously subs the client in the quarter, you\u2019ve pointed to some states and all factors driving these. I\u2019m just interested in how is that decline is compared to your expectations. Are you a little bit surprised that that subs it down over the period? And I mean do you feel that we have now reached close to full penetration for Kayo. It\u2019s fairly \u2013 fairly seems to launch. And then just related to that, I mean, do you think pricing speaks to the right level? Do you feel like you need additional content? Any comments would be helpful.\nRobert Thomson: Entcho, it\u2019s a very early phase of the evolution of Kayo and it has been an exponential evolution. If you look at really only been in existence for just over a year. And as you know, we are very much in the low sports season in Australia. Our crickets fascinating, sometimes antediluvian as it can be is not as compelling for crowds in Australia as Aussie Rules or Rugby League. But cricket has certainly made a positive difference to audience retention. But the winter sports in Australia are about congregation and audience aggregation and we\u2019re on the cusp of that selling season. There\u2019s no doubt that Kayo is an absolutely world class OTT offering, also no doubt that it has a hell of a runway. As you know, the customer reviews are resoundingly positive. I mean, streaming technology without equal in Australia, is unrivaled and non-pareil [ph]. And let us be clear, this is not a 699 offering, but a premium $25 a month product.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Entcho. Eduardo, we\u2019ll take our next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alan Gould at Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nAlan Gould: Thank you. I have just two questions please. First for Susan, can you just talk where the Foxtel debt stands now, including this Telstra debt and what kind of covenants it has and how it stands relative to its covenants? And Robert, for marked philosophical question. Warren Buffett has given up on local newspapers in the U.S. in the U.S., you have a national newspaper without local newspapers. How important are the local newspapers in Australia to your national newspapers and the rest of your Australian business? Thank you.\nSusan Panuccio: Hi, Alan. Just in relation to the Foxtel refinancing, you\u2019d be able to find all the details in the 10-Q. They will have the different charges with the interest rates and the maturity by every individual chart in there What I would say though is in relation to the covenants; we did put $700 million of a shareholder loan in subordinated, in order to provide plenty of head room in relation to the covenants. So, we have absolutely no concerns at this stage that there\u2019s any issues with those.\nRobert Thomson: And as for papers, Alan, I think yours was a philosophical question and I\u2019ll give you an even more philosophical answer. Is it the ecosystem generally can use content is in the midst of two levels of transition. We have to change the ecosystem for news content. It is digitally dysfunction, which affects national and local papers. And then our papers, whether local or national, have to transform themselves within that challenging landscape. Unless fundamental changes take place at both levels, the havens will not be, cannot be in equilibrium. And let\u2019s be clear, we are literally dealing with fundamental changes in the character and valued content, and it is absolutely fair to say that with Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch\u2019s leadership, no company has been as influential on this issue as News Corp.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Alan. Eduardo, we\u2019ll take our next question please.\nOperator: So our next question comes from Craig Huber at Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nCraig Huber: Yes, hi. I got a few questions. You can just go one at a time please. On your last call, Robert, you mentioned a little bit today, I\u2019d like to hear a little bit further about your relationship with Facebook. The Wall Street Journal payment there, is a room there, is just kind of think out here in the coming years to actually expand that relationship and the size of monetary payment, what\u2019s the benefit for you? That\u2019s my first question.\nRobert Thomson: Craig, obviously, that\u2019s an evolving relationship and not just with Facebook, but with the other digital platforms, where \u2013 I can\u2019t obviously go into specific details about the agreement, but it is a substantial agreement, it creates new precedents. We host the content, we sell the advertising, and Facebook pays a premium for premium journalism and up until that point, that kind of precedent hasn\u2019t been established and it is a precedent that will resonate.\nCraig Huber: Do you see any, Robert, the other platform that\u2019s like a Google or something coming down the pipe at some point when we get to payments there or is that not realistic?\nRobert Thomson: I couldn\u2019t possibly comment on other platforms other than the observation I made about the real appreciation of Sundar Pichai for the importance of high-quality journalism for society.\nCraig Huber: Okay.\nMichael Florin: Eduardo, we\u2019ll take our next question please.\nOperator: And so our next question comes from Brian Han at Morningstar. Please go ahead.\nBrian Han: Robert, now that you\u2019ve sold the Unruly and put NAM on the sales book, would it be fair to say that assets, such as the Wireless Group, storyful and SkyNews are also being looked at? And also Susan, in News and Information, did you guys change the prior quarter\u2019s EBITDA number from 120 to 112? And if so, why?\nRobert Thomson: Regarding your question of simplification, obviously, we love all our assets and we just acquired wireless, which is playing a beneficial role in the development of \u2013 for example, as I mentioned, [indiscernible]. Look, simplification is an ongoing process with a clear cogen purpose, to make the inherent value of the company more obvious to investors. You may have noticed, it was a complexity to the company given the mix of assets and there\u2019d be great transition in some of the sectors. And the more \u2013 frankly, that we can highlight the value of individual assets, the more that the positive trajectory and the transparency of the company will become obvious.\nSusan Panuccio: And Brian, just in relation to your question around the News and Information Services EBITDA, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we \u2013 this is similar to what we did last quarter. We had about $8 million of costs that we reallocated into that segment from the other segments and those costs related to various initiatives including news IQ, which is our global programmatic effort, and shared technology services that directly impact on that particular segment, which we continually look at as we look to leverage our global scale.\nBrian Han: Thank you.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Brian. Eduardo, we\u2019ll take our next question please.\nOperator: It appears there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to Michael Florin for any additional closing remarks.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Eduardo and thank you for all participating. We look forward to talking to you soon. Have a great day. Take care.\nOperator: This now concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Robert. turning to the financials, fiscal 2020 second quarter total revenues were approximately $2.5 billion, down 6% versus the prior year and total segment EBITDA was $355 million down 4% versus the prior year. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, currency fluctuations, and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues fell 4% and total segment EBITDA decreased 3%, a notable improvement from the prior quarters EBITDA performance. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.14 as compared to $0.16 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.18 in the quarter flat with the prior year. Turning now to the individual operating segments. in News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.2 billion, down 1% versus the prior year. on an adjusted basis, revenues were flat reflecting a material improvement from the prior quarter. Advertising fell 5% while circulation and subscriptions grew 3% despite currency headwinds, digital revenues for Dow Jones and the newspaper mastheads represented 39% of their combined revenues, up from 35% in the prior year. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $142 million, up 27% from $112 million, benefiting from the growth at News UK and Dow Jones. There was a one-time benefit of approximately $22 million due to the settlement of certain warranty-related claims in the UK. However, even absent that benefit, we saw growth in segment EBITDA. This was driven by the UK, Dow Jones and the narrowing losses at the New York post, partially offset by lower contributions from news Australia and news America Marketing. Similar to the first quarter, we reclassified approximately $8 million of cost in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 from the other segment, the News and Information Services segment. These reallocated costs are related to various initiatives including news IQ, our global programmatic effort and certain shared technology services that directly benefit the News and Information Services segment, as part of our ongoing efforts to leverage our global scale to lower cost. Turning now to the segment highlights. at Dow Jones, consumer circulation revenues grew at a healthy 5%, reflecting 17% growth in digital-paid subscribers across Dow Jones consumer products. This includes 13% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at The Wall Street Journal. In the aggregate, The Wall Street Journal subscriber base reached approximately $2.6 million. professional Information Business revenues accounted for 27% of Dow Jones revenues this quarter, growing 8% to $115 million maintaining momentum from the first quarter. As Robert mentioned, the key growth engine continues to be in risk and compliance, which grew a healthy 21% this quarter. This is a highly profitable and scalable business and is on track to approach $160 million of revenues this fiscal year. The Newswires product also showed growth benefiting from licensing deals with Bloomberg and FactSet, while Factiva was stable. advertising at Dow Jones was weaker this quarter, falling about 5% compared to the prior year. Digital accounted for 43% of advertising revenues. digital advertising was lower in the second quarter, primarily due to tough comparatives from the prior year, which showed significant programmatic growth from MarketWatch. However, we have seen a strong start so far this quarter although visibility remains limited. while it is very early days, we are making progress on monetizing valuable third-party partnerships, which is our key strategic focus as we expand the reach of Dow Jones and the Wall Street Journal across digital platforms and markets. These include deals with Twitter from WSJ; watch now videos our week-day podcast, the journal with Spotify and our recent content partnerships with Apple and Facebook. Overall, Dow Jones posted 4% revenue growth and another quarter of increased segment EBITDA contribution. elsewhere across our news portfolio, advertising conditions were mixed. News UK's advertising revenues rose 5% on both the reported and local currency basis representing the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth on a local currency basis, led by digital advertising growth at The Sun and moderating print declines. Advertising conditions in Australia remained challenging, but improved slightly from the prior quarter rate with revenues down 11% on a reported basis and down 7% in local currency. for circulation revenues, the increase in cover prices and digital subscribers that both news Australia and New UK helped mitigate print volume declines and Australian currency headwinds. Finally, at News America Marketing, revenue fell 4%, an improvement from quarter one. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $501 million, down 11% versus $562 million in the prior year, of which $25 million or 5% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency. on an adjusted basis, revenues declined 6%. Broadcast subscriber trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter with the revenue decline, driven by a lower broadcast subscriber base and changes to the broadcast subscriber package mix as well as modestly lower pay-per-view revenues. Revenue declines were partially offset by expanding OTT revenues. As a reminder, we lacked a price increase from last year, which also impacted the year-over-year comparison. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $70 million, down 17% from the prior year driven by the revenue decline, partially offset by lower total costs including programming and transmission costs as the team at Foxtel continues to focus on streamlining business. Turning to the KPIs. Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base was approximately $3 million as of December 31, reflecting a 3% growth with 96,000 subscribers versus the prior year driven by the launch of Kayo in November 2018. total paying OTT subscribers reached 684,000, up 73% versus last year. We have seen over the past year that Kayo's paid customers will increase around key exclusive events with the conclusion of Australia's popular winter sports and the Rugby World Cup. The number of paid subscribers in Kayo fell from the prior quarter. notwithstanding Kayo viewer engagement continues to be strong to the subscribers watching an average of 5.3 weekly hours with the average customer watching seven of the 50 different sports available on Kayo each week. We've also been pleased with increasing brand awareness, the stability of the platform and more importantly, customer feedback in relation to the user experience. Kayo's solid subscriber base gives us optimism as it enters its second year ahead of the prime winter sports selling season. The team continues to work on a new OTT entertainment product built on the Kayo technology platform with the commercial launch anticipation in the fourth quarter. in the second quarter, broadcast churn is 16%, which is slightly higher than the 15.6% in the prior year. Foxtel direct channel churn of 14% with 2.5 points lower than the prior year, which was the lowest second quarter rating for year. like last quarter, the main driver behind the higher churn is coming from the lower ARPU Telstra wholesale customers on the expiring contracts from the past 12 to 24 months. broadcast ARPU declined about 1% to over AUD 77 per month. In November, we completed the refinancing of a significant portion of Foxtel debt, which extended maturities for at least three years. more details will be available in the 10-Q filing. At Book Publishing, HarperCollins revenues for the quarter fell 11%, $442 million and segment EBITDA fell 28% to $63 million. As we have previously indicated, the revenue decline this quarter was primarily due to a tough comparison with the prior year, which included Homebody by Joanna Gaines, Girl, Wash Your Face by Rachel Hollis, The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas and hired back with sales from the subtle art by Mark Manson. The declines were partially offset by new releases, which includes the Pioneer Woman Cooks: The New Frontier by Ree Drummond and The Beast of Buckingham Palace by David Walliams. We saw a 5% improvement in digital sales compared to the prior year, primarily due to the 17% growth in downloadable audio books. Overall digital sales represented 19% of consumer revenues for the quarter. Progress is being made with our non-publishing ventures. We expect the partnerships with Elizabeth Gabler's group of Sony pictures and Bell Media to provide a longer-term payoff. These partnerships underscore the value of our intellectual property and should allow us to capitalize on other revenue streams with very modest capital outlay. At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues were down 5% to $294 million, of which foreign currency fluctuations had a negative impact of $8 million or 2%. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 3%. REA Group revenues were down 8% or down 4% in local currency. The decline moderated from last quarter, but the benefit from higher yield and improved product mix in the residential business were more than offset by a 12% year-over-year decline in the new listing volume during the quarter although the rate improved in each month during the quarter. Traffic page views, app launches, all trends at higher and we are seeing key indicators pointing to a gradual property market recovery. in the developer market, new project commencements fell 33% in the quarter and the associated revenues have remained challenged. Please refer to REA's earnings release and a conference call that just concluded for additional details and comments on the outlook. move revenues declined 1% to $121 million, although importantly, real estate revenues grew 4%. revenue trends slowed in the quarter, primarily due to the lapping at the Opcity acquisition in October 2018 and the subsequent transition of leads from the core league model to the referral model, which has a tiny impact as revenue is recognized when a transaction closes. the increasing real estate revenues, which represented 82% of total move revenues was led by growth in audience and high lead volume together with an increased penetration of local expert, a local branded product. Results at Opcity remain encouraging as we saw improvement in the KPIs across the 17 markets we are testing including and most importantly close rates. We are very encouraged by the results and continued to anticipate improvements at move in the second half. on audience, average monthly unique users for the quarter at realtor.com were $59 million rising 9% versus the prior year and a gainful, very strong year-over-year growth in page views and time spent on site. segment EBITDA sell 2% or $118 million; however, on an adjusted basis, EBITDA rose 2%. results reflect increased profit contribution at move, benefiting from phasing of marketing, restructuring changes implemented late last year and the lapping of investment costs at opcity, offset by lower REA revenues. I would now like to talk about some of the themes in the upcoming quarter. at News and Information Services, overall advertising trends thus far remain similar to the prior quarter levels, although visibility remains limited, we expect to see improvements at Dow Jones from increased licensing revenues from previously announced content licensing agreements notably from Facebook. As I noted, we have also seen a pickup in digital advertising at Dow Jones so far this quarter. Overall, we would expect to see improvements compared to the prior year among our news brands although news America Marketing likely remains challenged. in Subscription Video Services for the third quarter, we expect approximately $10 million of costs related to the accelerated amortization that we previously noted and modestly higher marketing costs in front of the key winter sports selling season. However, we expect full-year costs to be relatively stable with the prior year in local currency given the lower total expenses this quarter as I noted earlier. in Book Publishing, as Robert mentioned, we expect the timing and slate of new releases combined with less challenging prior-year comparisons in the fourth quarter to lead to improvement in book publishing in the second half. and at Digital Real Estate Services, as noted in their release, REA anticipates more favorable listing conditions in the second half of financial year 2020 to deliver a stronger revenue outcome. Please see their release for more details. We also expect improvements in the second half with the ongoing progress at Opcity. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A. Hi, Alan. Just in relation to the Foxtel refinancing, you'd be able to find all the details in the 10-Q. They will have the different charges with the interest rates and the maturity by every individual chart in there What I would say though is in relation to the covenants; we did put $700 million of a shareholder loan in subordinated, in order to provide plenty of head room in relation to the covenants. So, we have absolutely no concerns at this stage that there's any issues with those. And Brian, just in relation to your question around the News and Information Services EBITDA, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we \u2013 this is similar to what we did last quarter. We had about $8 million of costs that we reallocated into that segment from the other segments and those costs related to various initiatives including news IQ, which is our global programmatic effort, and shared technology services that directly impact on that particular segment, which we continually look at as we look to leverage our global scale."

            "name": "Robert Thomson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Before we begin the formalities, I would like to express my sincere thanks to our readers, customers and employees in Australia, who have combined to respond thoughtfully and meaningfully to the tragic bushfires, which has had profound consequences for many communities. In particular, our reporters and editors and photographers have done an extraordinary job in tracking the fires and highlighting the impact of the tragedy on towns and regions that will take much time to recover. We are pleased that the company and its founders have pledged more than AUD 11 million to the cause and our company has continuing fundraising campaigns that will contribute significantly more over the coming months. We also thank the many companies, which had partnered with News Corp to make a positive difference for Australian communities. Turning to our results, as we anticipated the second quarter was somewhat soft for various businesses. However, we expect improvement in the second half as real estate markets in Australia show signs of gradual recovery, and we continue to progress with Opcity at Move, which should benefit the performance of our digital real estate businesses. We also expect faster growth in digital revenues at Dow Jones from the previously announced content licensing arrangements, particularly with Facebook, and improvement in book publishing based on the timing of the release schedule. Meanwhile, we are on the cusp of the seasonal selling peak for Foxtel, given that the main winter sports as soon to launch and Kayo, our streaming service, has already started seeing upturn in new subscribers even though we are still in the midst of the low season for sales. We took an important step on our path towards simplification with the sale of Unruly and notable development, which will yield financial benefits for us going forward. And I am pleased to say that following our strategic review of News America Marketing, we are engaged in negotiations for a sale of that business. These ongoing simplification efforts shine a brighter light on the intrinsic and increasing value of our core assets, which have been tightly unappreciated and underappreciated for too long. For the quarter, the company reported total revenues of approximately $2.5 billion with total segment EBITDA of $355 million. This represents a decline of 6% in revenues and 4% in profitability versus the prior year. Foreign exchange fluctuations affected our results with a $50 million effect on revenues, or negative 3%. As I mentioned last quarter, we are now seeing the early benefits from our long battle for equitable treatment by the dominant tech platforms. In particular, our deals with Apple and Facebook are beginning to yield financial dividends, and we welcome their respect for the premium journalism produced by the talented professionals in News Corp. There are also positive signs that Sundar Pichai at Google has a thoughtful appreciation for the profound social influence of high-quality journalism. In Digital Real Estate Services, listing volume in Australia remains challenged. But the trend improved somewhat in the quarter, particularly in Melbourne and Sydney. REA Group posted record traffic in October and buyer inquiries were up 37% in Q2 versus the prior year. These signs point to a gradual recovery this year in the Australian housing market, which will obviously be efficacious for REA's revenue. At Move, operator of realtor.com profit contribution showed a substantial improvement in the quarter. Real estate revenue grew 4% as we transition to the referral model, which had a natural impact on the timing of revenues. Key indicators for the property market are encouraging and we expect to see improvements that Move in the second half of the year largely due to the progress at Opcity. We also envisage increasing monetization of relevant adjacencies as we further leverage our deep transaction data, which is made significantly more valuable by Opcity's ability to define and refine leads. Despite Q2 being a weaker quarter seasonally, we nonetheless saw traffic up 9% year-over-year and then more than 30% increase in page views based on internal metrics. Throughout most of calendar year 2019, realtor.com continued to gain audience share relative to Zillow and Trulia according to comScore. We welcomed that David Doctorow to Move this week as the new CEO. David is savvy digital commerce leader comes from eBay and had previously worked at Expedia. His technological vision and marketing prowess will serve realtor.com and News Corp well in the years ahead. Tracey Fellows, who ably served as acting new CEO, is now focusing on her role as President of Global Digital Real Estate and will be emphasizing the development about burgeoning digital real estate assets. Speaking the new talent of News Corp, I'm also pleased to note the arrival of David Kline as News Corp's Chief Technology Officer. David was at Viacom for the past decade and earlier at Discovery Communications, and he's expert at driving innovations and efficiency in global content businesses. David will ensure that our global shared services are robust at costs and manage institutely, security integrity is heightened, and technological creativity is enhanced. The News and Information Services segment showed tangible improvements in the quarter. The segment EBITDA increasing 27% versus the prior year. Dow Jones had another strong quarter with 17% growth in digital-only subscribers including 13% growth in Wall Street Journal, digital subscriptions year-over-year. The journal's total subscriber base continues to set records with almost 2.7 million subscribers as of the end of the second quarter and more recently, Dow Jones consumers' subscriptions achieved the new record surpassing 3.5 million with the journal crossing the two million digital subscriptions mark. I would like to highlight the continuing success of risk and compliance, where revenues grew a healthy 21%. In fact, Risk and Compliance has now seen over 20% revenue growth for 12 straight quarters. We believe the intrinsic value of this business is rising, validated by recent transactions in the sector, where acquisitions and commanded multiples of 20 to 25 times EBITDA. Risk and Compliance is not only a jewel in the crown at Dow Jones, but is on the way to becoming one of News Corp's most valuable assets. Our efforts to leverage The Wall Street Journal's content continue to yield benefits and are clearly seen in the success of the journal, the podcast produced with Spotify. Since September launch, there have been 20 million downloads. We still have work to do in perfecting podcast, but the acquisition of wireless in the UK has given us direct access to a professional pool of broadcast help. And at the WSJ, we have just begun recognizing revenues from our Facebook content licensing agreement with that contribution meaningfully increasing in the second half of the fiscal year under the terms of that contract. Barron's subscribers hit a record at 615,000 in Q2, up 8% over the prior year, and we launched a new show on the Fox Business Network during the quarter. Barron's Roundtable, which already has a full roster of sponsors. In the UK, where political stability and leadership have relatedly returned. News UK had a strong quarter reflected in results from The Times, Sunday Times and The Sun. We saw higher ad revenues at News UK in Q2 with digital growth outpacing print declines, led by meaningful improvement at The Sun, whose audience grew to approximately 134 million global average monthly unique users in Q2, an increase of 9% on Q1 according to Google Analytics. The Times and Sunday Times added digital readers and reached 320,000 subscriptions in Q2, up 19% year-over-year. Speaking of these publications, News UK, last week announced the creation of Times Radio, a new digital station, which will bring together the expertise of The Times and the Sunday Times, and Wireless. The Sun also moved to monetize its already substantial American audience by launching a U.S. based website last month. Early signs strongly suggest that he's tapping into an underserved growing and potentially lucrative forums. In Australia, where the economy has been a little listless and currency relatively weak. Our mastheads expanded to more than 566,000 digital subscriptions as of the end of the quarter, 23% year-over-year growth. That figure is led by the continued digital transformation at the Australia with 65% of total subscribers now, digital-only. In the U.S., New York Post revenues rose with digital advertising again, reaching over 70% of total advertising revenues and achieving more than 20% revenue growth. The post digital network had an audience of 95.2 million unique visitors in December, up over 30% year-over-year. Also in the U.S., just last week, we launched news.com in beta, delivering a uniquely-wide range of automated and curated journalism to readers on mobile and digital. news.com offers prominence for providence, and I used to bring as much data as possible to publishers, while subscription sites will not be punished in the ranking system, but combining sophisticated artificial intelligence with professional editing, news.com exposes readers to a vast array of news and views from left to right, from large publishers to small, national and regional and from every state in the country. In its first week of soft launch, news had 258,000 users according to Google Analytics. I recommend that you all downloaded the news app. If you don't use, you simply don't know. Turning to Subscription Video Services. Foxtel subscribers increased by 3% to 2.95 million. Benefiting from the launch of Kayo in November 2018. We are in the traditional low season for sports subscriptions, but Kayo had 372,000 subscribers and 350,040 paid subscribers as of the quarter's end, up from 42,000 at the same time last year. As of February 5, Kayo had over 370,000 paid subscribers. A positive trajectory as we head into the highest season for sports in Australia. Customer reviews are overwhelmingly positive, and user interface and experience of world-class, in fact, they are peerless. Foxtel remains focused on the user experience and strengthening the core foundation of its business, including its powerful entertainment lineup. Now, featuring six new Fox branded channels, more video on demand content or refresh to move the offering and a partnership with Netflix among various other streaming services. Foxtel also completed key content agreements with NBCU and Discovery in the quarter, providing more on-demand content, so that it is the go-to-provider of programming in Australia. Finally at Foxtel, we are planning our entertainment OTT product, which is built off the Kayo system and like Kayo will help maximize the value of existing rights and reach binge conscious consumers outside our traditional low. In Book Publishing, we had tough comparisons with the prior year though HarperCollins did see better growth sequentially in digital through the continued expansion of audiobooks. David Walliams' latest children's book The Beast Of Buckingham Palace did well in the UK. We are confident that we should see improvement in the second half, given the timing of the release schedule the continued popularity of the Dutch House by Ann Patchett and the recent successful release of Profiles in Corruption by Peter Schweizer. We also look forward to the April release of Volume 2 of Joanna Gaines, highly popular Magnolia Table. We have also just released books by Jessica Simpson and Carrie Underwood and in May, we expect to benefit from the release of the film, The Woman in the Window based on autonomous best seller by A. J. Finn. To summarize, the first half was as expected that had sluggish, but we see progress across many of the segments in the second half. It is increasingly clear that News Corp is harvesting benefits from being a creator of content as markets, societies and the big tech platforms appreciate its commercial value. We are simplifying the structure of the company with a view to maximizing its value for investors. As a result, for example, the inherent value of our digital real estate assets and Dow Jones will be more obvious to the benefit of all our shareholders. And now, for more details on the second quarter and financial 2020, I'd turn to Susan Panuccio. First of all, News America Marketing was indeed marketed. We're engaged in active negotiations for the sale of the company. And I'm happy to report that those discussions are well advanced. Frankly, the company's balance of revenues have shifted from being a newspaper insert company to being more of an installed marketing company. The letter is certainly a profitable business, but not core to our competencies. I won't comment on the use of the funds. as for HBO-related questions, you really should pose those to HBO. What I would say is that we have an unparalleled collection of programming at foxtel, where unlike U.S. cable companies in the past week ranges across a real range of providers. And there's no doubt, for example, with recent renewals of Fox, NBCU, Sony, Discovery, BBC, we still have two more years of HBO that we're in very good shape. Entcho, it's a very early phase of the evolution of Kayo and it has been an exponential evolution. If you look at really only been in existence for just over a year. And as you know, we are very much in the low sports season in Australia. Our crickets fascinating, sometimes antediluvian as it can be is not as compelling for crowds in Australia as Aussie Rules or Rugby League. But cricket has certainly made a positive difference to audience retention. But the winter sports in Australia are about congregation and audience aggregation and we're on the cusp of that selling season. There's no doubt that Kayo is an absolutely world class OTT offering, also no doubt that it has a hell of a runway. As you know, the customer reviews are resoundingly positive. I mean, streaming technology without equal in Australia, is unrivaled and non-pareil [ph]. And let us be clear, this is not a 699 offering, but a premium $25 a month product. And as for papers, Alan, I think yours was a philosophical question and I'll give you an even more philosophical answer. Is it the ecosystem generally can use content is in the midst of two levels of transition. We have to change the ecosystem for news content. It is digitally dysfunction, which affects national and local papers. And then our papers, whether local or national, have to transform themselves within that challenging landscape. Unless fundamental changes take place at both levels, the havens will not be, cannot be in equilibrium. And let's be clear, we are literally dealing with fundamental changes in the character and valued content, and it is absolutely fair to say that with Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch's leadership, no company has been as influential on this issue as News Corp. Craig, obviously, that's an evolving relationship and not just with Facebook, but with the other digital platforms, where \u2013 I can't obviously go into specific details about the agreement, but it is a substantial agreement, it creates new precedents. We host the content, we sell the advertising, and Facebook pays a premium for premium journalism and up until that point, that kind of precedent hasn't been established and it is a precedent that will resonate. I couldn't possibly comment on other platforms other than the observation I made about the real appreciation of Sundar Pichai for the importance of high-quality journalism for society. Regarding your question of simplification, obviously, we love all our assets and we just acquired wireless, which is playing a beneficial role in the development of \u2013 for example, as I mentioned, [indiscernible]. Look, simplification is an ongoing process with a clear cogen purpose, to make the inherent value of the company more obvious to investors. You may have noticed, it was a complexity to the company given the mix of assets and there'd be great transition in some of the sectors. And the more \u2013 frankly, that we can highlight the value of individual assets, the more that the positive trajectory and the transparency of the company will become obvious."

And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin. Please go ahead.\nMichael Florin: Thank you very much, Eduardo. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about an hour ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We'll open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.  This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release.  With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\nRobert Thomson: Thanks, Mike. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, News Corp showed strong growth at Dow Jones and higher revenues at Move, operator of realtor.com. So the company also faced challenges from pronounced currency headwinds, a sluggish Australian economy, in particular, a struggling Australian property market, as well as difficult comparisons with the prior year onetime revenue item, a noncash impairment charge in this quarter. For the quarter, the company reported total revenues of $2.34 billion with total segment EBITDA of $221 million. This represents a decline of 7% in revenues and 38% in profitability versus the prior year. Of the revenue decline, 3% was directly attributable to currency and 2% to our onetime cash payment last year by Tabcorp in the U.K.  Before getting into the final details of the quarter by segment, I want to address a significant development that bodes well for our future prospects. There has been a fundamental change in the content landscape. For over a decade, News Corp has led the international debate in seeking fair returns for our high-quality content from the digital platforms. Clearly, the dominant digital platforms are under intense and continuing regulatory scrutiny on issues such as privacy and an opaque advertising market. There has, however, been a substantial development with Facebook's decision to pay a significant premium for our premium journalism at the WSJ and beyond. This decision begins to change the content equation, and we expect a positive impact on financials at our News and Information Services segment over the long term, beginning this fiscal year. The Facebook deal complements the agreement we reached with Apple in March when The Wall Street Journal became a launch partner for Apple News+, which expanded the reach of The Journal and its journalism to new audiences. Our brands and our content obviously benefit from the marketing region prowess of a partner, which has nearly 189 million phones in the U.S. and 1.4 billion devices globally.  We expect the sectoral shift in the value of digital content to have significant implications for our investors and our bottom line. And let us be clear, these unprecedented changes in the publishing industry would not have been achieved without the determination of Rupert and Lock and Murdoch and the unwavering support of the new score board, which has taken a long-term principal stand on the need to change the digital ecosystem. Other publishers around the world should feel free to send us a commission for services rendered.  Another development worth highlighting is the ongoing simplification of News Corp. As you are aware, we have put our News America Marketing business under strategic review and are in discussions regarding a possible sale of that business. We expect to update you in due course.  Consistent with that theme of simplification, we have our Unruly ad tech business under strategic view and are also in discussions about a potential sale. We have learned much from the very talented team at Unruly, and those lessons will inform our ad business for many, many years to come. With simplification being an ongoing process, the company will continue to review its structure with the aim of bringing extra focus to our key assets, allowing investors to have a far clear review of their prospects.  Let me turn to the News and Information Services segment in which Dow Jones had a strong quarter with increased revenues and greater profitability year-over-year. Wall Street Journal subscriptions grew 8%, and we have crossed the 70% threshold for the number of digital-only subscribers. Important to note, we currently do not include readers of Apple News+ in that number. So it certainly does not fully capture the number of readers who are now paying for access to The Journal.  Advertising revenue at Dow Jones grew 2% in the quarter and led notably by strong digital outperformance at wsj.com, which grew 13% as compared to a decline of the New York Times. We also saw stronger circulation revenue growth and increasing profitability as compared to the New York Times. Dow Jones Professional Information Business continue to thrive, with the burgeoning risk and compliance sector, in particular, growing 25% year-over-year. With many companies under intensifying regulatory scrutiny, the imperative to minimize risk and to maximize compliance remains a burgeoning source of business. Overall, our Professional Information Business represents a pronounced distinguishing advantage over media competitors and provides multiple opportunities for us to upsell specialist content to companies, professional investors and individual investors who actively manage their portfolio.  Barron's group continued to report strong traffic growth in Q1, with total unique users up 27% year-over-year driven by MarketWatch and Barron's online. Barron's subscribers grew 7% to 587,000, while MarketWatch Q1 revenue was its strongest quarterly revenue performance ever.  In the U.K., digital subscribers at The Times and Sunday Times grew 19% to 312,000. Advertising in local currency was up for the first time since Q3 of financial year '18 as digital growth more than offset modest print declines. Digital advertising growth of The Sun accelerated from the prior quarter rate and benefited from a growing audience and higher yield with approximately 129 global monthly unique users in September 2019. Meanwhile, at Wireless, the October radar results show that the reach of Wireless's stations grew 21% year-over-year with a 26% increase in listening hours. And propelled by Chris Evans joining the network, Virgin Radio experienced a 300% increase in reach and a 500% jump in listening hours.  Meanwhile, talkSPORT had a 20% increase in digital listening, thanks in part to the new Premier League rights, which drive Saturday listening up 120% year-over-year. In Australia, there were harsh economic conditions that affected all of our businesses, including HarperCollins. In media, we continue to execute on our digital strategy with the mastheads reaching more than 542,000 digital subscribers, representing 23% year-over-year growth. At the Australian, 65% of subscribers were digital, showing that a subscription sensibility is indeed evolving and more people expect to pay more for digital products. Circulation revenue was also lifted by cover price increases at our metropolitan mastheads. We took the bold step of sharply increasing the cover price of the New York Post in June, and there has been a 12% year-over-year increase in circulation revenue. Advertising also rose at a similar rate. It is worth noting that more than 70% of The Post advertising revenues in the quarter were digital.  Turning to subscription video services. Total subscribers at Foxtel grew 6% year-over-year despite the difficult conditions in Australia. The latest number of paying Kayo payer subscribers as of November 5 reached 402,000 with total subscribers at 443,000, and this is less than a year after its launch. With the Rugby World Cup ending last week, Kayo is now preparing for the seasonal shift to cricket and other summer sports in Australia. And Kayo customers continue to be highly engaged with over 75% of subscribers using the product each and every week. Kayo is a premium streaming service and shows that a far larger number of Australians are prepared to pay for content they had previously been presumed. Given that we have already acquired the sports rights, it's another important opportunity to monetize those rights without undermining the core. [Technical Difficulty] operator of realtor.com had a robust quarter, and we have reason to be optimistic over its prospects, thanks to signs of improving health in the U.S. housing market. Existing home sales are on the rise, and there has been rapid audience growth at realtor.com where there was an 18% year-over-year increase in traffic in the quarter.  Based on the most recent comScore data, realtor's.com traffic is clearly going significantly faster than that of our nearest competitor. In addition, we are pleased with the ongoing integration of Opcity, a business that is helping realtor.com become even more connected to consumers and to REALTORS who are provided with higher quality refined leads that we expect to monetize in adjacencies such as mortgages. We are not entering the house flipping distressed sale business, but we want to offer vendors as many potential purchases as possible. The more competition for our house, the higher the price for the seller. While we have been in a period of reinvestment of Move due to the Opcity acquisition, we are seeing the benefits of that commitment with improving financials, and that will accelerate in the second half.  For News Corp, as the year unfolds, the simplification of our structure will continue, and we expect to see further benefits from the shift in a balance of power between creators of content and the digital distributors. Investors in News Corp should be the beneficiaries of that fundamental transformation.  And now for further insight, we will turn to Susan.\nSusan Panuccio: Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2020 first quarter total revenues were approximately $2.3 billion, down 7% versus the prior year, and total segment EBITDA was $221 million, down 38% versus the prior year. The results were impacted by last year's onetime benefit related to the exit of the partnership for Sun Bets in the U.K., coupled with continued currency headwinds and challenging prior year comparisons at HarperCollins.  On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues fell 4%, and total segment EBITDA decreased 30%. Net loss for the quarter was $211 million compared to net income of $128 million in the prior year, reflecting a $273 million of noncash impairment charges, primarily at News America Marketing. For the quarter, we reported a loss per share of $0.39 as compared to earnings per share of $0.17 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.04 in the quarter versus $0.17 in the prior year.  Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.1 billion, down approximately 8% versus the prior year. Currency had a $35 million or 3% negative impact. Digital revenues for Dow Jones and the newspaper mastheads represented 38% of the combined revenues. Approximately 34% of the segment's revenues were digital, up from 33% in the prior year, which included the onetime Tabcorp payment. Advertising revenues for the segment were down 8% in the quarter versus the prior year, with approximately $15 million or 3% due to negative currency fluctuations. Performance was stable versus the prior quarter rate. Improvements at Dow Jones and News U.K., absent currency impacts, were offset by declines at News America Marketing and News Australia. Circulation and subscription revenues rose 1% versus the prior year despite a $15 million or 3% negative impact from foreign currency. Growth was again led by Dow Jones.  Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $56 million, down from $109 million, with the decline due primarily to the absence of the net benefit related to the exit of the partnerships with Sun Bets in the U.K. last year. We reclassified approximately $7 million of costs in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 from the other segment to the News and Information Services segment. The costs are mainly related to initiatives, including News IQ, our global programmatic asset and some shared technology services to directly benefit the News and Information Services segment as part of our ongoing efforts to leverage our global scale to lower costs.  I will now talk through some segment highlights. At Dow Jones, consumer circulation revenues in the first quarter remained very healthy, growing 6%, benefiting from 17% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at The Wall Street Journal to approximately 1.9 million as well as subscription price increases. Digital paid subscribers accounted for 71% of the total subscriber base at The Wall Street Journal, up from 65% last year. We see a big opportunity to scale The Wall Street Journal, both directly and through valuable third-party relationships, as Robert mentioned. As a result, we expect to see incremental revenues from these partnerships this year. Total subscribers in the quarter for Dow Jones consumer products, which also includes Barron's and financial news in the U.K., reached approximately 3.3 million, again posting record levels. Of that digital-only, subscribers rose 20% versus the prior year to almost 2.3 million subscribers.  We remain optimistic about our Professional Information Business, which accounted for 29% of Dow Jones revenues this quarter. The key growth engine continues to be in Risk and Compliance, which accelerated its revenue growth to 25% in the quarter compared to the prior quarter. Overall, our Professional Information Business grew a robust 8% this quarter. Advertising revenues at Dow Jones in the quarter rose 2%, an improvement from the fiscal fourth quarter rate. It's led by digital growth with a relatively stable print performance. Digital advertising accounted for 42% of total Dow Jones advertising compared to 37% last year.  We continue to balance healthy revenue growth at Dow Jones with reinvestment, which is leading to ongoing profit growth. Elsewhere across our news portfolio, advertising conditions were mixed. News UK's advertising revenues were flat on a reported basis and up 6% in local currency, representing the first year-over-year increase in local currencies since the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The U.K. showed notable growth in digital, particularly at The Sun, which is growing in both audience and engagement.  Advertising conditions in Australia were more challenged, notably in print, with advertising revenues down 13% on a reported basis and down 8% in local currency. Digital growth helped mitigate print declines with continued growth from music stand, small medium business initiatives and news.com.au. On circulation, our digital paid subscribers again grew at an impressive rate. Digital subscribers rose 19% at The Times and The Sunday Times and 22% at News Australia. The increase in digital subscribers, along with cover price increases at both News UK and News Australia, helped mitigate print volume declines and currency headwinds. Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues fell 10% driven by weakness in freestanding insert products given the ongoing digital migration, but partially offset by growth in in-store product revenue, which accounted for roughly half of the overall revenue.  Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $514 million, down 9% versus $565 million in the prior year, of which $34 million or 6% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency. Broadcast revenue trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter, with the revenue decline driven by a lower broadcast subscriber base and changes to the broadcast subscriber package mix. The revenue decline was partially offset by increased revenue contributions from Kayo and Foxtel Now. Importantly, as we look at a core driver of the business, TV subscription revenue, which includes both broadcast and OTT revenue, excluding the impact of currency, revenue growth from OTT products almost offset broadcast declines in the quarter, which will be key to the stability of the business.  Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $81 million, down 28% with the prior year, which, in addition to the revenue trends, was also impacted by $16 million of costs related to domestic cricket rights, which we didn't have in the prior year and $14 million related to the noncash accelerated amortization of certain of our entertaining -- entertainment programming costs, as we highlighted last quarter. We continue to expect approximately $30 million to $35 million impact from the accelerated amortization for the full year with a greater impact in the first half of the year.  Other costs notably in overheads were lower this quarter as the team is focused on rightsizing the cost base. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately 20% lower than the prior year and for the cash flow generation to improve.  Turning to the KPIs. Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base was approximately 3.1 million as of September 30, with volume growing 6% versus the prior year driven by the launch of Kayo last November. Of that subscriber base, over 2.3 million of the total closing subscribers were broadcast and commercial subscribers, and the remainder consisted of Kayo and Foxtel Now. Kayo paying subscribers grew to 364,000, up from 331,000 last quarter or 12% of the total Foxtel subscriber base, including trial list Kayo rose 430,000 subscribers. We are seeing that customer activations are more pronounced around big events. The first quarter had less exclusive content, particularly following the Cricket World Cup, but we have seen notably stronger ads with the start of the Rugby World Cup, which began in late September. As of November 5, Kayo paying subscribers have increased to approximately 402,000.  We continue to see that Kayo subscribers are incremental to the subscriber base with very little cannibalization from the core broadcast business. Paying subscribers for Foxtel Now were approximately 375,000, down from 446,000 last quarter following the conclusion of the Game of Thrones, but still up from the prior year and have seen an improvement in ARPU from both the last quarter and the prior year. In addition, Foxtel is also planning a new entertainment product, which will leverage the Kayo platform with the commercial launch anticipated later in this fiscal year.  In the first quarter, broadcast churn was 14.4% versus 12.9% in the prior year, but down from 14.7% in Q4, reflecting continued focus on churn management in the Foxtel direct channel and higher penetration of the iQ4 set-top boxes.  As a reminder, lower ARPU customers on expiring contracts from the past 12 to 24 months compounded by a price rise is resulting in higher churn versus the prior year. Churn from platinum and sports teams remain materially lower than the base.  Broadcast ARPU grew 2% to about AUD 78 per month. We expect to complete the refinancing of a significant portion of Foxtel debt in the coming weeks, which will include a package of bank refinancing, third-party financing and additional shareholder funding. As part of the refinancing, News Corp has contributed an additional AUD 200 million loan, and the new financing that will extend maturities for at least 3 years and, importantly, provide Foxtel with ample liquidity and flexibility to execute on its strategy. At Book Publishing, HarperCollins faced an unusually difficult comparison to the prior year due to the success of Rachel Hollis' Girl, Wash Your Face, Angie Thoma's The Hate U Give and Mark Manson's Subtle Art. As a result, revenues for the quarter fell 3% to $405 million and segment EBITDA fell to $49 million.  Notable releases this quarter include Daniel Silva's New Girl, Ann Patchett's, The Dutch House, Karin Slaughter's The Last Widow, Demi Moore's Inside Out and Ant Middleton's The Fear Bubble. Digital revenues declined 5% and represented 20% -- 22% of consumer revenues also impacted by the year ago comparison. At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues were down 7% to $272 million, of which $10 million or 3% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 5%. REA Group revenues were down 14% and down 8% in local currency as higher yield and improved product mix was more than offset by an overall 15% year-over-year decline in new listing volume during the quarter. Developer revenues were also down on the back of a 26% decline in new project development. Revenue decline was also impacted by the extended duration of premier all listings from 45 to 60 days, which increased the revenue deferral for the period.  Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call that just concluded for additional details and comments on the outlook. Group revenues rose 4% to $123 million versus the prior year, with real estate revenues growing 11%, which is an improvement from the fourth quarter rate. The increase in real estate revenues, which represented 80% of total revenues, was led by a higher contribution from Opcity, combined with an improvement in lead volume and audience. This is in the context of the U.S. housing market showing signs of improvement, with existing home sales up low single digits in the quarter compared to the prior year.  As I mentioned last quarter, we began live testing a performance-based-only model in over a dozen markets starting on May 1 to analyze the impact and scalability of the platform. The test also allows us to better control the consumer experience and the transaction. Although it is still relatively early in the testing, every single one of the core metrics has gone up materially. Leads, meeting rates, home values and close rates are all trending in the right direction. We are very encouraged by the results and have continued to allocate more leads to the Opcity model, which will allow greater opportunities to further extend into ancillary revenues. On audience, we saw an acceleration in audience growth versus the fourth quarter growth rate with average monthly unique users at realtor.com reaching over 71 million, rising 18% versus the prior year, together with a notable pickup in both page views and time spent. Segment EBITDA fell 22% to $82 million due to REA revenue declines and investment at Move due to Opcity. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined just 2%.  Other costs increased to $47 million from $37 million. The majority of the increase is related to higher equity comp due to the performance, existing schemes and the stock appreciation since the grant date as well as the phasing of certain strategic initiatives. Most importantly, we do not expect this increase to be reflective of the full year.  I would now like to talk about some themes in the upcoming quarter. In News and Information services, advertising trends thus far remains similar to the prior quarter levels, although visibility remains limited. We continue to seek cost efficiencies, particularly in both the U.K. and Australia. Comparisons should ease now that we have moved past the Sun Bets benefit, and we expect to show improvements, particularly at our news brands.  In Subscription Video Services, we will anniversary the acquisition of the domestic cricket rights, and cost trends should be more favorable. We will also lap the price increase from October last year. In Book Publishing, as Robert mentioned, we're excited about the recent launch of Ree Drummond's Pioneer Woman The New Frontier, although we'll continue to face difficult comparisons as the prior year included Joanna Gaine's Homebody and strong backlist sales. Given the timing of the release schedule, we expect performance will be more second half weighted.  At Digital Real Estate Services, we anticipate improvements at Move as we lap the Opcity acquisition, particularly in the second half. As noted on their release, REA expects revenue growth to be skewed towards the second half of the fiscal year. Please see the release for more detail.  With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. I'll take our first question from Kane Hannan at Goldman Sachs.\nKane Hannan: Just at Dow Jones revenue growth of 6%., can you give a bit more color around the level of cost growth during the quarter to drive that growth? And then I suppose, some comments around the revenue quantum we should be expecting from those digital partnerships this year, sort of next year? I -- should we expect them to be material?\nRobert Thomson: Well, look, I'll take the second part of the question first, Kane. The Facebook deal is a big deal. It establishes a clear precedent of paying a premium for premium journalism. And there are a couple of other initiatives that are notable. When you click on a headline in the Facebook News tab, you'll be taken to our site. So the story is not hosted by Facebook. And that means that we're able to sell advertising directly, and we'll have a more lucrative flow of permission data. And these were all essential preconditions for our ascent and our agreement, and will have a long-term benefit on our accounts.  The fact is that there'll be less providence if there's not a premium for Providence. And it's frankly clear that the revenue show flow had shifted dramatically from the creators to the distributors. So for us, there are -- commercially, there are 2 things that are meaningful and absolutely essential. Firstly, development of a subscription sensibility. There has to be more of a propensity to pay. Thankfully, Facebook understood that priority. Secondly, the digital advertising market is dysfunctional. The so-called open market is a virtual monopoly. We've been very public about our concerns on that segment, which is in dire need of reform, and is thankfully now under close scrutiny by 50 U.S. attorneys general.\nSusan Panuccio: And Kane, just in relation to the costs, we saw about a 4% increase in cost for the quarter for Dow Jones. So you should use that number as your proxy.\nMichael Florin: Eduardo, we'll take our next question please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll now take the next question from Eric Pan at JPMorgan.\nEric Pan: You mentioned in your comments, you're bringing extra focus on your key assets. And given the proposed sale of NAM, how should we think about the company's overall strategy going forward? Are you looking to unlock the value of the assets via monetization? Or could you be looking to beef up your existing businesses with acquisitions?\nRobert Thomson: Eric, simplification is indeed an ongoing process, and it doesn't stop at News America Marketing and Unruly. But we're very cognizant that the company trades at a discounted to some of the parts. We're seeking to rectify that situation and maximize value for all our shareholders. So it's fair to say that the institutional introspection will continue apace.\nMichael Florin: Eduardo, we'll take our next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Entcho Raykovski at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nEntcho Raykovski: Robert. Just a couple from me related to SVs. And just firstly, Susan, wanted to clarify your comments around the next quarter. You said you've lapped the increase seen in domestic cricket rights, so should we expect any increase in the cost of the cricket heading into Q2? And then just secondly, your commentary around the launch of an entertainment-only offering in SVOD. Do you expect any additional costs associated with that offering? Or do you think that you can pretty effectively utilize your existing rights and offer streaming products? And then just related to that, sorry, to kind of carry on with this. But just your rationale for it given that it feels like it is a pretty crowded space in streaming services in Australia?\nSusan Panuccio: I'll take maybe the first two, and Robert can take the last one Entcho, if that's okay. So just in relation to cricket, we would expect to see very, very modest increases over the course of the year. So the bulk of those costs have come through in Q1. But I think it's important to note when we think about the cost base, the largest increase that's come through is because of the noncash amortization in relation to those entertainment expenses. So over the full year, absent those costs, we would expect the whole cost base to be relatively stable. But it is important to note that the team down in Australia are continuing to focus on rightsizing their cost base and are continuing to look for opportunities as they move forward.  In relation to Aeries [ph], we are looking to launch that towards the back half of this particular fiscal year. We're not expecting to see significant incremental costs to your point. We do have a lot of the content covered within existing deals. We will, of course, have marketing costs as we scale up that product, but the actual incremental cost that we'd expect to see within the year is going to be minimal.\nRobert Thomson: And if I could just supplement Susan's comments. And it will obviously be based on the Kayo distribution platform. So much of the engineering there has already been done. And I think when you speak of streaming, this salient point to note about Foxtel is the rapid growth of Kayo from nothing a year ago to 402,000 paying customers now and another 443,000 in total. And this is not a service that cost $6.99 a month. It's $25 a month. And given the view of feedback and satisfaction, there's obviously some longer-term elasticity in that price. And when you see the sluggishness in the Australian economy in advertising and real estate, which has obviously had an impact on our earnings, the results are even more impressive.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Entcho. Eduardo, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Craig Huber at Huber Research Partners. All right. We'll now take our last question from Fraser Mcleish at MSC [ph].\nUnidentified Analyst: Robert, I'm just interested in your comments upfront that you were talking about giving us a clear view of the assets and the value, you're willing to just give us a little bit more insight to what you mean there. I assume you're talking about The Wall Street Journal and timing of that. I mean do we now have to wait until the next financial year for that? And that's my first question. And then just secondly, just on Move, which the margins -- you've got to do a little bit of work obviously to back them out because you don't report them, but look later around about that sort of 10% level and have sort of been stubbornly at that level for a little while. Is it structurally just a low-margin industry in the U.S. because they're obviously very low margins relative to similar businesses around the world? Or do you think you can really see some margin improvement there over the next few years?\nRobert Thomson: On your first question, we really can't go into detail about what simplification means in the longer term. What it does mean at the moment is News America Marketing and Unruly, which are under strategic review. But as I said, that strategic review does not stop with those 2 properties, and we are very conscious of the need to highlight the value of the company and provide more transparency for investors. As for Move, both short, medium and long term, we believe that realtor.com is a tremendous property. You could see that the growth in audience is far superior to that at Zillow at the moment. If you take the independent comScore figures from September, the unique users at realtor.com were up 17%, while Zillow grew at only 2%. And Trulia actually shrank by 2%. And the divergence was even more marked on desktop with 10% of growth at realtor and Zillow, down by 12% year-on-year. We're at a very early stage of the evolution of the digital real estate market in the United States. And we think as it evolves, those margins will surely increase.\nSusan Panuccio: And Fraser, I think I'll just add to that, that part of the reason and the rationale for acquiring Opcity was to accelerate that revenue growth going forward and provide an opportunity for margin expansion via ancillary revenues and different services. And so we would expect to see for the balance of this year and over the full year that revenue and EBITDA will continue to grow within that business.\nMichael Florin: Thanks, Fraser. Eduardo, we'll take our next question.\nOperator: All right, we'll now take the next question from Craig Huber at Huber Research Partners once again.\nCraig Huber: Yes. Can you hear me this time?\nSusan Panuccio: We can hear you.\nRobert Thomson: Yes, we can hear you. Loud and clear, Craig.\nCraig Huber: I have no idea what happened there. Look, I have two questions. Housekeeping question, circulation revenue across Dow Jones, Australia and the U.K. with and without currency. Did you give that? Maybe I missed it, but that's my first question. And my second question, Robert, you mentioned, I think a lot of people agree with you on this, that there's two large monopolies out there on the digital advertising front. I'd like to hear from you if you could just expand upon this, what do you think the solution is on that front?\nSusan Panuccio: Craig, just in relation to your housekeeping question. So circulation at Dow Jones was up 6%. In the U.K., it was flat. But in reported numbers, down 5%. And in Australia, it was down 2% in local currency; reported, down 8%.\nRobert Thomson: Craig, obviously, the tech topography is evolving very quickly. If you think back even 12 months ago, the prospects of Facebook paying for content, a carriage fee, as we called it, in fact, Rupert was the first to cite that as a need, the prospects seem remote. It's now real. And what we're finding generally in our discussion with the digital platforms is that, that they have indeed adopted a new approach. They realize that for various reasons that their past policies were unsustainable. But as I made clear to you, it's not just about paying a premium for premium journalism. It is also about sorting out what is an opaque advertising market, and there's no doubt that the regulatory pressure in that area is only going to increase. And a consequence of that, well, I suspect, be that as we're already seeing, more advertisers understand how dysfunctional that market is and seek association with high-quality content, and we will undoubtedly be a beneficiary of that given the excellent journalism that we have, not only in this country, but around the world.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Craig. Eduardo, we'll take our next question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. It appears there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back to Michael Florin for any additional closing remarks.\nMichael Florin: Great. Thank you, Eduardo, and thank you for all participating. We look forward to talking to you soon. Have a great day.\nOperator: This now concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Fiscal 2020 first quarter total revenues were approximately $2.3 billion, down 7% versus the prior year, and total segment EBITDA was $221 million, down 38% versus the prior year. The results were impacted by last year's onetime benefit related to the exit of the partnership for Sun Bets in the U.K., coupled with continued currency headwinds and challenging prior year comparisons at HarperCollins.  On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues fell 4%, and total segment EBITDA decreased 30%. Net loss for the quarter was $211 million compared to net income of $128 million in the prior year, reflecting a $273 million of noncash impairment charges, primarily at News America Marketing. For the quarter, we reported a loss per share of $0.39 as compared to earnings per share of $0.17 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.04 in the quarter versus $0.17 in the prior year.  Turning now to the individual operating segments.

Advertising revenues for the segment were down 8% in the quarter versus the prior year, with approximately $15 million or 3% due to negative currency fluctuations. Performance was stable versus the prior quarter rate. Improvements at Dow Jones and News U.K., absent currency impacts, were offset by declines at News America Marketing and News Australia. Circulation and subscription revenues rose 1% versus the prior year despite a $15 million or 3% negative impact from foreign currency. Growth was again led by Dow Jones.  Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $56 million, down from $109 million, with the decline due primarily to the absence of the net benefit related to the exit of the partnerships with Sun Bets in the U.K. last year. We reclassified approximately $7 million of costs in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 from the other segment to the News and Information Services segment. The costs are mainly related to initiatives, including News IQ, our global programmatic asset and some shared technology services to directly benefit the News and Information Services segment as part of our ongoing efforts to leverage our global scale to lower costs.

We remain optimistic about our Professional Information Business, which accounted for 29% of Dow Jones revenues this quarter. The key growth engine continues to be in Risk and Compliance, which accelerated its revenue growth to 25% in the quarter compared to the prior quarter. Overall, our Professional Information Business grew a robust 8% this quarter. Advertising revenues at Dow Jones in the quarter rose 2%, an improvement from the fiscal fourth quarter rate.

Developer revenues were also down on the back of a 26% decline in new project development. Revenue decline was also impacted by the extended duration of premier all listings from 45 to 60 days, which increased the revenue deferral for the period.  Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call that just concluded for additional details and comments on the outlook. Group revenues rose 4% to $123 million versus the prior year, with real estate revenues growing 11%, which is an improvement from the fourth quarter rate. The increase in real estate revenues, which represented 80% of total revenues, was led by a higher contribution from Opcity, combined with an improvement in lead volume and audience. This is in the context of the U.S. housing market showing signs of improvement, with existing home sales up low single digits in the quarter compared to the prior year.  As I mentioned last quarter, we began live testing a performance-based-only model in over a dozen markets starting on May 1 to analyze the impact and scalability of the platform. The test also allows us to better control the consumer experience and the transaction. Although it is still relatively early in the testing, every single one of the core metrics has gone up materially. Leads, meeting rates, home values and close rates are all trending in the right direction. We are very encouraged by the results and have continued to allocate more leads to the Opcity model, which will allow greater opportunities to further extend into ancillary revenues. On audience, we saw an acceleration in audience growth versus the fourth quarter growth rate with average monthly unique users at realtor.com reaching over 71 million, rising 18% versus the prior year, together with a notable pickup in both page views and time spent. Segment EBITDA fell 22% to $82 million due to REA revenue declines and investment at Move due to Opcity. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined just 2%.  Other costs increased to $47 million from $37 million. The majority of the increase is related to higher equity comp due to the performance, existing schemes and the stock appreciation since the grant date as well as the phasing of certain strategic initiatives. Most importantly, we do not expect this increase to be reflective of the full year.  I would now like to talk about some themes in the upcoming quarter. In News and Information services, advertising trends thus far remains similar to the prior quarter levels, although visibility remains limited. We continue to seek cost efficiencies, particularly in both the U.K. and Australia. Comparisons should ease now that we have moved past the Sun Bets benefit, and we expect to show improvements, particularly at our news brands.  In Subscription Video Services, we will anniversary the acquisition of the domestic cricket rights, and cost trends should be more favorable. We will also lap the price increase from October last year. In Book Publishing, as Robert mentioned, we're excited about the recent launch of Ree Drummond's Pioneer Woman The New Frontier, although we'll continue to face difficult comparisons as the prior year included Joanna Gaine's Homebody and strong backlist sales. Given the timing of the release schedule, we expect performance will be more second half weighted.  At Digital Real Estate Services, we anticipate improvements at Move as we lap the Opcity acquisition, particularly in the second half. As noted on their release, REA expects revenue growth to be skewed towards the second half of the fiscal year. Please see the release for more detail.  With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A. And Kane, just in relation to the costs, we saw about a 4% increase in cost for the quarter for Dow Jones. So you should use that number as your proxy. I'll take maybe the first two, and Robert can take the last one Entcho, if that's okay. So just in relation to cricket, we would expect to see very, very modest increases over the course of the year. So the bulk of those costs have come through in Q1. But I think it's important to note when we think about the cost base, the largest increase that's come through is because of the noncash amortization in relation to those entertainment expenses. So over the full year, absent those costs, we would expect the whole cost base to be relatively stable. But it is important to note that the team down in Australia are continuing to focus on rightsizing their cost base and are continuing to look for opportunities as they move forward.  In relation to Aeries [ph], we are looking to launch that towards the back half of this particular fiscal year. We're not expecting to see significant incremental costs to your point. We do have a lot of the content covered within existing deals. We will, of course, have marketing costs as we scale up that product, but the actual incremental cost that we'd expect to see within the year is going to be minimal. And Fraser, I think I'll just add to that, that part of the reason and the rationale for acquiring Opcity was to accelerate that revenue growth going forward and provide an opportunity for margin expansion via ancillary revenues and different services. And so we would expect to see for the balance of this year and over the full year that revenue and EBITDA will continue to grow within that business. We can hear you. Craig, just in relation to your housekeeping question. So circulation at Dow Jones was up 6%. In the U.K., it was flat. But in reported numbers, down 5%. And in Australia, it was down 2% in local currency; reported, down 8%."

            "name": "Robert Thomson",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, News Corp showed strong growth at Dow Jones and higher revenues at Move, operator of realtor.com. So the company also faced challenges from pronounced currency headwinds, a sluggish Australian economy, in particular, a struggling Australian property market, as well as difficult comparisons with the prior year onetime revenue item, a noncash impairment charge in this quarter. For the quarter, the company reported total revenues of $2.34 billion with total segment EBITDA of $221 million. This represents a decline of 7% in revenues and 38% in profitability versus the prior year. Of the revenue decline, 3% was directly attributable to currency and 2% to our onetime cash payment last year by Tabcorp in the U.K.  Before getting into the final details of the quarter by segment, I want to address a significant development that bodes well for our future prospects. There has been a fundamental change in the content landscape. For over a decade, News Corp has led the international debate in seeking fair returns for our high-quality content from the digital platforms. Clearly, the dominant digital platforms are under intense and continuing regulatory scrutiny on issues such as privacy and an opaque advertising market. There has, however, been a substantial development with Facebook's decision to pay a significant premium for our premium journalism at the WSJ and beyond. This decision begins to change the content equation, and we expect a positive impact on financials at our News and Information Services segment over the long term, beginning this fiscal year. The Facebook deal complements the agreement we reached with Apple in March when The Wall Street Journal became a launch partner for Apple News+, which expanded the reach of The Journal and its journalism to new audiences. Our brands and our content obviously benefit from the marketing region prowess of a partner, which has nearly 189 million phones in the U.S. and 1.4 billion devices globally.  We expect the sectoral shift in the value of digital content to have significant implications for our investors and our bottom line. And let us be clear, these unprecedented changes in the publishing industry would not have been achieved without the determination of Rupert and Lock and Murdoch and the unwavering support of the new score board, which has taken a long-term principal stand on the need to change the digital ecosystem. Other publishers around the world should feel free to send us a commission for services rendered.  Another development worth highlighting is the ongoing simplification of News Corp. As you are aware, we have put our News America Marketing business under strategic review and are in discussions regarding a possible sale of that business. We expect to update you in due course.  Consistent with that theme of simplification, we have our Unruly ad tech business under strategic view and are also in discussions about a potential sale. We have learned much from the very talented team at Unruly, and those lessons will inform our ad business for many, many years to come. With simplification being an ongoing process, the company will continue to review its structure with the aim of bringing extra focus to our key assets, allowing investors to have a far clear review of their prospects.  Let me turn to the News and Information Services segment in which Dow Jones had a strong quarter with increased revenues and greater profitability year-over-year. Wall Street Journal subscriptions grew 8%, and we have crossed the 70% threshold for the number of digital-only subscribers. Important to note, we currently do not include readers of Apple News+ in that number. So it certainly does not fully capture the number of readers who are now paying for access to The Journal.  Advertising revenue at Dow Jones grew 2% in the quarter and led notably by strong digital outperformance at wsj.com, which grew 13% as compared to a decline of the New York Times. We also saw stronger circulation revenue growth and increasing profitability as compared to the New York Times. Dow Jones Professional Information Business continue to thrive, with the burgeoning risk and compliance sector, in particular, growing 25% year-over-year. With many companies under intensifying regulatory scrutiny, the imperative to minimize risk and to maximize compliance remains a burgeoning source of business. Overall, our Professional Information Business represents a pronounced distinguishing advantage over media competitors and provides multiple opportunities for us to upsell specialist content to companies, professional investors and individual investors who actively manage their portfolio.  Barron's group continued to report strong traffic growth in Q1, with total unique users up 27% year-over-year driven by MarketWatch and Barron's online. Barron's subscribers grew 7% to 587,000, while MarketWatch Q1 revenue was its strongest quarterly revenue performance ever.  In the U.K., digital subscribers at The Times and Sunday Times grew 19% to 312,000. Advertising in local currency was up for the first time since Q3 of financial year '18 as digital growth more than offset modest print declines. Digital advertising growth of The Sun accelerated from the prior quarter rate and benefited from a growing audience and higher yield with approximately 129 global monthly unique users in September 2019. Meanwhile, at Wireless, the October radar results show that the reach of Wireless's stations grew 21% year-over-year with a 26% increase in listening hours. And propelled by Chris Evans joining the network, Virgin Radio experienced a 300% increase in reach and a 500% jump in listening hours.  Meanwhile, talkSPORT had a 20% increase in digital listening, thanks in part to the new Premier League rights, which drive Saturday listening up 120% year-over-year. In Australia, there were harsh economic conditions that affected all of our businesses, including HarperCollins. In media, we continue to execute on our digital strategy with the mastheads reaching more than 542,000 digital subscribers, representing 23% year-over-year growth. At the Australian, 65% of subscribers were digital, showing that a subscription sensibility is indeed evolving and more people expect to pay more for digital products. Circulation revenue was also lifted by cover price increases at our metropolitan mastheads. We took the bold step of sharply increasing the cover price of the New York Post in June, and there has been a 12% year-over-year increase in circulation revenue. Advertising also rose at a similar rate. It is worth noting that more than 70% of The Post advertising revenues in the quarter were digital.  Turning to subscription video services. Total subscribers at Foxtel grew 6% year-over-year despite the difficult conditions in Australia. The latest number of paying Kayo payer subscribers as of November 5 reached 402,000 with total subscribers at 443,000, and this is less than a year after its launch. With the Rugby World Cup ending last week, Kayo is now preparing for the seasonal shift to cricket and other summer sports in Australia. And Kayo customers continue to be highly engaged with over 75% of subscribers using the product each and every week. Kayo is a premium streaming service and shows that a far larger number of Australians are prepared to pay for content they had previously been presumed. Given that we have already acquired the sports rights, it's another important opportunity to monetize those rights without undermining the core. [Technical Difficulty] operator of realtor.com had a robust quarter, and we have reason to be optimistic over its prospects, thanks to signs of improving health in the U.S. housing market. Existing home sales are on the rise, and there has been rapid audience growth at realtor.com where there was an 18% year-over-year increase in traffic in the quarter.  Based on the most recent comScore data, realtor's.com traffic is clearly going significantly faster than that of our nearest competitor. In addition, we are pleased with the ongoing integration of Opcity, a business that is helping realtor.com become even more connected to consumers and to REALTORS who are provided with higher quality refined leads that we expect to monetize in adjacencies such as mortgages. We are not entering the house flipping distressed sale business, but we want to offer vendors as many potential purchases as possible. The more competition for our house, the higher the price for the seller. While we have been in a period of reinvestment of Move due to the Opcity acquisition, we are seeing the benefits of that commitment with improving financials, and that will accelerate in the second half.  For News Corp, as the year unfolds, the simplification of our structure will continue, and we expect to see further benefits from the shift in a balance of power between creators of content and the digital distributors. Investors in News Corp should be the beneficiaries of that fundamental transformation.  And now for further insight, we will turn to Susan. Well, look, I'll take the second part of the question first, Kane. The Facebook deal is a big deal. It establishes a clear precedent of paying a premium for premium journalism. And there are a couple of other initiatives that are notable. When you click on a headline in the Facebook News tab, you'll be taken to our site. So the story is not hosted by Facebook. And that means that we're able to sell advertising directly, and we'll have a more lucrative flow of permission data. And these were all essential preconditions for our ascent and our agreement, and will have a long-term benefit on our accounts.  The fact is that there'll be less providence if there's not a premium for Providence. And it's frankly clear that the revenue show flow had shifted dramatically from the creators to the distributors. So for us, there are -- commercially, there are 2 things that are meaningful and absolutely essential. Firstly, development of a subscription sensibility. There has to be more of a propensity to pay. Thankfully, Facebook understood that priority. Secondly, the digital advertising market is dysfunctional. The so-called open market is a virtual monopoly. We've been very public about our concerns on that segment, which is in dire need of reform, and is thankfully now under close scrutiny by 50 U.S. attorneys general. Eric, simplification is indeed an ongoing process, and it doesn't stop at News America Marketing and Unruly. But we're very cognizant that the company trades at a discounted to some of the parts. We're seeking to rectify that situation and maximize value for all our shareholders. So it's fair to say that the institutional introspection will continue apace. And if I could just supplement Susan's comments. And it will obviously be based on the Kayo distribution platform. So much of the engineering there has already been done. And I think when you speak of streaming, this salient point to note about Foxtel is the rapid growth of Kayo from nothing a year ago to 402,000 paying customers now and another 443,000 in total. And this is not a service that cost $6.99 a month. It's $25 a month. And given the view of feedback and satisfaction, there's obviously some longer-term elasticity in that price. And when you see the sluggishness in the Australian economy in advertising and real estate, which has obviously had an impact on our earnings, the results are even more impressive. On your first question, we really can't go into detail about what simplification means in the longer term. What it does mean at the moment is News America Marketing and Unruly, which are under strategic review. But as I said, that strategic review does not stop with those 2 properties, and we are very conscious of the need to highlight the value of the company and provide more transparency for investors. As for Move, both short, medium and long term, we believe that realtor.com is a tremendous property. You could see that the growth in audience is far superior to that at Zillow at the moment. If you take the independent comScore figures from September, the unique users at realtor.com were up 17%, while Zillow grew at only 2%. And Trulia actually shrank by 2%. And the divergence was even more marked on desktop with 10% of growth at realtor and Zillow, down by 12% year-on-year. We're at a very early stage of the evolution of the digital real estate market in the United States. And we think as it evolves, those margins will surely increase. Yes, we can hear you. Loud and clear, Craig. Craig, obviously, the tech topography is evolving very quickly. If you think back even 12 months ago, the prospects of Facebook paying for content, a carriage fee, as we called it, in fact, Rupert was the first to cite that as a need, the prospects seem remote. It's now real. And what we're finding generally in our discussion with the digital platforms is that, that they have indeed adopted a new approach. They realize that for various reasons that their past policies were unsustainable. But as I made clear to you, it's not just about paying a premium for premium journalism. It is also about sorting out what is an opaque advertising market, and there's no doubt that the regulatory pressure in that area is only going to increase. And a consequence of that, well, I suspect, be that as we're already seeing, more advertisers understand how dysfunctional that market is and seek association with high-quality content, and we will undoubtedly be a beneficiary of that given the excellent journalism that we have, not only in this country, but around the world."

[Operator Instructions]  At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mike Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMike Florin: Thank you very much, Valerie. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's fiscal fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We'll open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release. With that, I will pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\nRobert Thomson: Thank you, Mike. The past year has been a severe test for families, for countries and for companies. The stresses and strains of a pandemic have stretched the social fabric and the commercial canvas. I want, fore-mostly, to express my gratitude to the employees of News Corporation, who around the world, have navigated these testing times with professionalism and with principal. Their efforts, their creativity, and their commitment have built on the company's proud foundations and been a catalyst for these impressive results for News Corp and for our group companies. Overall, revenues in fiscal '21 rose 4% and by 30% in the fourth quarter, that is 30%, indicating that the company is surely gaining in momentum, while profitability improved by 26% for the year. We have continued to focus our investment on growth areas, with the acquisition of Investor's Business Daily, Mortgage Choice in Australia and the Books & Media division of. We have also continued to simplify the business with the rationalization of REA's Asian property business and the amicable settlement of residual litigation regarding News America Marketing, which we successfully sold just ahead of fiscal '21. Our strong cash generation has given us increased optionality. Our cash balance exceeded $2.2 billion at the end of June. And so we were able to take advantage of the required sale of Opus which we expect to strengthen and ultimately transform the Dow Jones' Professional Information business. And our clearly robust cash position has prompted the company to actively review our capital returns policy with a greater focus on buybacks. A few highlights before delving deeper into the businesses. For fiscal 2021, we had a record number of digital subscriptions at our key mastheads. Record traffic at realtor.com, where audience growth, according to comScore, is significantly outpacing that of its main rival, and record subscriber growth at Foxtel, where at the end of June, our paid streaming subscribers reached over 2 million, an increase year-on-year of 155%, a profound escalation that included the successful launch of Binge last year. That success has naturally given us much optionality as we consider Foxtel's rather favorable future. In short, we had the most profitable year since we created the new News Corp. Dow Jones had its most profitable year since it was acquired in 2007, and HarperCollins and Move also recorded their most profitable years, and we believe there is clearly more growth ahead. The past year has seen the revaluing of our content through landmark news payment agreements with the major tech platforms. These deals, the financial terms of which are confidential, will add significant revenue annually, clearly into nine figures and are a profoundly important part of the ongoing transformation of the content landscape. We are also watching the evolution of the digital ad market, which historically has lacked transparency, the active interest of regulators around the world should reduce the opacity and provide higher yields for publishers. At Dow Jones, subscriber growth continued to pace, leading to a significant increase in segment EBITDA for the fourth quarter and for the year, up 15% and 41%, respectively. The full year segment EBITDA was indeed the most lucrative since the company's acquisition. Digital consumer subscriptions, which were 26% higher in the quarter, contributed to that growth as did an overall increase in advertising revenues for the year of 4% as a surge in digital ads more than compensated for a decline in print advertising. At The Wall Street Journal, subscriptions grew 15% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, reaching nearly 3.5 million, and digital-only subs growing by nearly 100,000 from the third quarter and by 21% year-over-year, now comprise nearly 80% of total subscriptions. Advertising in the fourth quarter rose 45% and digital advertising was 53% higher. It is worth highlighting the success of our Risk & Compliance business, particularly as we contemplate the future potential of the just announced agreement to acquire Opus. Revenues at Risk & Compliance increased 23% for the fiscal year and burgeoned by 30% in the fourth quarter compared to a year earlier, marking six straight years of over 20% growth. We believe that the Professional Information business will continue to expand at a strong rate, and that Opus will be the cornerstone for commodities, energy and renewables digital business that will have a long-term positive impact on our earnings. We are excited to be adding a new growth lever to Dow Jones, whose performance has manifestly been exceptional. We firmly believe Opus and Dow Jones will be more than the sum of their parts. Our acquisition of Investor's Business Daily was completed in May, and we expect to see the positive impact of this high margin digital operation in coming quarters. We believe that there are multiple opportunities to cross-sell and upsell products as IBD will benefit from Dow Jones reach and Dow Jones will prosper from IBD's range of high-value specialist investment offerings. We are confident that Almar Latour and the team at Dow Jones are poised to deliver ongoing excellent results. The Foxtel narrative is particularly positive as our early emphasis on streaming and on securing long-term valuable sports and entertainment rights has put the company on a decidedly upward trajectory. Our paying subscribers were 40% higher and fiscal year revenue rose 10%, while our EBITDA growth was 11%. There was a noticeable acceleration in revenue growth in the fourth quarter when it surged 33%, driven by our streaming products and thanks in part to positive currency fluctuations. The strong growth in the streaming business, which is taking advantage of and successfully monetizing existing rights was evident in the fourth quarter with the number of total paying streaming subscribers was 155% higher than at the same time last year. We are obviously pleased with the exponential evolution of both Kayo, our sports streaming product, which has rights to Australia's most popular sports, and Binge, our entertainment streaming service, as they combine world-class technology, clever user interfaces and high quality compelling content. It is worth pausing for a moment to consider how the Foxtel narrative has changed decisively and positively over the past 18 months. Then we were being asked whether we would need to put extra funds into Foxtel. And now we have attractive options for a growing, thoroughly contemporary business that has a tangible upside. Our immediate task and that of our team led admirably by Siobhan McKenna and Patrick Delany is to keep driving the business to keep striving because those options will certainly be enhanced by continued success. Digital Real Estate is another fast-growing sector for the company, and we are proud of the performance of both REA and REALTOR. Many of you will recall, there was a certain skepticism when we acquired Move, the realtor.com parent, a certain doubt about our ability to turn around the company's then flagging fortunes. Well, there's no overstatement to say there has been a realtor renaissance with fiscal 2021 profit contribution from Move increasing by $100 million as its revenue scaled. For the year, revenue grew by 36% and the rate accelerated to 68% in the fourth quarter. Audience numbers hit record highs during the quarter. As measured by the independent comScore, audience growth has exceeded that of Zillow and Trulia for 17 successive months, an average more than 20 percentage points faster in the last 8 months. That is a telling testament to the great work by Tracey Fellows, David Doctorow and to all at REALTOR. The two core pillars of the REALTOR business, the premium referral model and lead generation, have both reported superlative growth. And those who watch the industry closely will have noted that a key indicator, the number of houses listed for sale has increased in the past two months. The more inventory on the market, the more opportunities for the REALTOR team to deliver their best-in-class services to buyers, sellers and agents. Our REA had a supernal year with revenue growth of 27%, benefiting from currency and a robust housing recovery in Australia. Revenue growth actually accelerated in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, again, listings were a key driver of that success with full year listing 15% higher, while those in the fourth quarter surged 54%. One of the absolute lessons of the pandemic is that families and investors have focused on property as both a source of returns but also of enduring security. The aloha [ph] of real estate is real and the profits are palpable. Meanwhile, we are expanding into sensible adjacencies, in particular, mortgages, which will also benefit from the renewed flow of listings. Smartline is already thriving, and Owen Wilson and the team are confident that Mortgage Choice will benefit from that increased activity by offering borrowers the best possible range of loans. We look forward to updating you in coming quarters with the progress at both Mortgage Choice and Smartline. HarperCollins is another resilient source of revenue growth, profits and cash generation for the company. Revenue for the full year rose 19%, while segment EBITDA was 42% higher as the company benefited from digital sales, the rediscovery of books as a medium and an extensive lucrative backlist. For example, the company has certainly profited from the immense popularity of Bridgeton, the eponymous Netflix series, which has been extended into a second season to the benefit of Julia Quinn's novels and HarperCollins. The company's prospects and its backlist have been bolstered by the addition of the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Books & Media segment, which has a living library of 7,000 titles including the perennially popular George Orwell and Curious George. We also acquired the U.S. rights to J.R.R. Tolkien's works, including the Hobbit and the Lord of Rings trilogy, and now have global English language rights, which will surely benefit from the upcoming blockbuster Amazon series based on those classic perdurable books. Brian Murray and the HarperCollins team have focused on driving digital and direct-to-consumer offerings, and it is worth noting that e-book sales rose 14% during the year, while audio books expanded a healthy 22%. Clearly, there is much interest by various podcast-related companies in our unique audio book offerings, and we stand to gain from the proliferation of streaming audio. For those of you who have perused our numbers, it is clear that there has been a strong improvement in the profitability of the News Media businesses with News U.K., News Corp Australia and the New York Post, all performing admirably and contributing to News Corp's overall enhanced profitability. There was disciplined cost control and sage leadership throughout those businesses and a strong recovery in advertising during the fourth quarter. In the UK, our businesses delivered a significant profit contribution for the year, with digital subscriptions increasing markedly and listening at wireless rising sharply during the European football championships with advertising benefiting accordingly. And we look forward with alacrity to the launch of the Premier League season next week. The Sun remains the country's largest digital news brand and advertising revenue across the properties in the UK rebounded in the fourth quarter compared to a year earlier. That rebound is a sign that reach, engagement and provenance are important to advertisers and that our UK media companies, under Rebekah Brooks' leadership, provide a uniquely effective forum. At News Corp Australia where Michael Miller and the team took the bold and necessary decision to convert most of our regional and community papers to digital-only platforms, we saw a 25% increase in digital subscribers at the mastheads in the fourth quarter, while there was a healthy recovery in advertising. Clearly, businesses are subject to the vagaries of the virus in Australia, but the robust recovery in recent months is a hopeful harbinger. The New York Post was on the very cusp of making an annual profit for the first time in many decades, perhaps for the first time since the age of Alexander Hamilton, which is testament to the epoch work of Sean Giancola, Keith Poole and all of the Post. The Post was a digital success in fiscal '21, generating 45% digital ad growth, including an acceleration in the fourth quarter with 65% growth, that is 65% growth. And we should harvest further savings from the exiting of our Bronx printing plant, which is attracting much demand from companies seeking this prime side. I would like to thank all who have printed and distributed the Post in Dow Jones publications through the decades. They provided a great service to the company and to society by delivering news and insight every morning around the Greater New York region. All of our employees deserve gratitude for their stellar contributions, both for the company and their communities over the past complicated, sometimes stressful year. Their efforts have been a crucial part of our unprecedented success and provided a firm foundation for ongoing revenue growth and increasing profitability. As I mentioned earlier, we are generating record profits and cash, and that has given us the ability to make opportunistic acquisitions to bolster the company and generate even more momentum. We will certainly be thoughtful and strategic in deploying our assets and will, as always, be cognizant of our responsibility to and the interest of all of our shareholders. And now, I hand you over to Susan Panuccio, who will provide more salient details about an extraordinary year.\nSusan Panuccio: Thank you, Robert. Fiscal 2021 fourth quarter total revenues were almost $2.5 billion, up 30%, the highest level since the second quarter of fiscal 2019 when we still owned News America Marketing. Total segment EBITDA was $210 million, up 8% versus the prior year, including record high segment EBITDA at Digital Real Estate Services. Total segment EBITDA included several non-recurring items that depressed year-over-year comparisons this quarter, including $49 million of non-recurring legal settlement and transaction costs. The results also include $11 million of one-off costs at Foxtel, which I'll come back to. Excluding the divestment of News America Marketing, acquisitions, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, adjusted revenues increased 20% and adjusted total segment EBITDA increased 26%, driven by a strong performance of Digital Real Estate Services and a big year-over-year improvement in News Media. For the quarter, we reported a net loss per share of $0.02 compared to a loss of $0.67 in the prior year. Last year's loss included $292 million of non-cash impairment charges, primarily related to fixed assets in the UK and Australia. Fiscal 2021 results included a $64 million tax benefit due to an adjustment to valuation allowance in the U.S. and a $54 million non-cash write-down of Foxtel's investment related to the Nickelodeon Australian joint venture, which is now covered through a separate affiliate agreement. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.16 in the quarter compared to a loss per share of $0.03 in the prior year. Importantly, on a full year basis, free cash flow available to News Corp improved to $731 million from $180 million in the prior year, driven by higher total segment EBITDA, improvements in working capital and lower capital spending. Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $413 million, an increase of 74% compared to the prior year, a sharp acceleration from the third quarter growth rate of 34%. The performance was driven by another record quarterly performance at Move, together with very strong results at REA and to a lesser extent, a positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. On an adjusted basis, revenues increased 59%. Segment EBITDA rose 92% to $136 million or 99% on an adjusted basis. Move's revenues were $186 million, a 68% increase year-over-year with real estate revenues rising 77%, a significant acceleration from the 43% growth in the prior quarter. Move contributed $17 million to the segment EBITDA growth this quarter, achieving strong profit improvements despite $30 million of additional marketing expenses consistent with our commentary that the bulk of the expected increase in cost the second half would materialize in the fourth quarter. For the full fiscal 2021 year, Move increased its profit contribution by $100 million and was the single biggest profit driver across News Corp this year. We saw accelerated revenue growth across both the traditional lead generation and referral businesses in the quarter. The traditional lead generation business continued to benefit from strong agent demand, improved retention rates, higher yield and lead volume growth. Revenues from the referral business represented approximately 30% of total Move revenues, up from 25% in the prior quarter, partly due to seasonality with revenue growth driven by an increase in lead volume, record home pricing and higher referral fees. In addition, advertising and rental revenue also showed strength during the quarter with the combined revenues more than doubling versus the prior year, only partially offset by the lower revenues resulting from the sale of top producer in the third quarter. The realtor.com's traffic reached a quarterly record of 106 million average monthly users, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 32%. Lead volume grew 14% year-over-year, a slower growth rate than the prior quarter, as we lapped tougher comparisons with the prior year, which saw growth rates in the mid-30s coupled with ongoing industry supply constraints. Compared to the prior quarter, lead volume grew 8%. REA had an exceptional quarter with revenues rising 79% year-over-year to $227 million, including a $34 million or 27% positive impact from currency fluctuations. REA's results benefited from a material increase in residential premier debt revenues despite the absence of a price increase this fiscal year as part of REA's prior year COVID-19 support initiatives. Australian national residential new buy listings for the quarter rose 54% with Melbourne and Sydney both up 64% as growth rates were somewhat exaggerated by the impacts from COVID-19 last year. Listing volumes were not only higher than the prior year, but also higher than fiscal 2019 and 2018 levels. Traffic remained robust with total visits to realestate.com.au [ph] for June at 123 million, up 8% year-over-year, and the visits multiplier against its nearest competitor reaching a record high of over 3.4 times in June. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $542 million, up 33% versus the prior year and included an $85 million or 21% positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The growth rate also improved sequentially. Adjusted revenues increased 12% with higher revenues from the streaming products more than offsetting the revenue declines from the broadcast product in the quarter, helped by the COVID-19 comparison. Total closing paid subscribers across Foxtel reached nearly 3.9 million as of June 30, with total subscriptions, including trialists, over 4 million and were up 40% versus the prior year, a material acceleration from the third quarter, driven by continued growth in paid streaming subscribers and a year-over-year recovery in commercial, which was hit particularly hard from COVID-19 last year. Sequentially, paid subscribers rose 10%. Kayo total subscribers increased to almost 1.1 million and Binge total subscribers increased to 827,000. In the aggregate, total streaming subscribers reached over 2.1 million with paying subscribers up more than 150% to just over 2 million. Streaming products are now delivering meaningful growth at scale and over 50% at Foxtel's total paid subscribers are now on streaming platforms. Residential broadcast subscribers declined to less than 1.7 million and commercial subscribers, while growing sharply year-over-year, continued to be impacted by COVID-19 restrictions and further lockdowns, notably in the accommodation sector. We saw broadcast churn moderate from the past two quarters to 17.1%, but up from 13.2% in the prior year, with the team continuing their focus on retaining high-value subscribers and driving ARPU growth. ARPU increased 4% to AUD 81 from the prior year, partially offsetting broadcast subscriber volume declines. Segment EBITDA declined 37% to $66 million or 46% on an adjusted basis. As we communicated in our prior call, the decline was largely timing related, driven by $84 million of higher sports programming rights and production costs in the quarter, which we didn't have in the prior year due to COVID-19, together with higher marketing expenses. In addition, Foxtel had approximately $11 million of one-time costs, mainly related to iQ3 and iQ4 promotional activity. Importantly, looking at Subscription Video Services for the full year, segment EBITDA increased 11% and was relatively stable in local currency, which includes the impact of $57 million of sports rights costs that were deferred from last year. The business also generated meaningful free cash flow across the year as increasing scale in streaming is leading to improved financial momentum within the company and lower capital intensity. Moving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones delivered revenue of $449 million, up 18% compared to the prior year, including two months of revenue from the acquisition of Investor's Business Daily with digital revenues accounting for 72% of total revenues this quarter. Circulation and subscription revenues increased $34 million or 11%, driven by a 12% increase in circulation revenues, reflecting the continued strong growth in digital-only subscription for Dow Jones consumer products and the acquisition of IBD. Dow Jones subscriptions increased to over 4.5 million average subscriptions to its consumer products in the quarter, up 19% from the prior year. Of that, nearly 3.5 million were digital-only subscriptions, up 26% year-over-year. IBD had over 100,000 subscriptions at quarter end with the majority being digital-only. Professional Information business revenues rose 11%, driven primarily by Risk & Compliance. Revenue growth from Risk & Compliance accelerated yet again with a year-over-year increase of 30% and marked the fastest growth in 3 years. For the year, Risk & Compliance reached approximately $195 million of revenues, up 23%. Advertising revenues, which accounted for 23% of revenues this quarter, grew 45% to $103 million, the highest fourth quarter growth rate since News Corp's acquisition and was also higher than the fourth quarter fiscal 2019. Digital advertising posted record growth with revenues up 53%, with all categories performing above expectations. We saw a significant increase in yield, particularly in direct display. Print advertising revenues rose 36% year-over-year, primarily benefiting from the COVID-19 comparison. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 15% to $69 million. EBITDA margins were relatively stable year-over-year as higher revenue growth was partially offset by the timing of marketing expenses for both brand and conferences, IBD integration costs and higher compensation costs. Costs were also notably depressed in the prior year due to COVID-19-related savings initiatives. As we previously communicated, much of the cost increase this quarter were planned investments with some timing-related items. Dow Jones achieved the highest level of profitability since its acquisition this fiscal year, with margins expanding to nearly 20%, up almost 5 percentage points from the prior year. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues and EBITDA for the quarter rose 14% and 12%, respectively. At Book Publishing, for the fourth quarter, HarperCollins posted 21% revenue growth from the prior year and segment EBITDA rose 2%. Adjusted revenues grew 11% and adjusted segment EBITDA was flat to the prior year. The moderation in growth was impacted by the lapping of COVID-19 benefits in the prior year and mix of titles as last year's results included the Magnolia Table Volume II. Despite a difficult prior year comparison, book consumption levels remain high. Fourth quarter continued to benefit from Bridgeton but to a lesser extent than the prior quarter. While physical sales continued their momentum this quarter, digital revenues declined 3% in the quarter, reflecting a difficult comparison to the prior year when many bricks-and-mortar stores were closed due to COVID-19. E-book sales fell 11% in the quarter, but were partly offset by 11% growth in downloadable audio. This quarter's results also include almost two months of results from the acquisition of the HMH Books & Media segment. We're excited about the acquisition and feel very confident about achieving the cost synergy target of $20 million within 2 years, and the team are actively exploring revenue opportunities, notably in licensing and animation. Turning to News Media. Revenues for the quarter were $595 million, up 21% versus the prior year, driven by the recovery of the advertising market from COVID-19-related weaknesses in the prior year. Growth in circulation and subscription revenues and a $73 million or 14% positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Growth was partially offset by a $58 million or 12% negative impact from the divestiture of News America Marketing in May 2020. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 21% as we cycled the steep declines from COVID-19 last year. Circulation and subscription revenues rose 26%, driven by a $34 million or 15% benefit from currency fluctuations, strong digital paid subscriber growth and cover price increases as well as the recovery of print volumes from COVID-19-related weakness in the prior year. Advertising revenues increased $31 million or 15% compared to the prior year, benefiting from the COVID-19 comparison with strong gains in both print and digital advertising revenues across key mastheads as well as a $29 million or 14% increase from foreign currency. Those gains came despite a $58 million or 28% negative impact related to the divestment of News America Marketing and a $10 million or 5% negative impact related to the closure or transition to digital of certain regional and community newspapers in Australia. On a reported basis, advertising revenues in Australia rose 34% or 14% in local currency, while News UK advertising revenues rose 86% or 65% in local currency. In the US, the trends remained strong with the New York Post posting 60% advertising revenue growth, of which digital advertising grew 65%. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was breakeven compared to a loss of $44 million in the prior year. In the Other segment, fourth quarter results include non-recurring legal settlement costs. Excluding that charge, costs were modestly higher than we had expected, primarily driven by higher equity compensation across both cash and non-cash expenditure. I would now like to talk about some themes for the upcoming quarter and fiscal 2022. Visibility remains limited, especially in Australia due to ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns. That said, we are very encouraged by our July trends and are looking to build on that momentum into fiscal 2022. Our Digital Real Estate Services, as noted in their release, revenue in fiscal 2022 will benefit from a price rise in July for REA, and they also noted that new buy listings declined 3% in the month. Results will also include the acquisition of Mortgage Choice. Please refer to REA's press release for more details. At Move, we continue to see strong pricing in agent demand despite ongoing supply constraints. Like the fourth quarter, we expect to balance reinvestments with revenue growth as we focus on expanding into adjacencies. In Subscription Video Services, we are pleased with the ongoing performance of Kayo and Binge and the efforts to improve broadcast ARPU. We do expect a modest impact in the first quarter due to the current lockdowns in Australia, particularly in commercial venues. For the year, we expect costs in local currency to be stable with fiscal 2021 and revenue trends to continue to improve as the streaming products continue to scale. At Dow Jones, overall trends across the business remains strong. We expect costs to increase as we focus on top line growth, but we will remain focused on margin expansion. Dow Jones will also see incremental content licensing revenues from Google. In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable despite lapping the benefits from COVID-19. While publishing faces a difficult comparison given its fiscal 2021 performance, we remain very encouraged by HarperCollins strong release slate and favorable secular trends. We also expect to see additional contribution from the acquisition of HMH. At News Media, we expect the segment to show notable improvement in fiscal 2022, driven by the contributions from the deals with Google and Facebook, improving advertising trends and disciplined cost action. CapEx for the year is expected to be approximately $100 million higher in fiscal 2022, partly driven by higher technology costs and the rollout of the IP-enabled iQ5 set-top box at Foxtel. We will continue to manage spend closely throughout the year as we did during fiscal 2021. And finally, free cash flow generation will remain a priority in the coming year. The company ends the year stronger, better capitalized and with new levers of growth. We're excited about the potential for our recent acquisitions, including our announcement this week on Opus. And as Robert mentioned, we are now actively reviewing our capital allocation policy as we look to balance reinvestment and growth with healthy shareholder returns. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from the line of Kane Hannan of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nKane Hannan: Good morning, guys. Just two quick ones for me quickly. Just firstly on that comment around the buybacks. Could you just give us a little bit more detail around potential outcomes there? What sort of quantum and timing you should be thinking about? And then on Move, just obviously very strong revenue growth this year. Can you just talk about sort of how we think about the sustainability of that growth into FY '22 and some of those pricing tailwinds that you mentioned?\nRobert Thomson: Sure. On buybacks, obviously, we're indicating that there's a more vigorous, livier [ph] discussion about capital allocation. For a start, we have more capital to allocate, given the strong cash generation in the company over the past year and for the foreseeable future. The acquisition of Opus does not change that thinking, which is at an advanced stage. So I'll reiterate what we said earlier, we are actively reviewing our capital returns policy with a greater focus on buybacks. As for REALTOR, REALTOR really is at a very early stage of its exponential evolution. The growth over the past year has come despite a relative paucity of listings. And the encouraging sign is the level of listings is on the rise again, and the immutable laws of supply and demand, as always, is beginning to take effect. And it is worth reiterating that we've grown faster than Zillow and Trulia, as measured independently for 17 successive months, and in the past 8 months, that growth has exceeded 20 percentage points. And that is a profound transformation and surely indicates that the fundamentals are favorable.\nSusan Panuccio: And Kane, just in relation to Move as well as we sort of think about the coming year, notwithstanding, obviously, market conditions, we do expect to see yield optimization on the core lead-gen product moving into 2022, and we still see opportunities to improve sell-through within that product. In relation to the referral business, we expect to continue to benefit from record home prices, yield optimization, and we'll continue to focus on improving the close rates. Overall, agent demand remains very robust and existing home sales remain notably higher than pre-COVID levels. So we feel very confident.\nMike Florin: Thank you, Kane. Valerie, will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll move to our next question from the line of Entcho Raykovski of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nEntcho Raykovski: Hi, Robert, Susan, so if I can ask one on books and just a very quick one on Opus. So books in the quarter, you had very strong revenue growth, but adjusted EBITDA was flat. And obviously, you've talked about the mix of titles. But just wanted to understand, are there any one-off cost factors driving this? And should we expect perhaps a reversal in future quarters? If you could provide us more detail that would be useful. And then with the Opus acquisition announced earlier this week, do you see any potential synergies from that transaction? And if you do, can you talk to what areas that perhaps come from? Thank you. \nSusan Panuccio: Entcho, I might start in relation to HarperCollins. So look, there's not anything really that's material in one-off. We have had some integration costs for HMH, but they're not material in the context of the overall results. It really rolls down to just the mix of slightly lower digital sales. The backlist mix was a little bit different, 2% difference quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year. But the consumption trends do remain favorable. So we are expecting to see the momentum continue.\nRobert Thomson: On Opus, Entcho, Opus was opportunistic. It was a required sale, and we were able to act swiftly and decisively. And we do have a significant amount of expertise in that sector, thanks to Dow Jones and a very clear sense of how we can develop the Opus business, which is already high-margin, cash-generative and decidedly digital. I mean it's grown every year since 2007 despite the ebb and flow of energy cycles. And so there's no doubt that Opus will be an important source of ongoing revenue and profit and cash flow for Dow Jones and News Corp. And we're talking energy, commodities, renewables and carbon-related products, which will have a long runway deep into the future.\nMike Florin: Thank you, Entcho. Valerie, we'll take our next question please?\nOperator: Thank you. We'll move on to our next question from the line of Darren Leung of Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nDarren Leung: Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. Just a very quick question, obviously considering a buyback. Can you give us a feel for, I suppose, the other side of capital management, like, obviously, with the Opus acquisition, how we should think about debt levels on a sustainable basis going forward, please?\nRobert Thomson: Look, Darren, I don't think we can give you any more detail than that which we have revealed today. But as I just made clear, the Opus acquisition itself has not affected our thinking on capital allocation, and we are in the fortuitous position of having more capital to allocate.\nSusan Panuccio: And Darren, just to add to that, I mean, as I mentioned, we've got a healthy cash balance of about $2.2 billion at the end of the year. The Opus transaction will be an all-cash transaction, but we still will be retaining a healthy cash balance. And having generated meaningful free cash flow this year, we are continuing to focus on free cash flow generation as we move forward. So at this stage, we're fairly comfortable with what our balance sheet looks like. A - Mike Florin Thank you, Darren. Valerie, we'll take our next question please?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from the line of Brian Han of Morningstar. Please go ahead.\nBrian Han: Robert, you mentioned several times the optionality that's opening up for Foxtel. Can you please elaborate on what that means? And when you will make a decision on which option you're going to take? And Susan, you mentioned the decline in capital intensity for Foxtel. Can you shed some light on how CapEx will change for Foxtel in '22 compared to '21? Thanks.\nRobert Thomson: Well, Brian, it's very clear that what we have with Foxtel are options, and that's a tribute to the team in Australia, who patently transformed the business and its fortunes. We've got the key sports rights long into the future. We have an absolutely contemporary customer-friendly streaming platform network and those systems are another means of monetizing existing rights at no extra cost.  We have a broadcast experience that is world-class and is now the village square for video in Australia. And we surely have price elasticity in a market where an ever larger number of people in Australia understand that you pay a premium for premium content. And these are all special circumstances and their confluence combined with sage leadership from Patrick and Siobhan has transformed Foxtel fortunes and certainly given us choices.\nSusan Panuccio: And then just a follow on in relation to the CapEx question. So the increasing investment next year is in relation to the iQ5 box, as I mentioned, which really is to focus on IP for that business going forward, which will drive efficiencies going forward. So whilst CapEx will be slightly elevated relative to this financial year, it will then start to come down. And even the forecast for financial year '22 is materially below the financial year '20 numbers. A - Mike Florin Thank you. Valerie we'll take our next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have a follow-up question from Kane Hannan of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nKane Hannan: Hi, guys. I know you're not talking to specifics around the Google, Facebook 9-figure earnings number. But just was there any of that benefit in this fourth quarter? And then just any comments, I suppose you can make around the Dow Jones versus the News Media split of that number?\nSusan Panuccio: Kane, the numbers for Q4 are actually pretty immaterial. So we're expecting to see the full benefit of those deals come through into financial year '22. We haven't actually given any guidance on the allocation. It's fair to say the bulk of that allocation is obviously going to go across the Dow Jones segment and the News Media segment. And we'll obviously be updating on that as we work through the year.\nMike Florin: Thank you, Kane. Valerie, we\u2019ll take our next question, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] It appears that there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Florin for any additional or closing remarks.\nMike Florin: Well, thank you, Valerie, and thank you for all participating today. Have a great day. And as always, we look forward to speaking with you all again in the very near future. Take care. This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Robert. Fiscal 2021 fourth quarter total revenues were almost $2.5 billion, up 30%, the highest level since the second quarter of fiscal 2019 when we still owned News America Marketing. Total segment EBITDA was $210 million, up 8% versus the prior year, including record high segment EBITDA at Digital Real Estate Services. Total segment EBITDA included several non-recurring items that depressed year-over-year comparisons this quarter, including $49 million of non-recurring legal settlement and transaction costs. The results also include $11 million of one-off costs at Foxtel, which I'll come back to. Excluding the divestment of News America Marketing, acquisitions, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, adjusted revenues increased 20% and adjusted total segment EBITDA increased 26%, driven by a strong performance of Digital Real Estate Services and a big year-over-year improvement in News Media. For the quarter, we reported a net loss per share of $0.02 compared to a loss of $0.67 in the prior year. Last year's loss included $292 million of non-cash impairment charges, primarily related to fixed assets in the UK and Australia. Fiscal 2021 results included a $64 million tax benefit due to an adjustment to valuation allowance in the U.S. and a $54 million non-cash write-down of Foxtel's investment related to the Nickelodeon Australian joint venture, which is now covered through a separate affiliate agreement. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.16 in the quarter compared to a loss per share of $0.03 in the prior year. Importantly, on a full year basis, free cash flow available to News Corp improved to $731 million from $180 million in the prior year, driven by higher total segment EBITDA, improvements in working capital and lower capital spending. Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $413 million, an increase of 74% compared to the prior year, a sharp acceleration from the third quarter growth rate of 34%. The performance was driven by another record quarterly performance at Move, together with very strong results at REA and to a lesser extent, a positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. On an adjusted basis, revenues increased 59%. Segment EBITDA rose 92% to $136 million or 99% on an adjusted basis. Move's revenues were $186 million, a 68% increase year-over-year with real estate revenues rising 77%, a significant acceleration from the 43% growth in the prior quarter. Move contributed $17 million to the segment EBITDA growth this quarter, achieving strong profit improvements despite $30 million of additional marketing expenses consistent with our commentary that the bulk of the expected increase in cost the second half would materialize in the fourth quarter. For the full fiscal 2021 year, Move increased its profit contribution by $100 million and was the single biggest profit driver across News Corp this year. We saw accelerated revenue growth across both the traditional lead generation and referral businesses in the quarter. The traditional lead generation business continued to benefit from strong agent demand, improved retention rates, higher yield and lead volume growth. Revenues from the referral business represented approximately 30% of total Move revenues, up from 25% in the prior quarter, partly due to seasonality with revenue growth driven by an increase in lead volume, record home pricing and higher referral fees. In addition, advertising and rental revenue also showed strength during the quarter with the combined revenues more than doubling versus the prior year, only partially offset by the lower revenues resulting from the sale of top producer in the third quarter.

For the year, Risk & Compliance reached approximately $195 million of revenues, up 23%. Advertising revenues, which accounted for 23% of revenues this quarter, grew 45% to $103 million, the highest fourth quarter growth rate since News Corp's acquisition and was also higher than the fourth quarter fiscal 2019. Digital advertising posted record growth with revenues up 53%, with all categories performing above expectations. We saw a significant increase in yield, particularly in direct display.

Turning to News Media. Revenues for the quarter were $595 million, up 21% versus the prior year, driven by the recovery of the advertising market from COVID-19-related weaknesses in the prior year. Growth in circulation and subscription revenues and a $73 million or 14% positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations.

On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 21% as we cycled the steep declines from COVID-19 last year. Circulation and subscription revenues rose 26%, driven by a $34 million or 15% benefit from currency fluctuations, strong digital paid subscriber growth and cover price increases as well as the recovery of print volumes from COVID-19-related weakness in the prior year. Advertising revenues increased $31 million or 15% compared to the prior year, benefiting from the COVID-19 comparison with strong gains in both print and digital advertising revenues across key mastheads as well as a $29 million or 14% increase from foreign currency. Those gains came despite a $58 million or 28% negative impact related to the divestment of News America Marketing and a $10 million or 5% negative impact related to the closure or transition to digital of certain regional and community newspapers in Australia. On a reported basis, advertising revenues in Australia rose 34% or 14% in local currency, while News UK advertising revenues rose 86% or 65% in local currency. In the US, the trends remained strong with the New York Post posting 60% advertising revenue growth, of which digital advertising grew 65%. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was breakeven compared to a loss of $44 million in the prior year. In the Other segment, fourth quarter results include non-recurring legal settlement costs. Excluding that charge, costs were modestly higher than we had expected, primarily driven by higher equity compensation across both cash and non-cash expenditure. I would now like to talk about some themes for the upcoming quarter and fiscal 2022. Visibility remains limited, especially in Australia due to ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns. That said, we are very encouraged by our July trends and are looking to build on that momentum into fiscal 2022. Our Digital Real Estate Services, as noted in their release, revenue in fiscal 2022 will benefit from a price rise in July for REA, and they also noted that new buy listings declined 3% in the month. Results will also include the acquisition of Mortgage Choice. Please refer to REA's press release for more details. At Move, we continue to see strong pricing in agent demand despite ongoing supply constraints. Like the fourth quarter, we expect to balance reinvestments with revenue growth as we focus on expanding into adjacencies. In Subscription Video Services, we are pleased with the ongoing performance of Kayo and Binge and the efforts to improve broadcast ARPU. We do expect a modest impact in the first quarter due to the current lockdowns in Australia, particularly in commercial venues. For the year, we expect costs in local currency to be stable with fiscal 2021 and revenue trends to continue to improve as the streaming products continue to scale. At Dow Jones, overall trends across the business remains strong. We expect costs to increase as we focus on top line growth, but we will remain focused on margin expansion. Dow Jones will also see incremental content licensing revenues from Google. In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable despite lapping the benefits from COVID-19. While publishing faces a difficult comparison given its fiscal 2021 performance, we remain very encouraged by HarperCollins strong release slate and favorable secular trends. We also expect to see additional contribution from the acquisition of HMH. At News Media, we expect the segment to show notable improvement in fiscal 2022, driven by the contributions from the deals with Google and Facebook, improving advertising trends and disciplined cost action. CapEx for the year is expected to be approximately $100 million higher in fiscal 2022, partly driven by higher technology costs and the rollout of the IP-enabled iQ5 set-top box at Foxtel. We will continue to manage spend closely throughout the year as we did during fiscal 2021. And finally, free cash flow generation will remain a priority in the coming year. The company ends the year stronger, better capitalized and with new levers of growth. We're excited about the potential for our recent acquisitions, including our announcement this week on Opus. And as Robert mentioned, we are now actively reviewing our capital allocation policy as we look to balance reinvestment and growth with healthy shareholder returns. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A. And Kane, just in relation to Move as well as we sort of think about the coming year, notwithstanding, obviously, market conditions, we do expect to see yield optimization on the core lead-gen product moving into 2022, and we still see opportunities to improve sell-through within that product. In relation to the referral business, we expect to continue to benefit from record home prices, yield optimization, and we'll continue to focus on improving the close rates. Overall, agent demand remains very robust and existing home sales remain notably higher than pre-COVID levels. So we feel very confident. Entcho, I might start in relation to HarperCollins. So look, there's not anything really that's material in one-off. We have had some integration costs for HMH, but they're not material in the context of the overall results. It really rolls down to just the mix of slightly lower digital sales. The backlist mix was a little bit different, 2% difference quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year. But the consumption trends do remain favorable. So we are expecting to see the momentum continue. And Darren, just to add to that, I mean, as I mentioned, we've got a healthy cash balance of about $2.2 billion at the end of the year. The Opus transaction will be an all-cash transaction, but we still will be retaining a healthy cash balance. And having generated meaningful free cash flow this year, we are continuing to focus on free cash flow generation as we move forward. So at this stage, we're fairly comfortable with what our balance sheet looks like. A - Mike Florin Thank you, Darren. Valerie, we'll take our next question please? And then just a follow on in relation to the CapEx question. So the increasing investment next year is in relation to the iQ5 box, as I mentioned, which really is to focus on IP for that business going forward, which will drive efficiencies going forward. So whilst CapEx will be slightly elevated relative to this financial year, it will then start to come down. And even the forecast for financial year '22 is materially below the financial year '20 numbers. A - Mike Florin Thank you. Valerie we'll take our next question please. Kane, the numbers for Q4 are actually pretty immaterial. So we're expecting to see the full benefit of those deals come through into financial year '22. We haven't actually given any guidance on the allocation. It's fair to say the bulk of that allocation is obviously going to go across the Dow Jones segment and the News Media segment. And we'll obviously be updating on that as we work through the year."

            "name": "Robert Thomson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. The past year has been a severe test for families, for countries and for companies. The stresses and strains of a pandemic have stretched the social fabric and the commercial canvas. I want, fore-mostly, to express my gratitude to the employees of News Corporation, who around the world, have navigated these testing times with professionalism and with principal. Their efforts, their creativity, and their commitment have built on the company's proud foundations and been a catalyst for these impressive results for News Corp and for our group companies. Overall, revenues in fiscal '21 rose 4% and by 30% in the fourth quarter, that is 30%, indicating that the company is surely gaining in momentum, while profitability improved by 26% for the year. We have continued to focus our investment on growth areas, with the acquisition of Investor's Business Daily, Mortgage Choice in Australia and the Books & Media division of. We have also continued to simplify the business with the rationalization of REA's Asian property business and the amicable settlement of residual litigation regarding News America Marketing, which we successfully sold just ahead of fiscal '21. Our strong cash generation has given us increased optionality. Our cash balance exceeded $2.2 billion at the end of June. And so we were able to take advantage of the required sale of Opus which we expect to strengthen and ultimately transform the Dow Jones' Professional Information business. And our clearly robust cash position has prompted the company to actively review our capital returns policy with a greater focus on buybacks. A few highlights before delving deeper into the businesses. For fiscal 2021, we had a record number of digital subscriptions at our key mastheads. Record traffic at realtor.com, where audience growth, according to comScore, is significantly outpacing that of its main rival, and record subscriber growth at Foxtel, where at the end of June, our paid streaming subscribers reached over 2 million, an increase year-on-year of 155%, a profound escalation that included the successful launch of Binge last year. That success has naturally given us much optionality as we consider Foxtel's rather favorable future. In short, we had the most profitable year since we created the new News Corp. Dow Jones had its most profitable year since it was acquired in 2007, and HarperCollins and Move also recorded their most profitable years, and we believe there is clearly more growth ahead. The past year has seen the revaluing of our content through landmark news payment agreements with the major tech platforms. These deals, the financial terms of which are confidential, will add significant revenue annually, clearly into nine figures and are a profoundly important part of the ongoing transformation of the content landscape. We are also watching the evolution of the digital ad market, which historically has lacked transparency, the active interest of regulators around the world should reduce the opacity and provide higher yields for publishers. At Dow Jones, subscriber growth continued to pace, leading to a significant increase in segment EBITDA for the fourth quarter and for the year, up 15% and 41%, respectively. The full year segment EBITDA was indeed the most lucrative since the company's acquisition. Digital consumer subscriptions, which were 26% higher in the quarter, contributed to that growth as did an overall increase in advertising revenues for the year of 4% as a surge in digital ads more than compensated for a decline in print advertising. At The Wall Street Journal, subscriptions grew 15% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, reaching nearly 3.5 million, and digital-only subs growing by nearly 100,000 from the third quarter and by 21% year-over-year, now comprise nearly 80% of total subscriptions. Advertising in the fourth quarter rose 45% and digital advertising was 53% higher. It is worth highlighting the success of our Risk & Compliance business, particularly as we contemplate the future potential of the just announced agreement to acquire Opus. Revenues at Risk & Compliance increased 23% for the fiscal year and burgeoned by 30% in the fourth quarter compared to a year earlier, marking six straight years of over 20% growth. We believe that the Professional Information business will continue to expand at a strong rate, and that Opus will be the cornerstone for commodities, energy and renewables digital business that will have a long-term positive impact on our earnings. We are excited to be adding a new growth lever to Dow Jones, whose performance has manifestly been exceptional. We firmly believe Opus and Dow Jones will be more than the sum of their parts. Our acquisition of Investor's Business Daily was completed in May, and we expect to see the positive impact of this high margin digital operation in coming quarters. We believe that there are multiple opportunities to cross-sell and upsell products as IBD will benefit from Dow Jones reach and Dow Jones will prosper from IBD's range of high-value specialist investment offerings. We are confident that Almar Latour and the team at Dow Jones are poised to deliver ongoing excellent results. The Foxtel narrative is particularly positive as our early emphasis on streaming and on securing long-term valuable sports and entertainment rights has put the company on a decidedly upward trajectory. Our paying subscribers were 40% higher and fiscal year revenue rose 10%, while our EBITDA growth was 11%. There was a noticeable acceleration in revenue growth in the fourth quarter when it surged 33%, driven by our streaming products and thanks in part to positive currency fluctuations. The strong growth in the streaming business, which is taking advantage of and successfully monetizing existing rights was evident in the fourth quarter with the number of total paying streaming subscribers was 155% higher than at the same time last year. We are obviously pleased with the exponential evolution of both Kayo, our sports streaming product, which has rights to Australia's most popular sports, and Binge, our entertainment streaming service, as they combine world-class technology, clever user interfaces and high quality compelling content. It is worth pausing for a moment to consider how the Foxtel narrative has changed decisively and positively over the past 18 months. Then we were being asked whether we would need to put extra funds into Foxtel. And now we have attractive options for a growing, thoroughly contemporary business that has a tangible upside. Our immediate task and that of our team led admirably by Siobhan McKenna and Patrick Delany is to keep driving the business to keep striving because those options will certainly be enhanced by continued success. Digital Real Estate is another fast-growing sector for the company, and we are proud of the performance of both REA and REALTOR. Many of you will recall, there was a certain skepticism when we acquired Move, the realtor.com parent, a certain doubt about our ability to turn around the company's then flagging fortunes. Well, there's no overstatement to say there has been a realtor renaissance with fiscal 2021 profit contribution from Move increasing by $100 million as its revenue scaled. For the year, revenue grew by 36% and the rate accelerated to 68% in the fourth quarter. Audience numbers hit record highs during the quarter. As measured by the independent comScore, audience growth has exceeded that of Zillow and Trulia for 17 successive months, an average more than 20 percentage points faster in the last 8 months. That is a telling testament to the great work by Tracey Fellows, David Doctorow and to all at REALTOR. The two core pillars of the REALTOR business, the premium referral model and lead generation, have both reported superlative growth. And those who watch the industry closely will have noted that a key indicator, the number of houses listed for sale has increased in the past two months. The more inventory on the market, the more opportunities for the REALTOR team to deliver their best-in-class services to buyers, sellers and agents. Our REA had a supernal year with revenue growth of 27%, benefiting from currency and a robust housing recovery in Australia. Revenue growth actually accelerated in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, again, listings were a key driver of that success with full year listing 15% higher, while those in the fourth quarter surged 54%. One of the absolute lessons of the pandemic is that families and investors have focused on property as both a source of returns but also of enduring security. The aloha [ph] of real estate is real and the profits are palpable. Meanwhile, we are expanding into sensible adjacencies, in particular, mortgages, which will also benefit from the renewed flow of listings. Smartline is already thriving, and Owen Wilson and the team are confident that Mortgage Choice will benefit from that increased activity by offering borrowers the best possible range of loans. We look forward to updating you in coming quarters with the progress at both Mortgage Choice and Smartline. HarperCollins is another resilient source of revenue growth, profits and cash generation for the company. Revenue for the full year rose 19%, while segment EBITDA was 42% higher as the company benefited from digital sales, the rediscovery of books as a medium and an extensive lucrative backlist. For example, the company has certainly profited from the immense popularity of Bridgeton, the eponymous Netflix series, which has been extended into a second season to the benefit of Julia Quinn's novels and HarperCollins. The company's prospects and its backlist have been bolstered by the addition of the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Books & Media segment, which has a living library of 7,000 titles including the perennially popular George Orwell and Curious George. We also acquired the U.S. rights to J.R.R. Tolkien's works, including the Hobbit and the Lord of Rings trilogy, and now have global English language rights, which will surely benefit from the upcoming blockbuster Amazon series based on those classic perdurable books. Brian Murray and the HarperCollins team have focused on driving digital and direct-to-consumer offerings, and it is worth noting that e-book sales rose 14% during the year, while audio books expanded a healthy 22%. Clearly, there is much interest by various podcast-related companies in our unique audio book offerings, and we stand to gain from the proliferation of streaming audio. For those of you who have perused our numbers, it is clear that there has been a strong improvement in the profitability of the News Media businesses with News U.K., News Corp Australia and the New York Post, all performing admirably and contributing to News Corp's overall enhanced profitability. There was disciplined cost control and sage leadership throughout those businesses and a strong recovery in advertising during the fourth quarter. In the UK, our businesses delivered a significant profit contribution for the year, with digital subscriptions increasing markedly and listening at wireless rising sharply during the European football championships with advertising benefiting accordingly. And we look forward with alacrity to the launch of the Premier League season next week. The Sun remains the country's largest digital news brand and advertising revenue across the properties in the UK rebounded in the fourth quarter compared to a year earlier. That rebound is a sign that reach, engagement and provenance are important to advertisers and that our UK media companies, under Rebekah Brooks' leadership, provide a uniquely effective forum. At News Corp Australia where Michael Miller and the team took the bold and necessary decision to convert most of our regional and community papers to digital-only platforms, we saw a 25% increase in digital subscribers at the mastheads in the fourth quarter, while there was a healthy recovery in advertising. Clearly, businesses are subject to the vagaries of the virus in Australia, but the robust recovery in recent months is a hopeful harbinger. The New York Post was on the very cusp of making an annual profit for the first time in many decades, perhaps for the first time since the age of Alexander Hamilton, which is testament to the epoch work of Sean Giancola, Keith Poole and all of the Post. The Post was a digital success in fiscal '21, generating 45% digital ad growth, including an acceleration in the fourth quarter with 65% growth, that is 65% growth. And we should harvest further savings from the exiting of our Bronx printing plant, which is attracting much demand from companies seeking this prime side. I would like to thank all who have printed and distributed the Post in Dow Jones publications through the decades. They provided a great service to the company and to society by delivering news and insight every morning around the Greater New York region. All of our employees deserve gratitude for their stellar contributions, both for the company and their communities over the past complicated, sometimes stressful year. Their efforts have been a crucial part of our unprecedented success and provided a firm foundation for ongoing revenue growth and increasing profitability. As I mentioned earlier, we are generating record profits and cash, and that has given us the ability to make opportunistic acquisitions to bolster the company and generate even more momentum. We will certainly be thoughtful and strategic in deploying our assets and will, as always, be cognizant of our responsibility to and the interest of all of our shareholders. And now, I hand you over to Susan Panuccio, who will provide more salient details about an extraordinary year. Sure. On buybacks, obviously, we're indicating that there's a more vigorous, livier [ph] discussion about capital allocation. For a start, we have more capital to allocate, given the strong cash generation in the company over the past year and for the foreseeable future. The acquisition of Opus does not change that thinking, which is at an advanced stage. So I'll reiterate what we said earlier, we are actively reviewing our capital returns policy with a greater focus on buybacks. As for REALTOR, REALTOR really is at a very early stage of its exponential evolution. The growth over the past year has come despite a relative paucity of listings. And the encouraging sign is the level of listings is on the rise again, and the immutable laws of supply and demand, as always, is beginning to take effect. And it is worth reiterating that we've grown faster than Zillow and Trulia, as measured independently for 17 successive months, and in the past 8 months, that growth has exceeded 20 percentage points. And that is a profound transformation and surely indicates that the fundamentals are favorable. On Opus, Entcho, Opus was opportunistic. It was a required sale, and we were able to act swiftly and decisively. And we do have a significant amount of expertise in that sector, thanks to Dow Jones and a very clear sense of how we can develop the Opus business, which is already high-margin, cash-generative and decidedly digital. I mean it's grown every year since 2007 despite the ebb and flow of energy cycles. And so there's no doubt that Opus will be an important source of ongoing revenue and profit and cash flow for Dow Jones and News Corp. And we're talking energy, commodities, renewables and carbon-related products, which will have a long runway deep into the future. Look, Darren, I don't think we can give you any more detail than that which we have revealed today. But as I just made clear, the Opus acquisition itself has not affected our thinking on capital allocation, and we are in the fortuitous position of having more capital to allocate. Well, Brian, it's very clear that what we have with Foxtel are options, and that's a tribute to the team in Australia, who patently transformed the business and its fortunes. We've got the key sports rights long into the future. We have an absolutely contemporary customer-friendly streaming platform network and those systems are another means of monetizing existing rights at no extra cost.  We have a broadcast experience that is world-class and is now the village square for video in Australia. And we surely have price elasticity in a market where an ever larger number of people in Australia understand that you pay a premium for premium content. And these are all special circumstances and their confluence combined with sage leadership from Patrick and Siobhan has transformed Foxtel fortunes and certainly given us choices."

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mike Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMike Florin: Thank you very much, Todd. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp.'s fiscal third quarter 2021 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We'll open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release. With that, I will pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\nRobert Thomson: Thank you, Mike. While some nations including America are spasmodically emerging from the ravages of the pandemic, other regions continue to suffer profoundly. We certainly hope that the vicissitudes of the virus will abate and trust that all on this call are navigating these perplexing times safely and securely. I must again salute the people of News Corp, as they continue their extraordinary work for the company and for their communities in these demanding circumstances. Their efforts, their expertise and their endurance have yielded strong results for our company and for the millions of people who find comfort and inspiration and illumination from the news, information insight and entertainment our businesses around the world deliver each and every day. It is further testament to the efforts of all in News Corp that fiscal year 2021 has been defined by improving revenue trends and flourishing profitability. In fact in strictly financial terms, this year is on a trajectory to be the most successful since our reincarnation in 2013 in profitability, highlighting how much the character of the company has evolved over that period. Patently, the strategy of simplifying the asset mix, the vigorous pursuit of digitization, the disciplined cost reductions and the investment focus on three growth areas: Digital Real Estate, Dow Jones and Book Publishing have proven to be particularly fruitful. You will have noticed that since our last earnings call in February, we announced three significant acquisitions that we firmly expect will immediately increase revenue and EBITDA upon closing. The first being Investor\u2019s Business Daily to be operated by Dow Jones; the second was Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's Books and Media segment, which will become part of HarperCollins; and the third was Mortgage Choice by REA Group, which will add heft to their Mortgage Broking business. And since our last earnings announcement, we have reached historic and lucrative deals with Google and with Facebook, as we continue our campaign for equitable and substantial compensation from the big tech platforms for our premium journalism whether in text, audio or video. The three-year Google deal is global and involves the creation of a subscription platform, ad revenue sharing and partnerships in audio journalism, as well as video journalism on YouTube. That agreement is evolving well and should be a platform for further cooperation between our companies in the future. The Facebook deal also for three years involves leading metro newspapers in Australia and a large array of regional and local mastheads as well as Sky News Australia and will have a material and meaningful impact on our business in Australia. This deal is in addition to that launch with Facebook in the US in 2019, involving Dow Jones and the New York Post. We are yet to reach agreement with Facebook in the UK and hope that reason will descend imminently. We note the UK. is chairing the G7 and applaud the diligent and intelligent work of Andrea Coscelli and the Competition and Markets Authority, which has developed great insight into the digital landscape and will play a crucial role in drafting a G7 response and in raising social and commercial consciousness. As the terms of trade change, we can expect to see tangible benefits flow to those who report and distribute news to the public. And I am confident that will include publishers large and small, urban and rural, in many countries and in many languages. For us in Australia, the deals will obviously improve the results at our newspapers but also enable us to hire journalists to improve the coverage in underserved regions and communities. Finally, before turning to the quarter's results, I would like to highlight the successful completion of our inaugural bond offering, which was multiple times oversubscribed at an attractive coupon and thus a resounding vote of confidence in the company's strategy and its prospects. As for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, I am pleased to report that we achieved nearly $300 million in profits, up 23% year-over-year. We have now had three successive quarters of double-digit profit increases and we strongly believe these rather positive results reflect an increase in our core profitability. Revenues in the third quarter exceeded $2.3 billion, representing a 3% increase from the prior year. Turning first to the resolutely robust Digital Real Estate Services segment, Move's revenue growth was 37%, exceeding Q2's 28% growth. Move and realtor.com's value to News Corp to the real estate industry and to consumers is becoming more obvious with each passing quarter. Overall, Digital Real Estate Services revenues were up 34% year-over-year and segment EBITDA surged 58%. realtor.com traffic growth has outpaced that of Zillow for 14 consecutive months through March and the significant growth disparity between the two has been widening markedly according to comScore in March. REALTOR's traffic growth outpaced Zillow and Trulia by nearly 30 percentage points. Why this extraordinary growth at REALTOR? Because we are focused on our consumers, whether that be a family buying or selling a house or the agents handling that important transaction. We are not flipping houses. We are not competing with our clients. We are not building up a stock of bricks-and-mortar inventory. We are not worrying over the wallpaper or fretting over fences or stuck up on stucco. We are absolutely digital and devoted to our consumers. This reputational and functional advantage for REALTOR comes at a moment of genuine momentum for the US real estate market. Our internal metrics show that average monthly unique views in the quarter were 44% higher than the prior year and reached 108 million uniques for the month of March alone, a burgeoning of 60% versus the prior year. Not only is realtor.com serving homebuyers and sellers, we are serving renters and landlords as well. We expanded our rentals offering by acquiring Avail, where revenue growth has exceeded initial expectations and we are excited about the opportunity that lies ahead in this lucrative market segment. In Australia, the real estate market is thriving, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. REA Group, the clear leader in that country's digital real estate sector saw revenues increase by 32%. During the quarter, REA announced that it proposed to acquire 100% of the shares in Mortgage Choice Limited. The proposed acquisition aligns with REA's financial services strategy by leveraging the group's digital expertise, motivated property buyers and data insights across a larger network. At Dow Jones, revenues rose 6% year-over-year and segment EBITDA led an impressive 61%. Overall, advertising which was slightly down in Q2, moved into positive terrain in Q3 with digital advertising 30% higher in the quarter, almost double the growth rate of the New York Times. Digital now represents 61% of all advertising, compared to a ratio of 48% in the prior year. Digital-only subs at Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal surged 29% and Dow Jones digital-only net adds in the quarter, exceeded those of the New York Times for its new subscriptions. MarketWatch is achieving record-high revenues and is now benefiting from multiple revenue streams, with the successful launch of its subscription offering in October. Risk & Compliance reported growth of 24% in the quarter, marking 23 consecutive quarters of double-digit expansion. This strength underscores R&C's value as a global leader in data intelligence, including in anti-money laundering, anticorruption and commercial risk assessment. With increasingly stringent demands from the US government and bodies around the world for strict compliance and heightened emphasis on ESG, we believe Dow Jones Risk & Compliance is perfectly poised to benefit. If anyone on this call would like to minimize risk or maximize compliance, please do reach out. Meanwhile we are on the cusp of integrating Investor\u2019s Business Daily. That deal closed this week and we expect IBD will provide innumerable opportunities for cross-selling and upselling with the Dow Jones portfolio of products. IBD will also be a source of important expertise and insight, as 90% of its revenue is digital and the company has a compelling lucrative suite of software products. Book Publishing is another engine of growth for News Corp, as HarperCollins continued on its extremely positive trajectory with 19% revenue growth in the quarter, compared to a year earlier and segment EBITDA surging 45%, as both our powerful backlist and notable front list performed strongly. One of the standouts in the third quarter was the Bridgerton series, which is now the most successful series of HarperCollins in fiscal 2021. Other strong performers included The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse by Charles Mackesy and Cicely Tyson's memoir Just as I Am. The power of the HarperCollins substantial backlist in Q3 reinforces our enthusiasm, the anticipated integration of the newly acquired Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Books and Media segment, which should close in Q4. This acquisition will greatly expand the HarperCollins backlist with an additional 7,000 titles, including such monumental works as The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Animal Farm and 1984; and loved children's books, like Curious George, The Polar Express, The Little Prince and many, many more. We look forward with eager anticipation to Amazon's production of J.R.R. Tolkien's works due in coming years. As with HMH, we will have acquired the US rights to that extraordinary collection and will now own the global English language rights. As Tolkien himself wrote, the greatest adventure is what lies ahead. Today and tomorrow are yet to be said. In Subscription Video Services, our strategy to rapidly expand streaming has been transformational for Foxtel. The express growth of Kayo and Binge, together with Foxtel Now, saw a number of paying OTT subscribers reach approximately 1.6 million as at the end of March. That represents a doubling of streaming subscribers over the past year alone, an extraordinary achievement. In total, Foxtel closing subscribers grew to a record of over 3.5 million, up 21% year-over-year, driving a significant increase in profitability. Kayo Sports has helped make Foxtel, the preeminent home of sports in Australia, with a record 2.2 million sports subscribers. Of these, Kayo accounted for 851,000 paying subscribers, as at March 31, more than double the prior year, where it was 408,000. In recent days, Kayo exceeded one million total subscribers, with paying subscribers expected to reach that milestone imminently. A strong summer of cricket and the start of the dominant winter sports saw Kayo generate more momentum. This was supported by our recent agreement with Telstra, which has seen Kayo replace Telstra Live Pass in the AFL Live app and NRL official app, making Kayo the exclusive streaming home of the extremely popular Aussie Rules and Rugby League competitions. Not yet one year old, the Binge entertainment streaming service reached 516,000 paying subscribers, up nearly 20% on the second quarter. Binge has established consistent weekly subscriber growth, underpinned by the growing awareness of the Binge brand, the popularity of hit shows such as The Flight Attendant, The Walking Dead and Zack Snyder's, Justice League and it's deserved reputation for a user-friendly tech savvy access to the world's best content. Foxtel's resurgence during the pandemic, coupled with the continuing value of its broadcast product, the rapid growth of Kayo and Binge and a relentless focus on cost transformation have delivered a much enhanced financial performance that certainly gives us flexibility and optionality. In the News Media segment, revenues declined somewhat as expected. The difference was entirely attributable to the sale of News America Marketing and the restructuring of regional and community titles in Australia, most of which became digital-only properties. In the UK, circulation revenues increased, while The New York Post continued revenue growth, driven by strong expansion in digital advertising. Finally, I want to express my enduring gratitude for the thousands of people who work at News Corp around the world, for their creativity, their commitment and their collaborative spirit, which has been a guiding force as we navigate through the uncharted turbulent waters of the pandemic. The past 12 months have seen record profits in many of our businesses, a strong reinforcement of our digital imperative and particularly potent performances by the three sectors that we had targeted for expedited growth. It is clear that our investors are increasingly embracing that strategy and profiting from that strategy. And now, I turn to Susan Panuccio, for words of financial wisdom.\nSusan Panuccio: Thank you, Robert. Fiscal 2021 third quarter total revenues were over $2.3 billion, an increase of 3% versus the prior year, while total segment EBITDA was $298 million, up 23% year-over-year, reflecting strong performances across our key segments. Our three core pillars, Dow Jones, Digital Real Estate Services and Book Publishing collectively grew segment EBITDA by 55% versus the prior year. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, most notably the sale of News America Marketing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, as well as currency fluctuations and other items disclosed in our release, revenues rose 4%, while total segment EBITDA grew 24%. Net income for the quarter was $96 million compared to a net loss of $1 billion in the prior year, which reflects the absence of a noncash impairment charge related to Foxtel and News America Marketing in the prior period. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.13 as compared to a net loss per share of $1.24 last year. And our adjusted EPS were $0.09 in the quarter compared to $0.03 in the prior year. Turning now to the operating segments. Digital Real Estate Services segment revenues were $351 million, an increase of 34% compared to the prior year, which was more than double the growth rate we saw in the second quarter. The performance was driven by another record quarterly performance at Move together with improvements at REA as well as the Elara consolidation and positive impact from foreign exchange fluctuations. On an adjusted basis, revenues increased 22%. Segment EBITDA rose 58% to $117 million or 52% on an adjusted basis, the fastest quarterly growth rate in nearly four years. Move's revenues accelerated to $162 million, a 37% increase year-over-year with real estate revenues rising 43%. Move contributed $36 million or 84% of the segment EBITDA growth this quarter the highest contribution to growth to the segment for the fiscal year. Realtor.com's traffic increased to 98 million average monthly unique users in the third quarter reflecting a year-over-year increase of 44%. Notably in March, REALTOR's unique users eclipsed 100 million the first time, reaching over 108 million unique users up 60% compared to the prior year. Monthly average lead volume remained very strong growing over 40%, which was higher than the second quarter rate despite continued inventory constraints across the industry. We saw very strong growth across both the traditional lead generation and referral businesses in the third quarter with a notable acceleration from the second quarter rate in the growth of Connections Plus our traditional lead generation product, which benefited from higher traffic and lead volumes higher retention rates and improved pricing. These results underscore the success of our strategy of choice and flexibility. Revenues from the referral business continued to grow strongly, representing 25% of total Move revenues lower than the first half mainly due to the acceleration in the traditional lead generation business coupled with the seasonality impact. Overall, the drivers behind the performance of the referral model remained similar to the prior quarter with continued strong transaction volumes, higher home pricing and stable to higher referral fees. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect to continue reinvesting in Move primarily in marketing and product development balancing continued improvement in profitability with revenue growth. We are pleased to see strong growth across both as the team accelerates the pace of innovation and new products as we expand into adjacencies. Turning to REA Group. Revenues at REA rose 32% to $189 million, reflecting a $28 million or 19% positive impact from currency fluctuations and a $7 million from the acquisition of Elara. Australian national residential listings for the quarter rose 8% with Melbourne up 13% and Sydney up 5% with growth rates improving throughout the quarter. New developer project launches increased by 14% compared to the prior year. REA's results also benefited from an increase in residential debt revenue despite the absence of a price increase this fiscal year as part of REA's COVID-19 support initiative. Like REALTOR, REA is benefiting from record traffic with realestate.com.au hitting an all-time high of 137 million monthly visits in March, up 60% year-over-year and buyer inquiries are also at record high. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more detail. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $523 million, up 13% versus the prior year and included a $79 million or 17% positive impact from foreign currency fluctuation. Adjusted revenues were down 4% continuing the improving trend through the fiscal year as the expansion of OTT revenues partially offset the declines in broadcast subscription revenue. Total closing paid subscribers across Foxtel were over 3.5 million as of March 31, up 21% versus the prior year as the team focused on maintaining its premium broadcast customers while the Kayo and Binge streaming services delivered subscriber growth at scale. The comparison versus the prior year was helped by the absence of the initial impact of COVID-19 and the launch of Binge in the fourth quarter. Total paying OTT subscribers expanded to nearly 1.6 million paying subscribers, up 120% compared to the prior year with Kayo reaching 851,000 and binge at 516,000 paying subscribers. Including trialists Kayo and Binge reached 914,000 and 679,000 subscribers respectively, which is indicative of the strong consumer interest in each of the product's unique content set. Kayo's growth has been enhanced by the recent agreement with Telstra to replace Telstra's Live Pass with Kayo, accelerating the penetration and adoption of the product. While the revenue impact from the addition of former Live Pass customers will be minimally new one at the agreement due to the pricing promotion, we see this partnership as a unique opportunity and window to introduce Kayo to a new audience. Residential broadcast subscribers declined 12% from the prior year to over 1.7 million and commercial subscribers also declined 12% to 235,000. However, the trend improved sequentially as COVID-19 restrictions continue to ease particularly in pubs and clubs albeit the accommodation sector remains challenged. Broadcast churn was elevated at 20.1% versus 17.5% in the prior year as the team continued to balance churn with revenue optimization. As a result ARPU continued to rise both year-over-year and sequentially, partly mitigating broadcast subscriber volume declines. Broadcast ARPU rose 2% to over AUD 80 or US$62. Segment EBITDA improved 34% to $91 million and was up 13% on an adjusted basis. The improvement was driven by $22 million of lower sports programming rights and production costs, as well as lower transmission marketing and employee costs. Finally, on Foxtel, they refinanced their existing AUD650 million revolving credit and working capital facilities and extended the maturity out 18 months to May 2024 at a slight price improvement. Moving on to Dow Jones, Dow Jones delivered another outstanding quarter with year-over-year growth for both revenue and segment EBITDA accelerating versus the second quarter and the first half rate. Revenues for the quarter were $421 million, up 6% compared to the prior year with digital revenues accounting for 74% of total revenues this quarter, up six percentage points from the prior year. Circulation revenues again rose 8% due to the growth in digital circulation revenues partially offset by lower single coffee and amenity print volume, which is still impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. Dow Jones continue to post record subscriptions with nearly 4.3 million average subscriptions to its consumer products in the quarter, up 19% from the prior year. Of that nearly 3.3 million were digital-only subscriptions reflecting 238,000 sequential net adds and 29% year-over-year growth. For the Wall Street Journal, there were approximately 3.4 million average subscriptions for the quarter, up 21% from the prior year with digital-only subscriptions growing 29% to over 2.6 million. Revenues from, Dow Jones Risk & Compliance grew 24% improving from the Q2 rate and was the fastest growth since the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Overall, Professional Information Business revenues rose 9%. Within Professional Information Business Risk & Compliance was the largest source of revenue this quarter for the first time on record and is now approaching $200 million in revenues for the full year, compared to approximately $160 million in fiscal 2020. Advertising revenues which accounted for 20% of revenues this quarter, grew 1% to $85 million a marked improvement from the 4% decline last quarter and was the first growth since the first quarter of fiscal 2020. As Robert mentioned, digital advertising revenues had the fastest growth in a decade, up 30% and accounting for 61% of advertising revenues for the third quarter. It is worth noting, that this level of growth came despite, a tough prior year comparison of up over 20% which at the time was a record quarterly performance. Encouragingly, the growth was again broad-based with notable gains in the financial services category. We saw growth in both volume and yield particularly in direct display. Print advertising revenues declined 25% year-over-year, which was an improvement from the 29% decline in the second quarter. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose, 61% to $82 million with margins expanding close to seven percentage points versus the prior year. Total costs declined 2% this quarter which was better than we had expected, mostly due to lower print volumes and other discretionary savings partially offset by higher compensation costs. Our Book Publishing HarperCollins posted 19% revenue growth to $490 million and 45% segment EBITDA growth to $80 million, reflecting another very strong quarter and continues to benefit from the industry-wide increase in consumption. Like the second quarter, revenue growth was again broad-based and was led by the general trade, children's U.K. and foreign language categories. The backlist was the key driver this quarter, accounting for 62% of sales, led by very strong sales from the Bridgerton series, by Julia Quinn. Similar to previous quarters, we are continuing to benefit from a strong rebound in e-books with sales up 38% year-over-year and gains in all categories, while downloadable audio books increased 42% year-over-year. Overall digital sales were up 38%. HarperCollins again demonstrated strong operating leverage. Despite a 15% increase in total costs in part, due to royalties and higher production expenses related to the successful top line performance margins improved by three percentage points. Turning to News Media, we continue to remain focused on rightsizing the cost base and moving towards digital within the segment. Revenues for the quarter were $550 million, down 25% versus the prior year of which, the impact from the divestment of News America Marketing accounted for the majority of the decline. On an adjusted basis revenues declined only 7%, which is an improvement from the 9% decline last quarter. Decline also reflects the $28 million or 4% negative impact from the closure or transition to digital and certain regional and community newspapers in Australia. Circulation and subscription revenues rose 13%, driven by a $26 million or 10% benefit from currency fluctuations, strong digital paid subscriber growth and a couple of price increases partially offset by, lower newsstand sales related to COVID-19. Advertising revenues decreased $215 million or 50% compared to the prior year, reflecting a $199 million or 47% negative impact from the divestiture of News America Marketing and a $23 million or 5% negative impact related to the closure or transition to digital of certain regional and community newspapers in Australia. The remainder of the movement was driven by, favorable foreign exchange partly offset by the continued weakness in the print advertising market, exacerbated by COVID-19. Advertising performance was mixed across the regions with Australia showing moderating declines compared to the second quarter rate, particularly driven by increased retail spending. While the U.K.'s year-over-year performance weakened mostly compared to the second quarter impacted by another lockdown which started at the end of 2020. In the U.S., the trends remained robust with the New York Post posting 21% advertising revenue growth of which digital advertising grew 32%. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $8 million compared to $24 million in the prior year, due primarily to the absence of the contribution from News America Marketing. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased by $5 million. In our other segment, the third quarter costs were higher than we expected, primarily driven by higher equity compensation due to the rising share price and the initial investment spending related to the implementation of our global shared services initiative. I would now like to talk about, some themes for the upcoming quarter. As noted in the past call, forecasting remains challenging given the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. At Digital Real Estate Services national residential listings in Australia for April were up 98% compared to the prior year. While the market dynamics are strong these growth rates are exaggerated by the severe COVID-19-related declines experienced in April 2020. Please refer to REA's press release and earnings call for more details. At Move, we remain very encouraged by overall trends and expect the revenue momentum to continue. We continue to expect additional reinvestments at Move in areas such as, brand marketing and product development as we focus on gaining market share and expanding into adjacencies. In Subscription Video Services, we have seen broadcast churn trends moderate during April. And we remain encouraged by strong OTT demand from Kayo and Binge. We expect EBITDA results to be challenged, due in large part to the lapping of the prior year cost savings. As a reminder, the prior year's fourth quarter results included $70 million of lower sports programming costs, mainly due to the suspension of sporting events, as a result of COVID-19. For the current fiscal fourth quarter, we expect to incur those rights which will be impacted by the rising Aussie dollar versus the U.S. dollar as well as some additional costs for further OTT investments. At Dow Jones, overall revenue trends remained favorable compared to the prior year, including strong digital advertising growth. As mentioned last quarter, we expect to reinvest in the business, as we focus on driving revenue growth through its digital assets and expect second half expenses to increase modestly compared to the prior year. In Book Publishing, overall industry trends remain favorable, but we continue to monitor closely the sustainability of recent consumer spending patterns, such as the increasing free time for consumers to read and the increase in the average number of books purchased. We continue to expect performance to moderate in the fourth quarter, in part, due to the strong performance in the prior year, which benefited from increased consumer demand at the onset of COVID-19 lockdowns, and restrictions as well as the successful release of Magnolia Table, Volume 2. At News Media, we expect continued improvement in the fourth quarter, as we lap both the impact from COVID-19 and the sale of News America Marketing in May 2020. Cost decline should moderate, as we lap COVID-19 saving initiatives as well as the divestment of News America Marketing and the closure or digital transition of some of our newspapers in Australia, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. We expect overall profitability trends to improve. And we expect modest revenue impacts from our new licensing agreements. In our Other segment, we expect the fourth quarter cost to increase around $20 million versus the prior year in-part due to the reduction of bonuses in the prior year, higher share price and the costs related to the global shared services initiative. Our year-to-date free cash flow available was $762 million compared to $63 million in the prior year, benefiting from higher EBITDA, improvements in working capital and lower CapEx. Some of the working capital improvement is timing related, but we're very pleased with the progress made to date. Also note that the fourth quarter balance sheet will reflect the proceeds from our recent senior notes offering, together with the three recently announced acquisitions, which will impact our interest expense and cash balance. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Also management has asked that you limit yourself to one question. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Alan Gould with Loop Capital.\nAlan Gould: Thanks for taking the question. Robert, these results at REALTOR are quite impressive. Can you just look out three, five years and give us some sense of what the opportunity is for Digital Real Estate in the United States?\nRobert Thomson: Well, I'm not sure I'm that precedent and I certainly don't pass myself off as a soothsayer. But we are firmly of the view that real estate properties make us the world's leading digital property company. And we also are firmly of the view that we have vast potential for growth, given the markets in which we operate and given our successful acquisition strategy. And equally, we are firmly of the view that the full value of our digital property assets and their potential is not yet entirely recognized in our share price. We now have a global leadership of our real estate assets with Tracey Fellows and her appointment itself was a sign of our intention and our ambition. And she's not just working through ideas for the future. She's driving the business and seeking out new opportunities, such as cities, such as rental and such as other adjacencies that will generate even more momentum.\nAlan Gould: If I can just\u2026\nMike Florin: Thank you, Alan. We\u2019ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Kane Hannan with Goldman Sachs.\nKane Hannan: Good morning, guys. Just in terms of the investment at Move and Dow Jones you've been calling out, should we be expecting investment to step up in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter? I know you guys, obviously, spoke about this investment in the half year. So just interested how we think about the phasing.\nSusan Panuccio: Kane, I'll take that one. So I think, just at REALTOR, if you think about the cost for Q4, we did guide to an additional $40 million of cost in the second half. You probably could assume the bulk of that $40 million that we quoted will hit in Q4. So if you compare that to the Q3 numbers, we also expect those numbers to scale up from a variable cost perspective, given the revenue growth. In relation to Dow Jones, we would expect to see higher costs in Q4, largely as a consequence of compensation and marketing expenditure. But we have been very encouraged by the ongoing cost focus in that business. And as you could see, they had a pretty good cost result for this quarter as well. So probably more investment coming through at REALTOR than what we would expect to see in Dow Jones.\nMike Florin: Thank you. Kane -- thank you, Kane. Todd, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. My question's on the Journal, Dow Jones. When you look at the Wall Street Journal digital subscription, do you think that the change in administration here in the U.S. has a positive? Is it a tailwind going forward for future digital subscriptions, or is it a negative, or is it neutral? I'm sure curious to hear how you think the change in the geopolitical environment may or may not influence the digital sub growth there.\nRobert Thomson: Well, the key factor for us is the quality of the Wall Street Journal, the quality of the journalism, the quality of the leadership. We have a great team at Dow Jones with Almar Latour and Josh Stinchcomb, our Chief Revenue Officer, who've done a sterling job collectively in developing our digital expertise. So we don't have to worry about a Trump bump becoming a Trump slump, as you might see in other places. The Wall Street Journal's journalism obviously rises above the -- sort of gormless rhetoric the pants-tearing [ph], the jaundiced journalism that you see in some other places. And so, the Dow Jones results certainly rise above those of the New York Times, both in circulation now in the news segment and in digital advertising, which was almost double that of the New York Times. And so, it is in essence the enduring quality of the Journal that gives us momentum. And those are very positive wins that we're seeing now and are confident that we'll see in the future. \nSusan Panuccio: And Alexia, I think, the other thing that is really encouraging for us is, if I look back over the last 10 quarters and the quarter-on-quarter sort of net adds, the net adds that we had this quarter were the second highest that we've had over those 10 periods and so that gives us confidence actually about the ongoing growth potential within Dow Jones.\nRobert Thomson: And to further supplement Susan's wise observation, the acquisition of IBD will give us further opportunity to up-sell to cross-sell across both properties. And that's why we acquired the IBD, which is close to closing. And that's why -- and that investment itself was an indication of our confidence in the sector.\nMike Florin: Thank you, Alexia. Todd, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Entcho Raykovski with Credit Suisse.\nEntcho Raykovski: Hi, Robert. Hi, Susan. My question is on the other segments. Costs were up circa $50 million in the quarter year-on-year and you're obviously guiding to a further $20 million increase in Q4. I'm just interested in what's driving the incremental uplift relative to the $50 million number which you gave us back in Feb. I mean, is it the share price performance that's driving bonuses? So any color would be useful. And is there an element of catch-up in those numbers? So if we -- as we look into FY 2022, could we expect a stable cost base in other or could there be a potential for a drop as well? Thank you.\nSusan Panuccio: Yeah. Look in Q4, we obviously had the absence of some bonuses in Q4 of last year and so we obviously wouldn't expect to see that this year. So we've got that movement that's happening. We also had some of the COVID impacts coming through in Q4. So we did have a couple of one-off cost savings that hit in Q4 of last year which we didn't see repeated -- expected to repeat in Q4 of this year. And we also have the scale after some of the news next step transformation project costs that are going to hit in Q4. So I think when we look sort of going forward, we wouldn't expect to see the large movement that we've been seeing in equity comp. I mean, obviously if the share price continues to go up we'll have that natural fluctuation. So we did have a very depressed share price as a consequence of COVID back in Q4 and so we've been seeing those movements come through this year. \nMike Florin: Thank you, Entcho. Todd, we will take our next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.\nCraig Huber: Thank you. I want to focus if I could on your IBD acquisition in the book segment. You guys are buying from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Obviously, you're spending a little bit over $600 million for the two. I wanted to hear if you agree with this. I mean my take on this, in this environment for you guys to spend over $600 million, which is unlike you. You don't do it too often. And I think you run your balance sheet pretty conservative, you run your company pretty conservative over the years. But for you to do this right now, do you agree with my thought that you must be feeling pretty good, pretty optimistic on the direction of the virus, the direction of the global economies and more importantly direction of your revenues and your great cost containment. When you put it all together that gave you the confidence out there to spend $600 million plus?\nRobert Thomson: Craig, look I think that's a fair assessment. We certainly have confidence in our teams and their ability to integrate those acquisitions. We certainly have a fundamental faith in the sectors themselves. And you will see that the financial impact of the acquisitions will be almost immediately positive for both revenue and EBITDA. At both Investor\u2019s Business Daily and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt General Book division are highly profitable. And in Australia Mortgage Choice will surely complement the existing mortgage broking business at REA. And as I mentioned earlier with IBD being 90% digital now, it's extremely contemporary. We will be able to cross-sell and upsell and make the most of our existing content. And there's -- at HarperCollins Brian Murray and the team there's no doubt we have a history of successfully integrating businesses. And so we fully expect profits to increase at both HMH and thus at HarperCollins and thus at News Corp.\nMike Florin: Thank you, Craig. Todd, we will take our next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Darren Leung with Macquarie. \nDarren Leung: Good morning. Thank you for the update. I just wanted to ask a question around Dow Jones. You obviously talked about the sort of growth trajectory in the Risk & Compliance business. Can you please give us a feel for what the margins look like, not necessarily in FY 2021, but perhaps into the medium term, once you're done investing for The Wall Street Journal versus the Risk & Compliance business please?\nSusan Panuccio: We don't give out the margins actually for Risk & compliance. But what we would say is though that they are high margin and they've been scaled. So we are seeing good growth within that particular segment.\nRobert Thomson: And as we indicated earlier, the climate for Risk & Compliance is certainly conducive to growth given the advent of US administration that is obviously intent upon increasing regulation and the need for compliance.\nMike Florin: Thanks you, Darren. Todd, we will take our next question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brian Han with Morningstar. \nBrian Han: Hi. For Foxtel in Australia, you are still investing in marketing and retention of Foxtel broadcast subscribers, or is most of the marketing efforts directly towards Kayo and Binge? \nRobert Thomson: Well we're certainly focused on all segments at Foxtel and we're genuinely delighted by the progress where we have EBITDA up 34%. And the revenue trends are obviously improving. We haven't seen the spindown from broadcasting that some feared. And Kayo is as we mentioned on the cusp of one million paying subscribers with a user base already larger than that and Binge growing week after week after week. And frankly, all underpinned by world-class cutting-edge technology that provides a great user experience. And its financial position overall is much more robust and Patrick Siobhan and the team deserve much credit for the markedly improved performance. That means, we frankly have options real options.\nMike Florin: Thank you, Brian. Todd, we will take our next question please.\nOperator: Sir, at this time, we have no questions. I'll turn it back to you for closing remarks.\nMike Florin: Great. Well thank you Todd. Thank you for all for participating. Have a great day. And as always, we look forward to speaking with you all in the very near future. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Fiscal 2021 third quarter total revenues were over $2.3 billion, an increase of 3% versus the prior year, while total segment EBITDA was $298 million, up 23% year-over-year, reflecting strong performances across our key segments. Our three core pillars, Dow Jones, Digital Real Estate Services and Book Publishing collectively grew segment EBITDA by 55% versus the prior year. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, most notably the sale of News America Marketing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, as well as currency fluctuations and other items disclosed in our release, revenues rose 4%, while total segment EBITDA grew 24%. Net income for the quarter was $96 million compared to a net loss of $1 billion in the prior year, which reflects the absence of a noncash impairment charge related to Foxtel and News America Marketing in the prior period. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.13 as compared to a net loss per share of $1.24 last year. And our adjusted EPS were $0.09 in the quarter compared to $0.03 in the prior year. Turning now to the operating segments. Digital Real Estate Services segment revenues were $351 million, an increase of 34% compared to the prior year, which was more than double the growth rate we saw in the second quarter. The performance was driven by another record quarterly performance at Move together with improvements at REA as well as the Elara consolidation and positive impact from foreign exchange fluctuations. On an adjusted basis, revenues increased 22%. Segment EBITDA rose 58% to $117 million or 52% on an adjusted basis, the fastest quarterly growth rate in nearly four years. Move's revenues accelerated to $162 million, a 37% increase year-over-year with real estate revenues rising 43%. Move contributed $36 million or 84% of the segment EBITDA growth this quarter the highest contribution to growth to the segment for the fiscal year. Realtor.com's traffic increased to 98 million average monthly unique users in the third quarter reflecting a year-over-year increase of 44%. Notably in March, REALTOR's unique users eclipsed 100 million the first time, reaching over 108 million unique users up 60% compared to the prior year. Monthly average lead volume remained very strong growing over 40%, which was higher than the second quarter rate despite continued inventory constraints across the industry. We saw very strong growth across both the traditional lead generation and referral businesses in the third quarter with a notable acceleration from the second quarter rate in the growth of Connections Plus our traditional lead generation product, which benefited from higher traffic and lead volumes higher retention rates and improved pricing. These results underscore the success of our strategy of choice and flexibility.

Overall, the drivers behind the performance of the referral model remained similar to the prior quarter with continued strong transaction volumes, higher home pricing and stable to higher referral fees. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect to continue reinvesting in Move primarily in marketing and product development balancing continued improvement in profitability with revenue growth. We are pleased to see strong growth across both as the team accelerates the pace of innovation and new products as we expand into adjacencies. Turning to REA Group. Revenues at REA rose 32% to $189 million, reflecting a $28 million or 19% positive impact from currency fluctuations and a $7 million from the acquisition of Elara. Australian national residential listings for the quarter rose 8% with Melbourne up 13% and Sydney up 5% with growth rates improving throughout the quarter. New developer project launches increased by 14% compared to the prior year. REA's results also benefited from an increase in residential debt revenue despite the absence of a price increase this fiscal year as part of REA's COVID-19 support initiative. Like REALTOR, REA is benefiting from record traffic with realestate.com.au hitting an all-time high of 137 million monthly visits in March, up 60% year-over-year and buyer inquiries are also at record high. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more detail. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $523 million, up 13% versus the prior year and included a $79 million or 17% positive impact from foreign currency fluctuation. Adjusted revenues were down 4% continuing the improving trend through the fiscal year as the expansion of OTT revenues partially offset the declines in broadcast subscription revenue. Total closing paid subscribers across Foxtel were over 3.5 million as of March 31, up 21% versus the prior year as the team focused on maintaining its premium broadcast customers while the Kayo and Binge streaming services delivered subscriber growth at scale. The comparison versus the prior year was helped by the absence of the initial impact of COVID-19 and the launch of Binge in the fourth quarter. Total paying OTT subscribers expanded to nearly 1.6 million paying subscribers, up 120% compared to the prior year with Kayo reaching 851,000 and binge at 516,000 paying subscribers. Including trialists Kayo and Binge reached 914,000 and 679,000 subscribers respectively, which is indicative of the strong consumer interest in each of the product's unique content set. Kayo's growth has been enhanced by the recent agreement with Telstra to replace Telstra's Live Pass with Kayo, accelerating the penetration and adoption of the product. While the revenue impact from the addition of former Live Pass customers will be minimally new one at the agreement due to the pricing promotion, we see this partnership as a unique opportunity and window to introduce Kayo to a new audience. Residential broadcast subscribers declined 12% from the prior year to over 1.7 million and commercial subscribers also declined 12% to 235,000. However, the trend improved sequentially as COVID-19 restrictions continue to ease particularly in pubs and clubs albeit the accommodation sector remains challenged. Broadcast churn was elevated at 20.1% versus 17.5% in the prior year as the team continued to balance churn with revenue optimization. As a result ARPU continued to rise both year-over-year and sequentially, partly mitigating broadcast subscriber volume declines. Broadcast ARPU rose 2% to over AUD 80 or US$62. Segment EBITDA improved 34% to $91 million and was up 13% on an adjusted basis. The improvement was driven by $22 million of lower sports programming rights and production costs, as well as lower transmission marketing and employee costs. Finally, on Foxtel, they refinanced their existing AUD650 million revolving credit and working capital facilities and extended the maturity out 18 months to May 2024 at a slight price improvement. Moving on to Dow Jones, Dow Jones delivered another outstanding quarter with year-over-year growth for both revenue and segment EBITDA accelerating versus the second quarter and the first half rate. Revenues for the quarter were $421 million, up 6% compared to the prior year with digital revenues accounting for 74% of total revenues this quarter, up six percentage points from the prior year. Circulation revenues again rose 8% due to the growth in digital circulation revenues partially offset by lower single coffee and amenity print volume, which is still impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. Dow Jones continue to post record subscriptions with nearly 4.3 million average subscriptions to its consumer products in the quarter, up 19% from the prior year. Of that nearly 3.3 million were digital-only subscriptions reflecting 238,000 sequential net adds and 29% year-over-year growth. For the Wall Street Journal, there were approximately 3.4 million average subscriptions for the quarter, up 21% from the prior year with digital-only subscriptions growing 29% to over 2.6 million. Revenues from, Dow Jones Risk & Compliance grew 24% improving from the Q2 rate and was the fastest growth since the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Overall, Professional Information Business revenues rose 9%. Within Professional Information Business Risk & Compliance was the largest source of revenue this quarter for the first time on record and is now approaching $200 million in revenues for the full year, compared to approximately $160 million in fiscal 2020. Advertising revenues which accounted for 20% of revenues this quarter, grew 1% to $85 million a marked improvement from the 4% decline last quarter and was the first growth since the first quarter of fiscal 2020. As Robert mentioned, digital advertising revenues had the fastest growth in a decade, up 30% and accounting for 61% of advertising revenues for the third quarter. It is worth noting, that this level of growth came despite, a tough prior year comparison of up over 20% which at the time was a record quarterly performance. Encouragingly, the growth was again broad-based with notable gains in the financial services category. We saw growth in both volume and yield particularly in direct display. Print advertising revenues declined 25% year-over-year, which was an improvement from the 29% decline in the second quarter. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose, 61% to $82 million with margins expanding close to seven percentage points versus the prior year. Total costs declined 2% this quarter which was better than we had expected, mostly due to lower print volumes and other discretionary savings partially offset by higher compensation costs. Our Book Publishing HarperCollins posted 19% revenue growth to $490 million and 45% segment EBITDA growth to $80 million, reflecting another very strong quarter and continues to benefit from the industry-wide increase in consumption. Like the second quarter, revenue growth was again broad-based and was led by the general trade, children's U.K. and foreign language categories. The backlist was the key driver this quarter, accounting for 62% of sales, led by very strong sales from the Bridgerton series, by Julia Quinn. Similar to previous quarters, we are continuing to benefit from a strong rebound in e-books with sales up 38% year-over-year and gains in all categories, while downloadable audio books increased 42% year-over-year. Overall digital sales were up 38%. HarperCollins again demonstrated strong operating leverage. Despite a 15% increase in total costs in part, due to royalties and higher production expenses related to the successful top line performance margins improved by three percentage points. Turning to News Media, we continue to remain focused on rightsizing the cost base and moving towards digital within the segment. Revenues for the quarter were $550 million, down 25% versus the prior year of which, the impact from the divestment of News America Marketing accounted for the majority of the decline. On an adjusted basis revenues declined only 7%, which is an improvement from the 9% decline last quarter. Decline also reflects the $28 million or 4% negative impact from the closure or transition to digital and certain regional and community newspapers in Australia. Circulation and subscription revenues rose 13%, driven by a $26 million or 10% benefit from currency fluctuations, strong digital paid subscriber growth and a couple of price increases partially offset by, lower newsstand sales related to COVID-19. Advertising revenues decreased $215 million or 50% compared to the prior year, reflecting a $199 million or 47% negative impact from the divestiture of News America Marketing and a $23 million or 5% negative impact related to the closure or transition to digital of certain regional and community newspapers in Australia. The remainder of the movement was driven by, favorable foreign exchange partly offset by the continued weakness in the print advertising market, exacerbated by COVID-19. Advertising performance was mixed across the regions with Australia showing moderating declines compared to the second quarter rate, particularly driven by increased retail spending. While the U.K.'s year-over-year performance weakened mostly compared to the second quarter impacted by another lockdown which started at the end of 2020. In the U.S., the trends remained robust with the New York Post posting 21% advertising revenue growth of which digital advertising grew 32%. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $8 million compared to $24 million in the prior year, due primarily to the absence of the contribution from News America Marketing. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased by $5 million. In our other segment, the third quarter costs were higher than we expected, primarily driven by higher equity compensation due to the rising share price and the initial investment spending related to the implementation of our global shared services initiative. I would now like to talk about, some themes for the upcoming quarter. As noted in the past call, forecasting remains challenging given the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. At Digital Real Estate Services national residential listings in Australia for April were up 98% compared to the prior year. While the market dynamics are strong these growth rates are exaggerated by the severe COVID-19-related declines experienced in April 2020. Please refer to REA's press release and earnings call for more details. At Move, we remain very encouraged by overall trends and expect the revenue momentum to continue. We continue to expect additional reinvestments at Move in areas such as, brand marketing and product development as we focus on gaining market share and expanding into adjacencies. In Subscription Video Services, we have seen broadcast churn trends moderate during April. And we remain encouraged by strong OTT demand from Kayo and Binge. We expect EBITDA results to be challenged, due in large part to the lapping of the prior year cost savings. As a reminder, the prior year's fourth quarter results included $70 million of lower sports programming costs, mainly due to the suspension of sporting events, as a result of COVID-19. For the current fiscal fourth quarter, we expect to incur those rights which will be impacted by the rising Aussie dollar versus the U.S. dollar as well as some additional costs for further OTT investments. At Dow Jones, overall revenue trends remained favorable compared to the prior year, including strong digital advertising growth. As mentioned last quarter, we expect to reinvest in the business, as we focus on driving revenue growth through its digital assets and expect second half expenses to increase modestly compared to the prior year. In Book Publishing, overall industry trends remain favorable, but we continue to monitor closely the sustainability of recent consumer spending patterns, such as the increasing free time for consumers to read and the increase in the average number of books purchased. We continue to expect performance to moderate in the fourth quarter, in part, due to the strong performance in the prior year, which benefited from increased consumer demand at the onset of COVID-19 lockdowns, and restrictions as well as the successful release of Magnolia Table, Volume 2. At News Media, we expect continued improvement in the fourth quarter, as we lap both the impact from COVID-19 and the sale of News America Marketing in May 2020. Cost decline should moderate, as we lap COVID-19 saving initiatives as well as the divestment of News America Marketing and the closure or digital transition of some of our newspapers in Australia, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. We expect overall profitability trends to improve. And we expect modest revenue impacts from our new licensing agreements. In our Other segment, we expect the fourth quarter cost to increase around $20 million versus the prior year in-part due to the reduction of bonuses in the prior year, higher share price and the costs related to the global shared services initiative. Our year-to-date free cash flow available was $762 million compared to $63 million in the prior year, benefiting from higher EBITDA, improvements in working capital and lower CapEx. Some of the working capital improvement is timing related, but we're very pleased with the progress made to date. Also note that the fourth quarter balance sheet will reflect the proceeds from our recent senior notes offering, together with the three recently announced acquisitions, which will impact our interest expense and cash balance. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A. Kane, I'll take that one. So I think, just at REALTOR, if you think about the cost for Q4, we did guide to an additional $40 million of cost in the second half. You probably could assume the bulk of that $40 million that we quoted will hit in Q4. So if you compare that to the Q3 numbers, we also expect those numbers to scale up from a variable cost perspective, given the revenue growth. In relation to Dow Jones, we would expect to see higher costs in Q4, largely as a consequence of compensation and marketing expenditure. But we have been very encouraged by the ongoing cost focus in that business. And as you could see, they had a pretty good cost result for this quarter as well. So probably more investment coming through at REALTOR than what we would expect to see in Dow Jones. And Alexia, I think, the other thing that is really encouraging for us is, if I look back over the last 10 quarters and the quarter-on-quarter sort of net adds, the net adds that we had this quarter were the second highest that we've had over those 10 periods and so that gives us confidence actually about the ongoing growth potential within Dow Jones. Yeah. Look in Q4, we obviously had the absence of some bonuses in Q4 of last year and so we obviously wouldn't expect to see that this year. So we've got that movement that's happening. We also had some of the COVID impacts coming through in Q4. So we did have a couple of one-off cost savings that hit in Q4 of last year which we didn't see repeated -- expected to repeat in Q4 of this year. And we also have the scale after some of the news next step transformation project costs that are going to hit in Q4. So I think when we look sort of going forward, we wouldn't expect to see the large movement that we've been seeing in equity comp. I mean, obviously if the share price continues to go up we'll have that natural fluctuation. So we did have a very depressed share price as a consequence of COVID back in Q4 and so we've been seeing those movements come through this year. We don't give out the margins actually for Risk & compliance. But what we would say is though that they are high margin and they've been scaled. So we are seeing good growth within that particular segment."

            "name": "Robert Thomson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. While some nations including America are spasmodically emerging from the ravages of the pandemic, other regions continue to suffer profoundly. We certainly hope that the vicissitudes of the virus will abate and trust that all on this call are navigating these perplexing times safely and securely. I must again salute the people of News Corp, as they continue their extraordinary work for the company and for their communities in these demanding circumstances. Their efforts, their expertise and their endurance have yielded strong results for our company and for the millions of people who find comfort and inspiration and illumination from the news, information insight and entertainment our businesses around the world deliver each and every day. It is further testament to the efforts of all in News Corp that fiscal year 2021 has been defined by improving revenue trends and flourishing profitability. In fact in strictly financial terms, this year is on a trajectory to be the most successful since our reincarnation in 2013 in profitability, highlighting how much the character of the company has evolved over that period. Patently, the strategy of simplifying the asset mix, the vigorous pursuit of digitization, the disciplined cost reductions and the investment focus on three growth areas: Digital Real Estate, Dow Jones and Book Publishing have proven to be particularly fruitful. You will have noticed that since our last earnings call in February, we announced three significant acquisitions that we firmly expect will immediately increase revenue and EBITDA upon closing. The first being Investor's Business Daily to be operated by Dow Jones; the second was Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's Books and Media segment, which will become part of HarperCollins; and the third was Mortgage Choice by REA Group, which will add heft to their Mortgage Broking business. And since our last earnings announcement, we have reached historic and lucrative deals with Google and with Facebook, as we continue our campaign for equitable and substantial compensation from the big tech platforms for our premium journalism whether in text, audio or video. The three-year Google deal is global and involves the creation of a subscription platform, ad revenue sharing and partnerships in audio journalism, as well as video journalism on YouTube. That agreement is evolving well and should be a platform for further cooperation between our companies in the future. The Facebook deal also for three years involves leading metro newspapers in Australia and a large array of regional and local mastheads as well as Sky News Australia and will have a material and meaningful impact on our business in Australia. This deal is in addition to that launch with Facebook in the US in 2019, involving Dow Jones and the New York Post. We are yet to reach agreement with Facebook in the UK and hope that reason will descend imminently. We note the UK. is chairing the G7 and applaud the diligent and intelligent work of Andrea Coscelli and the Competition and Markets Authority, which has developed great insight into the digital landscape and will play a crucial role in drafting a G7 response and in raising social and commercial consciousness. As the terms of trade change, we can expect to see tangible benefits flow to those who report and distribute news to the public. And I am confident that will include publishers large and small, urban and rural, in many countries and in many languages. For us in Australia, the deals will obviously improve the results at our newspapers but also enable us to hire journalists to improve the coverage in underserved regions and communities. Finally, before turning to the quarter's results, I would like to highlight the successful completion of our inaugural bond offering, which was multiple times oversubscribed at an attractive coupon and thus a resounding vote of confidence in the company's strategy and its prospects. As for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, I am pleased to report that we achieved nearly $300 million in profits, up 23% year-over-year. We have now had three successive quarters of double-digit profit increases and we strongly believe these rather positive results reflect an increase in our core profitability. Revenues in the third quarter exceeded $2.3 billion, representing a 3% increase from the prior year. Turning first to the resolutely robust Digital Real Estate Services segment, Move's revenue growth was 37%, exceeding Q2's 28% growth. Move and realtor.com's value to News Corp to the real estate industry and to consumers is becoming more obvious with each passing quarter. Overall, Digital Real Estate Services revenues were up 34% year-over-year and segment EBITDA surged 58%. realtor.com traffic growth has outpaced that of Zillow for 14 consecutive months through March and the significant growth disparity between the two has been widening markedly according to comScore in March. REALTOR's traffic growth outpaced Zillow and Trulia by nearly 30 percentage points. Why this extraordinary growth at REALTOR? Because we are focused on our consumers, whether that be a family buying or selling a house or the agents handling that important transaction. We are not flipping houses. We are not competing with our clients. We are not building up a stock of bricks-and-mortar inventory. We are not worrying over the wallpaper or fretting over fences or stuck up on stucco. We are absolutely digital and devoted to our consumers. This reputational and functional advantage for REALTOR comes at a moment of genuine momentum for the US real estate market. Our internal metrics show that average monthly unique views in the quarter were 44% higher than the prior year and reached 108 million uniques for the month of March alone, a burgeoning of 60% versus the prior year. Not only is realtor.com serving homebuyers and sellers, we are serving renters and landlords as well. We expanded our rentals offering by acquiring Avail, where revenue growth has exceeded initial expectations and we are excited about the opportunity that lies ahead in this lucrative market segment. In Australia, the real estate market is thriving, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. REA Group, the clear leader in that country's digital real estate sector saw revenues increase by 32%. During the quarter, REA announced that it proposed to acquire 100% of the shares in Mortgage Choice Limited. The proposed acquisition aligns with REA's financial services strategy by leveraging the group's digital expertise, motivated property buyers and data insights across a larger network. At Dow Jones, revenues rose 6% year-over-year and segment EBITDA led an impressive 61%. Overall, advertising which was slightly down in Q2, moved into positive terrain in Q3 with digital advertising 30% higher in the quarter, almost double the growth rate of the New York Times. Digital now represents 61% of all advertising, compared to a ratio of 48% in the prior year. Digital-only subs at Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal surged 29% and Dow Jones digital-only net adds in the quarter, exceeded those of the New York Times for its new subscriptions. MarketWatch is achieving record-high revenues and is now benefiting from multiple revenue streams, with the successful launch of its subscription offering in October. Risk & Compliance reported growth of 24% in the quarter, marking 23 consecutive quarters of double-digit expansion. This strength underscores R&C's value as a global leader in data intelligence, including in anti-money laundering, anticorruption and commercial risk assessment. With increasingly stringent demands from the US government and bodies around the world for strict compliance and heightened emphasis on ESG, we believe Dow Jones Risk & Compliance is perfectly poised to benefit. If anyone on this call would like to minimize risk or maximize compliance, please do reach out. Meanwhile we are on the cusp of integrating Investor's Business Daily. That deal closed this week and we expect IBD will provide innumerable opportunities for cross-selling and upselling with the Dow Jones portfolio of products. IBD will also be a source of important expertise and insight, as 90% of its revenue is digital and the company has a compelling lucrative suite of software products. Book Publishing is another engine of growth for News Corp, as HarperCollins continued on its extremely positive trajectory with 19% revenue growth in the quarter, compared to a year earlier and segment EBITDA surging 45%, as both our powerful backlist and notable front list performed strongly. One of the standouts in the third quarter was the Bridgerton series, which is now the most successful series of HarperCollins in fiscal 2021. Other strong performers included The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse by Charles Mackesy and Cicely Tyson's memoir Just as I Am. The power of the HarperCollins substantial backlist in Q3 reinforces our enthusiasm, the anticipated integration of the newly acquired Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Books and Media segment, which should close in Q4. This acquisition will greatly expand the HarperCollins backlist with an additional 7,000 titles, including such monumental works as The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Animal Farm and 1984; and loved children's books, like Curious George, The Polar Express, The Little Prince and many, many more. We look forward with eager anticipation to Amazon's production of J.R.R. Tolkien's works due in coming years. As with HMH, we will have acquired the US rights to that extraordinary collection and will now own the global English language rights. As Tolkien himself wrote, the greatest adventure is what lies ahead. Today and tomorrow are yet to be said. In Subscription Video Services, our strategy to rapidly expand streaming has been transformational for Foxtel. The express growth of Kayo and Binge, together with Foxtel Now, saw a number of paying OTT subscribers reach approximately 1.6 million as at the end of March. That represents a doubling of streaming subscribers over the past year alone, an extraordinary achievement. In total, Foxtel closing subscribers grew to a record of over 3.5 million, up 21% year-over-year, driving a significant increase in profitability. Kayo Sports has helped make Foxtel, the preeminent home of sports in Australia, with a record 2.2 million sports subscribers. Of these, Kayo accounted for 851,000 paying subscribers, as at March 31, more than double the prior year, where it was 408,000. In recent days, Kayo exceeded one million total subscribers, with paying subscribers expected to reach that milestone imminently. A strong summer of cricket and the start of the dominant winter sports saw Kayo generate more momentum. This was supported by our recent agreement with Telstra, which has seen Kayo replace Telstra Live Pass in the AFL Live app and NRL official app, making Kayo the exclusive streaming home of the extremely popular Aussie Rules and Rugby League competitions. Not yet one year old, the Binge entertainment streaming service reached 516,000 paying subscribers, up nearly 20% on the second quarter. Binge has established consistent weekly subscriber growth, underpinned by the growing awareness of the Binge brand, the popularity of hit shows such as The Flight Attendant, The Walking Dead and Zack Snyder's, Justice League and it's deserved reputation for a user-friendly tech savvy access to the world's best content. Foxtel's resurgence during the pandemic, coupled with the continuing value of its broadcast product, the rapid growth of Kayo and Binge and a relentless focus on cost transformation have delivered a much enhanced financial performance that certainly gives us flexibility and optionality. In the News Media segment, revenues declined somewhat as expected. The difference was entirely attributable to the sale of News America Marketing and the restructuring of regional and community titles in Australia, most of which became digital-only properties. In the UK, circulation revenues increased, while The New York Post continued revenue growth, driven by strong expansion in digital advertising. Finally, I want to express my enduring gratitude for the thousands of people who work at News Corp around the world, for their creativity, their commitment and their collaborative spirit, which has been a guiding force as we navigate through the uncharted turbulent waters of the pandemic. The past 12 months have seen record profits in many of our businesses, a strong reinforcement of our digital imperative and particularly potent performances by the three sectors that we had targeted for expedited growth. It is clear that our investors are increasingly embracing that strategy and profiting from that strategy. And now, I turn to Susan Panuccio, for words of financial wisdom. Well, I'm not sure I'm that precedent and I certainly don't pass myself off as a soothsayer. But we are firmly of the view that real estate properties make us the world's leading digital property company. And we also are firmly of the view that we have vast potential for growth, given the markets in which we operate and given our successful acquisition strategy. And equally, we are firmly of the view that the full value of our digital property assets and their potential is not yet entirely recognized in our share price. We now have a global leadership of our real estate assets with Tracey Fellows and her appointment itself was a sign of our intention and our ambition. And she's not just working through ideas for the future. She's driving the business and seeking out new opportunities, such as cities, such as rental and such as other adjacencies that will generate even more momentum. Well, the key factor for us is the quality of the Wall Street Journal, the quality of the journalism, the quality of the leadership. We have a great team at Dow Jones with Almar Latour and Josh Stinchcomb, our Chief Revenue Officer, who've done a sterling job collectively in developing our digital expertise. So we don't have to worry about a Trump bump becoming a Trump slump, as you might see in other places. The Wall Street Journal's journalism obviously rises above the -- sort of gormless rhetoric the pants-tearing [ph], the jaundiced journalism that you see in some other places. And so, the Dow Jones results certainly rise above those of the New York Times, both in circulation now in the news segment and in digital advertising, which was almost double that of the New York Times. And so, it is in essence the enduring quality of the Journal that gives us momentum. And those are very positive wins that we're seeing now and are confident that we'll see in the future. And to further supplement Susan's wise observation, the acquisition of IBD will give us further opportunity to up-sell to cross-sell across both properties. And that's why we acquired the IBD, which is close to closing. And that's why -- and that investment itself was an indication of our confidence in the sector. Craig, look I think that's a fair assessment. We certainly have confidence in our teams and their ability to integrate those acquisitions. We certainly have a fundamental faith in the sectors themselves. And you will see that the financial impact of the acquisitions will be almost immediately positive for both revenue and EBITDA. At both Investor's Business Daily and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt General Book division are highly profitable. And in Australia Mortgage Choice will surely complement the existing mortgage broking business at REA. And as I mentioned earlier with IBD being 90% digital now, it's extremely contemporary. We will be able to cross-sell and upsell and make the most of our existing content. And there's -- at HarperCollins Brian Murray and the team there's no doubt we have a history of successfully integrating businesses. And so we fully expect profits to increase at both HMH and thus at HarperCollins and thus at News Corp. And as we indicated earlier, the climate for Risk & Compliance is certainly conducive to growth given the advent of US administration that is obviously intent upon increasing regulation and the need for compliance. Well we're certainly focused on all segments at Foxtel and we're genuinely delighted by the progress where we have EBITDA up 34%. And the revenue trends are obviously improving. We haven't seen the spindown from broadcasting that some feared. And Kayo is as we mentioned on the cusp of one million paying subscribers with a user base already larger than that and Binge growing week after week after week. And frankly, all underpinned by world-class cutting-edge technology that provides a great user experience. And its financial position overall is much more robust and Patrick Siobhan and the team deserve much credit for the markedly improved performance. That means, we frankly have options real options."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the News Corp. 2Q Fiscal 2021 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mike Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMike Florin: Thank you very much, Ally. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp.'s Fiscal Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We'll open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release. With that, I will pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\nRobert Thomson: Thank you, Mike. Across this country and around the world in so many places for so many people, these past few months have been characterized by considerable upheaval, with social, political, financial and health-related tribulations and turmoil deeply profoundly affecting many families, economies and communities. I trust that all on this call and your families have been weathering the storm safely and safely. In the midst of this tumult, which has been a severe stress test for individuals and businesses and countries, I am gratified to report that News Corp has navigated the turbulence, and to be candid, significantly very significantly, increased profitability. We noted 3 months ago that the first quarter was particularly robust. And so I am pleased to report that our second quarter results were even more robust. And this burgeoning is a tribute to the efforts and the commitment and the professionalism of all our employees and to the enduring value of the company's culture created by Rupert Murdoch. In fact, the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 was the most profitable quarter since the new News Corp was launched more than 7 years ago, and there were other significant records established. We have the largest profits for Dow Jones since the acquisition of the company in December 2007. While we reported a 77% rise in EBITDA at subscription video services, where at Foxtel, streaming customers hit an historic high, and we also benefited from lower costs. As Digital Real Estate Services, Move accounted for approximately 80% of that segment's EBITDA growth. And history was made when the New York Post reported a profit for the quarter and for the year-to-date. That is the first profit in modern times at the very least, for what was a chronic loss-making masthead founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton. In short, Digital Real Estate Services, Book Publishing and Dow Jones all performed powerfully in Q2, collectively generating segment EBITDA growth of close to 40%. Their continuing expansion highlights profound potential of the company to increase profits and generate value for our shareholders far into the future. These resilient results are founded on our long-term strategic shift in the company's assets, determine digitization and a relentless discipline on costs. We were adamant that we would not be victims of digital dystopia, but that we would contribute to fashioning a more fruitful future for content creators, and we are seeing the results of that result. It is fair to say that regulators globally have joined the digital dots. In the second quarter, every segment in News Corp showed marked operating improvements and contributed meaningfully to our profitability. We continue to see increased cooperation across the company with valuable digital lessons and insights at each business rigorously applied for the benefit of all and to the benefit of shareholders. While overall revenues at over $2.4 billion declined 3 point -- 3% year-on-year, that was fundamentally due to the sale of News America Marketing in 2020. On an adjusted basis, a more genuine like-for-like comparison, revenues rose 2% despite the pernicious consequences of COVID-19. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $497 million, the highest of any quarter since our reincarnation in 2013. Year-over-year, that represents profitability growth of 40%, while our free cash flow available to News Corp for the half rose by $373 million. A pandemic is indeed a stress test, and News Corp is surely passing that test. At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, Move's revenue growth was 28%, and that came despite restrictions in certain states on inspections and thus sales. Having been an ardent supporter of the acquisition of Move, it is worth noting that we believe the net cost of this company, including the substantial settlement we ultimately received from Zillow in our trade secret lawsuit against them is a mere fraction of its current value. Net-net, we paid considerably less than $1 billion for Move in 2014. We believe it is worth vastly more today. And how much will it be worth in 5 years as the digitization of sales in the world's largest property market continues at pace. At the time of our acquisition, realtor.com was a struggling third place platform with modest profitability and fewer than 30 million monthly users. There was some [indiscernible] about the acquisition. But we were absolutely clear that our media platforms and growing digital expertise, plus our experience with REA in Australia would enable us to transform the company. In the first half of this fiscal year, REALTOR has contributed more to our profit growth than the brilliant beacon that is REA in Australia. So how much is REALTOR worth now? How much is New Corp worth? I will let you do the math. To help you do that math, a few specifics. REALTOR traffic has now outgrowing Zillow for 19 of the past 21 months, according to comScore, including the last 11 months in a row. According to our internal metrics, average unique monthly users in the second quarter were 37% higher than the prior year, and we reached each month, on average, 80 million people. Just to give you a sense of site scale and loyalty, we had 8.7 total billion paid views in the second quarter, more than 1 page for every person on our plant, and that number does not include photo galleries of houses. Multiply the number of visitors by the images in those galleries, and you get a sense of the scale of the intense interaction by users. Traffic has continued to grow since the quarter's end, with unique users reaching a record 94 million for the month of January. During Q2, Moves expanded in the rental market through its acquisition of Avail, an online property management platform that focuses on doing yourself landlords and tenants. This is significant given the fact that DIY landlords own and manage about 3/4 of rentals in the U.S. and a rental market according to U.S. Census Bureau data is a $500 billion per year business. So the addressable market is appreciable and appreciated. Also in Q2, realtor.com launched an advertising partnership with Rocket Mortgage, while continuing to build an even more seamless process for consumers wishing to qualify for mortgages to purchase a home. In January, REALTOR announced a partnership with Qualia to provide simplified digital home closings, allowing for greater online collaboration between agents and their clients. Let us be very clear. Buying a home is by far the largest investment that most families will make. And the purchase around that acquisition, whether it be securing a mortgage or starting with electricity or a broadband provider are necessary and valuable adjacencies. The home purchase is at the very center of that cluster of commerce and REALTOR's are at the very center of that purchase. From a macro perspective, the overall housing market in the U.S. not only has proven to be resilient during the time of crisis, it has demonstrated tangible strength with many positive signs of activity even with listing volumes at a historic low. With mortgage rates at a minimum and families expanding their search for better larger homes and new locations, there is reason to be optimistic about the trajectory of the sector. Resilience and optimism also characterized the housing market in Australia, with the emergence from lockdowns in the quarter has led to significant signs of recovery. Australia is still a growing economy, and it will continue to benefit from its location in the world's fastest-growing region. The deep ties with Asia, including India, give it a distinct advantage, along with its reliable legal procedures and stable coherent cogent political system. We believe it is still a country that is far from maximizing its potential and the growth opportunities are pronounced. In the second quarter, REA acquired a controlling interest in Elara Technologies, making it the majority owner of a large and growing Indian digital real estate portal, including housing.com and PropTiger.com. As measured by audience, Elara runs India's fastest-growing digital real estate business, and India itself is one of the world's fastest growing economies. So the possibilities are profound. We are, under Tracey Fellows leadership, by many measures, the world's largest digital property company, and we are acutely focused on the countries that we believe have the largest digital property potential. Meanwhile, HarperCollins had one of its most lucrative quarters with double-digit growth across every category. There were many successful new releases. While the back was bolstered both revenue and profitability as did our continued growth in digital. Brian Murray and the team are at a relatively early stage of the development of audio books and the proliferation of audio devices to the home will only increase the demand for our content. I'm not sure that all investors have yet comprehended the full value of that digital opportunity. As for the resident titles and successful catalog, there was: Didn't You See That Coming by Rachel Hollis; The Happy in a Hurry Cookbook, Steve Doocy; The Greatest Secret by Rhonda Byrne; Frontier follies, Ree Drummond; and the continuing strong demand for Magnolia Table, Volume 2 by Joanna Gaines. And then in January, there was Bridgerton. We have the series of 9 Bridgeton books by Julia Quinn, which are prospering, given the popularity of the autonomous series for which a new series has recently been announced. In all, revenues at HarperCollins ascended 23% in the quarter, and segment EBITDA surged 65% over the prior year. Dow Jones also set records this quarter, including having its highest absolute EBITDA since News Corp acquired the company in late 2007, with segment EBITDA up 43%, while the New York Times eked out a 1% increase. Digital advertising expanded 29%, the highest quarter in Dow Jones history, while digital advertising at the New York Times fell by 2%. Clearly, print was challenged during a pandemic period in which distribution was compromised. But overall advertising was down just 4%. Comparing dramatically with The New York Times, where it slumped 19%. In our professional information business, Risk and Compliance continued its record of extraordinary expansion with year-over-year revenue growth accelerating to 21%. Q2 marks Risk and Compliance 22nd consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth year-over-year. Given international tension with both the U.S. and China in posing controls on companies, and with the new administration in the U.S. inclined to tougher regulation, how bright are the prospects for Risk and Compliance. If anyone on this call works for a company that is not yet a client, I suggest that you remedy that dereliction. Traffic and subscribers across Dow Jones properties are surging. And Almar and the team are determined to make the most of the opportunity. WSJ digital-only subscriptions were up 28% and MarketWatch also had a successful digital subscription launch in Q2. We have always insisted that our strategy is to upsell at Dow Jones given our nonpareil portfolio. And so it's worth noting that more than 70% of those MarketWatch subscribers chose a bundle that included subscription to Barrons. As for traffic, average monthly unique users across the Dow Jones digital network were up 48% in the quarter, reaching 127 million, driven by 64% growth at both the Wall Street Journal and Barron's. In Subscription Video Services, our strategy to reshape the Foxtel Group as the next-generation subscription business is clearly gaining traction with total closing paid subscriptions increasing 12% and setting a new record of over 3.31 million. OTT now accounts for 40% of Foxtel's paying subscriber base, with more than 1.3 million streaming subscribers. The actual growth rate in streaming subscribers was over 90% driven by the strength of Binge, which launched last May and the continued expansion of Kayo. In the past, there has been skepticism about whether we could transition from our reliance on traditional broadcast, but hat those concerns have proven unfounded, and Foxtel is now a company with a diverse portfolio and much momentum. I would like to repeat that EBITDA at the Subscription Video Services segment for the quarter rose 77% on the same quarter last year. And for the first half, segment EBITDA was 34% higher. Growth has been crucial for that success. But we have a leadership team at Foxtel steered ably by Siobhan McKenna and Patrick Delany that has been absolutely focused on reviewing every aspect of the company's performance and diligently reducing costs where appropriate. That insight, foresight and discipline have contributed to the transformation of the company and given us a powerful platform and much optionality for the future. We have now secured long-term rights to the 3 most popular sports in the country, Aussie Rules, Rugby League and cricket, which had astounded success in the summer with the tour of the triumphant Indian team. Record after record was set on the cricket pitch and on the screen, whether they were traditional screen or a digital device. And that multi-platform future is now secure with both Australian Rules and Rugby, thanks to our partners at Telstra. Over 3 million live pass customers will have the opportunity to transition to Kayo over the coming months so that they can watch their teams, when they want to watch, how they want to watch, where they want to watch and on whatever device they want to launch. This is a monumental moment for Foxtel. Our News Media segment also contributed meaningfully to News Corp's profitability this quarter, with digital ad growth in the U.K. and at The New York Post. We had indeed indicated that the New York Post was on a path towards profitability, and it certainly achieved that doll in the second quarter. Our task now is to ensure its long-term profitability, given the challenges in that sector. Digital ad growth at the post was 64% up year-over-year. For the quarter, digital advertising accounted for nearly 90% of the total, page views of the posts were up 37%. It was also a quarter in which The Post reported a significant victory for all media for the freedom of the press by standing resolute and principled against censorship imposed by Twitter. Ultimately, Twitter realized that it's made an egregious mistake and thankfully, reversed it's decision. Our journalist are not lap dogs with laptops. Our journalists are not stenographers, our journalists are not wonks. Our journalists are awake to their profound responsibilities. In Australia, we were fortunately ahead of the curve in transitioning many of our local and regional print properties to digital platforms, which help them weather the storm of lockdown. Our Australian leadership under Michael Miller was disciplined in reducing costs and yet remained ambitious for our news platforms during this time of transition for journals. And Rebekah Brooks showed real leadership in the U.K. across our baskets like The Sun and The Times in our emerging digital businesses and it will as our radio network, which reached nearly 5 million listeners. In both Australia and the U.K., we are using our skills in video and audio to enhance our traditional platforms, and that is clear at Times Radio, which is an extension of a newspaper founded in London in 1785. On these calls, I've often referenced the ongoing debate with what is loosely called Big Digital. I personally regard that moniker as a euphemism. We're at a pivotal moment of those discussions in Australia, where new regulations and new terms of trade will be introduced. But that debate now extends across the globe. There is not a single serious digital regulator anywhere in the world who is not examining the opacity of algorithms, the integrity of personal data, the social value of professional journalism and the dysfunctional digital ad market. This has been an imperative for News Corp for far more than a decade. I gave evidence the House of Lords in London on this various subject in 2007. And it has been an imperative because we truly care about the social value of journalism, and we believe that the social value has a commercial value. This enduring often solitary campaign would not have been successful without the further support of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and the News Corp Board. We expect that the new tech topography will benefit our company's financial fortunes. That is for certain. And it will also have a material impact in not only the countries in which we operate, but in every country. An ambitious inspired young woman starting a digital news site in Nigeria or in Birmingham, England or Birmingham, Alabama, now has a far better, a far, far better chance of sustainable success. Finally, I want to thank all those contributed to the singular success of News Corp in this historic quarter. That would be all our employees who've contributed each day in courageous compassionate ways. I salute those individuals for what they have done and for what they continue to do for the company and for their communities. Thank you. While the macro environment remains unpredictable, our goal is to ensure that new score is best positioned for long-term success and that our value is absolutely appreciated by investors. And now I hand you to Susan Panuccio for some wise words.\nSusan Panuccio: Thank you, Robert. Fiscal 2021 second quarter total revenues were over $2.4 billion, a decline of 3% versus the prior year, while total segment EBITDA was $497 million, up 40% year-over-year, reflecting strong performances across all of our key reportable segments, driven by a combination of improved operating trends and cost reductions. This is the highest quarterly segment EBITDA since the company was formed in 2013. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, most notably the sale of News America Marketing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 as well as currency fluctuations and other items disclosed in our release revenues rose 2%, while total segment EBITDA grew 39%. Net income for the quarter was $261 million compared to $103 million in the prior year. For the quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.39 as compared to $0.14 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS was $0.34 in the quarter compared with $0.18 in the prior year. Turning now to the operating segments. Digital Real Estate Services segment revenues were $339 million, an increase of 15% compared to the prior year, which is more than double the rate in the first quarter, driven by another record quarterly performance for Move. On an adjusted basis, revenues increased 11%. Segment EBITDA rose 20% to $142 million or 19% on an adjusted basis despite higher investment spending, which was in contrast to the first quarter. Results also included $6 million of costs associated with Move's acquisition of Avail and the Elara transaction at REA. Move's operating results accounted for over 75% of segment revenue growth and approximately 80% of segment EBITDA growth this quarter. Move's revenues accelerated to $155 million, a 28% year-over-year increase, with real estate revenues rising 30%. As Robert mentioned, realtor.com traffic reached 80 million average monthly unique users, reflecting an increase of 37% year-over-year with growth in December accelerating to 44%. Monthly average lead volume remained very strong, growing over 30%. Like the first quarter, we saw strong growth in the performance-based referral model, which accounted for approximately 30% of total Move revenues in the quarter, benefiting from the growth in lead volume, higher home prices and real estate transaction closes. Not only did we see an acceleration in the revenue growth of the referral model this quarter compared to the prior quarter but we also saw growth in Connection Plus, our traditional lead generation product, driven by strong customer demand, enabling improved pricing and higher sell through. As our referral revenues are recognized upon transaction closures, only around 20% of the associated revenues from leads generated in this quarter are reflected in the results. This provides a strong pipeline through the balance of the year, assuming continued favorable housing conditions. These results are very encouraging, and we remain focused on expanding our addressable market through the integration of key ancillary services, including our Rocket Mortgage partnership. We've contributed $19 million to the segment EBITDA growth this quarter versus the prior year, driven by the strong top line growth. As we had previously indicated, we are increasing our investment levels in REALTOR, given the rapid performance in lead volume and further expansion into adjacency. Revenues at REA Group rose 6% to $184 million, reflecting a $12 million or 7% benefit from currency fluctuations. COVID-19 restrictions eased during the quarter, including the removal of property inspection restrictions in Melbourne. Residential listings for the quarter rose 10%, including 25% growth in Metro Melbourne and 13% growth in Sydney. A new developer project launches increased 12% on the prior year. REA's results benefited from growth in residential revenues, which was offset by declines in commercial and Asia. It also is worth remembering that as a consequence of COVID, REA did not implement a price increase in July. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more detail. Turning to Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $511 million, up 2% versus the prior year and included a $33 million or 7% positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted revenues were down 5%, an improvement on the Q1 decline of 7%, benefiting from moderating broadcast subscription revenue declines and the expansion of OTT revenues. Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base reached over 3.3 million as of December 31, up 12% year-over-year, with OTT expanding to over 1.3 million paying subscribers, close to double the prior year's number with Kayo reaching 624,000 and Binge at 431,000 paying subscribers. Kayo subscribers declined slightly quarter-over-quarter due to seasonality, but the decline was much less pronounced than last year as the business successfully managed to transition from winter to spring and summer sporting codes, underpinned by the exclusive cricket content. Residential broadcast subscribers declined about 11% to approximately $1.8 million, relatively consistent with last quarter. Commercial subscribers declined 18% year-over-year to 218,000, with the trend improving sequentially, having bottomed out at 86,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 as a consequence of the pandemic. Broadcast churn was somewhat elevated at 17.5% versus 16% in the prior year, impacted by a strategy to reduce promotional offers, which resulted in the roll-off of lower ARPU subscribers. The financial benefit is reflected in a 3% increase in ARPU to almost AUD 80. Segment EBITDA improved 77% to $124 million, the continuing cost transformation at Foxtel, desire to rightsize the cost base was the driver of profitability. Total cost declined approximately 10%, including $35 million of lower sports programming rights and production costs, which was primarily driven by savings from renegotiated sports rights partially offset by the $20 million negative impact related to the deferral of these costs from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Expenses also benefited from lower entertainment programming costs and lower overheads. Some of the cost benefits are timing related, which will reverse later in the year, I will touch on these later. Moving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones delivered its highest revenue quarter since separation in 2013 and its higher segment EBITDA quarter since News Corp's acquisition in 2007. Revenues for the quarter were $446 million, up 4% compared to the prior year, with digital revenues accounting for 70% of total revenues this quarter, up 6 percentage points from the prior year. Circulation revenues rose 8% due to growth in digital circulation revenues, partially offset by lower single copy and amenity print volume still impacted by COVID-19. As Robert mentioned, Dow Jones again achieved record subscriptions in the quarter with average subscriptions to its consumer products for the quarter exceeding $4 million, up 18% from the prior year and off that digital-only subscriptions were over $3 million, up 29% year-over-year. For the Wall Street Journal, there were 3.2 million average subscriptions for the quarter, up nearly 19% from the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions growing 28% to nearly 2.5 million. Revenues from Dow Jones Risk and Compliance grew 21%, which was a faster growth rate than the past 3 quarters. Overall, professional information business revenues rose 4%. Advertising revenues, which accounted for 26% of revenues this quarter declined just 4% to $115 million, a marked improvement from the 17% decline last quarter. As Robert mentioned, we had another record quarter for digital advertising with 29% growth and digital accounting for 58% of advertising revenues for the second quarter. We saw growth in all categories, particularly in technology. Print advertising revenues declined 29% year-over-year, which was an improvement from the 39% decline in the first quarter. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 43% to $109 million, with margins expanding to over 24% and up almost 7 percentage points versus the prior year. Costs declined almost 5% this quarter due to lower print volumes and other discretionary savings. At Book Publishing, HarperCollins posted 23% revenue growth to $544 million and a 65% segment EBITDA growth to $104 million, marking the best quarterly performance in its history. Revenue growth was strong across all categories with double digit gains. Robert mentioned the depth of the sub list this quarter, which included strong performances from numerous authors, including Rachel Hollis, Rhonda Byrne, Ree Drummond and Joanna Gaines and David Walliams among others. Similar to what we saw in the past 2 quarters, we are continuing to benefit from a strong rebound in e-books with overall digital sales up 15% year-over-year. E-book sales increased 21% year-over-year with gains in all categories, while downloadable audio books increased 10% year-over-year. We have continued to see higher online sales and, in particularly, benefited from strong orders from Amazon and other e-commerce platforms during the holiday season. But perhaps more importantly, we are seeing very strong consumption levels, likely benefiting from stay-at-home measures and a continuous flow of new content. Revenues increased at low double digits across the backlist, notwithstanding, they contributed 55% of sales this quarter, down from 58% last year due to the larger mix of the front list titles. HarperCollins again demonstrated strong operating leverage despite a 16% increase in cost, in part due to royalties and higher production expenses related to the successful top line performance, margins improved by almost 5 percentage points. Turning to News Media. Despite ongoing challenges, we remain focused on rightsizing the cost base and moving towards digital, helped by a moderation in advertising revenue trends. Revenues for the quarter were $573 million, down 29% versus the prior year, of which the impact from the divestment of News America marketing accounted for the majority of the decline. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact from the divestment of NAM and Unruly and the other items mentioned in our release, revenues declined 9%, which is an improvement from a 16% decline in the first quarter. The decline also reflects $34 million or 4% negative impact from the closure or transition to digital of certain regional and community newspapers in Australia. Circulation and subscription revenues rose 5%. There's a $9 million or 4% benefit from currency fluctuations, strong digital paid subscriber growth and cover price increases offset lower news stand sales related to COVID-19. Overall, the year-over-year trends in local currency were better in both the U.K. and Australia compared to the first quarter. Circulation revenues accounted for 45% of total segment revenues. And was slightly higher than advertising this quarter as the mix of revenues become more reoccurring and predictable. Advertising revenue fell $231 million or 48% on a reported basis, of which $191 million or 40% was from the sale of News America Marketing, and $28 million or 6% was related to the negative impact from the closure or transition to digital of certain regional community titles in Australia. The remainder of the decline was due to the overall weakness in the print advertising market. On a positive note, the New York Post continued to outperform with advertising revenues up 23%, and as Robert mentioned, digital advertising up 64%. In fact, digital revenues at the New York Post exceeded 50% of total revenues this quarter. And overall, the New York Post had its highest digital revenue since 2013. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $66 million, flat with the prior year despite the $22 million a onetime benefit in the prior year related to a settlement of certain warranty related claims in the U.K. and the absence of the modest contribution from News America marketing. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased 5%, which included a $5 million positive contribution from the New York Post. I would now like to talk about some things in the upcoming quarter and the second half. Overall, we expect to see some slowdown in the second half results with forecasting remaining particularly challenging given the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. At Digital Real Estate Services, as REA noted, National Residential Listings in Australia for January were flat to the prior year. Results will reflect a small loss related to the consolidation of Elara Technologies in the second half. Please refer to REA's press release and earnings call for more detail. At Move, we remain encouraged by the traffic and lead volume trends, which are expected to drive higher revenues in the second half despite the historically low listing volumes across the industry. We expect these higher revenues to fund at least $40 million of additional reinvestments in the second half compared to the prior year in areas such as brand marketing and product development as we focus on gaining market share and expanding into adjacencies. In Subscription Video Services, we have seen broadcast churn continue to increase due to the ongoing focus on ARPU and seasonal trends with the end of winter sports. However, Kayo has remained resilient, and our OTT subscriber growth led by Binge remains strong. We expect EBITDA results in the second half to be more challenged due in part to the lapping of the prior year cost savings. As a reminder, fiscal 2020 fourth quarter results included a $70 million cost benefit due to the deferral of sports rights and production costs related to COVID-19. We now expect full year overall cost declines, given the better-than-expected revenue performance to be more modest than we had initially expected, with a net reduction of less than AUD 100 million. This includes approximately AUD 80 million of higher sports comp in the second half of fiscal 2021, particularly in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period. At Dow Jones, overall revenue trends remained favorable compared to the prior year, including strong digital advertising growth. As we look to the rest of the year, we continue to expect to reinvest in the business as we focus on driving revenue growth to its digital assets and expect second half expenses to increase modestly compared to the prior year. In addition, third quarter will face a more difficult digital advertising growth comparison. In Book Publishing, overall industry trends remain favorable, we continue to monitor closely the sustainability of recent consumer spending patterns, such as the increasing free time for consumers to read and the increase in the average number of books purchased. The second half comparables will be tougher, particularly in the fourth quarter, given the material outperformance last year and as we lap some of the initial benefits at the outset of COVID-19. At News Media, the ongoing national lockdown in the U.K. and domestic travel restrictions in Australia continue to put pressure on print circulation, especially with daily newsstand and are also creating increased uncertainty on advertising spend across most categories. Cost declines in the second half are expected to moderate from the first half rate as we lap some COVID-19 saving initiatives as well as the divestment of News America Marketing and the closure or digital transition of some of our newspapers in Australia in the fourth quarter. In our other segment, for the second half, we expect at least a $50 million increase in cost, driven by a combination of higher equity comp related to the stock price performance and the absence of the bonus reductions across the senior executive team in the prior year in response to COVID-19 as well as additional costs related to the implementation of the global shared services initiative. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go ahead and take our first question from Alexia Quadrani from JP Morgan.\nZilu Pan: This is Zilu Pan on for Alexia. Digital advertising at Dow Jones continues to outperform some of your peers. And I'm wondering if there's any further color you can give on why you think you are doing relatively quite well on that front. Is there a vertical SKU or specific advertising products driving the outperformance? And then just some Foxtel with better results at the segment due to the streaming products, what indicators or trends are you looking for to determine the next steps for that asset?\nRobert Thomson: Well, first of all, Dow Jones. We have a great team at Dow Jones led by Almar Latour and Josh Stinchcomb, our Chief Revenue Officer, he's done a sterling job in developing our digital ad expertise. And that's across wsj.com, MarketWatch, Barron's and beyond. And the increase has been across categories, but also in new categories in custom advertising. And it's clear that if you want not just a safe space, but a space that is brand-enhancing and an audience that's still most influential in the world in [indiscernible] well heeled, then Dow Jones has comparative advantages. Just one broader point to bear in mind with the imminent death of the cookie, our vast audience in the U.S., for example, will be particularly valuable and Dow Jones is a significant component in that. When you add together the uniques across our U.S. businesses, and this is not dejobbing, as you can tell from the number, but we have a close to 350 million monthly nicks. So that's in the advertising audience that's important for Dow Jones but for all our properties.\nSusan Panuccio: And I think just to add to Robert's comment, we also, under Josh, who leads the sales team at Dow Jones have been very focused over the past 18 months on improving our ad tech capabilities, upskilling the sales force and improving yield management, which we now believe we're starting to see the benefit of in addition to obviously, the audience growth. And just in relation to the second question for Foxtel. When we think about the trends that we're looking at and the next steps for the assets, well, clearly, OTT will be an ongoing focus for us in that business. As well as the stability in broadcast as the team focus on the management of the base subscribers within broadcast. And they are clearly focused on costs as well. They've done a tremendous job in the first half or really over the last10 months since COVID-19 started in taking out the underlying cost of the business, the renegotiation of sports and entertainment contracts, but we'll be particularly looking forward to the growth within the OTT properties.\nRobert Thomson: And to complement Susan's comments, so let's consider how the Foxtel narrative has changed to the questions we have been asked a couple of quarters ago whether we would need to put extra capital into Foxtel and then we're asked whether some spec wanted to buy more speculation and speculation. And the truth is that the successful development of the business has given us real options. And our immediate task and the team's task is to keep driving the business to keep striving, we've obviously made a fairly successful migration to streaming up 90% year-on-year. And we obviously have hits with Kayo and Binge, and we obviously have more work ahead. But the path to the future is certainly paid with possibility.\nOperator: We'll go ahead and hear from Kane Hannan from Goldman Sachs.\nKane Hannan: Congratulations on the result. Just 2 for me. Firstly, just the Move revenue outlook. You're talking about $40 million back to the incremental investment. You're seeing strong traffic growth. You won't have the agent concessions in the fourth quarter. Do you think it's possible that, that revenue growth continues to accelerate in the second half? Or just how should we think about the revenue trends? And then secondly, just on the global shared services initiative, I think it was the $100 million bucket you were talking about at the full year result. Just given some of these increasing investment you're talking to in the second half, just interested how we should be thinking about that program in FY '22 and whether there's any change to those sorts of targets?\nSusan Panuccio: Thanks. Kane, I might take those questions, and Robert can add and supplement as he will. So just in relation to the sustainability of Move growth, I mean, we remain very confident in the growth of the business and are encouraged by the traffic and the lead volumes, as we talked about in our prepared remarks, notwithstanding the industry listing volumes remain at historically low levels. We do expect with the revenue growth, the cost will increase. And I think the interesting thing to note, when we think about the results for this quarter versus the first quarter, actually, the cost increased this quarter. And so it was really top line revenue growth that was dropping down to the bottom line. So we do think that the revenue growth will continue, and we do want to scale up those costs in the reinvestment areas that I mentioned, marketing and product development. Just in relation to shared services, yes, we did quote $100 million for financial year '22. We're still holding that number at this stage, notwithstanding the cost work that we've done across the business. We do still think that there are enormous opportunities, but it will require, obviously, a lot of work and reconfiguration of our systems in order to unlock those savings. But at this stage, the guidance is still $100 million for financial year '22.\nRobert Thomson: And just to supplement, Susan, particularly on Move, clearly, we have to be somewhat cautious in the second half of the year simply because of the complications of COVID. There's a lack of visibility for many of our businesses. And you can see that reflected in our words today. We are certainly taking nothing for granted despite the excellence of the Q2 results. But at Move, the signs are positive, at least in January, and David and the team at REALTOR. With January normally a slower month, unique users rose 37% to $94 million, and the lead volume remained robust. Those are indicators, but we are taking nothing for granted.\nOperator: Next we'll hear from Entcho Raykovski from Credit Suisse.\nEntcho Raykovski: Robert, Susan, I've got a couple. Firstly, within News Media, obviously, significant cost reductions in the quarter. Just interested in whether you can make any comments about the extent to which those cost reductions are permanent. You obviously indicated that print circulation may be challenged in future quarters. So I don't know if that just results in lower print costs, which may come back down the track. And whether you, in fact, see further opportunities for cost reductions within that division. And then second question is around SVS. Following the announcement of the Telstra live pass users transitioning to Kayo, do you have a sense for how many of -- how many of those circa 3 million users do you expect to transition? And do you have any projections you're willing to share around how many of those you'd expect to hold on to after that promotional period is over?\nSusan Panuccio: Entcho, maybe if I start with your first question just in relation to News Media. Obviously, there's been a lot of cost work that's been done. And you're right. Some of that is obviously volume related, and some of that will scale up and down depending on how those businesses trade in light of COVID. But there are also significant permanent cost reductions that the teams have been working on. We've had significant reduction in head count that came through in the back end of last fiscal year that is obviously flowing through here. But we do have a lot of costs that have come out in the overhead space as well. Now some of that naturally will come back in as the businesses open up, but we would also hope that some of that may be permanent as we change the way that we work going forward. We also had in the back end of last year significant reduction in marketing expenditure within News Media, we would expect to see some of that start to come back in, but not necessarily the levels that we're seeing. So I think a balance of both as we look forward. And I do think actually that there are still permanent cost reduction opportunities that the businesses are working on within that segment. A lot of that has to do with the restructuring of the business and the reconfiguration, and the teams are actively working on that.\nRobert Thomson: And as for the transition from Live Pass to Kayo, this is obviously an extraordinary opportunity for Foxtel. And our partners at Telstra will be doing everything as they can to encourage their users to make that migration around a total of 3.2 million Live Pass members. For those who are interested in Aussie Rules or rugby or any of the many sports on Kayo, this is an extraordinary opportunity to be able to watch a world-class streaming operation at work. And the -- those who've used Kayo and have experienced its ability to not only show 1 game, but many games simultaneously. That experience is definitely compelling. And so we believe that a very large number of Live Pass subscribers will make that migration, but it's so early in the process that at the moment, we don't want to put numbers out there. But with the imminent start of the winter sports season in Australia, I think you are going to see the metrics in coming months, and we'll be able to update you next quarter.\nSusan Panuccio: And I think, Entcho, the only other thing to add to that would be that as we think about this exciting opportunity that Foxtel now have, it will scale clearly more from year 1 given the introductory office. So whilst we would expect subscriber numbers to pick up, we'd expect the actual impact on revenue and EBITDA to be more back-ended from year 1 onwards.\nEntcho Raykovski: Got it. That's very useful. Maybe just a very quick follow-up. Do you know if there's much overlap at the moment between the existing Kayo subspace and the Live Pass users?\nRobert Thomson: It's relatively small, Entcho. Well below 20%.\nOperator: We'll now hear from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners.\nCraig Huber: Susan, I wanted to hear a little bit further about the costs within your subscription video services, just the remaining part of the year and maybe as we think out to the next fiscal year, anything out of the ordinary there you want to call out further you haven't already touched on?\nSusan Panuccio: I guess probably the easiest way to maybe frame the cost in the second half is I expect them to be broadly in line with the cost for the first half, which is net of any of the movements that we've obviously talked about with the deferral of sports rights. With the remainder, we are reminded that the full year cost will absorb approximately AUD 156 million of additional cost year-on-year due to the deferrals of those sports cost. So I think the underlying cost work that, as I said, the Foxtel team has done is starting to pay dividends, but clearly, we've got this double off of sports rights in the current year. But as a frame, I would say, broadly speaking, in line with the first half.\nCraig Huber: And my follow-on question, if I quickly ask, as you think out to the next fiscal year, is there any large sports programming contracts up for renewal that might have a significant jump if taken into account in our models, the next fiscal year?\nSusan Panuccio: No. We've got -- we've obviously just executed the renewals of the AFL and NRL. So we have those deferred up now 2024 and 2027, and we're not expecting in next financial year significant step-up from an overall basis on sports cost.\nOperator: It appears we have no further questions. That does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.\nMike Florin: Well, thank you very much, Ally, and thank you all for participating. We look forward to talking to you soon. Have a great day, and stay safe. Take care.\nOperator: And with that, that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Susan Panuccio",
            "content": "Thank you, Robert. Fiscal 2021 second quarter total revenues were over $2.4 billion, a decline of 3% versus the prior year, while total segment EBITDA was $497 million, up 40% year-over-year, reflecting strong performances across all of our key reportable segments, driven by a combination of improved operating trends and cost reductions. This is the highest quarterly segment EBITDA since the company was formed in 2013. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, most notably the sale of News America Marketing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 as well as currency fluctuations and other items disclosed in our release revenues rose 2%, while total segment EBITDA grew 39%. Net income for the quarter was $261 million compared to $103 million in the prior year. For the quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.39 as compared to $0.14 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS was $0.34 in the quarter compared with $0.18 in the prior year. Turning now to the operating segments. Digital Real Estate Services segment revenues were $339 million, an increase of 15% compared to the prior year, which is more than double the rate in the first quarter, driven by another record quarterly performance for Move. On an adjusted basis, revenues increased 11%. Segment EBITDA rose 20% to $142 million or 19% on an adjusted basis despite higher investment spending, which was in contrast to the first quarter. Results also included $6 million of costs associated with Move's acquisition of Avail and the Elara transaction at REA. Move's operating results accounted for over 75% of segment revenue growth and approximately 80% of segment EBITDA growth this quarter. Move's revenues accelerated to $155 million, a 28% year-over-year increase, with real estate revenues rising 30%. As Robert mentioned, realtor.com traffic reached 80 million average monthly unique users, reflecting an increase of 37% year-over-year with growth in December accelerating to 44%. Monthly average lead volume remained very strong, growing over 30%. Like the first quarter, we saw strong growth in the performance-based referral model, which accounted for approximately 30% of total Move revenues in the quarter, benefiting from the growth in lead volume, higher home prices and real estate transaction closes. Not only did we see an acceleration in the revenue growth of the referral model this quarter compared to the prior quarter but we also saw growth in Connection Plus, our traditional lead generation product, driven by strong customer demand, enabling improved pricing and higher sell through. As our referral revenues are recognized upon transaction closures, only around 20% of the associated revenues from leads generated in this quarter are reflected in the results. This provides a strong pipeline through the balance of the year, assuming continued favorable housing conditions. These results are very encouraging, and we remain focused on expanding our addressable market through the integration of key ancillary services, including our Rocket Mortgage partnership. We've contributed $19 million to the segment EBITDA growth this quarter versus the prior year, driven by the strong top line growth. As we had previously indicated, we are increasing our investment levels in REALTOR, given the rapid performance in lead volume and further expansion into adjacency. Revenues at REA Group rose 6% to $184 million, reflecting a $12 million or 7% benefit from currency fluctuations. COVID-19 restrictions eased during the quarter, including the removal of property inspection restrictions in Melbourne. Residential listings for the quarter rose 10%, including 25% growth in Metro Melbourne and 13% growth in Sydney. A new developer project launches increased 12% on the prior year. REA's results benefited from growth in residential revenues, which was offset by declines in commercial and Asia. It also is worth remembering that as a consequence of COVID, REA did not implement a price increase in July. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more detail. Turning to Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $511 million, up 2% versus the prior year and included a $33 million or 7% positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted revenues were down 5%, an improvement on the Q1 decline of 7%, benefiting from moderating broadcast subscription revenue declines and the expansion of OTT revenues. Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base reached over 3.3 million as of December 31, up 12% year-over-year, with OTT expanding to over 1.3 million paying subscribers, close to double the prior year's number with Kayo reaching 624,000 and Binge at 431,000 paying subscribers. Kayo subscribers declined slightly quarter-over-quarter due to seasonality, but the decline was much less pronounced than last year as the business successfully managed to transition from winter to spring and summer sporting codes, underpinned by the exclusive cricket content. Residential broadcast subscribers declined about 11% to approximately $1.8 million, relatively consistent with last quarter. Commercial subscribers declined 18% year-over-year to 218,000, with the trend improving sequentially, having bottomed out at 86,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 as a consequence of the pandemic. Broadcast churn was somewhat elevated at 17.5% versus 16% in the prior year, impacted by a strategy to reduce promotional offers, which resulted in the roll-off of lower ARPU subscribers. The financial benefit is reflected in a 3% increase in ARPU to almost AUD 80. Segment EBITDA improved 77% to $124 million, the continuing cost transformation at Foxtel, desire to rightsize the cost base was the driver of profitability. Total cost declined approximately 10%, including $35 million of lower sports programming rights and production costs, which was primarily driven by savings from renegotiated sports rights partially offset by the $20 million negative impact related to the deferral of these costs from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Expenses also benefited from lower entertainment programming costs and lower overheads. Some of the cost benefits are timing related, which will reverse later in the year, I will touch on these later. Moving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones delivered its highest revenue quarter since separation in 2013 and its higher segment EBITDA quarter since News Corp's acquisition in 2007. Revenues for the quarter were $446 million, up 4% compared to the prior year, with digital revenues accounting for 70% of total revenues this quarter, up 6 percentage points from the prior year. Circulation revenues rose 8% due to growth in digital circulation revenues, partially offset by lower single copy and amenity print volume still impacted by COVID-19. As Robert mentioned, Dow Jones again achieved record subscriptions in the quarter with average subscriptions to its consumer products for the quarter exceeding $4 million, up 18% from the prior year and off that digital-only subscriptions were over $3 million, up 29% year-over-year. For the Wall Street Journal, there were 3.2 million average subscriptions for the quarter, up nearly 19% from the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions growing 28% to nearly 2.5 million. Revenues from Dow Jones Risk and Compliance grew 21%, which was a faster growth rate than the past 3 quarters. Overall, professional information business revenues rose 4%. Advertising revenues, which accounted for 26% of revenues this quarter declined just 4% to $115 million, a marked improvement from the 17% decline last quarter. As Robert mentioned, we had another record quarter for digital advertising with 29% growth and digital accounting for 58% of advertising revenues for the second quarter. We saw growth in all categories, particularly in technology. Print advertising revenues declined 29% year-over-year, which was an improvement from the 39% decline in the first quarter. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 43% to $109 million, with margins expanding to over 24% and up almost 7 percentage points versus the prior year. Costs declined almost 5% this quarter due to lower print volumes and other discretionary savings. At Book Publishing, HarperCollins posted 23% revenue growth to $544 million and a 65% segment EBITDA growth to $104 million, marking the best quarterly performance in its history. Revenue growth was strong across all categories with double digit gains. Robert mentioned the depth of the sub list this quarter, which included strong performances from numerous authors, including Rachel Hollis, Rhonda Byrne, Ree Drummond and Joanna Gaines and David Walliams among others. Similar to what we saw in the past 2 quarters, we are continuing to benefit from a strong rebound in e-books with overall digital sales up 15% year-over-year. E-book sales increased 21% year-over-year with gains in all categories, while downloadable audio books increased 10% year-over-year. We have continued to see higher online sales and, in particularly, benefited from strong orders from Amazon and other e-commerce platforms during the holiday season. But perhaps more importantly, we are seeing very strong consumption levels, likely benefiting from stay-at-home measures and a continuous flow of new content. Revenues increased at low double digits across the backlist, notwithstanding, they contributed 55% of sales this quarter, down from 58% last year due to the larger mix of the front list titles. HarperCollins again demonstrated strong operating leverage despite a 16% increase in cost, in part due to royalties and higher production expenses related to the successful top line performance, margins improved by almost 5 percentage points. Turning to News Media. Despite ongoing challenges, we remain focused on rightsizing the cost base and moving towards digital, helped by a moderation in advertising revenue trends. Revenues for the quarter were $573 million, down 29% versus the prior year, of which the impact from the divestment of News America marketing accounted for the majority of the decline. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact from the divestment of NAM and Unruly and the other items mentioned in our release, revenues declined 9%, which is an improvement from a 16% decline in the first quarter. The decline also reflects $34 million or 4% negative impact from the closure or transition to digital of certain regional and community newspapers in Australia. Circulation and subscription revenues rose 5%. There's a $9 million or 4% benefit from currency fluctuations, strong digital paid subscriber growth and cover price increases offset lower news stand sales related to COVID-19. Overall, the year-over-year trends in local currency were better in both the U.K. and Australia compared to the first quarter. Circulation revenues accounted for 45% of total segment revenues. And was slightly higher than advertising this quarter as the mix of revenues become more reoccurring and predictable. Advertising revenue fell $231 million or 48% on a reported basis, of which $191 million or 40% was from the sale of News America Marketing, and $28 million or 6% was related to the negative impact from the closure or transition to digital of certain regional community titles in Australia. The remainder of the decline was due to the overall weakness in the print advertising market. On a positive note, the New York Post continued to outperform with advertising revenues up 23%, and as Robert mentioned, digital advertising up 64%. In fact, digital revenues at the New York Post exceeded 50% of total revenues this quarter. And overall, the New York Post had its highest digital revenue since 2013. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $66 million, flat with the prior year despite the $22 million a onetime benefit in the prior year related to a settlement of certain warranty related claims in the U.K. and the absence of the modest contribution from News America marketing. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased 5%, which included a $5 million positive contribution from the New York Post. I would now like to talk about some things in the upcoming quarter and the second half. Overall, we expect to see some slowdown in the second half results with forecasting remaining particularly challenging given the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. At Digital Real Estate Services, as REA noted, National Residential Listings in Australia for January were flat to the prior year. Results will reflect a small loss related to the consolidation of Elara Technologies in the second half. Please refer to REA's press release and earnings call for more detail. At Move, we remain encouraged by the traffic and lead volume trends, which are expected to drive higher revenues in the second half despite the historically low listing volumes across the industry. We expect these higher revenues to fund at least $40 million of additional reinvestments in the second half compared to the prior year in areas such as brand marketing and product development as we focus on gaining market share and expanding into adjacencies. In Subscription Video Services, we have seen broadcast churn continue to increase due to the ongoing focus on ARPU and seasonal trends with the end of winter sports. However, Kayo has remained resilient, and our OTT subscriber growth led by Binge remains strong. We expect EBITDA results in the second half to be more challenged due in part to the lapping of the prior year cost savings. As a reminder, fiscal 2020 fourth quarter results included a $70 million cost benefit due to the deferral of sports rights and production costs related to COVID-19. We now expect full year overall cost declines, given the better-than-expected revenue performance to be more modest than we had initially expected, with a net reduction of less than AUD 100 million. This includes approximately AUD 80 million of higher sports comp in the second half of fiscal 2021, particularly in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period. At Dow Jones, overall revenue trends remained favorable compared to the prior year, including strong digital advertising growth. As we look to the rest of the year, we continue to expect to reinvest in the business as we focus on driving revenue growth to its digital assets and expect second half expenses to increase modestly compared to the prior year. In addition, third quarter will face a more difficult digital advertising growth comparison. In Book Publishing, overall industry trends remain favorable, we continue to monitor closely the sustainability of recent consumer spending patterns, such as the increasing free time for consumers to read and the increase in the average number of books purchased. The second half comparables will be tougher, particularly in the fourth quarter, given the material outperformance last year and as we lap some of the initial benefits at the outset of COVID-19. At News Media, the ongoing national lockdown in the U.K. and domestic travel restrictions in Australia continue to put pressure on print circulation, especially with daily newsstand and are also creating increased uncertainty on advertising spend across most categories. Cost declines in the second half are expected to moderate from the first half rate as we lap some COVID-19 saving initiatives as well as the divestment of News America Marketing and the closure or digital transition of some of our newspapers in Australia in the fourth quarter. In our other segment, for the second half, we expect at least a $50 million increase in cost, driven by a combination of higher equity comp related to the stock price performance and the absence of the bonus reductions across the senior executive team in the prior year in response to COVID-19 as well as additional costs related to the implementation of the global shared services initiative. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A. And I think just to add to Robert's comment, we also, under Josh, who leads the sales team at Dow Jones have been very focused over the past 18 months on improving our ad tech capabilities, upskilling the sales force and improving yield management, which we now believe we're starting to see the benefit of in addition to obviously, the audience growth. And just in relation to the second question for Foxtel. When we think about the trends that we're looking at and the next steps for the assets, well, clearly, OTT will be an ongoing focus for us in that business. As well as the stability in broadcast as the team focus on the management of the base subscribers within broadcast. And they are clearly focused on costs as well. They've done a tremendous job in the first half or really over the last10 months since COVID-19 started in taking out the underlying cost of the business, the renegotiation of sports and entertainment contracts, but we'll be particularly looking forward to the growth within the OTT properties. Thanks. Kane, I might take those questions, and Robert can add and supplement as he will. So just in relation to the sustainability of Move growth, I mean, we remain very confident in the growth of the business and are encouraged by the traffic and the lead volumes, as we talked about in our prepared remarks, notwithstanding the industry listing volumes remain at historically low levels. We do expect with the revenue growth, the cost will increase. And I think the interesting thing to note, when we think about the results for this quarter versus the first quarter, actually, the cost increased this quarter. And so it was really top line revenue growth that was dropping down to the bottom line. So we do think that the revenue growth will continue, and we do want to scale up those costs in the reinvestment areas that I mentioned, marketing and product development. Just in relation to shared services, yes, we did quote $100 million for financial year '22. We're still holding that number at this stage, notwithstanding the cost work that we've done across the business. We do still think that there are enormous opportunities, but it will require, obviously, a lot of work and reconfiguration of our systems in order to unlock those savings. But at this stage, the guidance is still $100 million for financial year '22. Entcho, maybe if I start with your first question just in relation to News Media. Obviously, there's been a lot of cost work that's been done. And you're right. Some of that is obviously volume related, and some of that will scale up and down depending on how those businesses trade in light of COVID. But there are also significant permanent cost reductions that the teams have been working on. We've had significant reduction in head count that came through in the back end of last fiscal year that is obviously flowing through here. But we do have a lot of costs that have come out in the overhead space as well. Now some of that naturally will come back in as the businesses open up, but we would also hope that some of that may be permanent as we change the way that we work going forward. We also had in the back end of last year significant reduction in marketing expenditure within News Media, we would expect to see some of that start to come back in, but not necessarily the levels that we're seeing. So I think a balance of both as we look forward. And I do think actually that there are still permanent cost reduction opportunities that the businesses are working on within that segment. A lot of that has to do with the restructuring of the business and the reconfiguration, and the teams are actively working on that. And I think, Entcho, the only other thing to add to that would be that as we think about this exciting opportunity that Foxtel now have, it will scale clearly more from year 1 given the introductory office. So whilst we would expect subscriber numbers to pick up, we'd expect the actual impact on revenue and EBITDA to be more back-ended from year 1 onwards. I guess probably the easiest way to maybe frame the cost in the second half is I expect them to be broadly in line with the cost for the first half, which is net of any of the movements that we've obviously talked about with the deferral of sports rights. With the remainder, we are reminded that the full year cost will absorb approximately AUD 156 million of additional cost year-on-year due to the deferrals of those sports cost. So I think the underlying cost work that, as I said, the Foxtel team has done is starting to pay dividends, but clearly, we've got this double off of sports rights in the current year. But as a frame, I would say, broadly speaking, in line with the first half. No. We've got -- we've obviously just executed the renewals of the AFL and NRL. So we have those deferred up now 2024 and 2027, and we're not expecting in next financial year significant step-up from an overall basis on sports cost."

            "name": "Robert Thomson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Across this country and around the world in so many places for so many people, these past few months have been characterized by considerable upheaval, with social, political, financial and health-related tribulations and turmoil deeply profoundly affecting many families, economies and communities. I trust that all on this call and your families have been weathering the storm safely and safely. In the midst of this tumult, which has been a severe stress test for individuals and businesses and countries, I am gratified to report that News Corp has navigated the turbulence, and to be candid, significantly very significantly, increased profitability. We noted 3 months ago that the first quarter was particularly robust. And so I am pleased to report that our second quarter results were even more robust. And this burgeoning is a tribute to the efforts and the commitment and the professionalism of all our employees and to the enduring value of the company's culture created by Rupert Murdoch. In fact, the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 was the most profitable quarter since the new News Corp was launched more than 7 years ago, and there were other significant records established. We have the largest profits for Dow Jones since the acquisition of the company in December 2007. While we reported a 77% rise in EBITDA at subscription video services, where at Foxtel, streaming customers hit an historic high, and we also benefited from lower costs. As Digital Real Estate Services, Move accounted for approximately 80% of that segment's EBITDA growth. And history was made when the New York Post reported a profit for the quarter and for the year-to-date. That is the first profit in modern times at the very least, for what was a chronic loss-making masthead founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton. In short, Digital Real Estate Services, Book Publishing and Dow Jones all performed powerfully in Q2, collectively generating segment EBITDA growth of close to 40%. Their continuing expansion highlights profound potential of the company to increase profits and generate value for our shareholders far into the future. These resilient results are founded on our long-term strategic shift in the company's assets, determine digitization and a relentless discipline on costs. We were adamant that we would not be victims of digital dystopia, but that we would contribute to fashioning a more fruitful future for content creators, and we are seeing the results of that result. It is fair to say that regulators globally have joined the digital dots. In the second quarter, every segment in News Corp showed marked operating improvements and contributed meaningfully to our profitability. We continue to see increased cooperation across the company with valuable digital lessons and insights at each business rigorously applied for the benefit of all and to the benefit of shareholders. While overall revenues at over $2.4 billion declined 3 point -- 3% year-on-year, that was fundamentally due to the sale of News America Marketing in 2020. On an adjusted basis, a more genuine like-for-like comparison, revenues rose 2% despite the pernicious consequences of COVID-19. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $497 million, the highest of any quarter since our reincarnation in 2013. Year-over-year, that represents profitability growth of 40%, while our free cash flow available to News Corp for the half rose by $373 million. A pandemic is indeed a stress test, and News Corp is surely passing that test. At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, Move's revenue growth was 28%, and that came despite restrictions in certain states on inspections and thus sales. Having been an ardent supporter of the acquisition of Move, it is worth noting that we believe the net cost of this company, including the substantial settlement we ultimately received from Zillow in our trade secret lawsuit against them is a mere fraction of its current value. Net-net, we paid considerably less than $1 billion for Move in 2014. We believe it is worth vastly more today. And how much will it be worth in 5 years as the digitization of sales in the world's largest property market continues at pace. At the time of our acquisition, realtor.com was a struggling third place platform with modest profitability and fewer than 30 million monthly users. There was some [indiscernible] about the acquisition. But we were absolutely clear that our media platforms and growing digital expertise, plus our experience with REA in Australia would enable us to transform the company. In the first half of this fiscal year, REALTOR has contributed more to our profit growth than the brilliant beacon that is REA in Australia. So how much is REALTOR worth now? How much is New Corp worth? I will let you do the math. To help you do that math, a few specifics. REALTOR traffic has now outgrowing Zillow for 19 of the past 21 months, according to comScore, including the last 11 months in a row. According to our internal metrics, average unique monthly users in the second quarter were 37% higher than the prior year, and we reached each month, on average, 80 million people. Just to give you a sense of site scale and loyalty, we had 8.7 total billion paid views in the second quarter, more than 1 page for every person on our plant, and that number does not include photo galleries of houses. Multiply the number of visitors by the images in those galleries, and you get a sense of the scale of the intense interaction by users. Traffic has continued to grow since the quarter's end, with unique users reaching a record 94 million for the month of January. During Q2, Moves expanded in the rental market through its acquisition of Avail, an online property management platform that focuses on doing yourself landlords and tenants. This is significant given the fact that DIY landlords own and manage about 3/4 of rentals in the U.S. and a rental market according to U.S. Census Bureau data is a $500 billion per year business. So the addressable market is appreciable and appreciated. Also in Q2, realtor.com launched an advertising partnership with Rocket Mortgage, while continuing to build an even more seamless process for consumers wishing to qualify for mortgages to purchase a home. In January, REALTOR announced a partnership with Qualia to provide simplified digital home closings, allowing for greater online collaboration between agents and their clients. Let us be very clear. Buying a home is by far the largest investment that most families will make. And the purchase around that acquisition, whether it be securing a mortgage or starting with electricity or a broadband provider are necessary and valuable adjacencies. The home purchase is at the very center of that cluster of commerce and REALTOR's are at the very center of that purchase. From a macro perspective, the overall housing market in the U.S. not only has proven to be resilient during the time of crisis, it has demonstrated tangible strength with many positive signs of activity even with listing volumes at a historic low. With mortgage rates at a minimum and families expanding their search for better larger homes and new locations, there is reason to be optimistic about the trajectory of the sector. Resilience and optimism also characterized the housing market in Australia, with the emergence from lockdowns in the quarter has led to significant signs of recovery. Australia is still a growing economy, and it will continue to benefit from its location in the world's fastest-growing region. The deep ties with Asia, including India, give it a distinct advantage, along with its reliable legal procedures and stable coherent cogent political system. We believe it is still a country that is far from maximizing its potential and the growth opportunities are pronounced. In the second quarter, REA acquired a controlling interest in Elara Technologies, making it the majority owner of a large and growing Indian digital real estate portal, including housing.com and PropTiger.com. As measured by audience, Elara runs India's fastest-growing digital real estate business, and India itself is one of the world's fastest growing economies. So the possibilities are profound. We are, under Tracey Fellows leadership, by many measures, the world's largest digital property company, and we are acutely focused on the countries that we believe have the largest digital property potential. Meanwhile, HarperCollins had one of its most lucrative quarters with double-digit growth across every category. There were many successful new releases. While the back was bolstered both revenue and profitability as did our continued growth in digital. Brian Murray and the team are at a relatively early stage of the development of audio books and the proliferation of audio devices to the home will only increase the demand for our content. I'm not sure that all investors have yet comprehended the full value of that digital opportunity. As for the resident titles and successful catalog, there was: Didn't You See That Coming by Rachel Hollis; The Happy in a Hurry Cookbook, Steve Doocy; The Greatest Secret by Rhonda Byrne; Frontier follies, Ree Drummond; and the continuing strong demand for Magnolia Table, Volume 2 by Joanna Gaines. And then in January, there was Bridgerton. We have the series of 9 Bridgeton books by Julia Quinn, which are prospering, given the popularity of the autonomous series for which a new series has recently been announced. In all, revenues at HarperCollins ascended 23% in the quarter, and segment EBITDA surged 65% over the prior year. Dow Jones also set records this quarter, including having its highest absolute EBITDA since News Corp acquired the company in late 2007, with segment EBITDA up 43%, while the New York Times eked out a 1% increase. Digital advertising expanded 29%, the highest quarter in Dow Jones history, while digital advertising at the New York Times fell by 2%. Clearly, print was challenged during a pandemic period in which distribution was compromised. But overall advertising was down just 4%. Comparing dramatically with The New York Times, where it slumped 19%. In our professional information business, Risk and Compliance continued its record of extraordinary expansion with year-over-year revenue growth accelerating to 21%. Q2 marks Risk and Compliance 22nd consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth year-over-year. Given international tension with both the U.S. and China in posing controls on companies, and with the new administration in the U.S. inclined to tougher regulation, how bright are the prospects for Risk and Compliance. If anyone on this call works for a company that is not yet a client, I suggest that you remedy that dereliction. Traffic and subscribers across Dow Jones properties are surging. And Almar and the team are determined to make the most of the opportunity. WSJ digital-only subscriptions were up 28% and MarketWatch also had a successful digital subscription launch in Q2. We have always insisted that our strategy is to upsell at Dow Jones given our nonpareil portfolio. And so it's worth noting that more than 70% of those MarketWatch subscribers chose a bundle that included subscription to Barrons. As for traffic, average monthly unique users across the Dow Jones digital network were up 48% in the quarter, reaching 127 million, driven by 64% growth at both the Wall Street Journal and Barron's. In Subscription Video Services, our strategy to reshape the Foxtel Group as the next-generation subscription business is clearly gaining traction with total closing paid subscriptions increasing 12% and setting a new record of over 3.31 million. OTT now accounts for 40% of Foxtel's paying subscriber base, with more than 1.3 million streaming subscribers. The actual growth rate in streaming subscribers was over 90% driven by the strength of Binge, which launched last May and the continued expansion of Kayo. In the past, there has been skepticism about whether we could transition from our reliance on traditional broadcast, but hat those concerns have proven unfounded, and Foxtel is now a company with a diverse portfolio and much momentum. I would like to repeat that EBITDA at the Subscription Video Services segment for the quarter rose 77% on the same quarter last year. And for the first half, segment EBITDA was 34% higher. Growth has been crucial for that success. But we have a leadership team at Foxtel steered ably by Siobhan McKenna and Patrick Delany that has been absolutely focused on reviewing every aspect of the company's performance and diligently reducing costs where appropriate. That insight, foresight and discipline have contributed to the transformation of the company and given us a powerful platform and much optionality for the future. We have now secured long-term rights to the 3 most popular sports in the country, Aussie Rules, Rugby League and cricket, which had astounded success in the summer with the tour of the triumphant Indian team. Record after record was set on the cricket pitch and on the screen, whether they were traditional screen or a digital device. And that multi-platform future is now secure with both Australian Rules and Rugby, thanks to our partners at Telstra. Over 3 million live pass customers will have the opportunity to transition to Kayo over the coming months so that they can watch their teams, when they want to watch, how they want to watch, where they want to watch and on whatever device they want to launch. This is a monumental moment for Foxtel. Our News Media segment also contributed meaningfully to News Corp's profitability this quarter, with digital ad growth in the U.K. and at The New York Post. We had indeed indicated that the New York Post was on a path towards profitability, and it certainly achieved that doll in the second quarter. Our task now is to ensure its long-term profitability, given the challenges in that sector. Digital ad growth at the post was 64% up year-over-year. For the quarter, digital advertising accounted for nearly 90% of the total, page views of the posts were up 37%. It was also a quarter in which The Post reported a significant victory for all media for the freedom of the press by standing resolute and principled against censorship imposed by Twitter. Ultimately, Twitter realized that it's made an egregious mistake and thankfully, reversed it's decision. Our journalist are not lap dogs with laptops. Our journalists are not stenographers, our journalists are not wonks. Our journalists are awake to their profound responsibilities. In Australia, we were fortunately ahead of the curve in transitioning many of our local and regional print properties to digital platforms, which help them weather the storm of lockdown. Our Australian leadership under Michael Miller was disciplined in reducing costs and yet remained ambitious for our news platforms during this time of transition for journals. And Rebekah Brooks showed real leadership in the U.K. across our baskets like The Sun and The Times in our emerging digital businesses and it will as our radio network, which reached nearly 5 million listeners. In both Australia and the U.K., we are using our skills in video and audio to enhance our traditional platforms, and that is clear at Times Radio, which is an extension of a newspaper founded in London in 1785. On these calls, I've often referenced the ongoing debate with what is loosely called Big Digital. I personally regard that moniker as a euphemism. We're at a pivotal moment of those discussions in Australia, where new regulations and new terms of trade will be introduced. But that debate now extends across the globe. There is not a single serious digital regulator anywhere in the world who is not examining the opacity of algorithms, the integrity of personal data, the social value of professional journalism and the dysfunctional digital ad market. This has been an imperative for News Corp for far more than a decade. I gave evidence the House of Lords in London on this various subject in 2007. And it has been an imperative because we truly care about the social value of journalism, and we believe that the social value has a commercial value. This enduring often solitary campaign would not have been successful without the further support of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and the News Corp Board. We expect that the new tech topography will benefit our company's financial fortunes. That is for certain. And it will also have a material impact in not only the countries in which we operate, but in every country. An ambitious inspired young woman starting a digital news site in Nigeria or in Birmingham, England or Birmingham, Alabama, now has a far better, a far, far better chance of sustainable success. Finally, I want to thank all those contributed to the singular success of News Corp in this historic quarter. That would be all our employees who've contributed each day in courageous compassionate ways. I salute those individuals for what they have done and for what they continue to do for the company and for their communities. Thank you. While the macro environment remains unpredictable, our goal is to ensure that new score is best positioned for long-term success and that our value is absolutely appreciated by investors. And now I hand you to Susan Panuccio for some wise words. Well, first of all, Dow Jones. We have a great team at Dow Jones led by Almar Latour and Josh Stinchcomb, our Chief Revenue Officer, he's done a sterling job in developing our digital ad expertise. And that's across wsj.com, MarketWatch, Barron's and beyond. And the increase has been across categories, but also in new categories in custom advertising. And it's clear that if you want not just a safe space, but a space that is brand-enhancing and an audience that's still most influential in the world in [indiscernible] well heeled, then Dow Jones has comparative advantages. Just one broader point to bear in mind with the imminent death of the cookie, our vast audience in the U.S., for example, will be particularly valuable and Dow Jones is a significant component in that. When you add together the uniques across our U.S. businesses, and this is not dejobbing, as you can tell from the number, but we have a close to 350 million monthly nicks. So that's in the advertising audience that's important for Dow Jones but for all our properties. And to complement Susan's comments, so let's consider how the Foxtel narrative has changed to the questions we have been asked a couple of quarters ago whether we would need to put extra capital into Foxtel and then we're asked whether some spec wanted to buy more speculation and speculation. And the truth is that the successful development of the business has given us real options. And our immediate task and the team's task is to keep driving the business to keep striving, we've obviously made a fairly successful migration to streaming up 90% year-on-year. And we obviously have hits with Kayo and Binge, and we obviously have more work ahead. But the path to the future is certainly paid with possibility. And just to supplement, Susan, particularly on Move, clearly, we have to be somewhat cautious in the second half of the year simply because of the complications of COVID. There's a lack of visibility for many of our businesses. And you can see that reflected in our words today. We are certainly taking nothing for granted despite the excellence of the Q2 results. But at Move, the signs are positive, at least in January, and David and the team at REALTOR. With January normally a slower month, unique users rose 37% to $94 million, and the lead volume remained robust. Those are indicators, but we are taking nothing for granted. And as for the transition from Live Pass to Kayo, this is obviously an extraordinary opportunity for Foxtel. And our partners at Telstra will be doing everything as they can to encourage their users to make that migration around a total of 3.2 million Live Pass members. For those who are interested in Aussie Rules or rugby or any of the many sports on Kayo, this is an extraordinary opportunity to be able to watch a world-class streaming operation at work. And the -- those who've used Kayo and have experienced its ability to not only show 1 game, but many games simultaneously. That experience is definitely compelling. And so we believe that a very large number of Live Pass subscribers will make that migration, but it's so early in the process that at the moment, we don't want to put numbers out there. But with the imminent start of the winter sports season in Australia, I think you are going to see the metrics in coming months, and we'll be able to update you next quarter. It's relatively small, Entcho. Well below 20%."

        "content": "Operator: Good day. And welcome to the News Corp 1Q Fiscal 2021 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. Media will be on a listen-only basis. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to, Mike Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.\nMike Florin: Thank you very much, Corey. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about an hour ago, and it's now posted on our website at, newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive, and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We'll open with some prepared remarks. And then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements, regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as, total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release. With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson, for some opening comments.\nRobert Thomson: Thank you, Mike. Wherever you happen to be, and whatever time it happens to be virtually and actually, I trust that all are faring well, during these most challenging of times, personally and professionally. We are certainly in the midst of a political uncertainty in the U.S. and continuity is a blessing in these polarized and polarizing moments. Please continue to stay both, safe and sage. I would in particular like to express my gratitude to all our employees, who've traversed this difficult terrain with courage and commitment. And we've played an important empathetic role in their communities, during these stressful months. Despite the harsh conditions and the inevitable COVID-caused disruptions, I am pleased to report that News Corp had a particularly robust first quarter, with resounding year-on-year growth in our profitability and revenue expansion in several key segments. Three vital -- three vital pillars of our company, Dow Jones, Book Publishing and Digital Real Estate Services had notable EBITDA growth and higher revenue in Q1. Consolidated revenues were over $2.1 billion. And while that was down 10% year-over-year adjusted revenues which exclude News America Marketing, Unruly and other items noted in the press release were only 3% lower. Consequentially in Q1, News Corp's total segment EBITDA was $268 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year evidence of the strength of our core businesses and the growth potential of those sectors in which we have made significant acquisitions in particular, Digital Real Estate and Book Publishing. We are also benefiting from our strategy to simplify the company, allowing us to focus on the segments that have the greatest growth potential, as well as ensuring that we are resolutely reducing shared costs around the company. We are determined to provide greater transparency for investors and the presentation of Dow Jones, as a separate segment was integral to that continuing process. Turning now to the details, Digital Real Estate Services flourished this quarter. Despite, limits on home inspections and other COVID-related disruption, revenues increased 7% year-over-year, while segment EBITDA surged 45% year-over-year led by particularly strong results at Move, operator of realtor.com, which had record revenues in the quarter of $138 million. Both REA and realtor.com reported record traffic during the quarter, with the latter having reached a high 92 million monthly unique visitors in August, while traffic was up 26% for the quarter. Based on comScore data, REALTOR has outpaced Zillow in audience growth for 16 of the past 18 months. This success comes as realtor.com continues to focus on transforming its business towards a data-rich referral model. We are convinced there's a substantial opportunity for REALTOR to expand its market from a still deep pool of real estate marketing dollars to provide value-added services at premium prices in mortgages titles and other adjacent categories.  I would note realtor.com's new partnership with Rocket Mortgage, as one example of the company's growth potential and our efforts to expand the addressable market. realtor.com also recently launched the Seller's Marketplace to provide listings for our buyers without the antediluvian approach of our main competitor, which has been doubling down on its house flipping business. We are a genuinely nimble, agile digital company. And will leave bricks-and-mortar to the specialists. realtor.com is also constantly focused on improving transparency. And choice for those buying and selling homes, including higher-quality estimates and salient information about everything from flood risk to neighbourhood noise levels. We have been introducing features, while still being cost-conscious. And that flense of creativity and discipline is behind, the burgeoning of the business. At REA, while listing volumes have patently been affected by government-imposed COVID restrictions, the business still posted a higher profit contribution. What we are seeing at both companies is that the pandemic has been a catalyst for many families to reconsider their current housing and environment prompting an increasing number to seek less dense areas and larger properties. As the restrictions on movement, ease we believe that trend is likely to gather momentum, particularly at a time of record low interest rates. As we noted earlier, Dow Jones is now reported as a separate segment, which is innate part of our efforts to increase transparency and highlight an inherent value. As you can see from the company's resounding results, there is much to savour, about the business and its prospects. As we noted in our Investor Day presentation, Dow Jones aims to double its subscribers, given an incremental pool of 12 million prospective Dow Jones premium customers in the U.S. alone. And as the world's leading provider of business news and analysis, Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal have maintained premium pricing. And we are increasing our efforts to up-sell our customers' high-value specialist products. Revenue benefited from accelerating digital circulation and digital advertising growth and continued expansion of risk and compliance. These compensated for not unexpected decline in print advertising. Though, the total ad decline was not as marked as that of other publishers. As a result, Dow Jones segment EBITDA grew 47% year-over-year. A few metrics to note behind that admiral result at a turbulent time. Risk and compliance revenues rose, 16% year-over-year representing the 21st consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. The Wall Street Journal reported 27% growth in digital-only subscriptions. And total Dow Jones subscriptions increased 18% in the quarter, reaching approximately 3.9 million. MarketWatch also had a buoyant quarter with the highest first quarter revenue results in its history, as traffic surged to 52 million average monthly uniques. In recent days we have moved to further monetize that fast-expanding audience, by introducing subscriptions and enhancing the news flow for loyal readers. The early results are rather positive for both, MarketWatch and Barron's. To gain the sense of the size of the Dow Jones universe, which like the actual universe is still expanding traffic across the digital network rose 54% year-over-year in Q1, averaging 127 million unique users per month according to Adobe Analytics. And we firmly believe we are still at a relatively early stage of our potential audience and revenue growth. Meanwhile, in Book Publishing, HarperCollins also reported a strong quarter with revenues increasing 13% and segment EBITDA, up 45%. Again, those results reflected a mix of the creativity of the commissioning along with disciplined, diligent cost control. Reopened bookstores restocked their shelves with compelling HarperCollins tones and overall digital sales in Q1 were up 20% compared to the prior year continuing a trend that was evident in Q4 of fiscal 2020. Direct-to-consumer revenues rose almost 38% year-over-year. And the I Can Read! Book Club for children nearly quadrupled its membership since February to more than 95,000 monthly active users as of quarter end. Best-selling authors included Daniel Silva, Jenna Bush Hager, Lucy Foley, Ben Shapiro and LeBron James. And looking ahead, we have high hopes for Frontier Follies by Ree Drummond, The Greatest Secret by Rhonda Byrne, Concrete Rose by Angie Thomas and Code Name Bananas by David Walliams which is being released today. At Foxtel, there was marked improvement in the growth of the OTT business, which saw total closing paid subscriptions reached a new record high with nearly 3.3 million subscribers. This includes over 1.2 million paying customers of Kayo, Foxtel Now and the recently launched Binge. In total, there was a 67% year-over-year growth in the OTT base. To be specific, as of September 30, Kayo had 644,000 paid subscribers and 691,000 total subscribers. Foxtel Now had 298,000 paid subscribers and 310,000 total subscribers. And the burgeoning Binge had 290,000 paid subscribers and 321,000 total subscribers. One other note about Binge, the active subscriber is watching for 7.5 hours a week. So we are clearly pleased with how they're binging on Binge. In the News Media segment, the rate of year-over-year revenue decline moderated compared to Q4. Obviously, the direct year-on-year comparisons are complicated by the sale of both NAM and Unruly. Cost consciousness continue to be raised with one recent announcement of note. In September, we did our plans to shift the printing of The Wall Street Journal the New York Post and Barron's to the New York Times plant in Queens and we are actively exploring options for the Bronx Print Plant site, for which there has been considerable interest. This decision involved much agonizing as the Bronx plant and its talented committed staff have played an important role in the history of the company and the U.S. newspaper industry. Their sterling efforts will resonate for many decades to come as the mastheads continue their migration to digital in a rapidly changing media environment. A measure of that evolution is that the New York Post digital network traffic grew 35% in September, year-over-year to 144 million unique users. Digital advertising in the quarter climbed over 20% and nearly 90% of advertising revenues at the Post are now digital. The transformation of News Corp Australia continue to pace with the transition of most of our community in regional mastheads to digital-only. All told, our Australian titles saw strong digital subscription growth, up 26% year-over-year to 685,000. In the U.K. The Times and Sunday Times digital subscribers expanded 8% to 337,000 and also saw strong ARPU growth. Also in the U.K. Times Radio launched last quarter has already exceeded over 100,000 listeners each week, clearly benefiting from our leveraging of the strong Times brand and talent. Of course, it is also a powerful marketing platform for all of our U.K. titles and businesses. Finally, it should be clear to all that the digital landscape is changing dramatically and we are at the forefront of that change. It could even be argued that much of that change would not have happened without News Corp's advocacy over the past decade. The drive towards achieving a premium for premium content has gathered momentum and we are pleased that negotiations with the large platforms are ongoing. This is certainly not the end of the issue but without being too Churchillian it is the end of the beginning. Now more than ever, we believe it is evident that News Corp has value above and beyond the sum of our parts. So that mathematical fact is yet to be fully realized for our investors. That value should be more visible now that we have broken out the Dow Jones results, which also increases the scrutiny of our other news businesses which are themselves in the midst of a successful transition. We plan to continue simplifying the business and are open to making structural changes to maximize value and will continue to address the cost base. Unlike most media companies we have the option of optionality having carefully mastered our cash reserves which have improved since the pandemic began. I believe our continuing concerted initiatives are making us a more focused and more digital company, which will generate enhanced returns for our investors, in the months, the quarters and the years to come. And now for further financial enlightenment, we turn to Susan Panuccio.\nSusan Panuccio: Thank you, Robert. As Robert mentioned, we are pleased with the start to the new fiscal year, particularly in an environment which has clearly been marked by unpredictability and uncertainty. Our businesses have responded well to the challenges as evidenced by these results. Fiscal 2021, first quarter total revenues were over $2.1 billion, down 10% versus the prior year while total segment EBITDA was $268 million, up 21% year-over-year led by very strong growth at the Digital Real Estate Services, Dow Jones and Book Publishing segments. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, most notably the sale of News America Marketing in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year, as well as currency fluctuations and other items disclosed in our release revenues were down by only 3% while total segment EBITDA increased by 23%. Net income for the quarter was $47 million compared to a net loss of $211 million in the prior year reflecting the absence of impairment charges and higher total segment EBITDA, partially offset by higher tax expense. The prior year figure reflected $273 million of non-cash impairment charges, primarily at News America Marketing. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.06 as compared to a loss of $0.39 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS were $0.08 in the quarter versus $0.04 in the prior year. Turning now to the operating segments. At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 7% to $290 million, a big improvement from the fourth quarter, primarily due to the strength of Move. On an adjusted basis revenues increased 4%. Segment EBITDA rose 45% to $119 million or 40% on an adjusted basis, primarily driven by a meaningful increase in profit contribution from Move, due to a combination of higher revenues and cost reduction measures. The results at Move accounted for over 80% of segment revenue growth and over 70% of segment EBITDA growth this quarter. REA group revenues rose 2%, reflecting a $6 million or 4% benefit from currency fluctuations. National residential listing volumes declined 2% for the quarter impacted by stage four government restrictions in Melbourne, which included a ban on physical inspections. To put that in perspective, Metro Melbourne listings in the quarter declined 44% versus the prior year while the listings in Metro Sydney grew 23%. REA's results benefited from positive FX movements as well as modest residential revenue and financial services growth driven by higher refinancing activity, but the growth was mostly offset by declines in commercial developer and Asia. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details. At Move, we are extremely pleased with our progress during the first quarter. Move revenues rose 12% to $138 million, representing an all-time high with real estate revenues rising 13%. As Robert mentioned, traffic reached record levels with an average of 90 million unique users for the first quarter, an increase of 26% year-over-year. Monthly average lead volume for the quarter grew at an even faster rate at over 40%. We saw material growth in the performance-based referral model which accounted for approximately 30% of total Move revenues in the quarter, benefiting from the growth in lead volume, higher home prices and real estate transaction closes. As I've mentioned in the past, there is a delay in recognizing the revenue from the referral model due to the timing of transaction closes, which in addition to natural real estate seasonal patterns can lead to some volatility quarter-to-quarter as we shift more leads to that model. These results are very encouraging as we further progress towards increasing our addressable market through the integration of key ancillary services like our Rocket Mortgage partnership. While we continue to transition to the referral model the combination of strong lead volume and price increases for our more traditional lead generation business, resulted in a more stable revenue performance this quarter than the prior quarters. Move increased its profit contribution by $28 million versus the prior year driven by the scaling of the referral model, cost efficiencies resulting from the restructuring of the organization last quarter, including completing the integration of REALTOR and Opcity and the deferral of marketing spend. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $496 million, down 4% versus the prior year and included a $20 million or 3% positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The revenue decline moderated from the prior quarter a strong growth at Kayo driven by the return of live sports as well as the expansion of Binge partially offset the declines in residential and commercial subscriptions. Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base reached a record high at nearly 3.3 million as of September 30, up 7% year-over-year led by meaningful growth of paying OTT subscriptions, which reached over 1.2 million at quarter end. Broadcast subscribers declined about 10% to 1.85 million. Commercial subscribers declined 23% to 205,000 but marked a big improvement from the fourth quarter due to the reopening of licensed venues in most parts of the country. Foxtel is continuing to work with impacted customers in the pubs clubs and accommodation sectors particularly in Victoria and New South Wales. Broadcast churn was relatively stable at 14.6% versus 14.4% in the prior year, partly impacted by the roll-off of some of the churn mitigation initiatives, but were still below the financial year 2019 and financial year 2020 averages. Broadcast ARPU increased 1% from the prior year to AUD 79, which was also modestly higher than the fourth quarter. Segment EBITDA declined 4% to $78 million and declined 9% on an adjusted basis. Total cost declined approximately 3% or $15 million with a $16 million or 4% adverse impact due to currency fluctuations. Underlying savings were $31 million or AUD 50 million. These savings came despite an increasing sports rights and production costs, partly due to the $36 million or AUD 51 million impact from the timing of some sporting events deferred from the fourth quarter. Foxtel also benefited in the quarter from lower entertainment programming costs as well as declines in transmission and overhead expenses as we see the flow-through from the cost actions taken last year. Moving on to Dow Jones, revenues for the quarter were $386 million, up 1% compared to the prior year with digital revenues accounting for a record 73% of total revenues this quarter, up 8 percentage points from the prior year. Circulation revenues rose 7% due to robust growth in digital circulation revenues, partially offset by lower-single copy and amenity print volume, and marked the meaningful improvement from the fourth quarter rate of 2%. As Robert mentioned, Dow Jones again achieved record subscriptions in the quarter with the year-over-year growth rate slightly higher than the fourth quarter. Dow Jones average subscriptions to its consumer product for the quarter were nearly 3.9 million, up 18% from the prior year. And of that digital-only subscriptions were 2.9 million, up 29% year-over-year. For The Wall Street Journal, there were 3.1 million average subscriptions for the quarter, up nearly 19% from the prior year with digital-only subscriptions growing 27% to more than 2.3 million. Revenues from Dow Jones Professional Information business rose 2% year-over-year, which included 16% growth in risk and compliance. As mentioned at the Dow Jones Investor Day, long-term contracts are 95% of risk and compliance revenues, providing us with a more predictable and reoccurring revenue base. Advertising revenues, which accounted for only 18% of revenues this quarter, declined 17% to $70 million, an improvement from a 28% decline last quarter. Digital advertising revenues again exceeded print advertising revenues, accounting for 57% of total advertising and increased 14%, benefiting from growth in direct display, programmatic and sponsored link revenues. Interestingly, we saw digital revenue growth in every industry category. Print and other advertising fell 39% a more modest improvement from the fourth quarter rate. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 47% to $72 million with margins expanding to almost 19% and up almost 6 percentage points versus the prior year. Overall costs for the segment declined approximately 6%, which combined with the top line growth led to the material margin expansion this quarter. At Book Publishing, HarperCollins had a very strong quarter building on the momentum from the fourth quarter, with revenues up 13% year-over-year to $458 million and segment EBITDA up 45% to $71 million. Revenue growth was driven by general trade and the children's books as well as modest revenue contribution from the Egmont acquisition in the U.K. Adjusted revenues and adjusted segment EBITDA grew 10% and 41% respectively. We saw strong digital growth with digital sales up 20% year-over-year to represent 23% of consumer revenues, up from 22%. E-book sales increased 18% year-over-year with gains in all genres while downloadable audio books increased 26% year-over-year. As Robert noted HarperCollins benefited from a strong release slate, which included Daniel Silva's The Order, Lucy Foley's The Guest List, Ben Shapiro's How to Destroy America in Three Easy Steps, Jenna Bush Hager's Everything Beautiful in Its Time as well as LeBron James' I Promise in children's books. The backlist contributed 61% of sales this quarter, down from 64% last year, which was due to the larger mix of front-list titles this quarter. Turning to News Media. We saw moderation in revenue declines this quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Revenues for the quarter were $487 million down 37% versus the prior year of which the impact from the divestment of News America Marketing accounted for the majority of the decline. On an adjusted basis which excludes the impact from the divestment of NAM and Unruly and the other items mentioned in our release, revenues declined 16% which is an improvement from the 22% decline in the fourth quarter. The decline also reflects a $35 million or 5% negative impact from the closure or transition to digital of certain regional and community newspapers in Australia. Circulation and subscription revenues were flat, as a $10 million or 4% benefit from currency fluctuations strong digital paid subscriber growth and cover price increases in the U.K. offset lower news stand sales related to COVID-19. We have seen print volumes beginning to improve particularly at the weekend papers. Advertising revenue fell $262 million or 59% on a reported basis of which $200 million or 45% was from the sale of News America Marketing, $29 million or a 7% negative impact related to the closure or transition to digital of certain regional and community titles in Australia with the rest of the decline relating to the overall weakness in the print advertising market. Advertising revenues at News U.K. fell 21% or 24% in local currency, while News Australia declined 35% or 38% in local currency which includes the $29 million negative impact or 20% related to the regional and community titles. Advertising revenues at the New York Post increased 6%, which includes 22% digital advertising growth. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was a loss of $22 million compared to a positive $7 million in the prior year or a decline of $29 million. The results reflect lower revenues and the absence of a net $12 million contribution from News America Marketing and Unruly partially offset by higher cost savings across the businesses. I would now like to talk about some of the themes in the upcoming quarter. Needless to say, forecasting continues to remain challenging. At Digital Real Estate Services as REA noted national residential listings in Australia for October were down 1% to the prior year with increases in Melbourne and Sydney. REA has also agreed to take a controlling interest in India's Elara Technologies. And as a result we expect to fully consolidate their results assuming completion on November 30. Please refer to REA's press release for more details. At REALTOR, we remain very encouraged by traffic and lead volumes. We are planning higher reinvestment spending in Q1 given our focus on expanding into adjacencies and growing the addressable market. In Subscription Video Services with the conclusion of Australia's two Tier One winter football seasons the AFL and NRL we expect to see seasonality in Kayo's subscriber numbers as we transition to the summer sports most notably Cricket. For Q2 we expect about $18 million or AUD 26 million of sports rights that were deferred due to COVID-19, but expect offsetting savings due to the ongoing benefit of the cost reduction measures taken in Q4 last year and the continued cost focus within the business. At Dow Jones overall year-over-year trends thus far are similar including strong digital advertising growth. As we look to the rest of the year, we expect modest reinvestment in the business as we focus on driving revenue growth through subscriptions and in risk and compliance. In Book Publishing as Robert mentioned, the key titles in the second quarter include Ree Drummond's Frontier Follies and Rhonda Byrne's, The Greatest Secret. We have continued to see higher online sales. At News Media, overall year-over-year revenue and cost trends remained similar to the prior quarter absent currency although visibility remains limited. As a reminder the prior year included a $22 million onetime benefit to segment EBITDA from the settlement of certain warranty claims at News U.K.'s printing business. We also expect some investment as we ramp our global shared service initiative over the course of the year. The COVID-19 crisis has presented challenges across all of our businesses and they have responded in a balanced and measured way. They will continue to focus on finding the right balance between permanent cost reduction and investment in growth opportunities, while keeping a close eye on the macroeconomic conditions and government responses to the virus within their own markets. We believe, we are well positioned as we move forward with a greater focus on digital across the company and a more disciplined approach to costs. With that let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Kane Hannan with Goldman Sachs. \nKane Hannan: Good morning guys. Two for me please. Firstly just on Move, very pleasing to see that revenue growth get back into the double digits. Just talk a bit more about how sustainable you think that growth is? And then the reinvestment you commented on Susan what sort of quantum we should be thinking about there? And then secondly just more broadly you've obviously seen the Elara investment come through. But just interested in your thoughts around how you should be capitalizing on your balance sheet strength which obviously have thus progressing the simplification agenda and then trying to realize the value in some of the parts in the current environment?\nRobert Thomson: Okay. It's fair to say, REALTOR has truly been renovated. I remember there was skeptics at the time of the acquisition the naysayers who wondered whether we could transform a company that frankly had seen better days. Well the best days are now clearly ahead. We've used our editorial expertise and reached the power of our media platforms and a relentless focus on the need of customers to improve user experience and that's showing up in the returns. For us the challenge as you indicated to get the blend rides between continuing expansion and contemporary returns. I mean obviously due to the savvy leadership of David Doctorow and Tracey Fellows, we have had a massive increase in margin. And we have elasticity there. But we believe that we're at the early stage of the exponential expansion of that business. And to be honest, it will also be a beneficiary of our advocacy to change the digital landscape whether it be through digital ad yields or algorithm transparency. And so it will be eminently efficacious for REALTOR for REA for our businesses in Asia and for our operations in India. Now as for structure the most important way of maximizing our real estate properties value is to ensure that they are the fastest-growing most lucrative most innovative sites in the world truly digital in orientation. And shall I say not weighed down by bricks-and-mortar and unsold inventory or the need to renovate a kitchen or add a bidet in the bathroom. The benefits of that creative committed approach to potential vendors to potential buyers and to real realtors is patently obvious in the results last quarter. Now we have Tracey Fellows overseeing our global real estate operations and we have just consolidated our India operations through REA. So there is a shape a structure emerging. And more than that there is a sense of purpose and of profitability. We are by many measures the world's largest real estate company and that business has more than withstood the stress tests of recent months. In fact, the recent months showed the extraordinary potential of that business. \nSusan Panuccio: And just in relation to the reinvestment question that you asked, look we don't obviously give guidance -- specific guidance in relation to the cost. But broadly speaking, we could probably think about the cost reductions that happened this quarter in buckets of headcount-related savings and marketing-related savings and probably half of those savings a little bit more related to marketing. So we would expect to see that scale up as we go throughout the year, obviously depending on audience and revenue growth. And we also will have some reinvestment in product innovation as we look to scale out the platforms. So without sort of giving guidance that's sort ofbroadly speaking how we're thinking about it. \nMichael Florin: Thank you, Kane. Corey, we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Entcho Raykovski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nEntcho Raykovski: Hi, Robert. Hi, Susan. Well done on a very good result. I've got a couple as well. So firstly, I appreciate your comments on digital real estate simplification. But if I can ask directly would you consider spinning out those assets? I'm particularly conscious given the implied value ex-REA is now at very much historically low levels by my calcs REA is now more than 90% of market value. So there's clear -- there seems to be a clear disconnect. So is there some scope for a spinout? And secondly, on Dow Jones costs. Interesting the extent to which you can hold on to the cost reductions which have been achieved in the quarter whether they're largely temporary and really achieved as a result of COVID? Thank you. \nRobert Thomson: Entcho look, we're always open-minded. We're constantly institutionally introspective. But the priority at the moment is to do what we're doing, which is to maximize growth in the past quarter, to maximize profitability, to take advantage of opportunities. And I'm just very proud of what Tracey and David and Owen in Australia are doing at the moment in very difficult circumstances. And as I said in particular with realtor.com, and I'm sure you recall the time of the acquisition where people wondered what we were going to do with that business and whether it had indeed seen better days. And it's very clear from those results last quarter that our best days are ahead. \nSusan Panuccio: And Entcho just in relation to the cost question on Dow Jones. Look obviously, it's tricky to say exactly how we expect the year to pan out. But what I would say is that the team have been very focused on cost. Some of those you're right will be COVID-related cost reductions and we wouldn't necessarily expect to see those replication throughout the year. But some of them actually are real cost reductions. There's been a lot of work on headcount and looking at the right balance between permanent reductions and reinvestment. But we would expect to see ongoing investment in that business, particularly, in relation to subscriber growth risk and compliance and new products as well. So very similar to the commentary around -- I gave on REALTOR. But we are really pleased with the ongoing focus given COVID on costs and we do expect to see some of those cost savings certainly continuing as we go throughout the year. \nMichael Florin: Thank you, Entcho. Corey, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. \nCraig Huber: Yes. Hi. I've got a few questions here. Has your thoughts changed at all on the large cash balance that you guys carry every quarter every year in terms of what to do with that going forward? \nRobert Thomson: Craig, we're constantly reviewing cash and capital allocation whether that be returns directly to shareholders or share buybacks for which we have a provision as you know. Well the potential for company-enhancing investments either internally or externally that are transformative for our results and most importantly for shareholders. As Susan just mentioned, we've certainly raised consciousness around the company with the imperative of conserving and preserving cash at a difficult time at a time of pandemic and uncertainty. And the success of that program has given us genuine optionality. But I'd certainly suggest the big investments we've made and you'll be aware that REALTOR and Harlequin books approved their worth at a time when every company is being stress tested by the crisis. And we're proud of how those investments have faired, but particularly proud of how our teams around the world have transformed those divisions. And I think it's fair to say that investors and potential investors can see the momentum and the value in those investments. \nCraig Huber: Okay. Also want to ask\u2026\nMichael Florin: Craig, do you want to ask another question? \nCraig Huber: Yes I did. Yes if I could please just real quick. And I guess just in the spirit of transparency here was the EBITDA for realtor.com can you disclose that? Was it roughly $20 million in the quarter? \nRobert Thomson: It would be. I mean Craig we said what the increase in profitability was and the increase in profitability was $28 million. So I think as Susan said that contributed the bulk of the EBITDA improvement at Digital Real Estate. And it was profitable. \nCraig Huber: Okay. Thank you, guys.\nMichael Florin: Thanks, Craig. Corey, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brian Han with Morningstar. \nBrian Han: Hi. The snapback in earnings and margins for books was that mostly just natural leverage from higher digital sales, or did your general cost-cutting program play a big role there?\nSusan Panuccio: Brian actually it wasn't cost-cutting programs within HarperCollins given their revenue growth. So, they have actually been scaling their costs in accordance with their revenue growth. But they do have clearly a different mix. So, there's a different mix between the front list and the back list quarter-on-quarter. And also it depends on the types of front list mastheads titles that we sell. So, it's a combination of those not necessarily cost-driven more revenue-driven this quarter.\nMike Florin: Thank you, Brian. We'll take our next question please, Corey.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We do have a follow-up question from Kane Hannan with Goldman Sachs.\nKane Hannan: Hi guys. Thanks for the follow-up. Just around Foxtel just interested in $15 million increase in cost in the quarter and I take the point around currency. But just whether there's any change in the commentary from the full year around the $100 million reduction. And then just on the commercial side of things, just interested if you could talk about the revenue impact. Obviously, I think you said you're working with the pubs and clubs and the subs are back up to 200,000. But just wondering what the if you could talk about a revenue impact in the quarter.\nSusan Panuccio: No worries, Kane. So, just in relation to the cost it was a net underlying saving of AUD50 million. So, I think that's important. And that does include the deferral of the sports rights in there. So, that gives you a sense as to the scale of the reduction that we're seeing within Foxtel. We are expecting for underlying costs to be significant for the full year. The team is still very, very focused on that. But as we mentioned last time there will be a net impact of the deferral of sports costs AUD78 million for the year both programming and then production costs included within that number. But the underlying savings will be significantly higher than that. In relation to the commercial revenue impact of about $14 million this year quarter-on-quarter, you'll see from the subs numbers that we quoted that we have picked up a considerable amount since Q4. We're hoping actually with the opening up of Victoria that we'll actually start to pick that number up again as we move forward. So, they will continue to work on that as we look to build that base back up.\nRobert Thomson: And to supplement what Susan said in the context of the COVID-related restrictions on pubs and clubs the impact on advertising we're very pleased with the rapid growth of the streaming business at Foxtel under Siobhan and Patrick. And we will continue to provide the best possible experience for our subscribers wherever they happen to be. As Susan earlier noted our OTT subs are up 67% year-on-year. And by any standard that's a significant expansion of the customer base. While the Foxtel broadcast ARPU actually rose at the same period in U.S. dollars obviously affected by currency part from $53 to $56. As we've already made clear we foresee no need to bolster Foxtel with extra investment which shows that the business is on a particularly positive trajectory. \nMike Florin: Thank you, Kane. Corey, we'll take our next question please.\nOperator: Yes. And our final question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.\nCraig Huber: Thank you. Just a couple of quick follow-ups here. On the divestiture front, do you think you're largely done with that? That's my first question. And then secondly is there anything else Susan, you'd want to call out within at Foxtel in terms of timing of costs things that are moving around related to the sports programming costs and anything else that we should be aware of here as we try to model it?\nRobert Thomson: On divestiture, look, we're obviously constantly reviewing the portfolio. But really one wouldn't speculate on speculation of any kind. What I would say is that we -- and you can see from the results, we're very proud of our teams around the world all our employees in the way that they've come together and put together a quarter of results which in the circumstances an indication not only of the strength of the company, but of the potential of the company.\nSusan Panuccio: And Craig just in relation to the Foxtel costs so just on phasing we had deferral of sports rights which we quoted at $51 million in this quarter. We've said we'll have another $26 million in Q2. So that sort of picks up the bulk of that deferral. But then of course, when you think forward to Q4, you won't have costs in Q4 in the last year in relation to sports rights which you will have next year. So, you almost have a double-up of those costs as we go through this year. In relation to the other cost savings the team actually did a really good job in Q4 of looking at that cost base and getting heads out of the business which sort of continued into the first month of this quarter. So, the actual underlying cost savings that they delivered in Q4 in relation to the heads and a lot of the overhead costs we expect that are in play now and they'll continue throughout the year.\nMike Florin: Thank you. And Corey are there any other additional questions?\nOperator: There are no further questions in queue at this time sir.\nMike Florin: Great. Thank you, Corey and thank you for all participating. Be well, stay safe, and we will talk to you soon. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Susan Panuccio",
            "content": "Thank you, Robert. As Robert mentioned, we are pleased with the start to the new fiscal year, particularly in an environment which has clearly been marked by unpredictability and uncertainty. Our businesses have responded well to the challenges as evidenced by these results. Fiscal 2021, first quarter total revenues were over $2.1 billion, down 10% versus the prior year while total segment EBITDA was $268 million, up 21% year-over-year led by very strong growth at the Digital Real Estate Services, Dow Jones and Book Publishing segments. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, most notably the sale of News America Marketing in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year, as well as currency fluctuations and other items disclosed in our release revenues were down by only 3% while total segment EBITDA increased by 23%. Net income for the quarter was $47 million compared to a net loss of $211 million in the prior year reflecting the absence of impairment charges and higher total segment EBITDA, partially offset by higher tax expense. The prior year figure reflected $273 million of non-cash impairment charges, primarily at News America Marketing. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.06 as compared to a loss of $0.39 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS were $0.08 in the quarter versus $0.04 in the prior year. Turning now to the operating segments. At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 7% to $290 million, a big improvement from the fourth quarter, primarily due to the strength of Move. On an adjusted basis revenues increased 4%. Segment EBITDA rose 45% to $119 million or 40% on an adjusted basis, primarily driven by a meaningful increase in profit contribution from Move, due to a combination of higher revenues and cost reduction measures. The results at Move accounted for over 80% of segment revenue growth and over 70% of segment EBITDA growth this quarter. REA group revenues rose 2%, reflecting a $6 million or 4% benefit from currency fluctuations. National residential listing volumes declined 2% for the quarter impacted by stage four government restrictions in Melbourne, which included a ban on physical inspections. To put that in perspective, Metro Melbourne listings in the quarter declined 44% versus the prior year while the listings in Metro Sydney grew 23%. REA's results benefited from positive FX movements as well as modest residential revenue and financial services growth driven by higher refinancing activity, but the growth was mostly offset by declines in commercial developer and Asia. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details. At Move, we are extremely pleased with our progress during the first quarter. Move revenues rose 12% to $138 million, representing an all-time high with real estate revenues rising 13%. As Robert mentioned, traffic reached record levels with an average of 90 million unique users for the first quarter, an increase of 26% year-over-year. Monthly average lead volume for the quarter grew at an even faster rate at over 40%. We saw material growth in the performance-based referral model which accounted for approximately 30% of total Move revenues in the quarter, benefiting from the growth in lead volume, higher home prices and real estate transaction closes. As I've mentioned in the past, there is a delay in recognizing the revenue from the referral model due to the timing of transaction closes, which in addition to natural real estate seasonal patterns can lead to some volatility quarter-to-quarter as we shift more leads to that model. These results are very encouraging as we further progress towards increasing our addressable market through the integration of key ancillary services like our Rocket Mortgage partnership. While we continue to transition to the referral model the combination of strong lead volume and price increases for our more traditional lead generation business, resulted in a more stable revenue performance this quarter than the prior quarters. Move increased its profit contribution by $28 million versus the prior year driven by the scaling of the referral model, cost efficiencies resulting from the restructuring of the organization last quarter, including completing the integration of REALTOR and Opcity and the deferral of marketing spend. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $496 million, down 4% versus the prior year and included a $20 million or 3% positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The revenue decline moderated from the prior quarter a strong growth at Kayo driven by the return of live sports as well as the expansion of Binge partially offset the declines in residential and commercial subscriptions. Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base reached a record high at nearly 3.3 million as of September 30, up 7% year-over-year led by meaningful growth of paying OTT subscriptions, which reached over 1.2 million at quarter end. Broadcast subscribers declined about 10% to 1.85 million. Commercial subscribers declined 23% to 205,000 but marked a big improvement from the fourth quarter due to the reopening of licensed venues in most parts of the country. Foxtel is continuing to work with impacted customers in the pubs clubs and accommodation sectors particularly in Victoria and New South Wales. Broadcast churn was relatively stable at 14.6% versus 14.4% in the prior year, partly impacted by the roll-off of some of the churn mitigation initiatives, but were still below the financial year 2019 and financial year 2020 averages. Broadcast ARPU increased 1% from the prior year to AUD 79, which was also modestly higher than the fourth quarter. Segment EBITDA declined 4% to $78 million and declined 9% on an adjusted basis. Total cost declined approximately 3% or $15 million with a $16 million or 4% adverse impact due to currency fluctuations. Underlying savings were $31 million or AUD 50 million. These savings came despite an increasing sports rights and production costs, partly due to the $36 million or AUD 51 million impact from the timing of some sporting events deferred from the fourth quarter. Foxtel also benefited in the quarter from lower entertainment programming costs as well as declines in transmission and overhead expenses as we see the flow-through from the cost actions taken last year. Moving on to Dow Jones, revenues for the quarter were $386 million, up 1% compared to the prior year with digital revenues accounting for a record 73% of total revenues this quarter, up 8 percentage points from the prior year. Circulation revenues rose 7% due to robust growth in digital circulation revenues, partially offset by lower-single copy and amenity print volume, and marked the meaningful improvement from the fourth quarter rate of 2%. As Robert mentioned, Dow Jones again achieved record subscriptions in the quarter with the year-over-year growth rate slightly higher than the fourth quarter. Dow Jones average subscriptions to its consumer product for the quarter were nearly 3.9 million, up 18% from the prior year. And of that digital-only subscriptions were 2.9 million, up 29% year-over-year. For The Wall Street Journal, there were 3.1 million average subscriptions for the quarter, up nearly 19% from the prior year with digital-only subscriptions growing 27% to more than 2.3 million. Revenues from Dow Jones Professional Information business rose 2% year-over-year, which included 16% growth in risk and compliance. As mentioned at the Dow Jones Investor Day, long-term contracts are 95% of risk and compliance revenues, providing us with a more predictable and reoccurring revenue base. Advertising revenues, which accounted for only 18% of revenues this quarter, declined 17% to $70 million, an improvement from a 28% decline last quarter. Digital advertising revenues again exceeded print advertising revenues, accounting for 57% of total advertising and increased 14%, benefiting from growth in direct display, programmatic and sponsored link revenues. Interestingly, we saw digital revenue growth in every industry category. Print and other advertising fell 39% a more modest improvement from the fourth quarter rate. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 47% to $72 million with margins expanding to almost 19% and up almost 6 percentage points versus the prior year. Overall costs for the segment declined approximately 6%, which combined with the top line growth led to the material margin expansion this quarter. At Book Publishing, HarperCollins had a very strong quarter building on the momentum from the fourth quarter, with revenues up 13% year-over-year to $458 million and segment EBITDA up 45% to $71 million. Revenue growth was driven by general trade and the children's books as well as modest revenue contribution from the Egmont acquisition in the U.K. Adjusted revenues and adjusted segment EBITDA grew 10% and 41% respectively. We saw strong digital growth with digital sales up 20% year-over-year to represent 23% of consumer revenues, up from 22%. E-book sales increased 18% year-over-year with gains in all genres while downloadable audio books increased 26% year-over-year. As Robert noted HarperCollins benefited from a strong release slate, which included Daniel Silva's The Order, Lucy Foley's The Guest List, Ben Shapiro's How to Destroy America in Three Easy Steps, Jenna Bush Hager's Everything Beautiful in Its Time as well as LeBron James' I Promise in children's books. The backlist contributed 61% of sales this quarter, down from 64% last year, which was due to the larger mix of front-list titles this quarter. Turning to News Media. We saw moderation in revenue declines this quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Revenues for the quarter were $487 million down 37% versus the prior year of which the impact from the divestment of News America Marketing accounted for the majority of the decline. On an adjusted basis which excludes the impact from the divestment of NAM and Unruly and the other items mentioned in our release, revenues declined 16% which is an improvement from the 22% decline in the fourth quarter. The decline also reflects a $35 million or 5% negative impact from the closure or transition to digital of certain regional and community newspapers in Australia. Circulation and subscription revenues were flat, as a $10 million or 4% benefit from currency fluctuations strong digital paid subscriber growth and cover price increases in the U.K. offset lower news stand sales related to COVID-19. We have seen print volumes beginning to improve particularly at the weekend papers. Advertising revenue fell $262 million or 59% on a reported basis of which $200 million or 45% was from the sale of News America Marketing, $29 million or a 7% negative impact related to the closure or transition to digital of certain regional and community titles in Australia with the rest of the decline relating to the overall weakness in the print advertising market. Advertising revenues at News U.K. fell 21% or 24% in local currency, while News Australia declined 35% or 38% in local currency which includes the $29 million negative impact or 20% related to the regional and community titles. Advertising revenues at the New York Post increased 6%, which includes 22% digital advertising growth. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was a loss of $22 million compared to a positive $7 million in the prior year or a decline of $29 million. The results reflect lower revenues and the absence of a net $12 million contribution from News America Marketing and Unruly partially offset by higher cost savings across the businesses. I would now like to talk about some of the themes in the upcoming quarter. Needless to say, forecasting continues to remain challenging. At Digital Real Estate Services as REA noted national residential listings in Australia for October were down 1% to the prior year with increases in Melbourne and Sydney. REA has also agreed to take a controlling interest in India's Elara Technologies. And as a result we expect to fully consolidate their results assuming completion on November 30. Please refer to REA's press release for more details. At REALTOR, we remain very encouraged by traffic and lead volumes. We are planning higher reinvestment spending in Q1 given our focus on expanding into adjacencies and growing the addressable market. In Subscription Video Services with the conclusion of Australia's two Tier One winter football seasons the AFL and NRL we expect to see seasonality in Kayo's subscriber numbers as we transition to the summer sports most notably Cricket. For Q2 we expect about $18 million or AUD 26 million of sports rights that were deferred due to COVID-19, but expect offsetting savings due to the ongoing benefit of the cost reduction measures taken in Q4 last year and the continued cost focus within the business. At Dow Jones overall year-over-year trends thus far are similar including strong digital advertising growth. As we look to the rest of the year, we expect modest reinvestment in the business as we focus on driving revenue growth through subscriptions and in risk and compliance. In Book Publishing as Robert mentioned, the key titles in the second quarter include Ree Drummond's Frontier Follies and Rhonda Byrne's, The Greatest Secret. We have continued to see higher online sales. At News Media, overall year-over-year revenue and cost trends remained similar to the prior quarter absent currency although visibility remains limited. As a reminder the prior year included a $22 million onetime benefit to segment EBITDA from the settlement of certain warranty claims at News U.K.'s printing business. We also expect some investment as we ramp our global shared service initiative over the course of the year. The COVID-19 crisis has presented challenges across all of our businesses and they have responded in a balanced and measured way. They will continue to focus on finding the right balance between permanent cost reduction and investment in growth opportunities, while keeping a close eye on the macroeconomic conditions and government responses to the virus within their own markets. We believe, we are well positioned as we move forward with a greater focus on digital across the company and a more disciplined approach to costs. With that let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A. And just in relation to the reinvestment question that you asked, look we don't obviously give guidance -- specific guidance in relation to the cost. But broadly speaking, we could probably think about the cost reductions that happened this quarter in buckets of headcount-related savings and marketing-related savings and probably half of those savings a little bit more related to marketing. So we would expect to see that scale up as we go throughout the year, obviously depending on audience and revenue growth. And we also will have some reinvestment in product innovation as we look to scale out the platforms. So without sort of giving guidance that's sort ofbroadly speaking how we're thinking about it. And Entcho just in relation to the cost question on Dow Jones. Look obviously, it's tricky to say exactly how we expect the year to pan out. But what I would say is that the team have been very focused on cost. Some of those you're right will be COVID-related cost reductions and we wouldn't necessarily expect to see those replication throughout the year. But some of them actually are real cost reductions. There's been a lot of work on headcount and looking at the right balance between permanent reductions and reinvestment. But we would expect to see ongoing investment in that business, particularly, in relation to subscriber growth risk and compliance and new products as well. So very similar to the commentary around -- I gave on REALTOR. But we are really pleased with the ongoing focus given COVID on costs and we do expect to see some of those cost savings certainly continuing as we go throughout the year. Brian actually it wasn't cost-cutting programs within HarperCollins given their revenue growth. So, they have actually been scaling their costs in accordance with their revenue growth. But they do have clearly a different mix. So, there's a different mix between the front list and the back list quarter-on-quarter. And also it depends on the types of front list mastheads titles that we sell. So, it's a combination of those not necessarily cost-driven more revenue-driven this quarter. No worries, Kane. So, just in relation to the cost it was a net underlying saving of AUD50 million. So, I think that's important. And that does include the deferral of the sports rights in there. So, that gives you a sense as to the scale of the reduction that we're seeing within Foxtel. We are expecting for underlying costs to be significant for the full year. The team is still very, very focused on that. But as we mentioned last time there will be a net impact of the deferral of sports costs AUD78 million for the year both programming and then production costs included within that number. But the underlying savings will be significantly higher than that. In relation to the commercial revenue impact of about $14 million this year quarter-on-quarter, you'll see from the subs numbers that we quoted that we have picked up a considerable amount since Q4. We're hoping actually with the opening up of Victoria that we'll actually start to pick that number up again as we move forward. So, they will continue to work on that as we look to build that base back up. And Craig just in relation to the Foxtel costs so just on phasing we had deferral of sports rights which we quoted at $51 million in this quarter. We've said we'll have another $26 million in Q2. So that sort of picks up the bulk of that deferral. But then of course, when you think forward to Q4, you won't have costs in Q4 in the last year in relation to sports rights which you will have next year. So, you almost have a double-up of those costs as we go through this year. In relation to the other cost savings the team actually did a really good job in Q4 of looking at that cost base and getting heads out of the business which sort of continued into the first month of this quarter. So, the actual underlying cost savings that they delivered in Q4 in relation to the heads and a lot of the overhead costs we expect that are in play now and they'll continue throughout the year."

            "name": "Robert Thomson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Wherever you happen to be, and whatever time it happens to be virtually and actually, I trust that all are faring well, during these most challenging of times, personally and professionally. We are certainly in the midst of a political uncertainty in the U.S. and continuity is a blessing in these polarized and polarizing moments. Please continue to stay both, safe and sage. I would in particular like to express my gratitude to all our employees, who've traversed this difficult terrain with courage and commitment. And we've played an important empathetic role in their communities, during these stressful months. Despite the harsh conditions and the inevitable COVID-caused disruptions, I am pleased to report that News Corp had a particularly robust first quarter, with resounding year-on-year growth in our profitability and revenue expansion in several key segments. Three vital -- three vital pillars of our company, Dow Jones, Book Publishing and Digital Real Estate Services had notable EBITDA growth and higher revenue in Q1. Consolidated revenues were over $2.1 billion. And while that was down 10% year-over-year adjusted revenues which exclude News America Marketing, Unruly and other items noted in the press release were only 3% lower. Consequentially in Q1, News Corp's total segment EBITDA was $268 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year evidence of the strength of our core businesses and the growth potential of those sectors in which we have made significant acquisitions in particular, Digital Real Estate and Book Publishing. We are also benefiting from our strategy to simplify the company, allowing us to focus on the segments that have the greatest growth potential, as well as ensuring that we are resolutely reducing shared costs around the company. We are determined to provide greater transparency for investors and the presentation of Dow Jones, as a separate segment was integral to that continuing process. Turning now to the details, Digital Real Estate Services flourished this quarter. Despite, limits on home inspections and other COVID-related disruption, revenues increased 7% year-over-year, while segment EBITDA surged 45% year-over-year led by particularly strong results at Move, operator of realtor.com, which had record revenues in the quarter of $138 million. Both REA and realtor.com reported record traffic during the quarter, with the latter having reached a high 92 million monthly unique visitors in August, while traffic was up 26% for the quarter. Based on comScore data, REALTOR has outpaced Zillow in audience growth for 16 of the past 18 months. This success comes as realtor.com continues to focus on transforming its business towards a data-rich referral model. We are convinced there's a substantial opportunity for REALTOR to expand its market from a still deep pool of real estate marketing dollars to provide value-added services at premium prices in mortgages titles and other adjacent categories.  I would note realtor.com's new partnership with Rocket Mortgage, as one example of the company's growth potential and our efforts to expand the addressable market. realtor.com also recently launched the Seller's Marketplace to provide listings for our buyers without the antediluvian approach of our main competitor, which has been doubling down on its house flipping business. We are a genuinely nimble, agile digital company. And will leave bricks-and-mortar to the specialists. realtor.com is also constantly focused on improving transparency. And choice for those buying and selling homes, including higher-quality estimates and salient information about everything from flood risk to neighbourhood noise levels. We have been introducing features, while still being cost-conscious. And that flense of creativity and discipline is behind, the burgeoning of the business. At REA, while listing volumes have patently been affected by government-imposed COVID restrictions, the business still posted a higher profit contribution. What we are seeing at both companies is that the pandemic has been a catalyst for many families to reconsider their current housing and environment prompting an increasing number to seek less dense areas and larger properties. As the restrictions on movement, ease we believe that trend is likely to gather momentum, particularly at a time of record low interest rates. As we noted earlier, Dow Jones is now reported as a separate segment, which is innate part of our efforts to increase transparency and highlight an inherent value. As you can see from the company's resounding results, there is much to savour, about the business and its prospects. As we noted in our Investor Day presentation, Dow Jones aims to double its subscribers, given an incremental pool of 12 million prospective Dow Jones premium customers in the U.S. alone. And as the world's leading provider of business news and analysis, Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal have maintained premium pricing. And we are increasing our efforts to up-sell our customers' high-value specialist products. Revenue benefited from accelerating digital circulation and digital advertising growth and continued expansion of risk and compliance. These compensated for not unexpected decline in print advertising. Though, the total ad decline was not as marked as that of other publishers. As a result, Dow Jones segment EBITDA grew 47% year-over-year. A few metrics to note behind that admiral result at a turbulent time. Risk and compliance revenues rose, 16% year-over-year representing the 21st consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. The Wall Street Journal reported 27% growth in digital-only subscriptions. And total Dow Jones subscriptions increased 18% in the quarter, reaching approximately 3.9 million. MarketWatch also had a buoyant quarter with the highest first quarter revenue results in its history, as traffic surged to 52 million average monthly uniques. In recent days we have moved to further monetize that fast-expanding audience, by introducing subscriptions and enhancing the news flow for loyal readers. The early results are rather positive for both, MarketWatch and Barron's. To gain the sense of the size of the Dow Jones universe, which like the actual universe is still expanding traffic across the digital network rose 54% year-over-year in Q1, averaging 127 million unique users per month according to Adobe Analytics. And we firmly believe we are still at a relatively early stage of our potential audience and revenue growth. Meanwhile, in Book Publishing, HarperCollins also reported a strong quarter with revenues increasing 13% and segment EBITDA, up 45%. Again, those results reflected a mix of the creativity of the commissioning along with disciplined, diligent cost control. Reopened bookstores restocked their shelves with compelling HarperCollins tones and overall digital sales in Q1 were up 20% compared to the prior year continuing a trend that was evident in Q4 of fiscal 2020. Direct-to-consumer revenues rose almost 38% year-over-year. And the I Can Read! Book Club for children nearly quadrupled its membership since February to more than 95,000 monthly active users as of quarter end. Best-selling authors included Daniel Silva, Jenna Bush Hager, Lucy Foley, Ben Shapiro and LeBron James. And looking ahead, we have high hopes for Frontier Follies by Ree Drummond, The Greatest Secret by Rhonda Byrne, Concrete Rose by Angie Thomas and Code Name Bananas by David Walliams which is being released today. At Foxtel, there was marked improvement in the growth of the OTT business, which saw total closing paid subscriptions reached a new record high with nearly 3.3 million subscribers. This includes over 1.2 million paying customers of Kayo, Foxtel Now and the recently launched Binge. In total, there was a 67% year-over-year growth in the OTT base. To be specific, as of September 30, Kayo had 644,000 paid subscribers and 691,000 total subscribers. Foxtel Now had 298,000 paid subscribers and 310,000 total subscribers. And the burgeoning Binge had 290,000 paid subscribers and 321,000 total subscribers. One other note about Binge, the active subscriber is watching for 7.5 hours a week. So we are clearly pleased with how they're binging on Binge. In the News Media segment, the rate of year-over-year revenue decline moderated compared to Q4. Obviously, the direct year-on-year comparisons are complicated by the sale of both NAM and Unruly. Cost consciousness continue to be raised with one recent announcement of note. In September, we did our plans to shift the printing of The Wall Street Journal the New York Post and Barron's to the New York Times plant in Queens and we are actively exploring options for the Bronx Print Plant site, for which there has been considerable interest. This decision involved much agonizing as the Bronx plant and its talented committed staff have played an important role in the history of the company and the U.S. newspaper industry. Their sterling efforts will resonate for many decades to come as the mastheads continue their migration to digital in a rapidly changing media environment. A measure of that evolution is that the New York Post digital network traffic grew 35% in September, year-over-year to 144 million unique users. Digital advertising in the quarter climbed over 20% and nearly 90% of advertising revenues at the Post are now digital. The transformation of News Corp Australia continue to pace with the transition of most of our community in regional mastheads to digital-only. All told, our Australian titles saw strong digital subscription growth, up 26% year-over-year to 685,000. In the U.K. The Times and Sunday Times digital subscribers expanded 8% to 337,000 and also saw strong ARPU growth. Also in the U.K. Times Radio launched last quarter has already exceeded over 100,000 listeners each week, clearly benefiting from our leveraging of the strong Times brand and talent. Of course, it is also a powerful marketing platform for all of our U.K. titles and businesses. Finally, it should be clear to all that the digital landscape is changing dramatically and we are at the forefront of that change. It could even be argued that much of that change would not have happened without News Corp's advocacy over the past decade. The drive towards achieving a premium for premium content has gathered momentum and we are pleased that negotiations with the large platforms are ongoing. This is certainly not the end of the issue but without being too Churchillian it is the end of the beginning. Now more than ever, we believe it is evident that News Corp has value above and beyond the sum of our parts. So that mathematical fact is yet to be fully realized for our investors. That value should be more visible now that we have broken out the Dow Jones results, which also increases the scrutiny of our other news businesses which are themselves in the midst of a successful transition. We plan to continue simplifying the business and are open to making structural changes to maximize value and will continue to address the cost base. Unlike most media companies we have the option of optionality having carefully mastered our cash reserves which have improved since the pandemic began. I believe our continuing concerted initiatives are making us a more focused and more digital company, which will generate enhanced returns for our investors, in the months, the quarters and the years to come. And now for further financial enlightenment, we turn to Susan Panuccio. Okay. It's fair to say, REALTOR has truly been renovated. I remember there was skeptics at the time of the acquisition the naysayers who wondered whether we could transform a company that frankly had seen better days. Well the best days are now clearly ahead. We've used our editorial expertise and reached the power of our media platforms and a relentless focus on the need of customers to improve user experience and that's showing up in the returns. For us the challenge as you indicated to get the blend rides between continuing expansion and contemporary returns. I mean obviously due to the savvy leadership of David Doctorow and Tracey Fellows, we have had a massive increase in margin. And we have elasticity there. But we believe that we're at the early stage of the exponential expansion of that business. And to be honest, it will also be a beneficiary of our advocacy to change the digital landscape whether it be through digital ad yields or algorithm transparency. And so it will be eminently efficacious for REALTOR for REA for our businesses in Asia and for our operations in India. Now as for structure the most important way of maximizing our real estate properties value is to ensure that they are the fastest-growing most lucrative most innovative sites in the world truly digital in orientation. And shall I say not weighed down by bricks-and-mortar and unsold inventory or the need to renovate a kitchen or add a bidet in the bathroom. The benefits of that creative committed approach to potential vendors to potential buyers and to real realtors is patently obvious in the results last quarter. Now we have Tracey Fellows overseeing our global real estate operations and we have just consolidated our India operations through REA. So there is a shape a structure emerging. And more than that there is a sense of purpose and of profitability. We are by many measures the world's largest real estate company and that business has more than withstood the stress tests of recent months. In fact, the recent months showed the extraordinary potential of that business. Entcho look, we're always open-minded. We're constantly institutionally introspective. But the priority at the moment is to do what we're doing, which is to maximize growth in the past quarter, to maximize profitability, to take advantage of opportunities. And I'm just very proud of what Tracey and David and Owen in Australia are doing at the moment in very difficult circumstances. And as I said in particular with realtor.com, and I'm sure you recall the time of the acquisition where people wondered what we were going to do with that business and whether it had indeed seen better days. And it's very clear from those results last quarter that our best days are ahead. Craig, we're constantly reviewing cash and capital allocation whether that be returns directly to shareholders or share buybacks for which we have a provision as you know. Well the potential for company-enhancing investments either internally or externally that are transformative for our results and most importantly for shareholders. As Susan just mentioned, we've certainly raised consciousness around the company with the imperative of conserving and preserving cash at a difficult time at a time of pandemic and uncertainty. And the success of that program has given us genuine optionality. But I'd certainly suggest the big investments we've made and you'll be aware that REALTOR and Harlequin books approved their worth at a time when every company is being stress tested by the crisis. And we're proud of how those investments have faired, but particularly proud of how our teams around the world have transformed those divisions. And I think it's fair to say that investors and potential investors can see the momentum and the value in those investments. It would be. I mean Craig we said what the increase in profitability was and the increase in profitability was $28 million. So I think as Susan said that contributed the bulk of the EBITDA improvement at Digital Real Estate. And it was profitable. And to supplement what Susan said in the context of the COVID-related restrictions on pubs and clubs the impact on advertising we're very pleased with the rapid growth of the streaming business at Foxtel under Siobhan and Patrick. And we will continue to provide the best possible experience for our subscribers wherever they happen to be. As Susan earlier noted our OTT subs are up 67% year-on-year. And by any standard that's a significant expansion of the customer base. While the Foxtel broadcast ARPU actually rose at the same period in U.S. dollars obviously affected by currency part from $53 to $56. As we've already made clear we foresee no need to bolster Foxtel with extra investment which shows that the business is on a particularly positive trajectory. On divestiture, look, we're obviously constantly reviewing the portfolio. But really one wouldn't speculate on speculation of any kind. What I would say is that we -- and you can see from the results, we're very proud of our teams around the world all our employees in the way that they've come together and put together a quarter of results which in the circumstances an indication not only of the strength of the company, but of the potential of the company."

[Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMichael Florin: Thank you very much, Sarah. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com.  On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We'll open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.  This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information.  Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as Total Segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release for the applicable periods posted on our website.  With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\nRobert Thomson: Thank you, Mike. The overuse of superlatives really is unbecoming. But the past quarter and the full year have created so many unprecedented records that reflect well on all of News Corp, and we believe have created a platform for future performance and enduring returns for our investors. These accomplishments, which necessarily demand the use of superlatives, follow intense digital transformation by the businesses and focused acquisitions that we expect will provide increased revenue and healthy profits far into the future.  Profitability for the full year rose 31% to a record $1.67 billion, and that followed a 26% surge in the previous year, which itself was a record. Revenues rose a robust 11% despite incipient economic uncertainty and unfavorable ForEx fluctuations that outweighed the benefit of an extra week. In total, the favorable results were reflected in our reported EPS of $1.05, compared to $0.56 in the prior year.  It is worth noting that we saw enhanced success in each and every business segment last year, and we are confident of our prospects in fiscal 2023. Our core pillars, Dow Jones, Digital Real Estate Services and Book Publishing, all notched record results that exceeded the sterling performance of the previous fiscal year when new benchmarks were set across most of the company. And it's worth noting that our net cash from operating activities was a record $1.35 billion, topping the previous year's record of $1.24 billion. That extra cash has enabled us to return capital to shareholders and to be pointedly poised for opportunistic investments of the kind that have already transformed the Dow Jones business, making it more digital, more premium and more profitable.  The successful journey of our media properties is unlike any in the world, as has been the principal pursuit of change in terms of trade with the big digital players. We believe the profoundly positive commercial and social impact of those changes will be felt for many years to come. None of that would have been possible without a strong corporate culture created by and curated by Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, the support of an engaged enlightened Board and passionate, committed and creative employees around the world.  So we have a steady balance sheet, potent cash generation, profitable and growing businesses and the resources to take advantage of emerging opportunities. That muscularity was also reflected in the past year by the termination of our shareholder rights plan, or as it is referred to colloquially, the poison pill. Over the past 8 years, our reported revenue has grown by $1.8 billion, even though our advertising revenue, print newspaper dependent as it was, declined by $2.2 billion. That is a $4 billion swing. Over the same period, our total segment EBITDA has more than doubled, and our free cash flow available has increased by over 80%. Dow  Jones has prospered, more than doubling its segment EBITDA to $433 million in just the past 3 years. Our faith in its prospects has been shown by the acquisitions of Investor's Business Daily, OPIS and Base Chemicals, all of which we expect will contribute to revenue and profitability in the years ahead. Meanwhile, Digital Real Estate Services has expanded rapidly from 5% of our revenues in 2014 to 17% in fiscal '22. To be precise, we have seen growth in every quarter of this past year despite the recent increases in interest rates and the home supply challenges. We are confident that digital runway for real estate is long and lucrative.  It is certainly worth recognizing that News Corp's profits have expanded prodigiously compared to 8 years ago, rising from a reported $770 million in total segment EBITDA to nearly $1.7 billion this year. Our teams have made this successful journey despite the upheaval in the advertising market, despite the significant challenges to print media and despite the pandemic. We are more digital, more mobile, more global, acutely cost conscious and astutely tracking trends, in the quest for more revenues, increased profitability and enhanced returns for our investors.  To be specific about the segments, Dow Jones is already seeing the tangible benefits of OPIS and Base Chemicals, which we have rebranded Chemical Market Analytics, or CMA, to the -- These 2 businesses complement each other, and they certainly complement Dow Jones. We were fortunate to acquire them at a favorable price as their sale was required by regulators for approval of the S&P Global-IHS Markit merger. We thank those companies and the regulators for the opportunity bequest to us.  Not only are OPIS and CMA is starting to benefit us financially, but they have contributed to the depth and breadth of Dow Jones' overall expertise in commodities, in traditional fuel sources, in essential chemical products and in renewables and more. The analysis and analytics fit perfectly into our professional information business, where we have seen sustained growth, particularly from risk and compliance, which reported an 18% surge in full year annual revenues, with the fourth quarter seeing another double-digit increase. That means we have reported 28, that is correct, 28 successive quarters of double-digit growth.  Advertising at Dow Jones remained strong in the fourth quarter and was a significant contributor to the segment throughout the year. Total advertising at Dow Jones achieved year-over-year growth of 20% for the full year, the highest on record. Dow Jones also made progress in expanding its high-yielding subscriber base, which rose 9% to almost 4.9 million, including over 4 million digital-only subscribers. As a point of comparison, digital advertising at Dow Jones rose 16% in the most recent quarter, while it shrank, it contracted, it diminished at the New York Times. In what was a resounding performance for News Corp, Dow Jones really is worthy of note. Dow Jones profitability saw 54% in the quarter to $106 million. And as noted earlier, for the year, segment EBITDA was $433 million, up 30%, while revenues rose to over $2 billion, an 18% increase.  The imperative at Dow Jones is to provide a premium service and premium value to a premium audience and is remembering that this is a premium audience at scale, with more than 100 million visitors each month to Dow Jones sites and thousands of the world's largest companies as enterprise clients. Our task, our opportunity is to offer more of the information, the intelligence demanded by discerning professionals. These are fertile fields for the future.  At Digital Real Estate Services, revenues for the full year surged 25% to more than $1.7 billion, while segment EBITDA grew 12% to $574 million as we continue to build brands and products for future success. In Australia, REA continued its expansion into intelligent adjacencies, most notably with the Mortgage Choice acquisition, and residential listing volume improved by 11% in fiscal '22 to the highest level since 2016. We also now have the #1 digital property company in India in terms of audience share with Housing.com expanding its lead in an expanding market. Monthly visitors rose in June by 52% to $15.7 million.  In the U.S., Move, operator of realtor.com, reported revenue growth for the year of 11% while we invested in expanding our expertise in rentals and acquired uplist, an agent marketplace that focuses on monetizing seller leads. The broader thing is that we see a confluence of trends in the U.S. and Australian marketplaces. The U.S. market has traditionally derived revenue from buyer leads, but the future will bring opportunity to harvest seller revenue, which is the basis for REA's emphatic success in Australia.  As for the U.S. housing market, obviously, the hiking of interest rates has influenced market trends. For example, mortgage refinancing has imploded, which plays to our strength as a source of mortgage origination leads, which mortgage companies were ignoring somewhat because it was easier to refinance an existing an own customer. The rate of price increases that put homes out of reach is generally expected to continue to decline, and inventories have at last started to improve, with active inventory in June up 19% year-over-year according to Realtor.com. News Media, which in recent years has faced severe challenges, did particularly well, both in Q4 and throughout the fiscal year. To be precise, News Media was the single largest contributor to profit improvement across the company this fiscal year. Let's be candid. This spectacular result came as many other newspaper companies around the world struggled and is a true tribute to the efforts of our executives and teams in Australia, the U.K. and the U.S.  In fiscal 2022, revenues were up 10%, and the segment delivered $217 million of segment EBITDA, expanding 317% year-over-year. I should repeat that stunning number for clarity, 317%. At News UK, the Sun reported a historic shift with digital advertising outpacing print in fiscal '22 and as its online audience surged 33% in Q4 to 165 million monthly average uniques globally, including 173% growth for the sun.com, driven by the successful launch of the Sun U.S. Overall, News UK, thanks to Rebecca Brooks and her team, increased its profit contribution by $54 million.  News Corp Australia under Michael Miller and his team increased its profit contribution by $109 million, its highest since separation, as digital subscribers to News Corp Australia properties rose by 12% to $964,000, and advertising revenues remain robust. The New York Post posted a historic result. It formally reported a profit, possibly the first since Alexander Hamilton founded the paper, and we are now on a pathway to increasing profit contribution. The Post has distinguished itself with brave journalism that has seen it so far above the media mediocrity. That is a tribute to the intrepid editor, Keith Paul, his journalists and to Sean Giancola, the Chief Executive, and all on the team. We also transitioned from the Bronx printing site and are working towards completion of that facility sale.  At Subscription Video Services, the Foxtel Group's renaissance continued with adjusted revenues, which excludes currency impact, rising 4% in the fourth quarter, while adjusted segment EBITDA rose 32% in the fourth quarter. And importantly, excluding currency, full year revenues for the segment rose for the first time in 5 years. Again, the Foxtel Group is a company transformed and one generating record metrics. Total streaming subscribers at the end of the fiscal year soared 31% from a year ago to $2.8 million, while broadcast churn fell to 13.8% in the fourth quarter, sharply lower than the prior year.  Our sports streaming service, Kayo, is particularly successful with ARPU rising partially attributable to the recent price increase and given the quality of our teams, productions and the quantity of quality sports. HarperCollins grew full year revenue and segment EBITDA despite higher freight and manufacturing costs and a challenging prior year comparison given that the pandemic created a captive audience and record revenues in many countries. We can clearly see the virtue of acquiring Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Books & Media as the value of that price list back list is being realized. That efficacy should be obvious in coming months as HMH includes the U.S. rights to the Lord of the Rings collection, and we have seen increased orders ahead of the Rings of Power series on Amazon Prime, scheduled to be launched next month.  Speaking of superlatives, we have the best-selling book in the U.S. with the new Daniel Silver novel, Portrait of an Unknown Woman, and we are pleased by the lingering melody of Where the crawdads Sing, the first movie that was just released in partnership with our friends at Sony Pictures.  The News Corporation of 9 years ago is not the News Corporation of now. The provenance and the principle endure, but the business is fundamentally transformed. It is vastly more profitable and with the potential for even greater growth. Our teams are rightly proud of the way they have influenced the digital landscape, changing the terms of trade for media businesses, bringing clarity to an opaque advertising market and increasing transparency to hit the 2 uncountable algorithms.  The commercial changes are integral to our ongoing success, but the social consequences are also profound and enduring. Almost a decade after our reincarnation, thanks to the efforts of our employees and the faith of our investors, News Corp is set fair for the future.  Our CFO, Susan Panuccio, will now provide a concise account of what has transpired and a glimpse of the shining light that is the future.\nSusan Panuccio: Thank you, Robert. Fiscal 2022 was another record year for News Corp. We have taken significant steps over the years to reshape and strengthen the portfolio, reduce fixed costs, transition to become more digital and generate incremental high-margin revenues. I will come back to some thoughts about our fiscal 2023 outlook. But suffice to say that News Corp is well positioned as we move into fiscal 2023, given the strength of our asset mix and balance sheet and the continued diversification of our revenue base.  Fiscal 2022 fourth quarter total revenues were almost $2.7 billion, up 7%. The fourth quarter includes an extra week, which positively impacted revenues by $110 million. That impact was more than offset by foreign exchange headwinds of $139 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, fourth Quarter adjusted revenues grew 9% compared to the prior year, including the extra week. Total segment EBITDA was $315 million, up 50% versus the prior year, primarily due to higher overall revenues and lower costs in the Other segment, partially offset by higher costs from recent acquisitions and the negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The current quarter results include a onetime $20 million legal settlement charge for Insignia.  Adjusted EBITDA grew a healthy 34% versus the prior period. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.19 compared to a loss of $0.02 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.37 in the quarter, compared to $0.16 in the prior year. Our free cash flow generation remains strong and remains a key area of focus.  Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segment for the fourth quarter, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $443 million, an increase of 7%, compared to 74% revenue growth in the prior year. The results include a negative impact of $22 million from a valuation adjustment of future trail commissions at REA's financial services business and a negative impact of $20 million or 5% from foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by the $21 million contribution from Mortgage Choice and the benefit from the extra week, which added $14 million to Move's revenues. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues increased 7%, which does not exclude the benefit from the extra week. Segment EBITDA declined 11% to $121 million, driven by the $14 million negative impact at REA related to the revaluation of trail commissions and an $8 million or 6% negative impact related to currency headwinds as well as higher employee costs at both REA and Move. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 1%.  Move's revenues were $193 million, up 4% following 68% growth in the prior year. For the quarter, real estate revenues grew 3% and accounted for 84% of total revenues. Price optimization within the core lead gen business, higher penetration of our hybrid offering market VIP and continued home price appreciation, coupled with higher advertising revenues, helped to offset the impact from lower lead volumes and transaction volumes. Move's revenues also benefited by $40 million from the extra week. Referral offerings accounted for approximately 31% of total revenues, up from 30% last year. Based on our internal metrics, Realtor's average monthly unique users were $93 million in the fourth quarter. Lead volumes in the quarter fell 39% compared to the prior year, impacted by continued lack of supply and home price appreciation as well as the recent rising mortgage rates. Home prices remain high, growing in mid-teens in June, underscoring the continued supply and demand imbalance.  During the quarter, Move acquired Up Nest advancing realtor seller and listing agent strategy and continue to make investments in rentals and new homes as they build out those adjacencies. In the last 2 years, Realtor's focus was not only to take advantage of the strong market dynamics during the pandemic, but also to position itself for long-term growth while focusing on core competencies and improving the product to deliver deeper and richer information for consumers and customers. This is evidenced by the shift to the data-rich referral base model with the integration of Opcity, which enabled the launch and expansion of Market VIP, the hybrid product, and sell a marketplace to allow customers to explore seller leads without risking own capital to enter buying. These investments, together with the UpNest acquisition have allowed us to expand our scale compared to 2 years ago and capture other elements of the transaction life cycle.  REA had another strong quarter, with revenues rising 10% year-on-year on a reported basis to $250 million as growth in residential depth revenues and the contribution from the Mortgage Choice acquisition more than offset the negative impacts from currency fluctuations and the revaluation of trail commissions. REA continued to benefit from the favorable market backdrop, which saw Australian residential new buy listings rise 2% despite comparing against 54% growth in listing volumes in the prior year and expected uncertainty around the federal election in May. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more detail.  Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $524 million, sequentially higher than the third quarter and down approximately 3% compared to the prior year on a reported basis due to foreign currency headwinds. Importantly, on an adjusted basis, revenues rose 4%, accelerating from the prior quarter rate of 1%. Streaming revenues accounted for 23% of circulation and subscription revenues versus 16% in the prior year and more than offset broadcast revenue decline this quarter. We believe this is a key inflection point for the business and has helped underpin the recent stability in Foxtel Group's revenue. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group reached over 4.4 million at quarter end, up 13% year-over-year. Total subscribers, including trial has reached over $4.5 million. Total paid streaming subscribers reached 2.7 million, increasing 34% versus the prior year and adding 114,000 sequentially, with streaming subscribers now representing 61% of Foxtel's total paid subscriber base.  Kayo benefited from strong winter sports content, very high retention from the initial repricing of the legacy Live Pass customers and the successful implementation of the price rise in May. Kayo paying subscribers reached almost 1.3 million, up nearly 23% year-over-year. Binge paying subscribers grew 63% year-over-year to 1.2 million subscribers, which is relatively stable with the third quarter as net adds were impacted by the timing of content availability and the record adds in the third quarter. In July, we announced a AUD 2 price rise for Binge standard offering. Foxtel ended the quarter with approximately 1.5 million residential broadcast subscribers, down 10% year-over-year, with the rate of decline modestly improving from the third quarter rate. Foxtel continues to focus on managing broadcast churn, which reduced by over 3 percentage points year-over-year in the quarter to 13.8%, even though cable customers are being actively migrated to the iQ5. This reflects 11 consecutive months of year-over-year churn reduction. The focus on retaining high-value subscribers for broadcast ARPU steadily rise by 2% to AUD 83 segment EBITDA in the quarter of $81 million rose 23% versus the prior year and 32% on an adjusted basis. Foxtel continues to exhibit healthy cash generation and use existing facilities to pay its AUD 306 million of July USPP maturities.  For the full year, the business showed stability in revenue and segment EBITDA. And as Robert mentioned, full year adjusted revenues improved for the first time in 5 years, which is a great result for the business given the challenges of recent years. As expected, total costs were relatively stable in local currency.  Moving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones continued its strong performance in the fourth quarter with revenues of $565 million, up 26% compared to the prior year, with digital revenues accounting for 76% of total revenues this quarter, up 4 percentage points from last year. Results include a full quarter from the OPIS acquisition and 1 month from the Chemical Market Analytics acquisition, which closed in early June. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose an impressive 16%, with the extra week contributing $40 million.  Circulation revenues grew 17%, reflecting an additional $17 million for the extra week as well as strong volume gains in digital-only subscriptions. Total Dow Jones digital-only subscriptions were over 4 million, up 14%, including 88,000 net adds in the fourth quarter. Professional information business revenues rose 47% and accounted for 32% of segment revenues, driven by recent acquisitions and growth across all product lines, partly due to $14 million of additional revenues from the extra week. We are focused on further expansion of PIB, which was significantly enhanced with the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA. These acquisitions continue to move Dow Jones to a more recurring and digital revenue base with very high retention rates, strong margins, premium products and optionality into new market verticals. While we don't break out margins specifically for PIB, it is fair to assume that the products in the business have attractive margins, which we expect to be enhanced by our recent acquisitions.  Revenue from Risk & Compliance increased 19%, driven by higher sales activity, including strong growth across all regions, most notably in Europe, and we have a very strong pipeline of new business activity. OPIS generated $37 million of revenues in the quarter, with the business benefiting from price rises, high customer retention and strong demand in existing verticals. CMA contributed approximately $6 million of revenues in the quarter. Advertising revenues grew 13% to $116 million despite lapping 45% growth in the prior year. The extra week contributed $9 million to revenue. Digital advertising revenues rose 16% in the quarter despite facing a record 53% growth comparable from the prior year. Digital accounted for 58% of total advertising revenues, which improved 2 percentage points from last year. We continue to see very strong yield improvement and full strength in the B2B, B2C and finance categories this quarter. It is also noteworthy that the vast majority of our digital advertising comes from direct sales rather than via third-party programmatic exchanges, which has been helpful to our yield improvement. Print advertising rose 9%.  Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 54% to $106 million. Excluding the contribution from the acquisitions, currency fluctuations and other items disclosed in the release, adjusted segment EBITDA for the quarter rose an impressive 30% despite higher employee costs and higher sales and marketing costs. At Book Publishing, HarperCollins posted 4% revenue growth to $513 million and segment EBITDA declined 2% to $47 million as we continue to navigate supply chain and inflationary pressures as communicated during the fiscal year. To that effect, margins were down slightly from the prior year. We saw revenue growth driven by a strong front list performance in general books and a $20 million benefit from the extra week. Our backlist contributed 56% of revenues, down slightly from last year, impacted by lower sales of the Bridgerton series compared to last year. Digital sales rose 9% this quarter and accounted for 24% of consumer sales. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 4% and segment EBITDA declined 6%.  Turning to News Media, where the momentum continued in the fourth quarter. Revenues were $629 million, up 6% versus the prior year and included $53 million or 9% of negative impact due to currency headwinds, but more than offset the additional $36 million from the extra week. Adjusted revenues for the segment increased 14% compared to the prior year. We again saw a very strong performance in advertising as well as continued growth in circulation and subscription revenues, which was driven by the contribution from our recent content licensing deals, higher digital subscriptions and cover prices. Digital revenues continued to expand, increasing to 35% of segment revenues from 32%, primarily driven by the strength of digital advertising, which we expect will soon be the largest source of the segment's advertising revenues. Within the segment, revenues at News Corp Australia increased 6% and revenues at News UK were flat as both were materially impacted by currency headwinds. The New York Post also continued to show strong top line growth, up 23%.  Circulation and subscription revenues rose 3%, including double-digit digital subscriber growth across News Australia and the Times and Sunday Times Currency headwinds had a $26 million or 9% negative impact, which more than offset the $19 million benefit from the extra week. Advertising revenues increased 8% compared to the prior year, with strength in digital across all our key mastheads, most notably at The Sun, where digital exceeded print advertising for the third consecutive quarter, benefiting from significantly higher yields and its successful launch in the U.S. Currency negatively impacted advertising revenues by $21 million or 9%, partially offset by the additional $15 million from the extra week. Segment EBITDA of $33 million increased also by that amount, reflecting higher revenues, partially offset by incremental investments of over $20 million related to Talk TV in the U.K., which launched in April, and other digital initiatives. News Corp Australia and News UK contributed $23 million and $16 million, respectively, to the segment EBITDA growth. And the New York Post and Wireless Group were also again positive contributors.  News Corp finishes fiscal 2022 more dependent on recurring and circulation based revenue, less dependent on advertising revenue and with greater cost discipline across the company as a consequence of navigating the past couple of years. As for fiscal 2023, we expect to see an improvement in top line revenue growth, partially driven by the integration of OPIS and CMA, but also by continued digital gains across the company, albeit much will dependent on macro conditions and the volatility of foreign currencies. We expect CapEx to be modestly higher in fiscal 2023 and anticipate strong levels of free cash flow.  For the upcoming quarter, I would like to discuss a few things. We expect cost impacts from continued supply chain and inflationary pressures, together with wage inflation challenges, to continue. We will take necessary action to address those pressures, including pricing adjustments, together with our ongoing focus on cost management. Visibility on advertising remains limited across the businesses, and we continue to expect foreign exchange headwinds given the current spot rate for the Australian dollar and pound sterling compared to the prior year.  Looking at each of our segments at Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for July rose 7%. Please refer to REA for a more specific outlook commentary. As Robert mentioned, across the industry in the U.S., inventory and active listings improved in June as we begin to cycle into more normalized year-over-year comparisons. We still assume lead volumes at Move will be challenged in the short term, and we'll look to mitigate that through yield optimization, new or enhanced products as well as balancing ongoing investment with cost discipline.  In Subscription Video Services, we remain pleased with the performance of the streaming products and the ongoing focus on broadcast ARPU and churn as we continue to migrate customers from cable. We look forward to the launch of House of the Dragon on Binge later this month, which we will expect will drive an improvement in net subscriber additions, and we continue to expect to see stability in earnings in local currency across the year.  At Dow Jones, we remain focused on the integration of OPIS and CMA. We expect the rate of investment in the first quarter to be higher than the prior year as we continue to invest to drive consumer subscriptions and enhance our PIB offerings. As a reminder, over 75% of Dow Jones revenues are recurring or subscription-based, the majority digital, with a strong margin, and we feel confident of its growth trajectory leading into 2023.  In Book Publishing, supply chain and inflationary pressures continue to persist. We look to capitalize on our global English language rights for J.R.R. Tolkien's work in our back list as we look forward to the release of The Rings of Power on Amazon Prime in early September.  At News Media, we still expect higher content licensing revenue from our platform deals as we implement elements of the broader Google partnership, such as subscribed with Google and also benefit from our expanded Apple relationship. We expect incremental costs in relation to product investments across the businesses, including Talk TV and our other digital initiatives, together with pressure on newsprint prices. As a reminder, we have recently raised cover prices in both the U.K. and Australia this calendar year.  With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Entcho Raykovski with Credit Suisse.\nEntcho Raykovski: Rob, Susan, it's Entcho here. I've got a question in relation to Move, particularly given those comments you've made around the next conversation. I'm just conscious that Zero have guided to declines in their IMP revenues in the double digits into the September quarter. It sounds like you are more positive given the yield improvements that you've mentioned. I guess, can you expand on whether you're likely to see in your revenue growth into the next quarter, notwithstanding some of the challenges in the macro environment?\nRobert Thomson: Entcho, Robert here. Look, the U.S. property market is replete with contradictions. Obviously, mortgage rates have risen. But by historical standards, they are relatively low and have been hovering around 5% in recent days. Obviously, also, there are ways to get lower rates than that in the shorter term. Our price increases have abated in much of the U.S., meaning internal increases, which patently strained affordability. And I mentioned earlier, our active inventory in June was actually up 19% year-on-year. So the more listings, the more opportunities for our teams. And having properties on the market for longer is not a problem, but generally a plus. It really doesn't suit us if a house is sold in 4 minutes or, frankly, takes 4 years, somewhere in between is ideal. So it's a volatile market, certainly, but opportunity abounds.\nOperator: Next, we move on to Kane Hannan with Goldman Sachs.\nKane Hannan: Just on the book segment and The Lord of the Rings series, next year. I mean I imagine that's going to drive a pretty strong revenue outcome. Can you talk a bit about how we should think about that from an EBITDA perspective? I suppose if there's any other key titles in the pipeline for next year that we should be thinking about?\nRobert Thomson: Kane, obviously, The Lord of the Rings series or the series based on The Lord of the Rings is going to have a profound impact on HarperCollins' performance, and the related publicity will no doubt stimulate sales. We're not in a position to give you an accurate forecast for the future, but it is fair to say it's going to be a significant moment for HarperCollins in coming months.\nSusan Panuccio: And I think the only other thing that I could add to that, Kane, is that, obviously, given it's going to be back list, we typically have higher margins on the back list than what we would see in the first year for front list titles.\nOperator: Next, we move on to Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.\nCraig Huber: Just a quick comment there. Robert, I've been listening to you for 9 years. I don't think I've ever heard you so excited about your business. Maybe you had a few cups of coffee, but you sounded very excited. Kidding there, but like -- my question for you is costs for you or Susan. As you think across your portfolio, if the environment does get worse here in the coming quarters, do you feel you have a room to take out costs out of your various segments? And I guess, more importantly, do you feel -- are you willing to take out cost investment spending here if the environment gets materially worse across your segments?\nSusan Panuccio: I might take that one, Craig. So look, obviously, if our revenue grows, we expect cost to increase given the variable nature of some of our businesses. And we are expecting supply chain and inflationary pressures most notably in manufacturing at HarperCollins and on newsprint prices at the mastheads together with wage inflation. Our business units are so far more in tune with the levers that they can use having successfully navigated the past couple of years. We do have a healthy pipeline of ongoing cost-saving initiatives, which gives us confidence that we can continue to take our cost to help mitigate some of those macro challenges.\nOperator: Next, we'll move on to Alan Gould with Loop Capital.\nAlan Gould: Robert, I just wondering if you can give us a little more insight on what's happening with these platform deals with Facebook, which supposedly is resisting paying for news going forward. And what the implications would be in Australia, given the recent laws that have been implemented there?\nRobert Thomson: Alan, I think it's fair to say we've entered a new Facebook phase. We have a 3-year agreement with Facebook in Australia. But beyond that, we have open discussions with Facebook on the role of professional content in areas from sport video to the Metaverse. Just one brief diversion. To be fair, some of the political pressures on Facebook to sensor content are rather perverse. The definition of disinformation or misinformation is often political and disingenuous. So some sympathy for them in that instance.  But more broadly, look, we set out with a clear aim of redefining the value of news content, and that value surely has been to be defined permanently and positively. And that's definitely to the benefit of journalists and communities around the world. We have extended our significant Apple deal, thanks to Tim Manet, who both firmly believe in news. And our engagement with Google is creative and purposeful, thanks to Sundar and his team. We are, however, still waiting patiently for commission checks from other publishers around the world.\nOperator: And we move on to Darren Leung with Macquarie.\nDarren Leung: Good performance in Risk & Compliance, 19% growth in the quarter. Can you give us a feel if this is acquisition impact? And if so, what is it excluding the acquisitions, please?\nSusan Panuccio: No, there's no acquisitions in Risk & Compliance basically within the period segment, but not Risk & Compliance.\nOperator: Next, move on to Brian Han, Morningstar.\nBrian Han: So strategic moves that you guys would like to do with REA, but cannot do due to the fact that you don't own 100% of it? And Susan, what is the revenue base of Risk & Compliance and now within Dow Jones?\nRobert Thomson: Brian, I think I missed the start of your question, but I presume it was about the structure of digital real estate. Is that right?\nBrian Han: Yes. What would you like to do with REA, but you cannot do it because you don't own 100% of it?\nRobert Thomson: Look, we're very proud of REA's performance. I would leave it to Owen and the team here to give you specifics. And we're passionate generally about digital property. As you know, there's real cooperation between and among the teams. And we do see a confluence in a broader market trends with more emphasis on providing sell-side solutions in the U.S. market, which is the strengths characteristically the Australian market, where we provide premium solutions for agents. More broadly, for News Corp, we're constantly reviewing the structure of the company. We're institutionally introspective and certainly never complacent self-satisfied or smug.\nSusan Panuccio: And Brian, just in relation to the number for Risk & Compliance, the annual revenue was $225 million for '22, 2020, excluding week 53, so 18% growth in the full year, and we had a 19% growth in Q4.\nOperator: Next, we'll move on to David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.\nJohn Cardoso: This is actually John on for David. Just touching on the U.S. real estate market again. But given the current cross-currents of a stabilizing market against a weakening macro backdrop, how should we think about the performance of the different product offerings that move, particularly as it relates to some of the more referral-based services versus the more lead-heavy ones?\nRobert Thomson: Well, John, the most important aspect for us is listings the number of leads and then our ability through the traditional lead model as well as the referral model to maximize the value of each of those leads. And then as I mentioned earlier on, mortgages, those leads now have more value because the refi market has imploded and the origination market has increased and relatively important. So what we've created with the team at Realtor is an ability to maximize returns on any particular lead. And so that model will be something that provides us robust revenues regardless of a certain amount of volatility, volatility indeed, that may be efficacious for the market.\nSusan Panuccio: And John, maybe I can just add to that as well. Given some of the headwinds that we face within the core legion with volumes down, we have had success in driving increased revenue given higher yield. And we've also recently launched the hybrid product, Market VIP, which we're starting to see growth, and that's getting traction as well. So that's helping to mitigate some further headwind.\nRobert Thomson: And one further point, John, even ad sales at Realtor.com have become more precise, more focused, taking the advantage of our yield lessons elsewhere in our media properties, and ads were up 11% at Realtor.com last year.\nOperator: And we have no further questions. So I would like to turn the conference back over to Mike Florin for any additional closing remarks.\nMichael Florin: Great. Thank you, Sara. Thank you all for participating today. Have a great day, and we look forward to speaking with you in the near future. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude today's teleconference. We do appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Susan Panuccio",
            "content": "Thank you, Robert. Fiscal 2022 was another record year for News Corp. We have taken significant steps over the years to reshape and strengthen the portfolio, reduce fixed costs, transition to become more digital and generate incremental high-margin revenues. I will come back to some thoughts about our fiscal 2023 outlook. But suffice to say that News Corp is well positioned as we move into fiscal 2023, given the strength of our asset mix and balance sheet and the continued diversification of our revenue base.  Fiscal 2022 fourth quarter total revenues were almost $2.7 billion, up 7%. The fourth quarter includes an extra week, which positively impacted revenues by $110 million. That impact was more than offset by foreign exchange headwinds of $139 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, fourth Quarter adjusted revenues grew 9% compared to the prior year, including the extra week. Total segment EBITDA was $315 million, up 50% versus the prior year, primarily due to higher overall revenues and lower costs in the Other segment, partially offset by higher costs from recent acquisitions and the negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The current quarter results include a onetime $20 million legal settlement charge for Insignia.  Adjusted EBITDA grew a healthy 34% versus the prior period. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.19 compared to a loss of $0.02 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.37 in the quarter, compared to $0.16 in the prior year. Our free cash flow generation remains strong and remains a key area of focus.  Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segment for the fourth quarter, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $443 million, an increase of 7%, compared to 74% revenue growth in the prior year. The results include a negative impact of $22 million from a valuation adjustment of future trail commissions at REA's financial services business and a negative impact of $20 million or 5% from foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by the $21 million contribution from Mortgage Choice and the benefit from the extra week, which added $14 million to Move's revenues. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues increased 7%, which does not exclude the benefit from the extra week. Segment EBITDA declined 11% to $121 million, driven by the $14 million negative impact at REA related to the revaluation of trail commissions and an $8 million or 6% negative impact related to currency headwinds as well as higher employee costs at both REA and Move. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 1%.  Move's revenues were $193 million, up 4% following 68% growth in the prior year. For the quarter, real estate revenues grew 3% and accounted for 84% of total revenues. Price optimization within the core lead gen business, higher penetration of our hybrid offering market VIP and continued home price appreciation, coupled with higher advertising revenues, helped to offset the impact from lower lead volumes and transaction volumes. Move's revenues also benefited by $40 million from the extra week. Referral offerings accounted for approximately 31% of total revenues, up from 30% last year. Based on our internal metrics, Realtor's average monthly unique users were $93 million in the fourth quarter. Lead volumes in the quarter fell 39% compared to the prior year, impacted by continued lack of supply and home price appreciation as well as the recent rising mortgage rates. Home prices remain high, growing in mid-teens in June, underscoring the continued supply and demand imbalance.  During the quarter, Move acquired Up Nest advancing realtor seller and listing agent strategy and continue to make investments in rentals and new homes as they build out those adjacencies. In the last 2 years, Realtor's focus was not only to take advantage of the strong market dynamics during the pandemic, but also to position itself for long-term growth while focusing on core competencies and improving the product to deliver deeper and richer information for consumers and customers. This is evidenced by the shift to the data-rich referral base model with the integration of Opcity, which enabled the launch and expansion of Market VIP, the hybrid product, and sell a marketplace to allow customers to explore seller leads without risking own capital to enter buying. These investments, together with the UpNest acquisition have allowed us to expand our scale compared to 2 years ago and capture other elements of the transaction life cycle.  REA had another strong quarter, with revenues rising 10% year-on-year on a reported basis to $250 million as growth in residential depth revenues and the contribution from the Mortgage Choice acquisition more than offset the negative impacts from currency fluctuations and the revaluation of trail commissions. REA continued to benefit from the favorable market backdrop, which saw Australian residential new buy listings rise 2% despite comparing against 54% growth in listing volumes in the prior year and expected uncertainty around the federal election in May. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more detail.  Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $524 million, sequentially higher than the third quarter and down approximately 3% compared to the prior year on a reported basis due to foreign currency headwinds. Importantly, on an adjusted basis, revenues rose 4%, accelerating from the prior quarter rate of 1%. Streaming revenues accounted for 23% of circulation and subscription revenues versus 16% in the prior year and more than offset broadcast revenue decline this quarter. We believe this is a key inflection point for the business and has helped underpin the recent stability in Foxtel Group's revenue. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group reached over 4.4 million at quarter end, up 13% year-over-year. Total subscribers, including trial has reached over $4.5 million. Total paid streaming subscribers reached 2.7 million, increasing 34% versus the prior year and adding 114,000 sequentially, with streaming subscribers now representing 61% of Foxtel's total paid subscriber base.  Kayo benefited from strong winter sports content, very high retention from the initial repricing of the legacy Live Pass customers and the successful implementation of the price rise in May. Kayo paying subscribers reached almost 1.3 million, up nearly 23% year-over-year. Binge paying subscribers grew 63% year-over-year to 1.2 million subscribers, which is relatively stable with the third quarter as net adds were impacted by the timing of content availability and the record adds in the third quarter. In July, we announced a AUD 2 price rise for Binge standard offering. Foxtel ended the quarter with approximately 1.5 million residential broadcast subscribers, down 10% year-over-year, with the rate of decline modestly improving from the third quarter rate. Foxtel continues to focus on managing broadcast churn, which reduced by over 3 percentage points year-over-year in the quarter to 13.8%, even though cable customers are being actively migrated to the iQ5. This reflects 11 consecutive months of year-over-year churn reduction. The focus on retaining high-value subscribers for broadcast ARPU steadily rise by 2% to AUD 83 segment EBITDA in the quarter of $81 million rose 23% versus the prior year and 32% on an adjusted basis. Foxtel continues to exhibit healthy cash generation and use existing facilities to pay its AUD 306 million of July USPP maturities.  For the full year, the business showed stability in revenue and segment EBITDA. And as Robert mentioned, full year adjusted revenues improved for the first time in 5 years, which is a great result for the business given the challenges of recent years. As expected, total costs were relatively stable in local currency.  Moving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones continued its strong performance in the fourth quarter with revenues of $565 million, up 26% compared to the prior year, with digital revenues accounting for 76% of total revenues this quarter, up 4 percentage points from last year. Results include a full quarter from the OPIS acquisition and 1 month from the Chemical Market Analytics acquisition, which closed in early June. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose an impressive 16%, with the extra week contributing $40 million.  Circulation revenues grew 17%, reflecting an additional $17 million for the extra week as well as strong volume gains in digital-only subscriptions. Total Dow Jones digital-only subscriptions were over 4 million, up 14%, including 88,000 net adds in the fourth quarter. Professional information business revenues rose 47% and accounted for 32% of segment revenues, driven by recent acquisitions and growth across all product lines, partly due to $14 million of additional revenues from the extra week.

No, there's no acquisitions in Risk & Compliance basically within the period segment, but not Risk & Compliance. And Brian, just in relation to the number for Risk & Compliance, the annual revenue was $225 million for '22, 2020, excluding week 53, so 18% growth in the full year, and we had a 19% growth in Q4. And John, maybe I can just add to that as well. Given some of the headwinds that we face within the core legion with volumes down, we have had success in driving increased revenue given higher yield. And we've also recently launched the hybrid product, Market VIP, which we're starting to see growth, and that's getting traction as well. So that's helping to mitigate some further headwind."

            "content": "Thank you, Mike. The overuse of superlatives really is unbecoming. But the past quarter and the full year have created so many unprecedented records that reflect well on all of News Corp, and we believe have created a platform for future performance and enduring returns for our investors. These accomplishments, which necessarily demand the use of superlatives, follow intense digital transformation by the businesses and focused acquisitions that we expect will provide increased revenue and healthy profits far into the future.  Profitability for the full year rose 31% to a record $1.67 billion, and that followed a 26% surge in the previous year, which itself was a record. Revenues rose a robust 11% despite incipient economic uncertainty and unfavorable ForEx fluctuations that outweighed the benefit of an extra week. In total, the favorable results were reflected in our reported EPS of $1.05, compared to $0.56 in the prior year.  It is worth noting that we saw enhanced success in each and every business segment last year, and we are confident of our prospects in fiscal 2023. Our core pillars, Dow Jones, Digital Real Estate Services and Book Publishing, all notched record results that exceeded the sterling performance of the previous fiscal year when new benchmarks were set across most of the company. And it's worth noting that our net cash from operating activities was a record $1.35 billion, topping the previous year's record of $1.24 billion. That extra cash has enabled us to return capital to shareholders and to be pointedly poised for opportunistic investments of the kind that have already transformed the Dow Jones business, making it more digital, more premium and more profitable.  The successful journey of our media properties is unlike any in the world, as has been the principal pursuit of change in terms of trade with the big digital players. We believe the profoundly positive commercial and social impact of those changes will be felt for many years to come. None of that would have been possible without a strong corporate culture created by and curated by Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, the support of an engaged enlightened Board and passionate, committed and creative employees around the world.  So we have a steady balance sheet, potent cash generation, profitable and growing businesses and the resources to take advantage of emerging opportunities. That muscularity was also reflected in the past year by the termination of our shareholder rights plan, or as it is referred to colloquially, the poison pill. Over the past 8 years, our reported revenue has grown by $1.8 billion, even though our advertising revenue, print newspaper dependent as it was, declined by $2.2 billion. That is a $4 billion swing. Over the same period, our total segment EBITDA has more than doubled, and our free cash flow available has increased by over 80%. Dow  Jones has prospered, more than doubling its segment EBITDA to $433 million in just the past 3 years. Our faith in its prospects has been shown by the acquisitions of Investor's Business Daily, OPIS and Base Chemicals, all of which we expect will contribute to revenue and profitability in the years ahead. Meanwhile, Digital Real Estate Services has expanded rapidly from 5% of our revenues in 2014 to 17% in fiscal '22. To be precise, we have seen growth in every quarter of this past year despite the recent increases in interest rates and the home supply challenges. We are confident that digital runway for real estate is long and lucrative.  It is certainly worth recognizing that News Corp's profits have expanded prodigiously compared to 8 years ago, rising from a reported $770 million in total segment EBITDA to nearly $1.7 billion this year. Our teams have made this successful journey despite the upheaval in the advertising market, despite the significant challenges to print media and despite the pandemic. We are more digital, more mobile, more global, acutely cost conscious and astutely tracking trends, in the quest for more revenues, increased profitability and enhanced returns for our investors.  To be specific about the segments, Dow Jones is already seeing the tangible benefits of OPIS and Base Chemicals, which we have rebranded Chemical Market Analytics, or CMA, to the -- These 2 businesses complement each other, and they certainly complement Dow Jones. We were fortunate to acquire them at a favorable price as their sale was required by regulators for approval of the S&P Global-IHS Markit merger. We thank those companies and the regulators for the opportunity bequest to us.  Not only are OPIS and CMA is starting to benefit us financially, but they have contributed to the depth and breadth of Dow Jones' overall expertise in commodities, in traditional fuel sources, in essential chemical products and in renewables and more. The analysis and analytics fit perfectly into our professional information business, where we have seen sustained growth, particularly from risk and compliance, which reported an 18% surge in full year annual revenues, with the fourth quarter seeing another double-digit increase. That means we have reported 28, that is correct, 28 successive quarters of double-digit growth.  Advertising at Dow Jones remained strong in the fourth quarter and was a significant contributor to the segment throughout the year. Total advertising at Dow Jones achieved year-over-year growth of 20% for the full year, the highest on record. Dow Jones also made progress in expanding its high-yielding subscriber base, which rose 9% to almost 4.9 million, including over 4 million digital-only subscribers. As a point of comparison, digital advertising at Dow Jones rose 16% in the most recent quarter, while it shrank, it contracted, it diminished at the New York Times. In what was a resounding performance for News Corp, Dow Jones really is worthy of note. Dow Jones profitability saw 54% in the quarter to $106 million. And as noted earlier, for the year, segment EBITDA was $433 million, up 30%, while revenues rose to over $2 billion, an 18% increase.  The imperative at Dow Jones is to provide a premium service and premium value to a premium audience and is remembering that this is a premium audience at scale, with more than 100 million visitors each month to Dow Jones sites and thousands of the world's largest companies as enterprise clients. Our task, our opportunity is to offer more of the information, the intelligence demanded by discerning professionals. These are fertile fields for the future.  At Digital Real Estate Services, revenues for the full year surged 25% to more than $1.7 billion, while segment EBITDA grew 12% to $574 million as we continue to build brands and products for future success. In Australia, REA continued its expansion into intelligent adjacencies, most notably with the Mortgage Choice acquisition, and residential listing volume improved by 11% in fiscal '22 to the highest level since 2016. We also now have the #1 digital property company in India in terms of audience share with Housing.com expanding its lead in an expanding market. Monthly visitors rose in June by 52% to $15.7 million.  In the U.S., Move, operator of realtor.com, reported revenue growth for the year of 11% while we invested in expanding our expertise in rentals and acquired uplist, an agent marketplace that focuses on monetizing seller leads. The broader thing is that we see a confluence of trends in the U.S. and Australian marketplaces. The U.S. market has traditionally derived revenue from buyer leads, but the future will bring opportunity to harvest seller revenue, which is the basis for REA's emphatic success in Australia.  As for the U.S. housing market, obviously, the hiking of interest rates has influenced market trends. For example, mortgage refinancing has imploded, which plays to our strength as a source of mortgage origination leads, which mortgage companies were ignoring somewhat because it was easier to refinance an existing an own customer. The rate of price increases that put homes out of reach is generally expected to continue to decline, and inventories have at last started to improve, with active inventory in June up 19% year-over-year according to Realtor.com. News Media, which in recent years has faced severe challenges, did particularly well, both in Q4 and throughout the fiscal year. To be precise, News Media was the single largest contributor to profit improvement across the company this fiscal year. Let's be candid. This spectacular result came as many other newspaper companies around the world struggled and is a true tribute to the efforts of our executives and teams in Australia, the U.K. and the U.S.  In fiscal 2022, revenues were up 10%, and the segment delivered $217 million of segment EBITDA, expanding 317% year-over-year. I should repeat that stunning number for clarity, 317%. At News UK, the Sun reported a historic shift with digital advertising outpacing print in fiscal '22 and as its online audience surged 33% in Q4 to 165 million monthly average uniques globally, including 173% growth for the sun.com, driven by the successful launch of the Sun U.S. Overall, News UK, thanks to Rebecca Brooks and her team, increased its profit contribution by $54 million.  News Corp Australia under Michael Miller and his team increased its profit contribution by $109 million, its highest since separation, as digital subscribers to News Corp Australia properties rose by 12% to $964,000, and advertising revenues remain robust. The New York Post posted a historic result. It formally reported a profit, possibly the first since Alexander Hamilton founded the paper, and we are now on a pathway to increasing profit contribution. The Post has distinguished itself with brave journalism that has seen it so far above the media mediocrity. That is a tribute to the intrepid editor, Keith Paul, his journalists and to Sean Giancola, the Chief Executive, and all on the team. We also transitioned from the Bronx printing site and are working towards completion of that facility sale.  At Subscription Video Services, the Foxtel Group's renaissance continued with adjusted revenues, which excludes currency impact, rising 4% in the fourth quarter, while adjusted segment EBITDA rose 32% in the fourth quarter. And importantly, excluding currency, full year revenues for the segment rose for the first time in 5 years. Again, the Foxtel Group is a company transformed and one generating record metrics. Total streaming subscribers at the end of the fiscal year soared 31% from a year ago to $2.8 million, while broadcast churn fell to 13.8% in the fourth quarter, sharply lower than the prior year.  Our sports streaming service, Kayo, is particularly successful with ARPU rising partially attributable to the recent price increase and given the quality of our teams, productions and the quantity of quality sports. HarperCollins grew full year revenue and segment EBITDA despite higher freight and manufacturing costs and a challenging prior year comparison given that the pandemic created a captive audience and record revenues in many countries. We can clearly see the virtue of acquiring Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Books & Media as the value of that price list back list is being realized. That efficacy should be obvious in coming months as HMH includes the U.S. rights to the Lord of the Rings collection, and we have seen increased orders ahead of the Rings of Power series on Amazon Prime, scheduled to be launched next month.  Speaking of superlatives, we have the best-selling book in the U.S. with the new Daniel Silver novel, Portrait of an Unknown Woman, and we are pleased by the lingering melody of Where the crawdads Sing, the first movie that was just released in partnership with our friends at Sony Pictures.  The News Corporation of 9 years ago is not the News Corporation of now. The provenance and the principle endure, but the business is fundamentally transformed. It is vastly more profitable and with the potential for even greater growth. Our teams are rightly proud of the way they have influenced the digital landscape, changing the terms of trade for media businesses, bringing clarity to an opaque advertising market and increasing transparency to hit the 2 uncountable algorithms.  The commercial changes are integral to our ongoing success, but the social consequences are also profound and enduring. Almost a decade after our reincarnation, thanks to the efforts of our employees and the faith of our investors, News Corp is set fair for the future.  Our CFO, Susan Panuccio, will now provide a concise account of what has transpired and a glimpse of the shining light that is the future. Entcho, Robert here. Look, the U.S. property market is replete with contradictions. Obviously, mortgage rates have risen. But by historical standards, they are relatively low and have been hovering around 5% in recent days. Obviously, also, there are ways to get lower rates than that in the shorter term. Our price increases have abated in much of the U.S., meaning internal increases, which patently strained affordability. And I mentioned earlier, our active inventory in June was actually up 19% year-on-year. So the more listings, the more opportunities for our teams. And having properties on the market for longer is not a problem, but generally a plus. It really doesn't suit us if a house is sold in 4 minutes or, frankly, takes 4 years, somewhere in between is ideal. So it's a volatile market, certainly, but opportunity abounds. Kane, obviously, The Lord of the Rings series or the series based on The Lord of the Rings is going to have a profound impact on HarperCollins' performance, and the related publicity will no doubt stimulate sales. We're not in a position to give you an accurate forecast for the future, but it is fair to say it's going to be a significant moment for HarperCollins in coming months. Alan, I think it's fair to say we've entered a new Facebook phase. We have a 3-year agreement with Facebook in Australia. But beyond that, we have open discussions with Facebook on the role of professional content in areas from sport video to the Metaverse. Just one brief diversion. To be fair, some of the political pressures on Facebook to sensor content are rather perverse. The definition of disinformation or misinformation is often political and disingenuous. So some sympathy for them in that instance.  But more broadly, look, we set out with a clear aim of redefining the value of news content, and that value surely has been to be defined permanently and positively. And that's definitely to the benefit of journalists and communities around the world. We have extended our significant Apple deal, thanks to Tim Manet, who both firmly believe in news. And our engagement with Google is creative and purposeful, thanks to Sundar and his team. We are, however, still waiting patiently for commission checks from other publishers around the world. Brian, I think I missed the start of your question, but I presume it was about the structure of digital real estate. Is that right? Look, we're very proud of REA's performance. I would leave it to Owen and the team here to give you specifics. And we're passionate generally about digital property. As you know, there's real cooperation between and among the teams. And we do see a confluence in a broader market trends with more emphasis on providing sell-side solutions in the U.S. market, which is the strengths characteristically the Australian market, where we provide premium solutions for agents. More broadly, for News Corp, we're constantly reviewing the structure of the company. We're institutionally introspective and certainly never complacent self-satisfied or smug. Well, John, the most important aspect for us is listings the number of leads and then our ability through the traditional lead model as well as the referral model to maximize the value of each of those leads. And then as I mentioned earlier on, mortgages, those leads now have more value because the refi market has imploded and the origination market has increased and relatively important. So what we've created with the team at Realtor is an ability to maximize returns on any particular lead. And so that model will be something that provides us robust revenues regardless of a certain amount of volatility, volatility indeed, that may be efficacious for the market. And one further point, John, even ad sales at Realtor.com have become more precise, more focused, taking the advantage of our yield lessons elsewhere in our media properties, and ads were up 11% at Realtor.com last year."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the News Corp 3Q Fiscal 2022 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. Media will be on a listen-only basis. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mike Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMike Florin : Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's fiscal third quarter 2022 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We will open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release. With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\nRobert Thomson: Thank you, Mike. I'm delighted to report that revenues and profitability were at a new record for the third quarter, since the company's rebirth in 2013, building comprehensively on the momentum of our record performance in preceding quarters News Corp delivered $2.5 billion of revenues up 7%, despite the vicissitudes of currency volatility. While profitability improved by 20% and that was despite the one time transaction costs for our Opus acquisition. The tangible benefits to revenue and profitability of that transaction should be obvious in coming quarters. To put the results in a broader context, we attained more in profitability at over $1.3 billion through the first three quarters of fiscal 2022 than we did in any entire fiscal year, since our rebirth in 2013. And there is certainly more to come in the fourth quarter. Given the impact of the pandemic and not so transitional inflation, both exogenous in the extreme, these sterling results are testament to the strength of the company's culture created and curated by Rupert and Locklin Murdoch and the commitment, creativity, and passion of all our employees. We are investing as well as returning capital to shareholders and have focused that investment on bolstering our growth pillars. The results of that productive investment should be felt for years to come. Our core product suite has expanded as has our reach, and we expect that auspicious combination will [indiscernible] our long-term growth. Following a strong fiscal 2021 and first half of fiscal 2022 Dow Jones continued to power ahead with revenues and segment EBITDA both sharply rising. Though the latter was impacted by the one-time costs related to the Opus transaction. Segment EBITDA was up 7% even including the Opus costs, adjusted segment EBITDA actually rose 16%. Opus, along with Base Chemicals, which we expect will close by the end of next month, represent an exciting opportunity for Dow Jones, extending the depth and reach of our news and information capabilities in the commodities sector. The appetite for data, analysis and insight in the energy, renewables, chemicals and related fields is strong and growing. And we believe Dow Jones is ideally positioned to capitalize for many years to come. Not only did we acquire Opus at a rather favorable price, but the recent surge in global commodity prices highlights the profound importance of this sector for Dow Jones. The need for trusted and accurate information has never been more imperative. And we expect to capitalize on that opportunity. Opus has healthy subscriber growth with robust margins and extremely high retention rates. Given the lack of overlap between the customer basis of Dow Jones and Opus, we see very strong cross-sell and upsell potential using the vast WSJ, IBD and MarketWatch audiences as a premium pool for customer leads. Subscriber growth at Dow Jones remain robust with WSJ digital only subscribers crossing three million this quarter expanding at a robust 16% rate. Digital only subscriptions across all Dow Jones consumer sites increased by 19%, which also reflects the consolidation of IBD and early success in new bundled offerings. Digital advertising burgeon 21%, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of double digit percent growth. Notably, print advertising has actually expanded for four consecutive quarters in double digits. While the conflict in Ukraine had a short term impact on advertising, given that certain advertisers did not want juxtaposition with war coverage, overall trends remain favorable. The imposition of sanctions and expansion of watchlists, underscore the value of the Dow Jones Risk & Compliance business, which continued its unbroken streak of rapid growth in Q3, when it recorded the 27th straight quarter of double digit increases. And on Ukraine, we are deeply appreciative of the professionalism of our journalists and their support teams in covering the tragic conflict and bringing understanding to readers around the world.  Our Digital Real Estate services, both revenues and segment EBITDA continue to expand at a healthy rate. Revenues at REA grew a robust 30% following a surge in listing value and also benefited from the integration of mortgage choice, which obviously provides another means of monetizing our valuable leaves. In the U.S., the real estate market is in the midst of flux with historically low inventories and rising interest rates. Home prices generally have continued to rise. There is much variation depending on the location, while rents are increasing at a double digit rate. Affordability and supply, which are obviously related, remain issues for first time buyers who also face an escalation in mortgage rates though by historical standards, rates remain relatively low. The ebb and flow of market forces is not unusual. And we believe the opportunity for realtor.com and News Corp has never been greater as the digitization of the property market continues at pace. And current trends are likely to expedite that evolution. Our product innovation has accelerated. Our scale has increased. And we are in the early days of venturing into relevant adjacencies with large addressable markets. Despite the shifting market conditions, Move posted revenue growth in the third quarter and our aim to be the digital marketplace for consumers and the industries is clearly paying dividends. As our average monthly unique users exceeded 100 million in March. Over the past two years, third quarter revenues of the Digital Real Estate Services segment have increased by 59%, which gives a measure of both the growth and the opportunity. The past two years have been remarkable for book publishing with third quarter revenues rising 5% this year, which means that there has been a 25% increase since the third quarter of fiscal 2020. And this in an industry that some observers had presumed to be mature. We expect sales to continue at significantly higher levels than before the pandemic. Unsurprisingly, EBITDA after the segment was challenged, including by supply chain, cost increases for paper, printing and distribution. We expect these near term disruptions to abate over time. We also expect continuing success from both new releases and our bolstered backlist, which was enhanced by the acquisition of the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Books & Media division. Successful releases included the bestselling memoir by former Attorney General, Bill Barr, One Damn Thing After Another, Red Handed by Peter Schweizer and The Paris Apartment by Lucy Foley. Given the public's abiding appetite for reading HarperCollins is certainly well positioned for future success. We're excited about Finding Me the new book by Viola Davis released late last month. And we anticipate a surge in interest in The Lord of the Rings franchise, for which we now have global English language rights. Given the launch of Amazon's landmark series later this calendar year. It is worth noting that according to Amazon, the teaser trailer for that series broke a global record for the most watched entertainment trailer to debut during the Super Bowl within 24 hours of the trailers release, it had 257 million views. News Media was the biggest contributor to News Corp\u2019s growth in profitability in Q3, with segment EBITDA approximately 388% higher in the quarter. We saw continued strong performance in digital advertising across the segment alongside a notable rebound in print advertising at News UK. News Australia had a strong quarter with substantial improvement in profit contribution, thanks in part to our deals with the tech platforms, our continuing cost discipline and the development of our digital platforms. The New York Post Renaissance continues with its massive audience, strong advertising growth and improved profit contribution. The New York Post digital network now ranks among the top news sites in the U.S. and has grown nearly eight-fold since fiscal 2014, to over 172 million average monthly unique users in the third quarter. News UK also had a healthy profit contribution with significant revenue improvement of The Sun where digital advertising outpaced print. It is also notable that thesun.com, the brand extension of The Sun in the U.S. market increased page views in Q3 by over 260% year-over-year to 500 million with yields significantly improving. Piers Morgan's much anticipated program launched on April 25. And it more than exceeded expectations in reach across the UK, the U.S. and Australia, thanks to the power of our platforms, the pivotal partnership with Fox News and the quality of the programming. Not only does TalkTV plan to be a broad church of diverse views and lively discussion, it offers a new opportunity to leverage our strong brands, talented people, and premium video content in the UK and around the world. In Subscription Video Services, the third quarter saw continued progress in reshaping the Foxtel Group as a growth-oriented subscription business, with continued success in streaming, stable revenues and solid cash generation. Notably Kayo and BINGE, both surged in the quarter and are now reaching record numbers of subscribers, Kayo plans to implement a price increase as it benefits from its scale platform and high-quality production, which is driving record ratings at the start of the season for both the NRL and the AFL. Overall, total paying streaming subs reach nearly 2.6 million up 62%. We remain pleased with Foxtel's turnaround and have a great optimism about its near and long term future. We are continuing to explore all options for Foxtel to maximize its value while watching closely all relevant developments in the financial markets. Through the first three quarters of fiscal year 2022 News Corp is well on track for its most profitable year since separation. Clearly, besting last year's record results. Success is building on success. We will relentlessly continue to drive our performance in the quest for enhanced returns for our investors, complacency, smugness, and hubris are not words in our vocabulary. News Corp is a company transformed more intensely digital, more intelligently global with strong growth in our core markets and much unrealized potential. Macroeconomic challenges affect all businesses, whether that be the supply chain, corrosive inflation or febrile currency markets. But our resilience, adaptability and ingenuity were stress tested by the pandemic and led to record revenues and profits. We understandably are optimistic about the years ahead. For more granularity about our quarterly performance, I now hand you over to the at right [ph] Susan Panuccio.\nSusan Panuccio: Thank you, Robert. Fiscal 2022 third quarter total revenues were approximately $2.5 billion, up 7% reflecting strong growth across our core pillars led by digital real estate services and Dow Jones, which includes benefits from our recent acquisitions and our continuing shift to digital across the company. Total segment EBITDA was $358 million higher than the prior year by 20%. And, as Robert mentioned, marked the highest third quarter total segment EBITDA on records since separation, reflecting our ongoing focus on costs. Those results came despite approximately $15 million of one-time cost related to the Opus transaction, which closed on February the 28 and a $16 million negative impact from currency headwinds. Excluding acquisitions, currency fluctuations, and other items disclosed in the release, adjusted revenues and adjusted total segment EBITDA rose 6% and 25% respectively. Reported EPS were $0.14 compared to $0.13 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter was $0.16 compared to $0.09 in the prior year. Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $416 million an increase of 19% compared to the prior year. The results include the contribution from the acquisition of Mortgage Choice, as well as the negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. On an adjusted basis segment revenues increase 14%. Segment EBITDA rose 17% to $137 million or up 18% on an adjusted basis. Like the second quarter, the driver of segment EBITDA improvement was REA while segment EBITDA contribution from news was flat compared to the prior year. News revenues were $170 million similar to last quarter and up 5% year-over-year, this followed 37% revenue growth in the prior year and is now approximately 44% higher than pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. For the quarter real estate revenues grew 7% and accounted for 85% of total revenues.  Price optimization within the core Lead Gen business, home price appreciation and the resulting flow through to commissions within the referral model together with higher advertising help to offset limited inventory impacting both lead volumes and transaction volumes. Referral offerings accounted for approximately 28% of total revenues up three percentage points compared to the prior year and was the biggest driver of year-over-year revenue growth this quarter. Based on our internal metrics, Realtor\u2019s, average monthly unique users were 95 million in Q3 reaching a 100 million in March, while unique users were down 3% year-over-year, they are still 40% above pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Like the second quarter revenue growth was partially offset by the divestiture of top producer in March, which negatively impacted revenues by approximately two percentage points. Lead volumes in the quarter were sequentially higher than the second quarter. However, they declined 22% compared to the prior year impacted by lower new listings and the recent rise in mortgage rates. The team remains focused on driving audience growth, scaling the core real estate business and investing in and growing adjacent businesses, while keeping a watchful eye on the macro environment. REA had another very strong quarter with revenues rising 30% year-on-year on a reported basis to $246 million, which includes a $38 million contribution from the Mortgage Choice acquisition. REA enjoyed another quarter of favorable trends, including an 11% increase in Australian residential new buy listings with Sydney up 14% and Melbourne up 8%, despite lapping tough comparisons. REA also benefit from higher yields, increased penetration, and favorable product mix. Financial services benefited from an increase in settlements, as well as the integration of Mortgage Choice. And the team continues to innovate with the launch of Premier Plus in March and enhanced offering that delivers additional marketing features to listings. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment, revenues for the quarter were $494 million, relatively stable from the second quarter and down approximately 6% compared to the prior year on a reported basis due to foreign currency headwinds. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 1%, a strong improvement from the second quarter rate of minus 3%. Streaming revenues, now account for 20% of circulation and subscription revenues saw notable acceleration in the growth rate from the second quarter. Total clients paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group reached $4.3 million at quarter end, up 23% year-over-year. Total subscribers, including trialists, were over 4.5 million. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher BINGE and Kayo subscribers, partially offset by the expected decline in residential broadcast subscribers. Commercial subscriptions rose modestly over the prior year helped by the easing of lockdown restrictions. Total streaming subscribers reached over 2.7 million with paying subscribers up 62% from the prior year and 421,000 sequentially to approximately 2.6 million. Streaming subscribers reached 59% of Foxtel's total paid subscriber base. Kayo benefited from the return of the winter sports codes [ph] and saw record early ratings with total subscribers over 1.2 million. 138,000 paid subscribers were added in the quarter, a notable acceleration from the second quarter, taking paid subscribers to over 1.1 million. Similar to Kayo, BINGE had a strong quarter increasing its total subscribers to over 1.3 million. Paying subscribers increased to over 1.2 million, up 135% from the prior year. BINGE added 284,000 paid subscribers in the quarter, the most quarterly additions since the launch of the service in 2020. BINGE's growth continued to be driven by the depth and diversity of its content library and the popularity of new shows such as Love Me, a Binge original, Euphoria, and the Walking Dead. Foxtel ended the quarter with over 1.5 million residential broadcast subscribers, down approximately 11% with the rate of decline stable versus the second quarter. Commercial subscribers ended the quarter 240,000 and improvement both sequentially and year-over-year. Retaining high value customers remains the focus for broadcast subscribers, which has led to churn improvements with churn reducing almost six percentage points year-over-year in the quarter to 14.3%, which reflects eight consecutive months of year-over-year churn reduction. Broadcast ARPU rose by 2% to AUD82. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $79 million was down 13% versus the prior year, driven by higher programming costs, partly due to increased availability of entertainment content as well as modestly high marketing investment in streaming.  Cost control remains a key focus at Foxtel, and we continue to expect full year cost to be flat versus the prior year in local currency, which is helping to underpin strong cash generation. The fourth quarter segment EBITDA will face more favorable prior year comparisons. Moving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones continued its strong performance in the quarter with revenues of $487 million, up 16% compared to the prior year with digital revenues accounting for 76% of total revenues this quarter, up two percentage points from last year.  Results for the quarter include IBD and one month of the recently acquired Opus. Circulation and subscription revenues increased 15%, including 16% circulation revenue growth, primarily reflecting the acquisition of IBD and continued strong volume gains in digital-only subscriptions. Digital-only net ads at Dow Jones were 167,000 subscribers, including 118,000 at the Wall Street Journal, the highest quarterly additions this fiscal year. Professional information business revenues rose 13% and accounted for 29% of revenues.  Revenue growth from Risk & Compliance increased 12%, despite a 3% negative foreign exchange impact driven by the higher entry rate at the beginning of the year and strong growth across the Americas, Europe and Asia. Opus accounted for approximately $10 million of revenues in the quarter. As a reminder, the business did $129 million of revenues in its last full year with very strong margins and with revenues almost all recurring and digital. Advertising revenues, which accounted for 21% of revenues this quarter, remained very strong, growing 20% to a $102 million, despite difficult prior year comparisons. Digital advertising revenues rose 21% in the quarter on top of 30% growth in the third quarter of the prior year and accounted for 62% of total advertising revenues. We continue to see strong yield improvement led by direct display and saw particular strength in the finance and technology categories. Print advertising continued to surprise on the upside with 18% growth year-over-year, partly due to easy prior year compares, but also due to strength in the technology category. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 7% to $88 million following growth of 61% in the third quarter of the prior year. As mentioned earlier, included in the quarter is approximately $15 million of one time transaction costs related to the Opus acquisition. Excluding the contribution from IBD and Opus currency fluctuations and other items disclosed in the release adjusted revenues and adjusted segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 9% and 16% respectively. Over the last few weeks, we have received questions from investors about our exposure to the war in Ukraine. Across the company, our exposure to the region is at Dow Jones, the region accounts for a de minimis amount of Dow Jones' gross revenues, almost entirely in [indiscernible]. And so far, the impact from close accounts and/or canceled contract is immaterial. We are also beginning to see opportunities in risk and compliance emerge due to increased sanctions and regulatory requirements. At Book Publishing, HarperCollins posted 5% revenue growth to $515 million and segment EBITDA fell 16% to $67 million. However, consumption levels continue to remain materially above pre-pandemic levels. Current quarter results were impacted by the ongoing global supply chain and inflation new pressures on freight and manufacturing cost as well as very difficult comparisons with the prior year, which benefited from a higher back list performance driven by The Bridgerton Series by Julia Quinn. The Bridgerton Series still performed well this quarter, but revenue contribution was down approximately $14 million versus the prior year. As flagged during our last earnings call, we saw an increase in manufacturing costs, partly due to supply chain issues, including higher inbound international freight and fuel prices. Digital sales declined 6% this quarter and accounted for 23% of consumer sales, which was almost entirely explained by the lower Bridgerton sales, which did particularly well in the ebook format last year, and also contributed to the strong margin performance in the prior year. HMH continued to perform according to plan. For the quarter, HMH contributed $35 million in revenues and $3 million in segment EBITDA and remains on track to deliver $20 million in annualized cost synergies. Turning to News Media, the momentum in this segment continued during the quarter revenues were $580 million up 5% versus the prior year, which included $25 million or approximately five percentage points of negative impact due to currency headwinds. The underlying growth rate in local currency was similar to the second quarter. We again saw improvement in advertising as well as strong growth in circulation and subscription revenues, benefited by the contribution from our recent content licensing revenues. Within the segment revenues at NewsCorp Australia and News UK increased 2% and 4% respectively. Wireless Group and the New York Post also continue to show strong top line growth. Adjusted revenues for the segment increased 10% compared to the prior year. Circulation and subscription revenues rose 5% benefiting from strong digital subscriber growth, incremental revenues from the platform agreements and cover price increases. Currency headwinds, negatively impacted circulation and subscription revenues by $12 million or four percentage points. Advertising revenues increase 9% compared to the prior year with strength in digital across all our key markets. Most notably at The Sun, which more than double digital advertising revenues versus the prior year. Currency negatively impacted advertising revenues by $10 million or five percentage points. Segment EBITDA of $39 million increased $31 million compared to the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues. Margins improved to almost 7% from 1% last year. Results were partially impacted by hiring investment related to TalkTV and marketing support for new digital product offerings at NewsCorp Australia. I would now like to talk about some themes for the upcoming quarter. We remain encouraged with our strong year-to-date results and that we have already delivered record profitability since separation for the company at the end of Q3. But we are clearly mindful of the lack of visibility from the ongoing impacts of the pandemic, the broader macroeconomic impacts from the war in Ukraine and the cost impacts from continued supply chain and inflationary pressures, particularly in book publishing and our [indiscernible], together with wage inflation and talent retention across the company. We expect these challenges to continue in the short term. At Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for April declined, 8% impacted by the timing of the Easter and ANZAC Day holidays. REA anticipates growth rates to slow as it cycles strong prior period listing volumes, which grew 54% in the fourth quarter of last year had potential impacts around the upcoming federal election in May. Please refer to REA for more specific outlook commentary. At Move, despite tougher comparisons and the macro environment, we continue to see strong yields. We expect to continue to reinvest in Move, as we drive the core business and expand into relevant adjacencies, particularly in new homes and rentals. Similar to last year, we expect investments in the second half. In Subscription Video Services, we remain pleased with the performance of the streaming products and the ongoing focus on broadcast ARPU and churn. As mentioned earlier, we expect full year costs in local currency to be relatively flat versus the prior year. And we expect improvement in profitability in the fourth quarter against the prior year. At Dow Jones, overall revenue trends across the business remains strong. We do expect the rate of advertising growth to be impacted next quarter, by a more difficult prior year comparison, which saw advertising grow by 45%. Excluding the impact from acquisitions, we expect the rate of cost growth to be higher than the third quarter as we continue to invest to drive consumer subscriptions and enhance our Professional Information Business offerings. And as Robert mentioned, we expect to close the Base Chemicals acquisition in June. In Book Publishing, we expect another quarter of strong front list releases and supply chain and inflationary pressures to persist. At News Media, overall advertising trends remain favorable, albeit recognizing that visibility is limited. We continue to expect incremental annual revenues from the recent platform agreements with the majority of that allocated to News Media. We expect incremental costs of at least $20 million in relation to product investments across the businesses, including TalkTV in the fourth quarter. On the Other segment, we expect costs in the second half to be slightly higher than the first half due to the phasing of costs, but lower than the prior year. Finally, note that this fiscal year is on a 53-week basis and will include an extra week of financial results. I would also like to note that similar to the third quarter, we do expect foreign exchange headwinds to continue, given the current spot rates for the Australian dollar and pound Sterling compared to the prior year. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Entcho Raykovski with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nEntcho Raykovski: Hi Robert. Hi, Susan. Entcho Raykovski here. If I can just sneak in two questions please. I mean the first one is on Move. I appreciate the comments Susan you've just made around fourth quarter. I'm conscious that the comps are particularly difficult with, I think, it was 68% revenue growth in the PCP. Can you talk about what yield benefit you might expect to see in that fourth quarter? And could you conceivably see revenue growth within Move, given that tough comp? That's the first question. And secondly, I have a question on the pace of the buyback by my calculus you've done, I think, $158 million so far versus an authorization of $1 billion. Do you think there is scope to accelerate that particularly if you think there is value on offer in the current share price? And could we see that in the coming months? Thank you.\nRobert Thomson: Thank you. Entcho, I'll take the first question about movement, Susan will address the buyback. Look, we're not going to give you a forecast for the quarter, but obviously enough, even though leads have been in decline in Q3, if there are fewer houses for sale, there'll be fewer leads. The beauty of the referral model is that we're focused on the quality, not the quantity. We can have fewer leads, but make more from each of those leads by offering realtors more purposeful purchases So quantity of course matters, but so does quality. And that is the beauty of the model that we've been building in recent years. Our quarterly real estate revenues rose even in this difficult market by 7%. And as you say, that followed 43% growth in the same quarter last year. And by the way, leads are still 11% higher than 2020. And existing home sales in calendar 2021 were 15% higher than 2019. Another thing to watch in coming months and quarters, the change in the mortgage market with origination being more important than refinancing, which had dominated over the past few years, the mortgage companies were more focused on serving preexisting, preapproved customers with refinancing and rapid decline. Our new leads will be relatively more valuable and we will surely extract that value.\nSusan Panuccio: And Entcho, so just in relation to the buyback, your numbers were accurate. That is what we have brought back to date. And you will notice from that that we have been buying back at a relatively steady rate since we announced the buyback like last calendar year. We haven't given a timeframe in relation to the execution of that buyback. But as always, we will continue to look at the reinvestment opportunities, versus the shareholder returns and monitoring the share price.\nMike Florin: Thank you, Entcho. Keith, we'll take our next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Kane Hannan with Goldman Sachs, please go ahead.\nKane Hannan: Hey guys just two quick ones as well, just Kayo and that price increase you mentioned, is there any more color you can give us around, I suppose, timing and quantum of that? I suppose, is that what is going to drive the improved profitability in the fourth quarter? And then just News Media, given the inflationary pressures and that $20 million investment you called out, is it right to assume a step down in margin for that segment in the fourth quarter.\nSusan Panuccio: Okay Kane I'll take those. So just in relation to Kayo, the price increase will hit. I think it's towards the end of May. So we'll actually see pretty limited impact of that in Q4. So it's 250 and it'll hit on the 9 of May. But we will obviously see the benefit of that as we go through into next financial year. In relation to News Media, what I would say about that is we obviously have seen really strong growth within that segment over the course of the year. And we are taking a balanced approach to reinvestment. So we are expecting to see profitability improve in Q4, obviously subject to revenue trends, and foreign currency and how that trades. And we will make sure that the revenue upside will help some of the cost investments that we're going to have within that business. And we will continue to focus on margins within that segment.\nMike Florin: Thank you, Kane. Keith, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from David Karnowski with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJohn Gaudioso: Hi guys. This is John Gaudioso on for David. Just one quick one for me. It's only been two months, but I thought I would just ask you about any early learnings as you integrate the Opus acquisition. And I realize you have a significant amount of expertise in Spector, particularly with Dow Jones, but any warning that might also affect base chemicals when it closes next month and its potential future integration thereafter.\nRobert Thomson: Yes, we're very pleased with the first phase of integration as you say said, it is early. But clearly enough international events have only highlighted the economic, commercial and political importance of energy policy and prices and the shift to renewables. Both Opus and Base Chemicals are essentially a hundred percent digital recurring subscription revenues and rather high EBITDA margins. But these are premium products at premium prices. And we have a very large base of potential, professional customers through our Barron's, WSJ, IBD and MarketWatch audiences. That vast base will create an ongoing funnel of possible premium subscribers for Opus. You'll certainly see the positive impacts in coming quarters. And it is obvious that this is a pivotal moment for Dow Jones.\nMike Florin: Thank you, John. Keith, we'll take our next question please.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Darren Leung with Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nDarren Leung: Hi guys. Thanks for your time. Just one from me. Looking at the professional information business in the Dow Jones segment, where we look at risk appliance, obviously going quite strong but actually largely in line with so a little bit faster than TRV. It sort of implies that Factiva and Newswires is sort of smaller in terms of its growth here. Any color or details implied here, please.\nRobert Thomson: Darren we\u2019re pleased overall with the professional information business. Newswire provides an important service not just for the professional side, but also for our consumer journalism. And we're fully invested in the, in the future of developing that Newswire\u2019s business. And you'll see in coming quarters, as I said, with the Piers acquisition, just how much potential professional information business actually has.\nDarren Leung: Can you comment whether subscribers are still increasing in Factiva?\nMike Florin: Well, I'm sorry Darren the detail I gave you is the detail that I will give you. Thank you.\nDarren Leung: Okay, thank you.\nRobert Thomson: I think Darren it\u2019s fair to say that that Factiva newswires is relatively stable. Keith, we'll take our next question please.\nDarren Leung: Okay.\nOperator: Our next questions from Brian Han with Morningstar. Please go ahead.\nBrian Han: Robert, I think, you mentioned that in News Media, digital advertising revenue was greater than print in the UK. First, can you please confirm that? And second, does that mean in Australia and U.S. print advertising revenue is still way bigger than digital advertising revenue?\nRobert Thomson: No. The second supposition is not accurate. Look, advertising generally has been excellent, particularly in digital and you see it from Dow Jones to the New York Post, which is on track as we've indicated for genuine profitability. But across, in total, the business units, Dow Jones advertising up 20%; News UK, 32%; New York Post, 13%; and News Australia, 2%, obviously currency affected. So strong growth and indications are that growth remains relatively robust.\nMike Florin: Thank you, Brian. Keith, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: At this time, we have no further questions in the queue.\nRobert Thomson: Great. Well thank you all for participating. Thank you, Keith. Have a wonderful day and we look forward to speaking with you soon,\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Robert. Fiscal 2022 third quarter total revenues were approximately $2.5 billion, up 7% reflecting strong growth across our core pillars led by digital real estate services and Dow Jones, which includes benefits from our recent acquisitions and our continuing shift to digital across the company. Total segment EBITDA was $358 million higher than the prior year by 20%. And, as Robert mentioned, marked the highest third quarter total segment EBITDA on records since separation, reflecting our ongoing focus on costs. Those results came despite approximately $15 million of one-time cost related to the Opus transaction, which closed on February the 28 and a $16 million negative impact from currency headwinds. Excluding acquisitions, currency fluctuations, and other items disclosed in the release, adjusted revenues and adjusted total segment EBITDA rose 6% and 25% respectively. Reported EPS were $0.14 compared to $0.13 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter was $0.16 compared to $0.09 in the prior year. Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $416 million an increase of 19% compared to the prior year. The results include the contribution from the acquisition of Mortgage Choice, as well as the negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. On an adjusted basis segment revenues increase 14%. Segment EBITDA rose 17% to $137 million or up 18% on an adjusted basis. Like the second quarter, the driver of segment EBITDA improvement was REA while segment EBITDA contribution from news was flat compared to the prior year. News revenues were $170 million similar to last quarter and up 5% year-over-year, this followed 37% revenue growth in the prior year and is now approximately 44% higher than pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. For the quarter real estate revenues grew 7% and accounted for 85% of total revenues.  Price optimization within the core Lead Gen business, home price appreciation and the resulting flow through to commissions within the referral model together with higher advertising help to offset limited inventory impacting both lead volumes and transaction volumes. Referral offerings accounted for approximately 28% of total revenues up three percentage points compared to the prior year and was the biggest driver of year-over-year revenue growth this quarter. Based on our internal metrics, Realtor's, average monthly unique users were 95 million in Q3 reaching a 100 million in March, while unique users were down 3% year-over-year, they are still 40% above pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Like the second quarter revenue growth was partially offset by the divestiture of top producer in March, which negatively impacted revenues by approximately two percentage points. Lead volumes in the quarter were sequentially higher than the second quarter. However, they declined 22% compared to the prior year impacted by lower new listings and the recent rise in mortgage rates. The team remains focused on driving audience growth, scaling the core real estate business and investing in and growing adjacent businesses, while keeping a watchful eye on the macro environment. REA had another very strong quarter with revenues rising 30% year-on-year on a reported basis to $246 million, which includes a $38 million contribution from the Mortgage Choice acquisition. REA enjoyed another quarter of favorable trends, including an 11% increase in Australian residential new buy listings with Sydney up 14% and Melbourne up 8%, despite lapping tough comparisons. REA also benefit from higher yields, increased penetration, and favorable product mix. Financial services benefited from an increase in settlements, as well as the integration of Mortgage Choice. And the team continues to innovate with the launch of Premier Plus in March and enhanced offering that delivers additional marketing features to listings. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment, revenues for the quarter were $494 million, relatively stable from the second quarter and down approximately 6% compared to the prior year on a reported basis due to foreign currency headwinds. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 1%, a strong improvement from the second quarter rate of minus 3%. Streaming revenues, now account for 20% of circulation and subscription revenues saw notable acceleration in the growth rate from the second quarter. Total clients paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group reached $4.3 million at quarter end, up 23% year-over-year. Total subscribers, including trialists, were over 4.5 million. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher BINGE and Kayo subscribers, partially offset by the expected decline in residential broadcast subscribers. Commercial subscriptions rose modestly over the prior year helped by the easing of lockdown restrictions. Total streaming subscribers reached over 2.7 million with paying subscribers up 62% from the prior year and 421,000 sequentially to approximately 2.6 million. Streaming subscribers reached 59% of Foxtel's total paid subscriber base. Kayo benefited from the return of the winter sports codes [ph] and saw record early ratings with total subscribers over 1.2 million. 138,000 paid subscribers were added in the quarter, a notable acceleration from the second quarter, taking paid subscribers to over 1.1 million. Similar to Kayo, BINGE had a strong quarter increasing its total subscribers to over 1.3 million. Paying subscribers increased to over 1.2 million, up 135% from the prior year. BINGE added 284,000 paid subscribers in the quarter, the most quarterly additions since the launch of the service in 2020. BINGE's growth continued to be driven by the depth and diversity of its content library and the popularity of new shows such as Love Me, a Binge original, Euphoria, and the Walking Dead. Foxtel ended the quarter with over 1.5 million residential broadcast subscribers, down approximately 11% with the rate of decline stable versus the second quarter. Commercial subscribers ended the quarter 240,000 and improvement both sequentially and year-over-year. Retaining high value customers remains the focus for broadcast subscribers, which has led to churn improvements with churn reducing almost six percentage points year-over-year in the quarter to 14.3%, which reflects eight consecutive months of year-over-year churn reduction. Broadcast ARPU rose by 2% to AUD82. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $79 million was down 13% versus the prior year, driven by higher programming costs, partly due to increased availability of entertainment content as well as modestly high marketing investment in streaming.  Cost control remains a key focus at Foxtel, and we continue to expect full year cost to be flat versus the prior year in local currency, which is helping to underpin strong cash generation. The fourth quarter segment EBITDA will face more favorable prior year comparisons. Moving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones continued its strong performance in the quarter with revenues of $487 million, up 16% compared to the prior year with digital revenues accounting for 76% of total revenues this quarter, up two percentage points from last year.  Results for the quarter include IBD and one month of the recently acquired Opus. Circulation and subscription revenues increased 15%, including 16% circulation revenue growth, primarily reflecting the acquisition of IBD and continued strong volume gains in digital-only subscriptions. Digital-only net ads at Dow Jones were 167,000 subscribers, including 118,000 at the Wall Street Journal, the highest quarterly additions this fiscal year. Professional information business revenues rose 13% and accounted for 29% of revenues.  Revenue growth from Risk & Compliance increased 12%, despite a 3% negative foreign exchange impact driven by the higher entry rate at the beginning of the year and strong growth across the Americas, Europe and Asia. Opus accounted for approximately $10 million of revenues in the quarter. As a reminder, the business did $129 million of revenues in its last full year with very strong margins and with revenues almost all recurring and digital. Advertising revenues, which accounted for 21% of revenues this quarter, remained very strong, growing 20% to a $102 million, despite difficult prior year comparisons. Digital advertising revenues rose 21% in the quarter on top of 30% growth in the third quarter of the prior year and accounted for 62% of total advertising revenues. We continue to see strong yield improvement led by direct display and saw particular strength in the finance and technology categories. Print advertising continued to surprise on the upside with 18% growth year-over-year, partly due to easy prior year compares, but also due to strength in the technology category. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 7% to $88 million following growth of 61% in the third quarter of the prior year. As mentioned earlier, included in the quarter is approximately $15 million of one time transaction costs related to the Opus acquisition. Excluding the contribution from IBD and Opus currency fluctuations and other items disclosed in the release adjusted revenues and adjusted segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 9% and 16% respectively. Over the last few weeks, we have received questions from investors about our exposure to the war in Ukraine. Across the company, our exposure to the region is at Dow Jones, the region accounts for a de minimis amount of Dow Jones' gross revenues, almost entirely in [indiscernible]. And so far, the impact from close accounts and/or canceled contract is immaterial. We are also beginning to see opportunities in risk and compliance emerge due to increased sanctions and regulatory requirements.

So just in relation to Kayo, the price increase will hit. I think it's towards the end of May. So we'll actually see pretty limited impact of that in Q4. So it's 250 and it'll hit on the 9 of May. But we will obviously see the benefit of that as we go through into next financial year. In relation to News Media, what I would say about that is we obviously have seen really strong growth within that segment over the course of the year. And we are taking a balanced approach to reinvestment. So we are expecting to see profitability improve in Q4, obviously subject to revenue trends, and foreign currency and how that trades. And we will make sure that the revenue upside will help some of the cost investments that we're going to have within that business. And we will continue to focus on margins within that segment."

            "content": "Thank you, Mike. I'm delighted to report that revenues and profitability were at a new record for the third quarter, since the company's rebirth in 2013, building comprehensively on the momentum of our record performance in preceding quarters News Corp delivered $2.5 billion of revenues up 7%, despite the vicissitudes of currency volatility. While profitability improved by 20% and that was despite the one time transaction costs for our Opus acquisition. The tangible benefits to revenue and profitability of that transaction should be obvious in coming quarters. To put the results in a broader context, we attained more in profitability at over $1.3 billion through the first three quarters of fiscal 2022 than we did in any entire fiscal year, since our rebirth in 2013. And there is certainly more to come in the fourth quarter. Given the impact of the pandemic and not so transitional inflation, both exogenous in the extreme, these sterling results are testament to the strength of the company's culture created and curated by Rupert and Locklin Murdoch and the commitment, creativity, and passion of all our employees. We are investing as well as returning capital to shareholders and have focused that investment on bolstering our growth pillars. The results of that productive investment should be felt for years to come. Our core product suite has expanded as has our reach, and we expect that auspicious combination will [indiscernible] our long-term growth. Following a strong fiscal 2021 and first half of fiscal 2022 Dow Jones continued to power ahead with revenues and segment EBITDA both sharply rising. Though the latter was impacted by the one-time costs related to the Opus transaction. Segment EBITDA was up 7% even including the Opus costs, adjusted segment EBITDA actually rose 16%. Opus, along with Base Chemicals, which we expect will close by the end of next month, represent an exciting opportunity for Dow Jones, extending the depth and reach of our news and information capabilities in the commodities sector. The appetite for data, analysis and insight in the energy, renewables, chemicals and related fields is strong and growing. And we believe Dow Jones is ideally positioned to capitalize for many years to come. Not only did we acquire Opus at a rather favorable price, but the recent surge in global commodity prices highlights the profound importance of this sector for Dow Jones. The need for trusted and accurate information has never been more imperative. And we expect to capitalize on that opportunity. Opus has healthy subscriber growth with robust margins and extremely high retention rates. Given the lack of overlap between the customer basis of Dow Jones and Opus, we see very strong cross-sell and upsell potential using the vast WSJ, IBD and MarketWatch audiences as a premium pool for customer leads. Subscriber growth at Dow Jones remain robust with WSJ digital only subscribers crossing three million this quarter expanding at a robust 16% rate. Digital only subscriptions across all Dow Jones consumer sites increased by 19%, which also reflects the consolidation of IBD and early success in new bundled offerings. Digital advertising burgeon 21%, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of double digit percent growth. Notably, print advertising has actually expanded for four consecutive quarters in double digits. While the conflict in Ukraine had a short term impact on advertising, given that certain advertisers did not want juxtaposition with war coverage, overall trends remain favorable. The imposition of sanctions and expansion of watchlists, underscore the value of the Dow Jones Risk & Compliance business, which continued its unbroken streak of rapid growth in Q3, when it recorded the 27th straight quarter of double digit increases. And on Ukraine, we are deeply appreciative of the professionalism of our journalists and their support teams in covering the tragic conflict and bringing understanding to readers around the world.  Our Digital Real Estate services, both revenues and segment EBITDA continue to expand at a healthy rate. Revenues at REA grew a robust 30% following a surge in listing value and also benefited from the integration of mortgage choice, which obviously provides another means of monetizing our valuable leaves. In the U.S., the real estate market is in the midst of flux with historically low inventories and rising interest rates. Home prices generally have continued to rise. There is much variation depending on the location, while rents are increasing at a double digit rate. Affordability and supply, which are obviously related, remain issues for first time buyers who also face an escalation in mortgage rates though by historical standards, rates remain relatively low. The ebb and flow of market forces is not unusual. And we believe the opportunity for realtor.com and News Corp has never been greater as the digitization of the property market continues at pace. And current trends are likely to expedite that evolution. Our product innovation has accelerated. Our scale has increased. And we are in the early days of venturing into relevant adjacencies with large addressable markets. Despite the shifting market conditions, Move posted revenue growth in the third quarter and our aim to be the digital marketplace for consumers and the industries is clearly paying dividends. As our average monthly unique users exceeded 100 million in March. Over the past two years, third quarter revenues of the Digital Real Estate Services segment have increased by 59%, which gives a measure of both the growth and the opportunity. The past two years have been remarkable for book publishing with third quarter revenues rising 5% this year, which means that there has been a 25% increase since the third quarter of fiscal 2020. And this in an industry that some observers had presumed to be mature. We expect sales to continue at significantly higher levels than before the pandemic. Unsurprisingly, EBITDA after the segment was challenged, including by supply chain, cost increases for paper, printing and distribution. We expect these near term disruptions to abate over time. We also expect continuing success from both new releases and our bolstered backlist, which was enhanced by the acquisition of the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Books & Media division. Successful releases included the bestselling memoir by former Attorney General, Bill Barr, One Damn Thing After Another, Red Handed by Peter Schweizer and The Paris Apartment by Lucy Foley. Given the public's abiding appetite for reading HarperCollins is certainly well positioned for future success. We're excited about Finding Me the new book by Viola Davis released late last month. And we anticipate a surge in interest in The Lord of the Rings franchise, for which we now have global English language rights. Given the launch of Amazon's landmark series later this calendar year. It is worth noting that according to Amazon, the teaser trailer for that series broke a global record for the most watched entertainment trailer to debut during the Super Bowl within 24 hours of the trailers release, it had 257 million views. News Media was the biggest contributor to News Corp's growth in profitability in Q3, with segment EBITDA approximately 388% higher in the quarter. We saw continued strong performance in digital advertising across the segment alongside a notable rebound in print advertising at News UK. News Australia had a strong quarter with substantial improvement in profit contribution, thanks in part to our deals with the tech platforms, our continuing cost discipline and the development of our digital platforms. The New York Post Renaissance continues with its massive audience, strong advertising growth and improved profit contribution. The New York Post digital network now ranks among the top news sites in the U.S. and has grown nearly eight-fold since fiscal 2014, to over 172 million average monthly unique users in the third quarter. News UK also had a healthy profit contribution with significant revenue improvement of The Sun where digital advertising outpaced print. It is also notable that thesun.com, the brand extension of The Sun in the U.S. market increased page views in Q3 by over 260% year-over-year to 500 million with yields significantly improving. Piers Morgan's much anticipated program launched on April 25. And it more than exceeded expectations in reach across the UK, the U.S. and Australia, thanks to the power of our platforms, the pivotal partnership with Fox News and the quality of the programming. Not only does TalkTV plan to be a broad church of diverse views and lively discussion, it offers a new opportunity to leverage our strong brands, talented people, and premium video content in the UK and around the world. In Subscription Video Services, the third quarter saw continued progress in reshaping the Foxtel Group as a growth-oriented subscription business, with continued success in streaming, stable revenues and solid cash generation. Notably Kayo and BINGE, both surged in the quarter and are now reaching record numbers of subscribers, Kayo plans to implement a price increase as it benefits from its scale platform and high-quality production, which is driving record ratings at the start of the season for both the NRL and the AFL. Overall, total paying streaming subs reach nearly 2.6 million up 62%. We remain pleased with Foxtel's turnaround and have a great optimism about its near and long term future. We are continuing to explore all options for Foxtel to maximize its value while watching closely all relevant developments in the financial markets. Through the first three quarters of fiscal year 2022 News Corp is well on track for its most profitable year since separation. Clearly, besting last year's record results. Success is building on success. We will relentlessly continue to drive our performance in the quest for enhanced returns for our investors, complacency, smugness, and hubris are not words in our vocabulary. News Corp is a company transformed more intensely digital, more intelligently global with strong growth in our core markets and much unrealized potential. Macroeconomic challenges affect all businesses, whether that be the supply chain, corrosive inflation or febrile currency markets. But our resilience, adaptability and ingenuity were stress tested by the pandemic and led to record revenues and profits. We understandably are optimistic about the years ahead. For more granularity about our quarterly performance, I now hand you over to the at right [ph] Susan Panuccio. Thank you. Entcho, I'll take the first question about movement, Susan will address the buyback. Look, we're not going to give you a forecast for the quarter, but obviously enough, even though leads have been in decline in Q3, if there are fewer houses for sale, there'll be fewer leads. The beauty of the referral model is that we're focused on the quality, not the quantity. We can have fewer leads, but make more from each of those leads by offering realtors more purposeful purchases So quantity of course matters, but so does quality. And that is the beauty of the model that we've been building in recent years. Our quarterly real estate revenues rose even in this difficult market by 7%. And as you say, that followed 43% growth in the same quarter last year. And by the way, leads are still 11% higher than 2020. And existing home sales in calendar 2021 were 15% higher than 2019. Another thing to watch in coming months and quarters, the change in the mortgage market with origination being more important than refinancing, which had dominated over the past few years, the mortgage companies were more focused on serving preexisting, preapproved customers with refinancing and rapid decline. Our new leads will be relatively more valuable and we will surely extract that value. Yes, we're very pleased with the first phase of integration as you say said, it is early. But clearly enough international events have only highlighted the economic, commercial and political importance of energy policy and prices and the shift to renewables. Both Opus and Base Chemicals are essentially a hundred percent digital recurring subscription revenues and rather high EBITDA margins. But these are premium products at premium prices. And we have a very large base of potential, professional customers through our Barron's, WSJ, IBD and MarketWatch audiences. That vast base will create an ongoing funnel of possible premium subscribers for Opus. You'll certainly see the positive impacts in coming quarters. And it is obvious that this is a pivotal moment for Dow Jones. Darren we're pleased overall with the professional information business. Newswire provides an important service not just for the professional side, but also for our consumer journalism. And we're fully invested in the, in the future of developing that Newswire's business. And you'll see in coming quarters, as I said, with the Piers acquisition, just how much potential professional information business actually has. I think Darren it's fair to say that that Factiva newswires is relatively stable. Keith, we'll take our next question please. No. The second supposition is not accurate. Look, advertising generally has been excellent, particularly in digital and you see it from Dow Jones to the New York Post, which is on track as we've indicated for genuine profitability. But across, in total, the business units, Dow Jones advertising up 20%; News UK, 32%; New York Post, 13%; and News Australia, 2%, obviously currency affected. So strong growth and indications are that growth remains relatively robust. Great. Well thank you all for participating. Thank you, Keith. Have a wonderful day and we look forward to speaking with you soon,"

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mike Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nMike Florin: Thank you very much, Jess. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal Second Quarter 2022[ph] Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We've all been with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release. With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\nRobert Thomson: Thank you, Mike. We are delighted that the considerable momentum shown over the past two years has continued unabated in the most recent quarter. While the first quarter was the most profitable first quarter since our rebirth in 2013. The second quarter was the most profitable of any quarter with record revenues and record profitability. Products are certainly deserved by our employees for their collective and unstinting effort, energy and creativity. We are all proud to be furthering a tradition of purpose in principle created by and curated by Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch. Credit too must go to a Board that has provided thoughtful prescient guidance during a particularly challenging period for most media companies in most countries. Revenues for the quarter exceeded $2.7 billion, a 13% increase year-over-year, while profitability rose 18% to $586 million and net income reached $262 million. In the first half of this fiscal year, News Corp amassed nearly $1 billion of total segment EBITDA, a 30% surge while reported net income was $529 million compared to $308 million in the previous year. The platform agreements with Big Tech continued to benefit our bottom line. In addition to our substantial deals with Google and Facebook, we have extended and expanded our multiyear global agreement with Apple, which is expected to be an important source of subscriptions and of advertising revenue for our new sites around the world. There is no doubt that Tim Cook and Eddy Cue have a visceral enlightened understanding of the importance of professional journalism, and we genuinely appreciate their personal and corporate commitment. Our businesses are flourishing. There was again strong performance at Digital Real Estate Services, Dow Jones and Book Publishing and a rapid expansion of profitability at our News Media segment. We are delighted that agreement has been reached to acquire the OPIS and Base Chemicals businesses after their required sale for antitrust reasons. They will surely add to the luster of the already lucrative Dow Jones Professional Information Business. Those acquisitions should formally close in the first half of calendar 2022. We had indicated that the strength of our cash position and our robust growth would enable us to make opportunistic purchases, and that has come to fruition and at reasonable prices that we believe will benefit all our shareholders. That studied strategic expansion has been complemented by a $1 billion share buyback program already well underway and which we expect will provide ongoing value to our investors. Turning first to Digital Real Estate Services. It is manifest that there is a global shift in the housing market, with families wanting more space, a higher quality of life and the opportunity to work from home, which is simply not feasible without a home. Unsurprisingly, there were 6.12 million existing home sales in the U.S. last year, the highest figure in 15 years, and that total came despite the disruption of COVID in viewing and reviewing homes. We see much macro strength ahead in a market that is still far from being fully digitized and should benefit from rising employment and from interest rates that while on an incline, remain close to historic lows. In the second quarter, Digital Real Estate Services reported 35% revenue growth and 25% segment EBITDA growth. Listing volume improved noticeably at REA. While realtor.com reinvested in valuable adjacencies and continue to generate strong revenue growth despite relatively low U.S. housing inventory levels. As of December, according to comScore, realtor traffic growth exceeded that of Zillow and Trulia for 23 straight months, which is vindication of our resolute focus on our core mission and customers. We were not mired in the capricious calendar sec of House Flipping. In Australia, REA reported revenue growth of 56%, which includes the integration of Mortgage Choice. The tapering of rapid house price rises has been accompanied by a flurry of new listings, even though the COVID situation remained somewhat unpredictable. And one state, Western Australia has chosen not-so-splended isolation. The Australian government is expecting an economic renaissance over the next year or so, and that should benefit REA and all of our businesses in that country. Dow Jones had a superb quarter with 14% revenue growth and a 32% increase in segment EBITDA at $144 million. Bear in mind that these outstanding numbers come on top of a particularly strong quarter a year ago, underscoring the scale of Dow Jones achievements. We are successfully building upon success. Subscriptions expanded across the Dow Jones portfolio, and there was 23% advertising revenue growth in the quarter. Risk and Compliance reported a revenue increase of 17%, the 26th successive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. To emphasize, 26 successive quarters of double-digit revenue growth. Total Dow Jones subscriptions, including IBD, rose 17% in the quarter, reaching approximately 4.7 million. And the Wall Street Journal's total subs exceeded 3.6 million with nearly 3 million of them being digital-only, an increase of 19% year-over-year. To be clear, these are core subscribers who are signing up to a premium product at a premium retail price. Our ability to offer high-margin professional products will certainly be enhanced by the integration of OPIS and Base Chemicals, both of which have still growing traditional businesses and rapidly expanding offerings in renewables. We plan to use Dow Jones expertise to create truly verifiable carbon products and prices in a market that is patently immature and lacking in transparency and veracity. And we expect the pressure for credible disclosure to be an additional source of revenue for our Risk and Compliance business. For clarity, these two new businesses have revenue bases that are close to 100% digital and recurring. They are highly profitable with healthy revenue growth and modest CapEx requirements. We expect that investors will be able to see clearly the positive impact in coming quarters. That these deals were done at rather attractive multiples is self-evidently a bonus for our investors. Book Publishing posted record numbers a year ago and the growth continued inexorably in Q2. This continuing success is thanks to the diverse front list and deep backlist at HarperCollins, augmented over the past year by the opportunistic acquisition of the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Books & Media segment. Notable success was seen with Ree Drummond\u2019s The Pioneer Woman Cooks-Super Easy! and Dave Grohl\u2019s, The Storyteller. Looking ahead, we have high hopes for the Paris Apartment by Lucy Foley, another David Williams installment in is superlative best-selling World\u2019s Worst series and what may well be the most telling book of the Trump administration, One Damn Thing After Another by Bill Barr, who was Attorney General and had a remarkable career before that service. Having read the text, I can report that this is a brilliantly written, profoundly important work, which will share thoughtful light on a turbulent period in the country's history. Also note in the second quarter, Harlequin launched Harlequin Plus, a direct-to-consumer digital subscription service that will appeal to romantics around the world. The app and website will give subscribers an opportunity to have a literally liaison with book bundles, e-books, movies and games. This multimedia offering is yet another example of the clever contemporary leveraging of our world-class content. News Media had a particularly strong quarter with segment EBITDA up 68%. That outstanding performance reflected growth in advertising, the benefits of the deals with the Big Tech platforms, sensible sustained cost discipline and the benefit of savvy product and technology investments made in recent years. The robust advertising results up 17% in the quarter, were evident at all major mastheads across both print and digital. Our digital trends are particularly pleasing, which speaks to the value of our global network and improvements in our understanding of permission data. It also reflects the sage leadership of Michael Miller in Australia, Rebecca Brooks in the U.K. and both Sean Giancola and Keith Poole at the New York Post. News Corp Australia showed a highly noteworthy improvement in profit contribution with digital paid subscriptions scaling to nearly 910,000 and the intelligent expansion into digital adjacencies. The New York Post had an especially successful Q2 with an appreciable contribution to segment EBITDA, thanks to a resounding advertising performance and its vast and growing digital audience. We recorded 160 million unique users in the months of December. The post increase in profit contribution has, it is fair to say, it exceeded even our demanding expectations. News U.K. had its highest second quarter profit contribution since fiscal 2011, helped by an acceleration in digital paid subscriber growth. In addition, the Sun's traffic has surged with global monthly uniques for December, up 25% to $163 million, and our fledgling U.S. Sun site growing rapidly. It's worth reiterating and pondering for a moment, some of those astounding numbers. Based on internal metrics, as of December, we had 160 million uniques for the New York Post, 163 million uniques for the Sun, over 80 million uniques for realtor.com and 123 million uniques with Dow Jones. That is certainly a firm foundation for network growth. In the U.K., Wireless made a positive contribution to News Media's revenue and segment EBITDA growth. We're also looking forward to the launch of talkTV, which will be available on platforms, including linear TV and OTT. The channel will take full advantage of our talent and content in the U.K. and via the global deal with Piers Morgan, our platforms in the U.S. and Australia. It will be high quality, low cost and certainly impactful. Subscription Video services benefit from increasing subscriptions and decreasing churn. Thanks to the ongoing appeal of our streaming platforms, the high quality of our technology, our increasingly sophisticated understanding of audience data and the depth and broad appeal of our unparalleled entertainment, sports and news offerings. Sports seasonality is always a factor in Australia, but our total streaming subscribers expanded by 66% year-over-year, with Binge exceeding 1 million subscribers and Flash, our news aggregation service in its infancy. In total, as of December, we had almost 2.3 million streaming subs, representing 56% of Foxtel's total subscriber base, which was 4.1 million. It's worth noting that in addition to the increase in streaming subs, broadcast churn was at a three-year note. The team, led by Siobhan McKenna and Patrick Delaney is executing successfully on our strategy to scale streaming, having developed world-class technology and compelling user interface. We are increasingly confident in Foxtel's future and thus actively looking at ways to maximize its value and ensure that we can build on that success. We are delighted with the patent progress at News Corp, but certainly not complacent as we contemplate the exciting potential in our company, which we will relentlessly realize for our investors. Our trajectory has been transformed despite the vicissitudes of the virus is a testament to the inherent potential of the businesses and the enduring culture of the company. There is no doubt that we will thoughtfully review our current structure and be institutionally introspective on behalf of shareholders. We have made many timely disposals and self-evidently successful purchases and are committed to maximizing value for those who have invested in our company. While our profits and revenues are at record levels, we are certainly far from stated and will never be complacent. We firmly believe the best quarters and years are yet to come. Now for more details about the most profitable quarter since our reincarnation in 2013, Susan Panuccio.\nSusan Panuccio: Thank you, Robert. As Robert mentioned, we are delighted with our second quarter and first half results, marked by strong revenue growth, further margin expansion and record high total segment EBITDA. Fiscal 2022 second quarter total revenues were over $2.7 billion, up 13%, reflecting strong revenue growth across the company with our three-core pillars, Digital Real Estate Services, Dow Jones and Book Publishing growing 19%. Total segment EBITDA was $586 million, higher than the prior year by 18% and a record high total segment EBITDA for the company since separation. Excluding acquisitions, currency fluctuations and other items disclosed in the release, adjusted revenues and adjusted total segment EBITDA rose 8% and 16%, respectively. Reported EPS were $0.40 as compared to $0.39 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.44 in the quarter compared to $0.34 in the prior year. During the quarter, we commenced our share buyback and announced the acquisition of Base Chemicals. As Robert mentioned, we anticipate both the OPIS and Base Chemicals acquisitions to close in the first half of calendar 2022. Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $456 million, an increase of 35% compared to the prior year. The results include the acquisition of Mortgage Choice and the consolidation of REA India, formerly Elara at REA. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues increased 22%. Segment EBITDA rose 25% to $178 million or 29% on an adjusted basis. We continue to see higher investment spending at Move and at REA, but at a more moderated rate than the first quarter, notably at Move. Move's revenues were $169 million or up 9% year-over-year off the back of 28% revenue growth in the prior year, primarily driven by the historically high lead volumes, which rose over 30% last year. Real estate revenues improved by 13% and accounted for 86% of total revenues. We saw higher revenues from the traditional lead generation business, fueled by higher yields and increased penetration from Market VIP Move\u2019s hybrid product. Referral offerings accounted for approximately 32% of total revenues and continued to benefit from record high home prices and higher referral fees despite lower transaction volume. Encouragingly, close rates also improved. Average monthly unique users for the second quarter were $85 million, up 6% over the prior year. Like the first quarter, revenue growth was partially offset by the divestiture of Top Producer in March, negatively impacting revenues by approximately 3 percentage points. Overall, as anticipated, lead volume declines moderated from the first quarter, down 9%, and we are now seeing the emergence of more typical seasonal patterns. Importantly, lead volume is up 18% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Yields remain robust given strong agent demand, which is more than offsetting the impact from lower lead volume. Expanding into adjacencies, including new homes and rentals and establishing partnerships like the recently announced Open Door and Orchid Life[ph] partnerships in the seller's marketplace remain a key focus in the second half. REA had another outstanding quarter with revenues rising 56% year-on-year on a reported basis to $287 million, which includes the $41 million contribution from the Mortgage Choice acquisition and $10 million from REA India. As a reminder, financial service revenues are reflected on a gross basis in the revenue line in our financial disclosures and broker commissions are reflected in costs. REA enjoyed very favorable trends this quarter, including a 22% increase in Australian residential new buy listings double the first quarter rate with Sydney, up 39%; and Melbourne, up 25%, aided by easing of lockdown restrictions. REA also continued to benefit from higher yields, increased depth penetration and product mix. Financial services not only benefited from the integration of Mortgage Choice but also saw record levels of applications and settlements. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $498 million, down approximately 3% on both a reported and adjusted basis and relatively stable from the prior quarter, as the declines in Foxtel residential broadcast revenue and continued COVID impacts on commercial venues were partially offset by strong growth in streaming revenues, which now account for 19% of circulation and subscription revenues. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group reached over 3.9 million at quarter end, up 19% year-over-year, improving from the prior quarter rate by 2 percentage points. Total subscribers, including trialists, were approximately 4.1 million, the highest on record. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher Binge and Kayo subscribers, partially offset by the expected decline in residential broadcast subscribers, albeit at a more moderated rate than the first quarter. In aggregate, total streaming subscribers rose 66% from the prior year to almost $2.3 million, of which approximately $2.2 million were paying subscribers. Streaming products in the aggregate reached 56% of Foxtel's total subscriber base. Binge had an outstanding quarter, increasing its total subscribers to over 1 million similar to Kayo. Paying subscribers more than doubled from the prior year to 928,000. Binge added 126,000 paid subscribers in the quarter, almost double the net adds of the first quarter. Binge's growth continued to be driven by the depth of its content library and the popularity of new shows, including a Binge original show, Love Me. Kayo subscribers followed seasonal patterns with total subscribers slightly down from the first quarter, consistent with the prior two years. The winter codes of AFL and NRL remain key acquisition drivers for Kayo with cricket and motorsports providing essential viewing over the spring and summer months to satisfy the year-round sports fans. Australia's winter sports codes will resume in the third quarter with the return of AFL, NRL, Netball and Supercars. Broadcast churn declined to 13%, the lowest level since the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and down 4.5 percentage points versus last year. The Foxtel team continued to focus on product enhancements and higher ARPU subscribers, resulting in broadcast ARPU increasing almost 3% from the prior year to AUD82 and helping to mitigate subscriber volume declines. Foxtel ended the quarter with 1.6 million residential broadcast subscribers with the sequential decline being the lowest since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Commercial subscribers increased from the first quarter as parts of Australia opened up and were flat versus the prior year at 218,000. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $86 million was down 31%, driven by one-off events such as the Ashes and the phasing of certain sports rights costs together with investments in marketing and technology. Costs were consistent with our outlook commentary, and we continue to expect full year total cost to be relatively flat if not down slightly in local currency, helping to deliver strong cash generation at Foxtel. Moving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones continued its strong performance in the quarter with revenues of $508 million, up 14% compared to the prior year, with digital revenues accounting for 72% of total revenues this quarter, up 2 percentage points from last year. Adjusted revenues, which notably excludes the impact of IBD, rose 10%. Circulation and subscription revenues increased 12%, including 13% circulation revenue growth, primarily reflecting the acquisition of IBD and continued strong volume gains in digital-only subscriptions. Digital net adds improved from the first quarter with Dow Jones adding 148,000 digital-only subscribers, including 115,000 at the Wall Street Journal. Professional Information Business revenues rose 9% and accounted for 25% of revenues. Revenue growth from Risk and Compliance increased 17%, driven by a higher entry rate and strong growth across the Americas, Europe and Asia, and we continue to see modest revenue growth in Newswires. Advertising revenues, which accounted for 28% of revenues this quarter grew 23% to $141 million, the highest quarterly advertising revenue in the last five years. Digital advertising revenues remained robust, up 18% on top of 29% growth in the second quarter of the prior year and accounted for 56% of total advertising revenues. We continue to see strong yield improvement led by direct display. Print advertising continued to surprise on the upside with 29% growth year-over-year, partly due to easy prior year compares but also due to the strength in technology and B2C categories. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 32% to $144 million despite the 43% growth last year, with EBITDA margins expanding by almost four percentage points to over 28%. That represents the highest margin since News Corp's acquisition in 2007. Total costs increased 8% with approximately half due to the consolidation of IBD. On an adjusted basis, revenues and segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 10% and 29%, respectively. At Book Publishing, HarperCollins posted 13% revenue growth to $617 million and segment EBITDA rose 3% to $107 million. Adjusted revenues rose 4% versus the prior year, while adjusted segment EBITDA declined 7%. We are particularly pleased with these results given the global supply chain pressures, which impacted manufacturing and freight costs during the quarter and the tough prior year compare, which saw 65% segment EBITDA growth last year. Results this quarter benefited from the acquisition of HMH, strong frontlist performance and healthy industry dynamics with consumption levels still significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. Digital sales rose 8% this quarter and accounted for 17% of consumer sales with growth driven by downloadable audio books. HMH continued to perform according to plan. For the quarter, HMH contributed $50 million in revenues and $10 million in segment EBITDA. Turning to News Media. The momentum in this segment continued during the quarter, revenues were $638 million, up 11% versus the prior year. The biggest driver to the growth was the continued rebound in the advertising market as well as the strong growth in circulation and subscription revenues helped by the contribution from our recent content licensing revenues. Within the segment, revenues at News Corp Australia and News UK increased 14% and 7%, respectively. Wireless Group and the New York Post also continued to show strong top line growth. Adjusted revenues for the segment increased 10% compared to the prior year. Circulation and subscription revenues rose 9%, benefiting from strong digital subscriber growth, incremental revenues from the platform agreements and cover price increases. Advertising revenues increased 17% compared to the prior year with notable strength in digital and a recovery in print advertising across all our key mastheads. Advertising revenues in Australia with the easing of lockdown conditions rose 11% in both reported and local currency. News UK advertising revenues rose 23% or 21% in local currency with impressive digital advertising growth. In fact, at the sum, digital advertising surpassed print for the first time, driven by improved number of page views and higher yields. In the U.S., the trends at the New York Post remained strong with higher yields helping to drive advertising revenue performance 19% higher year-over-year. Segment EBITDA of $111 million increased $45 million or 68% compared to the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues. News Corp Australia contributed $35 million to the segment EBITDA growth, and both News UK and the New York Post were positive contributors to the growth. Segment margins topped 17%, the highest since we have separated in 2013. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased 65%. I would now like to talk about some themes for the upcoming quarter. While we remain very encouraged with our strong year-to-date results and our trajectory thus far, we are clearly mindful of the uncertainty and lack of visibility from the ongoing impacts of the pandemic, including the potential cost impacts from continued supply chain pressures, particularly in Book Publishing and our mastheads as well as wage inflation and talent retention across the company. At Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for January rose 14%. REA anticipates growth rates to slow in the second half as it cycled strong prior period listing volumes and potential impacts around the upcoming federal election. Please refer to REA for more specific outlook commentary. At Move, we continue to see strong yields despite lower inventory. We expect to continue to reinvest in Move as we drive the core business and expand into relevant adjacencies, particularly in new homes and rentals. We expect the year-over-year growth rate of investment at Move in the second half to be relatively similar to the second quarter, but notably lower than the first quarter rate. In Subscription Video Services, we remain pleased with the ongoing performance of the streaming products and the efforts to improve broadcast ARPU and churn. We continue to expect full year costs in local currency to be relatively flat versus the prior year, and we continue to monitor commercial venue trends given the recent spike in COVID cases in the region. At Dow Jones, overall trends across the business remains strong with advertising and subscription growth continuing to perform well. We expect to continue to reinvest in digital to drive consumer subscriptions and to further enhance our professional information business offerings. And to reiterate, we expect both the OPIS and Base Chemicals acquisitions to close in the first half of calendar 2022, and we will incur onetime transaction costs related to these acquisitions. In Book Publishing, similar to the first half, overall trends remain favorable despite lapping the benefits from COVID-19 and strong growth from the sales of the Bridgeton series in the third quarter last year and the ongoing supply chain pressures. At News Media, overall advertising trends remain favorable, and we remain cautiously optimistic about the second half, albeit recognizing that visibility is limited. We continue to expect incremental revenues into nine figures from the recent platform agreements with the majority of that allocated to News Media. We do expect some reinvestment to the segment in the second half given the strong year-to-date performance focused on new product initiatives, marketing and the News UK TV project. On other, we expect costs in the second half to be slightly higher than the first half due to the phasing of certain costs. And lastly, we continue to expect full year CapEx to be up $100 million versus the prior year, albeit we are trending lower than that in the first half. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kane Hannan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nKane Hannan: Good morning guys. Just two quick ones for me. Just firstly, Move. The revenue growth did slow down in the quarter despite the improving lead decline. Just talk a little bit about the pricing tailwinds you're seeing so how we think about that into the second half? And then just quickly on News Media. The payments from the tech platforms, were that the full run rate in the second quarter? Or should we expect those to continue to grow into the second half?\nRobert Thomson: Kane, I'll take those two questions. First of all, the macro trends at REALTOR generally are specious. I mean, clearly, there's some fluctuation in the U.S. housing market. But the overall impetus for families and individuals to buy larger homes to work from home to move location to take advantage of labor opportunities and certainly of those job opportunities and mobility when as a positive of employees are all positive influences. First-time mortgages are still at near historic lows. And so financially, home purchases make sense, particularly as rents are rising. You'll not see reduction in refis, but that's not a market to which we have exposure. And the digitalization of the U.S. property market is still at an early stage, a very early stage and we're poised to take advantage of the opportunity in the short, the medium and the long term. As for the big digital payments, you are starting to see the run rate, but it does \u2013 those payments alone are really base payments, and so they don't take into account advertising and shared advertising and generally speaking, the improvement in the commercial rates for distribution of our content nor do they yet reflect the impact of the enhanced deal with Apple.\nSusan Panuccio: And Kane, I'd just like to add for the phasing of those content cost, with licensing costs that we've got in \u2013 so Q2 was slightly higher than Q1, and we would expect the second half of the year to be slightly higher again as they continue to ramp, particularly given showcase hasn't launched in the U.S.\nMike Florin: Thank you, Kane. Jess, we will take our next question please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Entcho Raykovski with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nEntcho Raykovski: Hi, Robert. Hi, Susan. I've got two as well. The first one is, I guess, a follow-up to those comments on the content licensing revenues. I'm just interested in your view on the sustainability of the earnings uplift at each of Dow Jones and News Media? And for News Media, in particular, do you expect this quarter and this year to reflect a peak? Or can you at least sustain these earnings. You're obviously investing in the second half, but just how you view the earnings trajectory would be helpful. And then secondly, I think this has been a pretty clear theme in markets. But given the slowdown in subscribers noted by some of the global streaming operators, what are the dynamics that you've seen in the Australian streaming market. I mean do you see any risk to the three ambitions that you put out last September for Foxtel subscribers to get to over [indiscernible] million. Thank you.\nRobert Thomson: Well, on the first question around the News Media numbers, clearly, the big digital agreements had an impact. But I think to focus on that alone is to actually not give you credit to the companies with a News UK, News Australia or the New York Post in the way that those businesses have been transformed in recent years. And it has been a heavy lift, as you know, in Australia, we had to close many of our print editions and regions and communities and enhance our digital service. So those are more fundamental to the transform fortunes. And when you look at the increase in EBITDA over the past year \u2013 the same quarter last year, 11.5%; most recent quarter, 17.4%; News UK advertising, up 21% in local currency; News Australia advertising, up 11%; New York Post, up 19%. These are fundamental shifts in the businesses. And there's no reason to think that those fundamental shifts won't have an enduring impact. As for streaming, the Australian situation is rather different to the prevailing trends in the U.S. Foxtel really is the village square for video. And we have many partners there in a way that's not common in the U.S., Australia, in that sense is rather like the Galapagos Islands, a unique viewing ecosystem. And the recent rapid growth in BINGE is actually exceeding our expectations. And Kayo is a very different sports streaming service with the most important watchable winter sports, along with the increasingly compelling Formula 1 and supercars, among many others. That complete content package is certainly and consistently are compelling. I mean that's appointment viewing day after day, week after week, month after month. That's not churn data, churn some. [ph]\nSusan Panuccio: And Entcho, I'd just like to add to Robert's comments in relation to News Media. And he's absolutely right. I mean the transformation of that segment, in particular, has been great, and we've been really delighted with it. And just to give some context of the $65 million increase in revenue, $42 million of that was advertising, $23 million was circulation and subscriptions, which is where those content licensing fees are. So a lot of it was advertising \u2013 a lot of that's being fueled by digital advertising and the work that the teams have done around driving those audiences and converting their businesses to digital and benefiting from obviously strong yields. And also the cost work that they've done, they've done a huge amount of cost work and heavy lifting over the past couple of years, which has really helped to underpin those results. So it does give us confidence about how those businesses are going to continue going forward.\nMike Florin: Thank you. And Jess, we will take our next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Huber at Huber Research Partners.\nCraig Huber: Great. Thank you. What's your general thought here on this inflationary environment we have going on right here as you think across your portfolio, I mean, obviously, your numbers were really good here in the prior quarter. The outlook I hear you talking about here is quite favorable as well. But what's your general thoughts on inflation, what you think it's doing to your top line, but also your revenues \u2013 I'm sorry, your revenues as well as your costs. And I do have a nitpick question, Susan. Your overall cost for the company for the quarter, if you adjust for currency and acquisitions, how much was that up placed in the quarter year-over-year? Thank you.\nRobert Thomson: Well, I will make a quick observation about inflation and then Susan will follow up on both subjects. The inflationary pressures vary segment by segment and country by country. And this was obviously going to be an important issue of challenge. And clearly, from quite a way ago, not transitory. And so we started our planning long ago, asking each of the businesses to be cost conscious to look at whether open positions needed to be filled to be focused on retention payments in an intelligent way to ensure, though, that our teams also feel as though they're part of a purposeful journey which they most certainly are. The cultural component of loyalty complements the complement component. Susan?\nSusan Panuccio: And Craig, just on your question. So reported costs were up 11% and adjusted costs were up 5%.\nMike Florin: Thank you, Craig. Jess, we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alan Gould at Loop Capital.\nAlan Gould: Well, thank you for taking the question. I've got two, please. Some of the digital platforms are talking about supply chain issues and inflation impacting our marketers desire to advertise and impacting advertising, you have a global perspective, wondering what you're seeing with respect to that. I know your advertising is looking quite good. And then secondly, the platform fees that you're getting from the digital players, what is the opportunity for the advertising subscription revenue on top of what you're already receiving on licensing fees?\nRobert Thomson: Susan, would you like to present?\nSusan Panuccio: So just in relation to the platform fees, I mean we are working through, obviously, driving continued audiences and looking and working with those tech platforms in order to build out those audiences. And so that will help us contribute to growing the advertising client. And particularly if we can grow the overall subscriber pie, then we've got a high-quality audience that we can look at. Just in relation to the comments that other companies may have made around supply chain pressures and advertising. We \u2013 as you mention, we haven't seen that actually impact us from an advertising perspective. We've had great growth actually across digital, and we've been really pleasantly surprised with the bounce back of print advertising, obviously off relatively low comps from the prior year, but it still has exceeded our expectations. So we're not really experiencing that at the moment, and we haven't seen that coming through our results.\nMike Florin: Thank you, Alan. Jess, we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Darren Leung with Macquarie. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nDarren Leung: Thanks for taking the time. Just one question from me. Just a bit of color around the Professional Information Business, 9% growth, please. So it looks like risking appliance is going pretty well, but that would sort of imply that it's affecting the Newswire sort of partners sort of growing a bit slower. Just any color around price or subscribers coming off or anything there, please? Thanks.\nRobert Thomson: Darren, I would make a general observation. That business is itself being transformed by Almar and the team at Dow Jones, you're seeing obviously, the success of Risk and Compliance. Those of you who use Factiva will notice that the interface is changing in a way that's frankly more user-friendly. And the acquisition of both OPIS and Base Chemicals will itself have a positive effect on the Professional Information Business, including Newswires, which will already have a focus on energy, chemicals, renewables, carbon, but that will obviously increase. And similarly with Factiva we're already, as you no doubt know, we have a remarkable array of sources. It's a real Aladdin's cave of content that will both complement the existing offering at OPIS and Base Chemicals, but also overall strengthen those offerings because it's \u2013 I think it's a fair observation \u2013 that in recent years, those businesses haven't been growing at the same rate as Risk and Compliance. But that's why a lot of work is going into transforming them and you'll see the results in the coming quarters, I suspect.\nMike Florin: Thank you, Darren. Jess, we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Han with Morningstar.\nBrian Han: Hi. Two quick ones, if I may. For your streaming services, can you please talk about any recent trends in the conversion rate of trial subscribers to paying prescribers? And Susan on free cash flows, do you expect that working capital buildup to reverse in the next couple of quarters? Or should we expect free cash flow to remain sort of impressed relative to earnings growth?\nRobert Thomson: Well, I'll make just a general observation about streaming it to Foxtel, which is overall, you can see the strong growth and the increasing portion of Foxtel revenue ascribed to streaming, while at the same time, and I think this is particularly noteworthy, where it three-year low with broadcast churn. And so the fears that some had that the increase in streaming would lead to a market deterioration of broadcast or unfounded. Susan?\nSusan Panuccio: And just in relation to free cash flow, yes, we will expect to see some reversal of that working capital as we work through the year, and we would definitely expect to see the second half have very, very strong free cash flow relative to the first.\nMike Florin: Thank you, Brian. Jess, we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Drew Figdor with TIG Advisors. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nEdmonds Bafford: This is Edmonds Bafford for Drew Figdor. I had a quick question around the OPIS and Base Chemical business. Congratulations on actually getting them at a very good valuation, but I was a bit surprised by the timing. I have it kind of the process being done by the first quarter of 2022, and I have it in my model on \u2013 and kind of in the back half of the third quarter. So what is driving that first half of calendar 2022 timing?\nRobert Thomson: Well, Edmonds, obviously, we'd like to get the deals done as quickly as possible because we cherish these companies because we can see how valuable are and what they'll add to Dow Jones and to use core more generally. And you will see in our accounts in coming quarters and years, the value of them. Clearly, we're subject to a regulatory calendar, and there are sometimes variables, unpredictable variables in that. But we're fairly confident that the OPIS deal will close next month and the Base Chemicals will close a couple of months after that.\nEdmonds Bafford: Okay. Thank you very much.\nMike Florin: Thank you. Jess, we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: And at the moment, I do not have any other questions holding. So I'll turn the conference back for any additional or closing comments.\nMike Florin: Great. Well, thank you, Jess, and thank you for all participating. Hope to talk to you soon. Have a wonderful day. Take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time, and have a great day.",

            "name": "Susan Panuccio",
            "content": "Thank you, Robert. As Robert mentioned, we are delighted with our second quarter and first half results, marked by strong revenue growth, further margin expansion and record high total segment EBITDA. Fiscal 2022 second quarter total revenues were over $2.7 billion, up 13%, reflecting strong revenue growth across the company with our three-core pillars, Digital Real Estate Services, Dow Jones and Book Publishing growing 19%. Total segment EBITDA was $586 million, higher than the prior year by 18% and a record high total segment EBITDA for the company since separation. Excluding acquisitions, currency fluctuations and other items disclosed in the release, adjusted revenues and adjusted total segment EBITDA rose 8% and 16%, respectively. Reported EPS were $0.40 as compared to $0.39 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.44 in the quarter compared to $0.34 in the prior year. During the quarter, we commenced our share buyback and announced the acquisition of Base Chemicals. As Robert mentioned, we anticipate both the OPIS and Base Chemicals acquisitions to close in the first half of calendar 2022. Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $456 million, an increase of 35% compared to the prior year. The results include the acquisition of Mortgage Choice and the consolidation of REA India, formerly Elara at REA. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues increased 22%. Segment EBITDA rose 25% to $178 million or 29% on an adjusted basis. We continue to see higher investment spending at Move and at REA, but at a more moderated rate than the first quarter, notably at Move. Move's revenues were $169 million or up 9% year-over-year off the back of 28% revenue growth in the prior year, primarily driven by the historically high lead volumes, which rose over 30% last year. Real estate revenues improved by 13% and accounted for 86% of total revenues. We saw higher revenues from the traditional lead generation business, fueled by higher yields and increased penetration from Market VIP Move's hybrid product. Referral offerings accounted for approximately 32% of total revenues and continued to benefit from record high home prices and higher referral fees despite lower transaction volume. Encouragingly, close rates also improved. Average monthly unique users for the second quarter were $85 million, up 6% over the prior year. Like the first quarter, revenue growth was partially offset by the divestiture of Top Producer in March, negatively impacting revenues by approximately 3 percentage points. Overall, as anticipated, lead volume declines moderated from the first quarter, down 9%, and we are now seeing the emergence of more typical seasonal patterns. Importantly, lead volume is up 18% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Yields remain robust given strong agent demand, which is more than offsetting the impact from lower lead volume. Expanding into adjacencies, including new homes and rentals and establishing partnerships like the recently announced Open Door and Orchid Life[ph] partnerships in the seller's marketplace remain a key focus in the second half. REA had another outstanding quarter with revenues rising 56% year-on-year on a reported basis to $287 million, which includes the $41 million contribution from the Mortgage Choice acquisition and $10 million from REA India. As a reminder, financial service revenues are reflected on a gross basis in the revenue line in our financial disclosures and broker commissions are reflected in costs. REA enjoyed very favorable trends this quarter, including a 22% increase in Australian residential new buy listings double the first quarter rate with Sydney, up 39%; and Melbourne, up 25%, aided by easing of lockdown restrictions. REA also continued to benefit from higher yields, increased depth penetration and product mix. Financial services not only benefited from the integration of Mortgage Choice but also saw record levels of applications and settlements. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $498 million, down approximately 3% on both a reported and adjusted basis and relatively stable from the prior quarter, as the declines in Foxtel residential broadcast revenue and continued COVID impacts on commercial venues were partially offset by strong growth in streaming revenues, which now account for 19% of circulation and subscription revenues. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group reached over 3.9 million at quarter end, up 19% year-over-year, improving from the prior quarter rate by 2 percentage points. Total subscribers, including trialists, were approximately 4.1 million, the highest on record. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher Binge and Kayo subscribers, partially offset by the expected decline in residential broadcast subscribers, albeit at a more moderated rate than the first quarter. In aggregate, total streaming subscribers rose 66% from the prior year to almost $2.3 million, of which approximately $2.2 million were paying subscribers. Streaming products in the aggregate reached 56% of Foxtel's total subscriber base. Binge had an outstanding quarter, increasing its total subscribers to over 1 million similar to Kayo. Paying subscribers more than doubled from the prior year to 928,000. Binge added 126,000 paid subscribers in the quarter, almost double the net adds of the first quarter. Binge's growth continued to be driven by the depth of its content library and the popularity of new shows, including a Binge original show, Love Me. Kayo subscribers followed seasonal patterns with total subscribers slightly down from the first quarter, consistent with the prior two years. The winter codes of AFL and NRL remain key acquisition drivers for Kayo with cricket and motorsports providing essential viewing over the spring and summer months to satisfy the year-round sports fans. Australia's winter sports codes will resume in the third quarter with the return of AFL, NRL, Netball and Supercars. Broadcast churn declined to 13%, the lowest level since the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and down 4.5 percentage points versus last year. The Foxtel team continued to focus on product enhancements and higher ARPU subscribers, resulting in broadcast ARPU increasing almost 3% from the prior year to AUD82 and helping to mitigate subscriber volume declines. Foxtel ended the quarter with 1.6 million residential broadcast subscribers with the sequential decline being the lowest since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Commercial subscribers increased from the first quarter as parts of Australia opened up and were flat versus the prior year at 218,000. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $86 million was down 31%, driven by one-off events such as the Ashes and the phasing of certain sports rights costs together with investments in marketing and technology. Costs were consistent with our outlook commentary, and we continue to expect full year total cost to be relatively flat if not down slightly in local currency, helping to deliver strong cash generation at Foxtel. Moving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones continued its strong performance in the quarter with revenues of $508 million, up 14% compared to the prior year, with digital revenues accounting for 72% of total revenues this quarter, up 2 percentage points from last year. Adjusted revenues, which notably excludes the impact of IBD, rose 10%. Circulation and subscription revenues increased 12%, including 13% circulation revenue growth, primarily reflecting the acquisition of IBD and continued strong volume gains in digital-only subscriptions. Digital net adds improved from the first quarter with Dow Jones adding 148,000 digital-only subscribers, including 115,000 at the Wall Street Journal. Professional Information Business revenues rose 9% and accounted for 25% of revenues. Revenue growth from Risk and Compliance increased 17%, driven by a higher entry rate and strong growth across the Americas, Europe and Asia, and we continue to see modest revenue growth in Newswires. Advertising revenues, which accounted for 28% of revenues this quarter grew 23% to $141 million, the highest quarterly advertising revenue in the last five years. Digital advertising revenues remained robust, up 18% on top of 29% growth in the second quarter of the prior year and accounted for 56% of total advertising revenues. We continue to see strong yield improvement led by direct display. Print advertising continued to surprise on the upside with 29% growth year-over-year, partly due to easy prior year compares but also due to the strength in technology and B2C categories. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 32% to $144 million despite the 43% growth last year, with EBITDA margins expanding by almost four percentage points to over 28%. That represents the highest margin since News Corp's acquisition in 2007. Total costs increased 8% with approximately half due to the consolidation of IBD. On an adjusted basis, revenues and segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 10% and 29%, respectively. At Book Publishing, HarperCollins posted 13% revenue growth to $617 million and segment EBITDA rose 3% to $107 million. Adjusted revenues rose 4% versus the prior year, while adjusted segment EBITDA declined 7%. We are particularly pleased with these results given the global supply chain pressures, which impacted manufacturing and freight costs during the quarter and the tough prior year compare, which saw 65% segment EBITDA growth last year. Results this quarter benefited from the acquisition of HMH, strong frontlist performance and healthy industry dynamics with consumption levels still significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. Digital sales rose 8% this quarter and accounted for 17% of consumer sales with growth driven by downloadable audio books. HMH continued to perform according to plan. For the quarter, HMH contributed $50 million in revenues and $10 million in segment EBITDA. Turning to News Media. The momentum in this segment continued during the quarter, revenues were $638 million, up 11% versus the prior year. The biggest driver to the growth was the continued rebound in the advertising market as well as the strong growth in circulation and subscription revenues helped by the contribution from our recent content licensing revenues. Within the segment, revenues at News Corp Australia and News UK increased 14% and 7%, respectively. Wireless Group and the New York Post also continued to show strong top line growth. Adjusted revenues for the segment increased 10% compared to the prior year. Circulation and subscription revenues rose 9%, benefiting from strong digital subscriber growth, incremental revenues from the platform agreements and cover price increases. Advertising revenues increased 17% compared to the prior year with notable strength in digital and a recovery in print advertising across all our key mastheads. Advertising revenues in Australia with the easing of lockdown conditions rose 11% in both reported and local currency. News UK advertising revenues rose 23% or 21% in local currency with impressive digital advertising growth. In fact, at the sum, digital advertising surpassed print for the first time, driven by improved number of page views and higher yields. In the U.S., the trends at the New York Post remained strong with higher yields helping to drive advertising revenue performance 19% higher year-over-year. Segment EBITDA of $111 million increased $45 million or 68% compared to the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues. News Corp Australia contributed $35 million to the segment EBITDA growth, and both News UK and the New York Post were positive contributors to the growth. Segment margins topped 17%, the highest since we have separated in 2013. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased 65%. I would now like to talk about some themes for the upcoming quarter. While we remain very encouraged with our strong year-to-date results and our trajectory thus far, we are clearly mindful of the uncertainty and lack of visibility from the ongoing impacts of the pandemic, including the potential cost impacts from continued supply chain pressures, particularly in Book Publishing and our mastheads as well as wage inflation and talent retention across the company. At Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for January rose 14%. REA anticipates growth rates to slow in the second half as it cycled strong prior period listing volumes and potential impacts around the upcoming federal election. Please refer to REA for more specific outlook commentary. At Move, we continue to see strong yields despite lower inventory. We expect to continue to reinvest in Move as we drive the core business and expand into relevant adjacencies, particularly in new homes and rentals. We expect the year-over-year growth rate of investment at Move in the second half to be relatively similar to the second quarter, but notably lower than the first quarter rate. In Subscription Video Services, we remain pleased with the ongoing performance of the streaming products and the efforts to improve broadcast ARPU and churn. We continue to expect full year costs in local currency to be relatively flat versus the prior year, and we continue to monitor commercial venue trends given the recent spike in COVID cases in the region. At Dow Jones, overall trends across the business remains strong with advertising and subscription growth continuing to perform well. We expect to continue to reinvest in digital to drive consumer subscriptions and to further enhance our professional information business offerings. And to reiterate, we expect both the OPIS and Base Chemicals acquisitions to close in the first half of calendar 2022, and we will incur onetime transaction costs related to these acquisitions. In Book Publishing, similar to the first half, overall trends remain favorable despite lapping the benefits from COVID-19 and strong growth from the sales of the Bridgeton series in the third quarter last year and the ongoing supply chain pressures. At News Media, overall advertising trends remain favorable, and we remain cautiously optimistic about the second half, albeit recognizing that visibility is limited. We continue to expect incremental revenues into nine figures from the recent platform agreements with the majority of that allocated to News Media. We do expect some reinvestment to the segment in the second half given the strong year-to-date performance focused on new product initiatives, marketing and the News UK TV project. On other, we expect costs in the second half to be slightly higher than the first half due to the phasing of certain costs. And lastly, we continue to expect full year CapEx to be up $100 million versus the prior year, albeit we are trending lower than that in the first half. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A. And Kane, I'd just like to add for the phasing of those content cost, with licensing costs that we've got in \u2013 so Q2 was slightly higher than Q1, and we would expect the second half of the year to be slightly higher again as they continue to ramp, particularly given showcase hasn't launched in the U.S. And Entcho, I'd just like to add to Robert's comments in relation to News Media. And he's absolutely right. I mean the transformation of that segment, in particular, has been great, and we've been really delighted with it. And just to give some context of the $65 million increase in revenue, $42 million of that was advertising, $23 million was circulation and subscriptions, which is where those content licensing fees are. So a lot of it was advertising \u2013 a lot of that's being fueled by digital advertising and the work that the teams have done around driving those audiences and converting their businesses to digital and benefiting from obviously strong yields. And also the cost work that they've done, they've done a huge amount of cost work and heavy lifting over the past couple of years, which has really helped to underpin those results. So it does give us confidence about how those businesses are going to continue going forward. And Craig, just on your question. So reported costs were up 11% and adjusted costs were up 5%. So just in relation to the platform fees, I mean we are working through, obviously, driving continued audiences and looking and working with those tech platforms in order to build out those audiences. And so that will help us contribute to growing the advertising client. And particularly if we can grow the overall subscriber pie, then we've got a high-quality audience that we can look at. Just in relation to the comments that other companies may have made around supply chain pressures and advertising. We \u2013 as you mention, we haven't seen that actually impact us from an advertising perspective. We've had great growth actually across digital, and we've been really pleasantly surprised with the bounce back of print advertising, obviously off relatively low comps from the prior year, but it still has exceeded our expectations. So we're not really experiencing that at the moment, and we haven't seen that coming through our results. And just in relation to free cash flow, yes, we will expect to see some reversal of that working capital as we work through the year, and we would definitely expect to see the second half have very, very strong free cash flow relative to the first."

            "name": "Robert Thomson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. We are delighted that the considerable momentum shown over the past two years has continued unabated in the most recent quarter. While the first quarter was the most profitable first quarter since our rebirth in 2013. The second quarter was the most profitable of any quarter with record revenues and record profitability. Products are certainly deserved by our employees for their collective and unstinting effort, energy and creativity. We are all proud to be furthering a tradition of purpose in principle created by and curated by Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch. Credit too must go to a Board that has provided thoughtful prescient guidance during a particularly challenging period for most media companies in most countries. Revenues for the quarter exceeded $2.7 billion, a 13% increase year-over-year, while profitability rose 18% to $586 million and net income reached $262 million. In the first half of this fiscal year, News Corp amassed nearly $1 billion of total segment EBITDA, a 30% surge while reported net income was $529 million compared to $308 million in the previous year. The platform agreements with Big Tech continued to benefit our bottom line. In addition to our substantial deals with Google and Facebook, we have extended and expanded our multiyear global agreement with Apple, which is expected to be an important source of subscriptions and of advertising revenue for our new sites around the world. There is no doubt that Tim Cook and Eddy Cue have a visceral enlightened understanding of the importance of professional journalism, and we genuinely appreciate their personal and corporate commitment. Our businesses are flourishing. There was again strong performance at Digital Real Estate Services, Dow Jones and Book Publishing and a rapid expansion of profitability at our News Media segment. We are delighted that agreement has been reached to acquire the OPIS and Base Chemicals businesses after their required sale for antitrust reasons. They will surely add to the luster of the already lucrative Dow Jones Professional Information Business. Those acquisitions should formally close in the first half of calendar 2022. We had indicated that the strength of our cash position and our robust growth would enable us to make opportunistic purchases, and that has come to fruition and at reasonable prices that we believe will benefit all our shareholders. That studied strategic expansion has been complemented by a $1 billion share buyback program already well underway and which we expect will provide ongoing value to our investors. Turning first to Digital Real Estate Services. It is manifest that there is a global shift in the housing market, with families wanting more space, a higher quality of life and the opportunity to work from home, which is simply not feasible without a home. Unsurprisingly, there were 6.12 million existing home sales in the U.S. last year, the highest figure in 15 years, and that total came despite the disruption of COVID in viewing and reviewing homes. We see much macro strength ahead in a market that is still far from being fully digitized and should benefit from rising employment and from interest rates that while on an incline, remain close to historic lows. In the second quarter, Digital Real Estate Services reported 35% revenue growth and 25% segment EBITDA growth. Listing volume improved noticeably at REA. While realtor.com reinvested in valuable adjacencies and continue to generate strong revenue growth despite relatively low U.S. housing inventory levels. As of December, according to comScore, realtor traffic growth exceeded that of Zillow and Trulia for 23 straight months, which is vindication of our resolute focus on our core mission and customers. We were not mired in the capricious calendar sec of House Flipping. In Australia, REA reported revenue growth of 56%, which includes the integration of Mortgage Choice. The tapering of rapid house price rises has been accompanied by a flurry of new listings, even though the COVID situation remained somewhat unpredictable. And one state, Western Australia has chosen not-so-splended isolation. The Australian government is expecting an economic renaissance over the next year or so, and that should benefit REA and all of our businesses in that country. Dow Jones had a superb quarter with 14% revenue growth and a 32% increase in segment EBITDA at $144 million. Bear in mind that these outstanding numbers come on top of a particularly strong quarter a year ago, underscoring the scale of Dow Jones achievements. We are successfully building upon success. Subscriptions expanded across the Dow Jones portfolio, and there was 23% advertising revenue growth in the quarter. Risk and Compliance reported a revenue increase of 17%, the 26th successive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. To emphasize, 26 successive quarters of double-digit revenue growth. Total Dow Jones subscriptions, including IBD, rose 17% in the quarter, reaching approximately 4.7 million. And the Wall Street Journal's total subs exceeded 3.6 million with nearly 3 million of them being digital-only, an increase of 19% year-over-year. To be clear, these are core subscribers who are signing up to a premium product at a premium retail price. Our ability to offer high-margin professional products will certainly be enhanced by the integration of OPIS and Base Chemicals, both of which have still growing traditional businesses and rapidly expanding offerings in renewables. We plan to use Dow Jones expertise to create truly verifiable carbon products and prices in a market that is patently immature and lacking in transparency and veracity. And we expect the pressure for credible disclosure to be an additional source of revenue for our Risk and Compliance business. For clarity, these two new businesses have revenue bases that are close to 100% digital and recurring. They are highly profitable with healthy revenue growth and modest CapEx requirements. We expect that investors will be able to see clearly the positive impact in coming quarters. That these deals were done at rather attractive multiples is self-evidently a bonus for our investors. Book Publishing posted record numbers a year ago and the growth continued inexorably in Q2. This continuing success is thanks to the diverse front list and deep backlist at HarperCollins, augmented over the past year by the opportunistic acquisition of the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Books & Media segment. Notable success was seen with Ree Drummond's The Pioneer Woman Cooks-Super Easy! and Dave Grohl's, The Storyteller. Looking ahead, we have high hopes for the Paris Apartment by Lucy Foley, another David Williams installment in is superlative best-selling World's Worst series and what may well be the most telling book of the Trump administration, One Damn Thing After Another by Bill Barr, who was Attorney General and had a remarkable career before that service. Having read the text, I can report that this is a brilliantly written, profoundly important work, which will share thoughtful light on a turbulent period in the country's history. Also note in the second quarter, Harlequin launched Harlequin Plus, a direct-to-consumer digital subscription service that will appeal to romantics around the world. The app and website will give subscribers an opportunity to have a literally liaison with book bundles, e-books, movies and games. This multimedia offering is yet another example of the clever contemporary leveraging of our world-class content. News Media had a particularly strong quarter with segment EBITDA up 68%. That outstanding performance reflected growth in advertising, the benefits of the deals with the Big Tech platforms, sensible sustained cost discipline and the benefit of savvy product and technology investments made in recent years. The robust advertising results up 17% in the quarter, were evident at all major mastheads across both print and digital. Our digital trends are particularly pleasing, which speaks to the value of our global network and improvements in our understanding of permission data. It also reflects the sage leadership of Michael Miller in Australia, Rebecca Brooks in the U.K. and both Sean Giancola and Keith Poole at the New York Post. News Corp Australia showed a highly noteworthy improvement in profit contribution with digital paid subscriptions scaling to nearly 910,000 and the intelligent expansion into digital adjacencies. The New York Post had an especially successful Q2 with an appreciable contribution to segment EBITDA, thanks to a resounding advertising performance and its vast and growing digital audience. We recorded 160 million unique users in the months of December. The post increase in profit contribution has, it is fair to say, it exceeded even our demanding expectations. News U.K. had its highest second quarter profit contribution since fiscal 2011, helped by an acceleration in digital paid subscriber growth. In addition, the Sun's traffic has surged with global monthly uniques for December, up 25% to $163 million, and our fledgling U.S. Sun site growing rapidly. It's worth reiterating and pondering for a moment, some of those astounding numbers. Based on internal metrics, as of December, we had 160 million uniques for the New York Post, 163 million uniques for the Sun, over 80 million uniques for realtor.com and 123 million uniques with Dow Jones. That is certainly a firm foundation for network growth. In the U.K., Wireless made a positive contribution to News Media's revenue and segment EBITDA growth. We're also looking forward to the launch of talkTV, which will be available on platforms, including linear TV and OTT. The channel will take full advantage of our talent and content in the U.K. and via the global deal with Piers Morgan, our platforms in the U.S. and Australia. It will be high quality, low cost and certainly impactful. Subscription Video services benefit from increasing subscriptions and decreasing churn. Thanks to the ongoing appeal of our streaming platforms, the high quality of our technology, our increasingly sophisticated understanding of audience data and the depth and broad appeal of our unparalleled entertainment, sports and news offerings. Sports seasonality is always a factor in Australia, but our total streaming subscribers expanded by 66% year-over-year, with Binge exceeding 1 million subscribers and Flash, our news aggregation service in its infancy. In total, as of December, we had almost 2.3 million streaming subs, representing 56% of Foxtel's total subscriber base, which was 4.1 million. It's worth noting that in addition to the increase in streaming subs, broadcast churn was at a three-year note. The team, led by Siobhan McKenna and Patrick Delaney is executing successfully on our strategy to scale streaming, having developed world-class technology and compelling user interface. We are increasingly confident in Foxtel's future and thus actively looking at ways to maximize its value and ensure that we can build on that success. We are delighted with the patent progress at News Corp, but certainly not complacent as we contemplate the exciting potential in our company, which we will relentlessly realize for our investors. Our trajectory has been transformed despite the vicissitudes of the virus is a testament to the inherent potential of the businesses and the enduring culture of the company. There is no doubt that we will thoughtfully review our current structure and be institutionally introspective on behalf of shareholders. We have made many timely disposals and self-evidently successful purchases and are committed to maximizing value for those who have invested in our company. While our profits and revenues are at record levels, we are certainly far from stated and will never be complacent. We firmly believe the best quarters and years are yet to come. Now for more details about the most profitable quarter since our reincarnation in 2013, Susan Panuccio. Kane, I'll take those two questions. First of all, the macro trends at REALTOR generally are specious. I mean, clearly, there's some fluctuation in the U.S. housing market. But the overall impetus for families and individuals to buy larger homes to work from home to move location to take advantage of labor opportunities and certainly of those job opportunities and mobility when as a positive of employees are all positive influences. First-time mortgages are still at near historic lows. And so financially, home purchases make sense, particularly as rents are rising. You'll not see reduction in refis, but that's not a market to which we have exposure. And the digitalization of the U.S. property market is still at an early stage, a very early stage and we're poised to take advantage of the opportunity in the short, the medium and the long term. As for the big digital payments, you are starting to see the run rate, but it does \u2013 those payments alone are really base payments, and so they don't take into account advertising and shared advertising and generally speaking, the improvement in the commercial rates for distribution of our content nor do they yet reflect the impact of the enhanced deal with Apple. Well, on the first question around the News Media numbers, clearly, the big digital agreements had an impact. But I think to focus on that alone is to actually not give you credit to the companies with a News UK, News Australia or the New York Post in the way that those businesses have been transformed in recent years. And it has been a heavy lift, as you know, in Australia, we had to close many of our print editions and regions and communities and enhance our digital service. So those are more fundamental to the transform fortunes. And when you look at the increase in EBITDA over the past year \u2013 the same quarter last year, 11.5%; most recent quarter, 17.4%; News UK advertising, up 21% in local currency; News Australia advertising, up 11%; New York Post, up 19%. These are fundamental shifts in the businesses. And there's no reason to think that those fundamental shifts won't have an enduring impact. As for streaming, the Australian situation is rather different to the prevailing trends in the U.S. Foxtel really is the village square for video. And we have many partners there in a way that's not common in the U.S., Australia, in that sense is rather like the Galapagos Islands, a unique viewing ecosystem. And the recent rapid growth in BINGE is actually exceeding our expectations. And Kayo is a very different sports streaming service with the most important watchable winter sports, along with the increasingly compelling Formula 1 and supercars, among many others. That complete content package is certainly and consistently are compelling. I mean that's appointment viewing day after day, week after week, month after month. That's not churn data, churn some. [ph] Well, I will make a quick observation about inflation and then Susan will follow up on both subjects. The inflationary pressures vary segment by segment and country by country. And this was obviously going to be an important issue of challenge. And clearly, from quite a way ago, not transitory. And so we started our planning long ago, asking each of the businesses to be cost conscious to look at whether open positions needed to be filled to be focused on retention payments in an intelligent way to ensure, though, that our teams also feel as though they're part of a purposeful journey which they most certainly are. The cultural component of loyalty complements the complement component. Susan? Susan, would you like to present? Darren, I would make a general observation. That business is itself being transformed by Almar and the team at Dow Jones, you're seeing obviously, the success of Risk and Compliance. Those of you who use Factiva will notice that the interface is changing in a way that's frankly more user-friendly. And the acquisition of both OPIS and Base Chemicals will itself have a positive effect on the Professional Information Business, including Newswires, which will already have a focus on energy, chemicals, renewables, carbon, but that will obviously increase. And similarly with Factiva we're already, as you no doubt know, we have a remarkable array of sources. It's a real Aladdin's cave of content that will both complement the existing offering at OPIS and Base Chemicals, but also overall strengthen those offerings because it's \u2013 I think it's a fair observation \u2013 that in recent years, those businesses haven't been growing at the same rate as Risk and Compliance. But that's why a lot of work is going into transforming them and you'll see the results in the coming quarters, I suspect. Well, I'll make just a general observation about streaming it to Foxtel, which is overall, you can see the strong growth and the increasing portion of Foxtel revenue ascribed to streaming, while at the same time, and I think this is particularly noteworthy, where it three-year low with broadcast churn. And so the fears that some had that the increase in streaming would lead to a market deterioration of broadcast or unfounded. Susan? Well, Edmonds, obviously, we'd like to get the deals done as quickly as possible because we cherish these companies because we can see how valuable are and what they'll add to Dow Jones and to use core more generally. And you will see in our accounts in coming quarters and years, the value of them. Clearly, we're subject to a regulatory calendar, and there are sometimes variables, unpredictable variables in that. But we're fairly confident that the OPIS deal will close next month and the Base Chemicals will close a couple of months after that."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and welcome to the News Corp First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Indiscernible] will be on a listen-only basis. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mike Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. You may begin, sir.\nMike Florin: Thank you very much, Bobby. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp 's fiscal first quarter 2022 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and is now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive, and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We will open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call will include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said.  News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to diver contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements, such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release. With that, I will pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\nRobert Thomson: Thank you, Mike. We are journeying through the contours of our complex commercial landscape that has been a staling test of the metal of companies and countries. For us, the first quarter was the most profitable of its kind since the relaunch of News Corp in 2013. Continuing the trends that were evidenced in the last financial year and building on those rapid rates of growth. And we continue to have much confidence in our immediate and long-term prospects. I would like to honor the work done by our employees around the world.  They have cut with extraordinary exigencies and provided a prevalence service to their customers and to their communities that the Company's purpose has endured and indeed thrive through such challenging times is a tribute to repute and Lachlan Murdoch and the culture they created and have curated. Revenues for the quarter were $2.5 billion, an increase of 18%, while our profitability rose 53%. I should repeat that figure for clarity, profitability rose 53%. It is worth bearing in mind that this increase follows a 21% increase in profitability in the first quarter last year. Every one of our key operating segments posted significant revenue expansion and strong segment EBITDA growth. I would like to reiterate that our Board authorized $1 billion stock repurchase program in September. As we previously indicated, we have refrained from executing on the buyback during this quiet period, but that period officially ends in coming days. It is a very different buyback to that which was approved in 2013, when we were unsure about share dislocation at the time of the separation from Fox. We now have confidence in our performance, our resilience, our ability to generate cash for our investors, and our potential.  Bolstering that confidence is the fact that our recent acquisitions are exceeding our expectations and our core segments are thriving. We now have an optionality across the businesses and significantly more flexibility in our ability to return capital to our investors. One note where they saw in that optionality is our ability to capitalize on the Peyton success of the Foxtel streaming strategy, which was highlighted during the Foxtel strategy day. We have been working through the potential permutations and will continue to provide updates as appropriate. In the meantime, it is worth noting that subscription video services segment EBITDA, rose a rather healthy 46% in the First Quarter.  As for our campaign to hold big digital accountable, clearly there have been pronounced and profound developments in recent times. We are pleased with the agreements we have reached and the work it has progressed on revaluing content. But we have always regarded the digital ad market as a separate issue. And the release of an underacted compliant by the Texas Attorney General last month, has highlighted the extent of the problem. The manipulative language was deeply concerning. We are obviously considering our position on this important matter and want to ensure that in the future, the Admark properly recognized the value of our audience and of our inventory.  Now, turning to the first quarter. Dow Jones recorded a 15% increase in revenues compared to the same quarter last year, with segment EBITDA surging 32%. That profitability was a record for the first quarter. Revenue at Risk & Compliance grew 26%, meaning that we have had 25 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Overall, the Professional Information Business experienced a solid 13% increase in revenues. And that should expand when we complete the acquisition of OPIS, which is expected to close early next calendar year. The past few weeks have highlighted the importance of intelligence about energy and carbon markets. and we fully expect to become a world leader in that area.  I've been talking at Dow Jones expanded a first quarter record of 29%, with digital advertising climbing 38%. Meanwhile, Subscription growth remains robust with a 19% increase across our consumer products to approximately 4.6 million with circulation revenues rising approximately 13%. The ongoing transformation of Dow Jones continues to pace, with digital now accounting for 75% of the segment's revenues. Digital Real Estate Services was again, a source of express growth with move, the operator of realtor.com, seeing revenue surge 30%. The U.S. housing market is sturdy with price rises moderating, more properties coming to the market, and longer listing times, all of which work in our favor.  As for the house flipping flip-flop by Zillow, we have always been focused on the digital markets, not on bricks-and-mortar and certainly not on sorting out the septic tank or papering over wall cracks. We concentrated on our core competency and never took on excessive Balance Sheet risk or chased what appear to us to be very low margin returns. It appears Zillow now finally understands what we always news to -- knew to be true. And that said, as an open platform, we do see opportunities to be a marketplace for the industry, including iBuyers such as Open-door, providing them with the same kind of dependable and trusted information that agents and consumers alike have valued.  In Australia, REA had a remarkable First Quarter with revenues burgeoning 62%. That is correct, 62%. Australia has slowly been emancipated from severe lockdowns, and access to homes for sale has been limited. So, we believe that positive market conditions will largely continue as the country returns to a semblance of normalcy. One Harbinger is that site traffic was strong in Q1 was 129 million average visits, up 13% year-over-year. That is essentially an average of five visits for every person in the country. That book business is thriving and even more so, with the successful integration of HMH.  Excluding the $50 million contribution of HMH, book sales have reset in the post-pandemic period, to around 22% higher than the same period in 2019. There has been a resurgence of interest in printed books as their tactility and talismanic quality is increasingly important at a time when many people have screen fatigue. We sold notable success in Q1 with the Bridgerton Series, The Authoritarian Moment by Ben Shapiro, and the Cellist by Daniel Silva.  In the months ahead, we have high hopes for the Pioneer Woman Coke super-easy by Ree Drummond. The storyteller by Dave Grohl, and Gangster Granny strikes again by David Williams. In subscription video services, the first quarter built on the significant progress made in FY '21 in reshaping the Foxtel group as a streaming LED business, would improve revenues, profitability, and cash generation. For the second consecutive quarter, growth in Kayo and Binge revenues clearly offset the not-unexpected modest decline in Retail Broadcast revenues. As of September 30, total subscribers were approximately 4 million, up 18% year-over-year. This includes a record 2.2 million total streaming subscribers, up 68% thanks to Kayo and Binge. While there will always be a certain seasonality in sports viewing in Australia, Kayo is quickly establishing itself as a year-round provider as it now offers 50 sports in total, and is furnishing and gauging off-season programming for the football [Indiscernible] ahead of the new season early next year.  Foxtel 's appeal was further broadened with the launch of the Flash Streaming News Service, featuring a [Indiscernible] collection of 20 local and global news sources with content for all political persuasion. That breadth combined with a cutting-edge world-class user interface adds to the luster of Foxtel, and is indicative of its [Indiscernible]. We're now obviously in a position to be even more ambitious. So, Foxtel and are always seeking to maximize its undoubted potential. News Media was a strong contributor to News Corp profitability this quarter with segment EBITDA of $34 million in the quarter after a loss in the same period last year.  That is a tribute to Rebekah Brooks, Michael Miller, and Sean Giancola (ph.), and their talented committed teams. There transformation was in part due to the benefits of our deals with the major tech platforms, notably Google and Facebook. Together, these deals will contribute annual revenues in the 9-figures to News Corp, clearly putting our News businesses on a more profitable path. Despite the successive lock-downs, our Australian business is faring well, showing significant improvement in profitability thanks to cost initiatives and rising digital advertising revenues, and used milestones subscription, which improved to 850,000, up 24% year-over-year.  News U.K. performed admirably, particularly in advertising. Both digital and print and in subscriptions. The Times and Sunday Times, contributed meaningfully to profits and their digital paid subscriptions have now reached 380,000. Wireless and radio network increased its revenue and profit contribution with exclusive football broadcasts, drawing large audiences and increased advertising. Wireless reported record rates of 6 million unique listeners per week according to the most recent, rage our survey.  A broadcast expertise is assisting our other media properties in the UK and will complement Talk TV, which is scheduled to launch in the early months of 2022 with Piers Morgan taking a global role across our broadcast and news properties. We believe Talk TV will be contemporary, low-cost, and high impact. In the U.S. the New York post, once legendary loss-making, is now contributing to segment profitability. And is an increasingly important voice in the national political divide.  Its digital network reached 151 million unique users in September, almost half of the U.S. population, according to Google analytics. Digital Advertising revenue was 28% higher compared to the same quarter last year. And print advertising increased 62%, recovering from the COVID related lows of last year. The Company built on its momentum from last fiscal in the first quarter, and we remain optimistic about growth prospects going forward.  Clearly, there are macroeconomic pressures affecting certain companies, but our increasingly digital orientation has bolstered our ability to weather the pandemic and deal with the economic uncertainty in some of our markets. We are confident in our employees, confident in our businesses, and very confident in our prospects. And now, for further detail -- for further details and invaluable insight, I cede the floor to Susan Panuccio.\nSusan Panuccio: Thank you, Robert. As Robert mentioned, strong operation dimension that, made last year so successful has continued into our first fiscal quarter results. Fiscal 2022, first quarter total revenues, were over $2.5 billion up 18% marked by higher revenue growth across all our key segments, notably at Digital Real Estate Services. Total segment EBITDA, was $410 million up 53% versus the prior year. The highest quarterly growth rate since 2017, despite the challenges from the lockdowns in Australia and comparing against 21% total segment EBITDA growth in the prior year.  Excluding acquisitions, currency fluctuations, and other items disclosed in the release, adjusted revenues and adjusted total segment EBITDA, rose 10% and 47% respectively. Reported EPS were $0.33 as compared to $0.06 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.23 in the quarter compared to $0.08 in the prior year. Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services, segment revenues were $426 million, an increase of 47% compared to the prior year, on an adjusted basis, revenues increased 29%. Segment EBITDA rose 16% to a $138 million or 21% on an adjusted basis.  Despite the higher investment spending at move and REA, and tough comparisons against the prior year cost declines implemented to counter the impact of COVID. Move 's revenues were $180 million, a 30% increase year-over-year, with real estate revenues rising 39% and accounting for 87% of total revenues. Revenue growth was again led by the traditional lead-generation business benefiting from strong agent demand and improved sell-through and yields. We're also seeing early success with the roll-out of Market VIP, a hybrid product offered to Move's top-performing agents.  The referral model saw strong revenue growth, and accounted for approximately 32% of revenues driven by record high in values and increased transaction volume. Revenue growth was partially offset by the divestiture of Top Producer in March, negatively impacting revenues by $5 million or 4%. We time prices at record highs and supply limited, lead volumes fell approximately 18% compared to over 40% growth last year, all be it, with lead still around 15% higher than pre -pandemic levels.  Encouragingly, new listings are up from their recent lows and we have seen moderation of lead volume declines in September and October. Pricing remains robust given strong agent demand. REA had an exceptional quarter with revenues rising 62% year-over-year to $246 million including $7 million of 3% positive impact from currency fluctuations. Results benefited from $43 million of contribution from the Mortgage choice acquisition and $8 million from the consolidation of Elara, which is being re-branded to REA India.  The underlying performance was very encouraging, with Australian residential revenue growth driven by an increasing penetration, price increase, and favorable product mix. The revenue growth was also driven by an 11% increase in new buy listings despite lock-downs across multiple states, including restrictions on physical inspections in Melbourne. Melbourne listings rose 79%, while Sydney fell 7%. Financial services also benefited from highest settlements and submissions.  Please refer to REA 's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment, revenues for the quarter were $510 million up 3% versus the prior year benefiting from higher streaming revenues and the modest benefit from positive currency fluctuations, partially offset by lower broadcast and commercial subscription revenues. On an adjusted basis, revenues were flat. Total closing paid subscribers across Foxtel reached nearly 3.9 million as the quarter end up 17% year-over-year, with total subscribers including trialists approximately 4 million.  The increase was driven by continued growth in paid streaming subscribers, partially offset by a decline in broadcast subscribers and commercial subscriptions, which were exacerbated by the impact of the lockdowns in Australia. [Indiscernible] end of the quarter with approximately 1.1 million and 885,000 total subscribers respectively. In the aggregate, total paying streaming subscribers were up more than 69% to nearly $2.1 million and total streaming subscribers including trialist reached over $2.2 million.  Streaming products in the aggregate reached approximately 54% of Foxtel 's total paid subscriber base. Broadcast turn improved declining to 14% from 14.6% last year and 17.1% in the fourth quarter. Broadcast ARPU increased 4% from the prior year to $82 Australian, mitigating subscriber volume declines consistent with Foxtel strategy of focusing on higher ARPU subscribers and fewer low cost offers. Foxtel continues to see an improvement in subscriber mix as a percentage of higher-valued long continued subscribers continue to rise with a corresponding decline in churn rates.  Net declines for residential broadcast subscribers moderated sequentially with 1.6 million broadcast subscribers at quarter end, commercial subscribers were down over 30% from the fourth quarter to 162,000. And we do anticipate a recovery for commercial subscribers in the second half with the easing of restrictions. Product innovation continued with the launch of iQ5 and IP-enabled set-top box, the announcement of plans to partner with Comcast and Sky on the launch of Sky Glass, and the launch of a third streaming product slash, a dedicated live news streaming service featuring more than 20 local and global live new services. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was a $114 million, up 46% compared to the prior year.  The improvement was primarily driven by $34 million of lower sports costs benefiting from the $36 million of negative impact seen in the First Quarter of fiscal 2021, related to deferred sports costs from the Fourth Quarter of fiscal 2020. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased 42%. Moving onto Dow Jones, Dow Jones delivered revenue of $444 million up 15% compared to the prior year with digital revenues accounting for 75% of total revenues this quarter, up 2% points from the prior year. Adjusted revenues, which notably excludes the impact of IBD, rose 9%. As Robert mentioned, both revenues and profitability with the highest First Quarter results since this acquisition.  Circulation and subscription revenues increased 12%, including 13% circulation revenue growth, primarily reflecting the acquisition of IBD and the continued strong volume gains in digital-only subscriptions. Dow Jones subscriptions to its consumer products increased to an average of approximately 4.6 million in the quarter, up 18% from the prior year. Off that, over 3.6 million were digital-only subscriptions, up 24% year-over-year. IBD accounted for 100,000 digital-only subscriptions, and a 128,000 in total subscriptions. Professional information business revenues rose 13% accelerating from the prior quarter. Revenue growth. From Risk & Compliance increased 26% driven by a higher entry rate and strong growth across the Americas, Europe, and Asia. We also saw modest improvement at [Indiscernible]. Advertising revenues, which accounted for 20% of revenues this quarter, grew 29% to $90 million, the highest First Quarter growth rate since acquisition.  Digital Advertising trends remained robust, up 38% on top of 14% growth in the First Quarter of the prior year an accounted for 61% of total advertising revenues. All categories performed above expectations, most notably in technology and finance, and we continue to see improving yields. Print advertising revenues were robust, rising 17% year-over-year, partially benefiting from the COVID-19 comparison. Dow Jones segment, EBITDA for the quarter rose 32% to $95 million with EBITDA margins improving by almost 3% points to 21%, despite an 11% increase in total cost, which included IBD and higher employee costs.  On an adjusted basis, segment revenues and EBITDA for the quarter rose 9% and 24% respectively. At book publishing, HarperCollins posted 19% revenue growth to $546 million and segment EBITDA rose 20% to $85 million. Adjusted revenue and EBITDA rose 7% and 10% respectively versus the prior year. Despite a difficult prior-year comparison, book consumption levels remain elevated, overall consumption across the industry remains higher than pre -pandemic levels and materially above the historical low single digit type revenue growth. This quarter benefited from a rebound in Christian Publishing, which was more exposed to the closure of retail stores in the prior year and higher sales in the UK.  General Books saw healthy growth benefiting from new releases coupled with higher backlist sales from the Bridgerton series by Julia Quinn. Digital sales raised 5% this quarter and accounted for 21% of consumer sales. The Barclays represented 62% of revenues, up 2% points from last year, underscoring the importance of the steady high-margin revenue stream and a key factor behind the acquisition of HMH. HMH integration continue to progress well, and is in the process of being integrated into a full imprint structure within HarperCollins.  We remain on track with our savings target of $20 million to be delivered within the first 2 years. Overall, HMH contributed $50 million in revenue, and $6 million in segment EBITDA this quarter. Turning to News Media, revenues for the quarter were $576 million up 18% versus the prior year, benefiting from the continued recovery in the advertising market, strong growth in circulation and subscription revenues, and a $25 million or 5% positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Within the segment, revenues at News UK and News Corp Australia increased 18% and 14% respectively.  Wireless Group and the New York post also showed strong top-line growth. Adjusted revenues to the segment increased 13% compared to the prior-year. Circulation and subscription revenues rose 16%, which included a $30 million or 5% benefit from currency fluctuations, strong digital subscriber growth, incremental revenues from our platform agreements, and cover price increases. Advertising revenues increased $39 million or 21% compared to the prior year. Benefiting from the COVID-19 comparison with particular strength in digital across our businesses.  On a reported basis, advertising revenues in Australia rose 5% or 2% in local currency, despite the negative impacts from the lockdowns. While News U.K. advertising revenues rose 36% or 28% in local currency. In the U.S., the trends remained strong with the New York Post posting 32% advertising revenue growth. Segment EBITDA of $34 million increased $56 million compared to the prior year, reflecting higher revenues, cost savings at News U.K. and News Corp Australia, and a modest positive contribution from the New York Post. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased $52 million to $30 million. I would now like to talk about some themes to the upcoming quarter.  Notwithstanding our strong results in the prior year, we remain encouraged by overall trends. Like many companies, we are closely monitoring supply-chain issues, particularly in book publishing in our mastheads as well as the impact of wage inflation on talent and retention. At Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential listing through October rose 16% and we are encouraged those restrictions on physical inspections, notably Melbourne [Indiscernible] east.  At move, we continue to see strong yield improvement despite the neat-term challenge on lead volume given the ongoing supply issues, like the first quarter, we expect to continue to reinvest in Move as we drive the core business and expand into relevant adjacencies. The rate of cost increase year -- one year in the first quarter was exacerbated by the COVID-19 savings initiatives in the prior-year across headcount and marketing, we expect more moderate year-over-year cost increases for the balance of the year.  In subscription video services, we remain pleased with the ongoing performance of Kayo and BINGE and the efforts to improve broadcast ARPU and Churn. We do expect seasonality in Kayo given the end of key winter codes, but look forward to our summer schedule with the Ashes and the Cricket World Cup in the second quarter. Costs are expected to be higher in the second quarter, most notably for entertainment and sports rights, as well as some higher marketing to support the launch of Flash, the new streaming offering. Overall, we continue to expect cost for the full year to be relatively stable in local currency.  At Dow Jones, overall trends across the business remains strong with advertising and subscriptions growth continuing to perform well. In book publishing, overall trends remained favorable despite lapping the benefits from COVID-19. We have a strong release lineup in the Second Quarter including titles from Ree Drummond [Indiscernible] At News Media, we continue to expect the segment to show profit improvement, partially benefit from the recent content licensing revenues.  We do expect some additional costs in the UK as we expand more into video content and leverage our key brands and mastered. CapEx was modestly higher in the first quarter, and we continue to expect full-year CapEx to be up a $100 million versus the prior year. And finally, we remain focused on driving strong and positive free cash flow generation for the year, with the first quarter free cash flow impacted by the timing of working capital payments. With that, let me hand it over to the Operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions]. If you're using a speakerphone, please make sure the mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. [Operator instructions]. Please limit your questions to one at a time. We will pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions. Our first question comes from Entcho Raykovski with Credit Suisse.\nEntcho Raykovski : Hi Robert. Hi Susan. I've got one question, one just very quick follow up. Basically, you comment on maximizing value at Foxtel. Obviously, this has been widely reported in the press, but is an odd [Indiscernible] option you considering. And what's the potential timing on whatever considerations do you have? And then secondly, just, I know Robert you mentioned, [Indiscernible] winding down. They [Indiscernible] model. Do you expect to see any impact on Move? I mean, could that perhaps get [Indiscernible] closer to some agent to perhaps an indecent franchise bio Move, any comments would be helpful.\nRobert Thomson: Entcho, on Foxtel. Look, it's inappropriate at this moment to discuss specific to the review. But clearly, we and our partners at Telstra recognized that the prospects of Foxtel have changed fundamentally and that we have a streaming success story. Look, we've had cutting edge world cost tech and we have a user interface. But as vastly improved and we have a team led by Patrick and [Indiscernible], and they will drive further success most surely. Think about how the narrative has changed over the past two years.  As you recall, we had been asked about the skeptics whether we would need to put more money into the Company. And let's examine what happened. We took a majority stake because we believed more clarity, more responsibility, more decisiveness was necessary. We've used our media platforms to complement and promote the quality of Foxtel. Our team made some tough decisions to rationalize, made some smart decisions on streaming and systems and here we are today. So, whatever we do we will not be naive, naivety is not now [Indiscernible].  And as for Zillow, obviously, we had discussed ourselves getting into bricks-and-mortar but we had a very clear sense of the digital priorities. Don't forget that we had revived -- renovated the distinctly unfashionably realtor.com. We bought it on the cheap net about $700 million. What's it worth now, $6 billion [Indiscernible] What will it be worth in 5 years as the inevitable digital march continues [Indiscernible] $20 billion [Indiscernible] So we've been very focused, diligently so to service for vendors, buyers, and realtors.  As for Zillow, look, the idea that it was simple to find a great plumber plus or a plan or a planter, the idea, the process was not variable and subject to vicissitudes, the idea that holding inventory was not itself costly. To me, those were rather strange ideas. I'm not sure what impact Eventually when Zillow makes up its mind on what type of businesses it is, they will have on the market. But I can talk from my macro perspective. First of all, very confident in REALTOR 's prospects, but also very confident in the U.S. real estate market generally.  It's a marketing transition and the laws of supply and demand still apply. Prices are too high; 2 things will happen. Buyers will start hesitating, more sellers will appear on the market, is the immutable way of the world. And I suspect we're very much in a moment of such transition which is good for REALTOR. Of course, interest rates will be a factor, but over the foreseeable future, we're still talking about either historic lows or near historic lows. And more significantly for us, we're seeing a more enduring trend starting to take hold. And it was a myth that millennials would not want to our own their own home.  That there would be a WeWork version of home, WeHome, or that car sharing meant that we wouldn't mind sharing bathrooms and lounges. Will that myth have been well and truly debunked? COVID coziness not really a thing. Work from home implies that you have a home. And I do recommend a sage article this week in barons on that subject. So, some of the myth of this suppose share economy has certainly been shattered. So, price increases of moderating, interest rates are relatively low in the USC eviction moratorium is mostly overtime on the market gradually increasing. Our massive increases in audience traffic 30% to 40% more than pre-Covid and leads 15% to 20% above pre -pandemic levels all tell us that there is deep demand. And in short, we are rather excited about REALTOR 's prospects now and far into the future.\nMike Florin: Thank you. And Joe, Bobby, we'll take our next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JP Morgan.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. In the news Media business, I was wondering if you could sort of pontificate or give us an idea of what you think the overall opportunity is even longer-term from licensing fees, from tech platforms over time. And then just a quick follow-up on Foxtel, with some of the streaming platforms, the S5 players launching their own platforms in Australia. Do you see that as incremental competition or how should we be that?\nRobert Thomson: First of all, on News Media, what you're seeing is really a transformation led by our chains, as Susan mentioned. Whether it be ad revenue, which shouldn't -- in the UK was up 36%, Australia 5%, New York Post, 32%. SEC revenues overall up 16%, in the UK 13%, Australia 9%. You're seeing a lot of hard work done by our teams in being very diligent about costs, but also being focused on growth. Certainly, the big digital deals will make a difference to all of our publications.  And frankly, all we can say given the constraints of confidentiality, is it the deals mean that comfortably over 9-figures are flowing into the News companies in return to the highest quality new services in 3 separate continents. Though unfortunately we are yet to reach agreement with Facebook, or the artist formerly known as Facebook in the UK. We are watching closely the evolution of possible legislation there that channels the Australian legislation, which would be handled. With Google as well, it's not just about payments. It also means working together on new products in audio and video.  And that's the content side. And those are productive discussions [Indiscernible] ideal, and it applies to both companies is the ad tech conundrum. We have always kept the ad tech issue to one side as I strongly believed that there were 2 components in need of resolution: the value of content and digital ad dysfunction. I was fairly confident there would be document discovery and the Texas Attorney General 's complaint has revealed some of the rather disturbing details. And I have little doubt that the Department of Justice will add to that detail in coming days. Now, how we resolve these issues does indeed remain to be seen.\nSusan Panuccio: And Alexia, on your second question you asked about the SFUAD competition within Australia. And I think the Foxtel team did a great job of talking about this at the strategy day. Around -- basically the great content they have within sports, particularly the AFL and our own quicker contracts that they have.  They had long-term relationships with the studios and have developed a very good working relationship with them. And there is great aggregator of the services down there. So, I think, while there is clearly competition that is coming into that marketplace down there, they are operating very well within that current environment.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you.\nMike Florin: Thank you, Alexia. Bobby, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.\nCraig Huber: Yes. Hi. My first question, you talked about, like in relation to a question from one of the guys on the phone that you will -- on the ongoing review of Foxtel from strategic standpoint. I'm just wondering for the rest of the Company is there any other reviews going on and then obviously, a lot of investors view rightly or wrongly that the Company is overly complicated as if I'm wondering if there's any other ongoing reviews going on with the Company? And my other just nitpick question usually tell us what the changes year-over-year in EBITDA at realtor.com, can you provide that for the quarter, please. Thank you.\nRobert Thomson: Craig, as a simplification, kindly we are constantly reviewing our structure. As you know, we've sold quite a few companies along the way. The local newspaper business at Dow Jones, which we presumed would struggle and that didn't turn out to be the case. Amplify which found a bit of home. News America Marketing was less meaningful to us as sprint sales declined somewhat. unruly, which has found a welcome home elsewhere and within we still have a relationship. But Ad-tech let say is for others.  So, we will constantly be institutionally introspective, reviewing our structure with Foxtel or Digital Real Estate, or -- as we have done to designate Dow Jones as a separate segment so that you can see not only the potential there but also to be clear about the very positive progress that the team is making in news media. We've made many changes. Those changes have been productive and profitable, and we will never stop questioning or challenging ourselves.\nSusan Panuccio: And Craig, just on your question in relation to REALTOR, as you know we don't give the EBITDA number but the year-on-year difference was up $6 million negative in relation to REALTOR. And one of the main reasons for that is the continuing investment in growth in that business within marketing and headcount.\nCraig Huber: Thank you\nMike Florin: Thank you, Greg. Thanks, Greg. Bobby, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Brian Han with Morningstar.\nBrian Han: Hi. 2 very quick questions if I may. On capital management, are there any technical or legal impediments to increasing your annual dividend amount, or do you feel that buyback just gives you more flexibility down the track. And secondly, enrolled -- let me try this again. But can you please comment on how much EBITDA was booked in the first quarter from the licensing deals with the big digital platforms.\nRobert Thomson: Clearly, we've focused on the buyback and we're now in a position to begin the buyback, as we've had to wait until the earnings announcement, given the regulatory restrictions in the quiet period. That quiet period, is almost over and you will soon hear the sound of buyback. The pacing depends on being rational about the trends in the market, but this is a very different buyback to that initiated the time of the split. As you know well, at that moment, we were worried about unexpected share dislocation.  And what are the provision to intervene if and when necessary, during that unprecedented unpredictable period. Now, we're on an entirely different epoch. The Company patently has momentum. We are confident about our cash generation potential, our ability to both invest to grow, and to return capital. So, as I mentioned, now that the quiet period is almost over, you will soon hear the sound of buyback.\nSusan Panuccio: And Brian, just in relation to your question on the content licensing, we haven't given out that number apart from saying it was going to be into 9 figures. And just in relation to how that's going to be pacing over the course of the year. We would expect to grow as more products within those particular contracts launched like for instance, showcase over here in the U.S. So, we would expect to see that build as we go throughout the year. And we talked previously in relation to that about a high-level allocation of switching between the News Media segment and Dow Jones.\nMike Florin: Thank you. Brian. Bobby, will take our next question, please.\nOperator: No further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to you for any closing remarks.\nRobert Thomson: Great. Well, thank you, Bobby. And thank you for all participating. We look forward to talking to you soon. Have a great day. Take care.",

            "name": "Susan Panuccio",
            "content": "Thank you, Robert. As Robert mentioned, strong operation dimension that, made last year so successful has continued into our first fiscal quarter results. Fiscal 2022, first quarter total revenues, were over $2.5 billion up 18% marked by higher revenue growth across all our key segments, notably at Digital Real Estate Services. Total segment EBITDA, was $410 million up 53% versus the prior year. The highest quarterly growth rate since 2017, despite the challenges from the lockdowns in Australia and comparing against 21% total segment EBITDA growth in the prior year.  Excluding acquisitions, currency fluctuations, and other items disclosed in the release, adjusted revenues and adjusted total segment EBITDA, rose 10% and 47% respectively. Reported EPS were $0.33 as compared to $0.06 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.23 in the quarter compared to $0.08 in the prior year. Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services, segment revenues were $426 million, an increase of 47% compared to the prior year, on an adjusted basis, revenues increased 29%. Segment EBITDA rose 16% to a $138 million or 21% on an adjusted basis.  Despite the higher investment spending at move and REA, and tough comparisons against the prior year cost declines implemented to counter the impact of COVID. Move 's revenues were $180 million, a 30% increase year-over-year, with real estate revenues rising 39% and accounting for 87% of total revenues. Revenue growth was again led by the traditional lead-generation business benefiting from strong agent demand and improved sell-through and yields. We're also seeing early success with the roll-out of Market VIP, a hybrid product offered to Move's top-performing agents.  The referral model saw strong revenue growth, and accounted for approximately 32% of revenues driven by record high in values and increased transaction volume. Revenue growth was partially offset by the divestiture of Top Producer in March, negatively impacting revenues by $5 million or 4%. We time prices at record highs and supply limited, lead volumes fell approximately 18% compared to over 40% growth last year, all be it, with lead still around 15% higher than pre -pandemic levels.  Encouragingly, new listings are up from their recent lows and we have seen moderation of lead volume declines in September and October. Pricing remains robust given strong agent demand. REA had an exceptional quarter with revenues rising 62% year-over-year to $246 million including $7 million of 3% positive impact from currency fluctuations. Results benefited from $43 million of contribution from the Mortgage choice acquisition and $8 million from the consolidation of Elara, which is being re-branded to REA India.  The underlying performance was very encouraging, with Australian residential revenue growth driven by an increasing penetration, price increase, and favorable product mix. The revenue growth was also driven by an 11% increase in new buy listings despite lock-downs across multiple states, including restrictions on physical inspections in Melbourne. Melbourne listings rose 79%, while Sydney fell 7%. Financial services also benefited from highest settlements and submissions.  Please refer to REA 's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment, revenues for the quarter were $510 million up 3% versus the prior year benefiting from higher streaming revenues and the modest benefit from positive currency fluctuations, partially offset by lower broadcast and commercial subscription revenues. On an adjusted basis, revenues were flat. Total closing paid subscribers across Foxtel reached nearly 3.9 million as the quarter end up 17% year-over-year, with total subscribers including trialists approximately 4 million.  The increase was driven by continued growth in paid streaming subscribers, partially offset by a decline in broadcast subscribers and commercial subscriptions, which were exacerbated by the impact of the lockdowns in Australia. [Indiscernible] end of the quarter with approximately 1.1 million and 885,000 total subscribers respectively. In the aggregate, total paying streaming subscribers were up more than 69% to nearly $2.1 million and total streaming subscribers including trialist reached over $2.2 million.  Streaming products in the aggregate reached approximately 54% of Foxtel 's total paid subscriber base. Broadcast turn improved declining to 14% from 14.6% last year and 17.1% in the fourth quarter. Broadcast ARPU increased 4% from the prior year to $82 Australian, mitigating subscriber volume declines consistent with Foxtel strategy of focusing on higher ARPU subscribers and fewer low cost offers. Foxtel continues to see an improvement in subscriber mix as a percentage of higher-valued long continued subscribers continue to rise with a corresponding decline in churn rates.  Net declines for residential broadcast subscribers moderated sequentially with 1.6 million broadcast subscribers at quarter end, commercial subscribers were down over 30% from the fourth quarter to 162,000. And we do anticipate a recovery for commercial subscribers in the second half with the easing of restrictions. Product innovation continued with the launch of iQ5 and IP-enabled set-top box, the announcement of plans to partner with Comcast and Sky on the launch of Sky Glass, and the launch of a third streaming product slash, a dedicated live news streaming service featuring more than 20 local and global live new services. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was a $114 million, up 46% compared to the prior year.  The improvement was primarily driven by $34 million of lower sports costs benefiting from the $36 million of negative impact seen in the First Quarter of fiscal 2021, related to deferred sports costs from the Fourth Quarter of fiscal 2020. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased 42%. Moving onto Dow Jones, Dow Jones delivered revenue of $444 million up 15% compared to the prior year with digital revenues accounting for 75% of total revenues this quarter, up 2% points from the prior year. Adjusted revenues, which notably excludes the impact of IBD, rose 9%. As Robert mentioned, both revenues and profitability with the highest First Quarter results since this acquisition.  Circulation and subscription revenues increased 12%, including 13% circulation revenue growth, primarily reflecting the acquisition of IBD and the continued strong volume gains in digital-only subscriptions. Dow Jones subscriptions to its consumer products increased to an average of approximately 4.6 million in the quarter, up 18% from the prior year. Off that, over 3.6 million were digital-only subscriptions, up 24% year-over-year. IBD accounted for 100,000 digital-only subscriptions, and a 128,000 in total subscriptions. Professional information business revenues rose 13% accelerating from the prior quarter. Revenue growth. From Risk & Compliance increased 26% driven by a higher entry rate and strong growth across the Americas, Europe, and Asia. We also saw modest improvement at [Indiscernible]. Advertising revenues, which accounted for 20% of revenues this quarter, grew 29% to $90 million, the highest First Quarter growth rate since acquisition.  Digital Advertising trends remained robust, up 38% on top of 14% growth in the First Quarter of the prior year an accounted for 61% of total advertising revenues. All categories performed above expectations, most notably in technology and finance, and we continue to see improving yields. Print advertising revenues were robust, rising 17% year-over-year, partially benefiting from the COVID-19 comparison. Dow Jones segment, EBITDA for the quarter rose 32% to $95 million with EBITDA margins improving by almost 3% points to 21%, despite an 11% increase in total cost, which included IBD and higher employee costs.  On an adjusted basis, segment revenues and EBITDA for the quarter rose 9% and 24% respectively. At book publishing, HarperCollins posted 19% revenue growth to $546 million and segment EBITDA rose 20% to $85 million. Adjusted revenue and EBITDA rose 7% and 10% respectively versus the prior year. Despite a difficult prior-year comparison, book consumption levels remain elevated, overall consumption across the industry remains higher than pre -pandemic levels and materially above the historical low single digit type revenue growth. This quarter benefited from a rebound in Christian Publishing, which was more exposed to the closure of retail stores in the prior year and higher sales in the UK.  General Books saw healthy growth benefiting from new releases coupled with higher backlist sales from the Bridgerton series by Julia Quinn. Digital sales raised 5% this quarter and accounted for 21% of consumer sales. The Barclays represented 62% of revenues, up 2% points from last year, underscoring the importance of the steady high-margin revenue stream and a key factor behind the acquisition of HMH. HMH integration continue to progress well, and is in the process of being integrated into a full imprint structure within HarperCollins.  We remain on track with our savings target of $20 million to be delivered within the first 2 years. Overall, HMH contributed $50 million in revenue, and $6 million in segment EBITDA this quarter. Turning to News Media, revenues for the quarter were $576 million up 18% versus the prior year, benefiting from the continued recovery in the advertising market, strong growth in circulation and subscription revenues, and a $25 million or 5% positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Within the segment, revenues at News UK and News Corp Australia increased 18% and 14% respectively.  Wireless Group and the New York post also showed strong top-line growth. Adjusted revenues to the segment increased 13% compared to the prior-year.

Advertising revenues increased $39 million or 21% compared to the prior year. Benefiting from the COVID-19 comparison with particular strength in digital across our businesses.  On a reported basis, advertising revenues in Australia rose 5% or 2% in local currency, despite the negative impacts from the lockdowns.

            "content": "Thank you, Mike. We are journeying through the contours of our complex commercial landscape that has been a staling test of the metal of companies and countries. For us, the first quarter was the most profitable of its kind since the relaunch of News Corp in 2013. Continuing the trends that were evidenced in the last financial year and building on those rapid rates of growth. And we continue to have much confidence in our immediate and long-term prospects. I would like to honor the work done by our employees around the world.  They have cut with extraordinary exigencies and provided a prevalence service to their customers and to their communities that the Company's purpose has endured and indeed thrive through such challenging times is a tribute to repute and Lachlan Murdoch and the culture they created and have curated. Revenues for the quarter were $2.5 billion, an increase of 18%, while our profitability rose 53%. I should repeat that figure for clarity, profitability rose 53%. It is worth bearing in mind that this increase follows a 21% increase in profitability in the first quarter last year. Every one of our key operating segments posted significant revenue expansion and strong segment EBITDA growth. I would like to reiterate that our Board authorized $1 billion stock repurchase program in September. As we previously indicated, we have refrained from executing on the buyback during this quiet period, but that period officially ends in coming days. It is a very different buyback to that which was approved in 2013, when we were unsure about share dislocation at the time of the separation from Fox. We now have confidence in our performance, our resilience, our ability to generate cash for our investors, and our potential.  Bolstering that confidence is the fact that our recent acquisitions are exceeding our expectations and our core segments are thriving. We now have an optionality across the businesses and significantly more flexibility in our ability to return capital to our investors. One note where they saw in that optionality is our ability to capitalize on the Peyton success of the Foxtel streaming strategy, which was highlighted during the Foxtel strategy day. We have been working through the potential permutations and will continue to provide updates as appropriate. In the meantime, it is worth noting that subscription video services segment EBITDA, rose a rather healthy 46% in the First Quarter.  As for our campaign to hold big digital accountable, clearly there have been pronounced and profound developments in recent times. We are pleased with the agreements we have reached and the work it has progressed on revaluing content. But we have always regarded the digital ad market as a separate issue. And the release of an underacted compliant by the Texas Attorney General last month, has highlighted the extent of the problem. The manipulative language was deeply concerning. We are obviously considering our position on this important matter and want to ensure that in the future, the Admark properly recognized the value of our audience and of our inventory.  Now, turning to the first quarter. Dow Jones recorded a 15% increase in revenues compared to the same quarter last year, with segment EBITDA surging 32%. That profitability was a record for the first quarter. Revenue at Risk & Compliance grew 26%, meaning that we have had 25 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Overall, the Professional Information Business experienced a solid 13% increase in revenues. And that should expand when we complete the acquisition of OPIS, which is expected to close early next calendar year. The past few weeks have highlighted the importance of intelligence about energy and carbon markets. and we fully expect to become a world leader in that area.  I've been talking at Dow Jones expanded a first quarter record of 29%, with digital advertising climbing 38%. Meanwhile, Subscription growth remains robust with a 19% increase across our consumer products to approximately 4.6 million with circulation revenues rising approximately 13%. The ongoing transformation of Dow Jones continues to pace, with digital now accounting for 75% of the segment's revenues. Digital Real Estate Services was again, a source of express growth with move, the operator of realtor.com, seeing revenue surge 30%. The U.S. housing market is sturdy with price rises moderating, more properties coming to the market, and longer listing times, all of which work in our favor.  As for the house flipping flip-flop by Zillow, we have always been focused on the digital markets, not on bricks-and-mortar and certainly not on sorting out the septic tank or papering over wall cracks. We concentrated on our core competency and never took on excessive Balance Sheet risk or chased what appear to us to be very low margin returns. It appears Zillow now finally understands what we always news to -- knew to be true. And that said, as an open platform, we do see opportunities to be a marketplace for the industry, including iBuyers such as Open-door, providing them with the same kind of dependable and trusted information that agents and consumers alike have valued.  In Australia, REA had a remarkable First Quarter with revenues burgeoning 62%. That is correct, 62%. Australia has slowly been emancipated from severe lockdowns, and access to homes for sale has been limited. So, we believe that positive market conditions will largely continue as the country returns to a semblance of normalcy. One Harbinger is that site traffic was strong in Q1 was 129 million average visits, up 13% year-over-year. That is essentially an average of five visits for every person in the country. That book business is thriving and even more so, with the successful integration of HMH.  Excluding the $50 million contribution of HMH, book sales have reset in the post-pandemic period, to around 22% higher than the same period in 2019. There has been a resurgence of interest in printed books as their tactility and talismanic quality is increasingly important at a time when many people have screen fatigue. We sold notable success in Q1 with the Bridgerton Series, The Authoritarian Moment by Ben Shapiro, and the Cellist by Daniel Silva.  In the months ahead, we have high hopes for the Pioneer Woman Coke super-easy by Ree Drummond. The storyteller by Dave Grohl, and Gangster Granny strikes again by David Williams. In subscription video services, the first quarter built on the significant progress made in FY '21 in reshaping the Foxtel group as a streaming LED business, would improve revenues, profitability, and cash generation. For the second consecutive quarter, growth in Kayo and Binge revenues clearly offset the not-unexpected modest decline in Retail Broadcast revenues. As of September 30, total subscribers were approximately 4 million, up 18% year-over-year. This includes a record 2.2 million total streaming subscribers, up 68% thanks to Kayo and Binge. While there will always be a certain seasonality in sports viewing in Australia, Kayo is quickly establishing itself as a year-round provider as it now offers 50 sports in total, and is furnishing and gauging off-season programming for the football [Indiscernible] ahead of the new season early next year.  Foxtel 's appeal was further broadened with the launch of the Flash Streaming News Service, featuring a [Indiscernible] collection of 20 local and global news sources with content for all political persuasion. That breadth combined with a cutting-edge world-class user interface adds to the luster of Foxtel, and is indicative of its [Indiscernible]. We're now obviously in a position to be even more ambitious. So, Foxtel and are always seeking to maximize its undoubted potential. News Media was a strong contributor to News Corp profitability this quarter with segment EBITDA of $34 million in the quarter after a loss in the same period last year.  That is a tribute to Rebekah Brooks, Michael Miller, and Sean Giancola (ph.), and their talented committed teams. There transformation was in part due to the benefits of our deals with the major tech platforms, notably Google and Facebook. Together, these deals will contribute annual revenues in the 9-figures to News Corp, clearly putting our News businesses on a more profitable path. Despite the successive lock-downs, our Australian business is faring well, showing significant improvement in profitability thanks to cost initiatives and rising digital advertising revenues, and used milestones subscription, which improved to 850,000, up 24% year-over-year.  News U.K. performed admirably, particularly in advertising. Both digital and print and in subscriptions. The Times and Sunday Times, contributed meaningfully to profits and their digital paid subscriptions have now reached 380,000. Wireless and radio network increased its revenue and profit contribution with exclusive football broadcasts, drawing large audiences and increased advertising. Wireless reported record rates of 6 million unique listeners per week according to the most recent, rage our survey.  A broadcast expertise is assisting our other media properties in the UK and will complement Talk TV, which is scheduled to launch in the early months of 2022 with Piers Morgan taking a global role across our broadcast and news properties. We believe Talk TV will be contemporary, low-cost, and high impact. In the U.S. the New York post, once legendary loss-making, is now contributing to segment profitability. And is an increasingly important voice in the national political divide.  Its digital network reached 151 million unique users in September, almost half of the U.S. population, according to Google analytics. Digital Advertising revenue was 28% higher compared to the same quarter last year. And print advertising increased 62%, recovering from the COVID related lows of last year. The Company built on its momentum from last fiscal in the first quarter, and we remain optimistic about growth prospects going forward.  Clearly, there are macroeconomic pressures affecting certain companies, but our increasingly digital orientation has bolstered our ability to weather the pandemic and deal with the economic uncertainty in some of our markets. We are confident in our employees, confident in our businesses, and very confident in our prospects. And now, for further detail -- for further details and invaluable insight, I cede the floor to Susan Panuccio. Entcho, on Foxtel. Look, it's inappropriate at this moment to discuss specific to the review. But clearly, we and our partners at Telstra recognized that the prospects of Foxtel have changed fundamentally and that we have a streaming success story. Look, we've had cutting edge world cost tech and we have a user interface. But as vastly improved and we have a team led by Patrick and [Indiscernible], and they will drive further success most surely. Think about how the narrative has changed over the past two years.  As you recall, we had been asked about the skeptics whether we would need to put more money into the Company. And let's examine what happened. We took a majority stake because we believed more clarity, more responsibility, more decisiveness was necessary. We've used our media platforms to complement and promote the quality of Foxtel. Our team made some tough decisions to rationalize, made some smart decisions on streaming and systems and here we are today. So, whatever we do we will not be naive, naivety is not now [Indiscernible].  And as for Zillow, obviously, we had discussed ourselves getting into bricks-and-mortar but we had a very clear sense of the digital priorities. Don't forget that we had revived -- renovated the distinctly unfashionably realtor.com. We bought it on the cheap net about $700 million. What's it worth now, $6 billion [Indiscernible] What will it be worth in 5 years as the inevitable digital march continues [Indiscernible] $20 billion [Indiscernible] So we've been very focused, diligently so to service for vendors, buyers, and realtors.  As for Zillow, look, the idea that it was simple to find a great plumber plus or a plan or a planter, the idea, the process was not variable and subject to vicissitudes, the idea that holding inventory was not itself costly. To me, those were rather strange ideas. I'm not sure what impact Eventually when Zillow makes up its mind on what type of businesses it is, they will have on the market. But I can talk from my macro perspective. First of all, very confident in REALTOR 's prospects, but also very confident in the U.S. real estate market generally.  It's a marketing transition and the laws of supply and demand still apply. Prices are too high; 2 things will happen. Buyers will start hesitating, more sellers will appear on the market, is the immutable way of the world. And I suspect we're very much in a moment of such transition which is good for REALTOR. Of course, interest rates will be a factor, but over the foreseeable future, we're still talking about either historic lows or near historic lows. And more significantly for us, we're seeing a more enduring trend starting to take hold. And it was a myth that millennials would not want to our own their own home.  That there would be a WeWork version of home, WeHome, or that car sharing meant that we wouldn't mind sharing bathrooms and lounges. Will that myth have been well and truly debunked? COVID coziness not really a thing. Work from home implies that you have a home. And I do recommend a sage article this week in barons on that subject. So, some of the myth of this suppose share economy has certainly been shattered. So, price increases of moderating, interest rates are relatively low in the USC eviction moratorium is mostly overtime on the market gradually increasing. Our massive increases in audience traffic 30% to 40% more than pre-Covid and leads 15% to 20% above pre -pandemic levels all tell us that there is deep demand. And in short, we are rather excited about REALTOR 's prospects now and far into the future. First of all, on News Media, what you're seeing is really a transformation led by our chains, as Susan mentioned. Whether it be ad revenue, which shouldn't -- in the UK was up 36%, Australia 5%, New York Post, 32%. SEC revenues overall up 16%, in the UK 13%, Australia 9%. You're seeing a lot of hard work done by our teams in being very diligent about costs, but also being focused on growth. Certainly, the big digital deals will make a difference to all of our publications.  And frankly, all we can say given the constraints of confidentiality, is it the deals mean that comfortably over 9-figures are flowing into the News companies in return to the highest quality new services in 3 separate continents. Though unfortunately we are yet to reach agreement with Facebook, or the artist formerly known as Facebook in the UK. We are watching closely the evolution of possible legislation there that channels the Australian legislation, which would be handled. With Google as well, it's not just about payments. It also means working together on new products in audio and video.  And that's the content side. And those are productive discussions [Indiscernible] ideal, and it applies to both companies is the ad tech conundrum. We have always kept the ad tech issue to one side as I strongly believed that there were 2 components in need of resolution: the value of content and digital ad dysfunction. I was fairly confident there would be document discovery and the Texas Attorney General 's complaint has revealed some of the rather disturbing details. And I have little doubt that the Department of Justice will add to that detail in coming days. Now, how we resolve these issues does indeed remain to be seen. Craig, as a simplification, kindly we are constantly reviewing our structure. As you know, we've sold quite a few companies along the way. The local newspaper business at Dow Jones, which we presumed would struggle and that didn't turn out to be the case. Amplify which found a bit of home. News America Marketing was less meaningful to us as sprint sales declined somewhat. unruly, which has found a welcome home elsewhere and within we still have a relationship. But Ad-tech let say is for others.  So, we will constantly be institutionally introspective, reviewing our structure with Foxtel or Digital Real Estate, or -- as we have done to designate Dow Jones as a separate segment so that you can see not only the potential there but also to be clear about the very positive progress that the team is making in news media. We've made many changes. Those changes have been productive and profitable, and we will never stop questioning or challenging ourselves. Clearly, we've focused on the buyback and we're now in a position to begin the buyback, as we've had to wait until the earnings announcement, given the regulatory restrictions in the quiet period. That quiet period, is almost over and you will soon hear the sound of buyback. The pacing depends on being rational about the trends in the market, but this is a very different buyback to that initiated the time of the split. As you know well, at that moment, we were worried about unexpected share dislocation.  And what are the provision to intervene if and when necessary, during that unprecedented unpredictable period. Now, we're on an entirely different epoch. The Company patently has momentum. We are confident about our cash generation potential, our ability to both invest to grow, and to return capital. So, as I mentioned, now that the quiet period is almost over, you will soon hear the sound of buyback. Great. Well, thank you, Bobby. And thank you for all participating. We look forward to talking to you soon. Have a great day. Take care."

Media will be allowed on a listen-only basis. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMichael Florin: Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's fiscal fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We will open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings release for the applicable periods posted on our website. With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\nRobert Thomson: Thank you, Mike. Before we discuss results for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2023, I would like to acknowledge that we\u2019ve now completed a decade of the News Corp's existence. So this is surely an appropriate moment to reflect on our profound transformation, a transformation faithful to the company's founding principles. Consider then and the now, our revenue basis changed fundamentally and expanded dramatically. News and information services accounted for 72% of total revenues in fiscal 2014, which included News America Marketing and Dow Jones. By fiscal 2023, News Media was 23% and revitalized Dow Jones segment was 22%. Digital real estate comprised 5% of total revenues 10 years ago, and that has tripled to over 15% this past year, which includes the acquisition of Move, were revenues have more than doubled. Subscription video services revenues increased from 6% of News Corp's total to 20%, bolstered by the consolidation and control of Foxtel, a business renewed, and Foxtel's imminent completion of a refinancing is expected to facilitate repayments of our outstanding shareholder loans beginning this fiscal year. Candidly, since our reincarnation, we have increasingly digital recurring revenues, higher margins, significantly more free cash flow, robust finances, and bright prospects for long-term growth and value creation for all our shareholders. A few facts to demonstrate our digital scale today. Based on our June metrics, we had 79 million unique visitors at Dow Jones, 159 million at the Sun, 74 million at Realtor.com, 21 million at Housing.com in India, and 145 million at the increasingly influential New York Post. And that digital momentum is surely gathering pace in the age of Generative AI. Along with this relentless focus on digitization, we have been intent on simplifying the company and heightening our cost consciousness. That cost discipline was clearly evident during a year that had a complicated plot line for books. While digital real estate was naturally inevitably affected by the interest rate hikes which appear to be plateauing in the U.S. I would like to pay sincere tribute to Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and our Directors who have been steadfast in their strategic support, and all our employees and our loyal, insightful investors. Thanks to their collective committed efforts, News Corp achieved its three strongest fiscal years ever in the last three fiscal years 2021, 2022 and 2023. In fact, fiscal '23, was our second most profitable year following fiscal '22, despite the difficult macro conditions in a couple of core segments, and our fourth quarter profitability was significantly higher than last year. There have certainly been fundamental changes in the media landscape. We have led the quest for appropriate compensation for content from the big digital platforms. And that quest began publicly in 2007 when I testified before the House of Lords about the challenges for publishers, and society in the internet age has entered a new, fascinating phase with the rise of Generative AI. Clearly, negotiations are well underway with the relevant companies. And once again, News Corp hopes to set precedents that benefit creators, publishers and journalists around the globe. It is crucial for our societies that AI is replete with EI. That re-composition does not lead to the decomposition of creativity and integrity. We have been characteristically candid about the AI challenge to publishers and to intellectual property. It is essentially a triptych. In the first instance, our content is being harvested and scraped and otherwise ingested to train AI engines. Ingestion should not lead to indigestion. Secondly, individual stories are being surfaced in specific searches. And thirdly, original content can be synthesized and presented as distinct when it is actually an extracting of our editorial essence. These super snippets distilling the effort and insight of great journalism are potentially designed so the reader will never visit a news site, thus fatally undermining journalism and damaging our societies. It is reassuring that the prescient executives at the largest digital companies can see these complexities and understand that our shared responsibilities extend far beyond the commercial, that Generative AI cannot be degenerative, that we are paving a platform for future generations and that we will be collectively held to account and not just by accountants. From the philosophical to the functional, there is no doubt that AI articulations will affect most sections of most companies, whether it be customer service, subscription management, chatbots -- the chatbots, text to audio and audio to video, experiences, efficiencies will be exponential. And we are absolutely clear in our company, there must be a confluence of the technological, the commercial and the cultural. Last earnings, I mentioned the plight of Wall Street Journal reporter, Evan Gershkovich, unjustly incarcerated by Russia for being a journalist seeking facts, seeking the truth. Both the Journal and the U.S government vehemently deny the allegations against him. Evan has now spent almost 5 months in prison. And we thank the many thoughtful people from all around the globe who have rallied to his cause and sought his release. And we thank those who are continuing to press determinedly for his emancipation, and providing support to his courageous family. Turning now to our results for Q4 and fiscal year 2023. The aforementioned macroeconomic factors, that is inflation, supply chain complications, and vaulting interest rates along with volatile foreign exchange rates, patently presented challenges, some of which are more ephemeral than eternal. Nonetheless, we still saw significant progress across several segments. And thanks to our digital and international strategic focus, and acute cost consciousness, including the announced 5% headcount reduction, which we expect to yield more than $160 million in annual gross savings. Not only was this fiscal year the second best ever in terms of profits, we believe we are poised for greater growth in the years ahead. As for the fourth quarter, revenues were over $2.43 billion, 9% lower year-over-year, though a majority of that decline is attributable to foreign exchange rates and an extra week last year, a 53rd week to balance out the multiyear calendar. Mathematically that one extra week accounts for almost half of the difference, and will obviously not be a factor in the current year. Profitability in the quarter rose 8%, which is especially notable and that it comes after a 50% rise a year earlier. We are building on our positive performances even when the headwinds are blustery. Full year revenues were $9.879 billion, down 5% on our record prior year, and total segment EBITDA was over $1.4 billion, 15% lower, thought still the second highest profits recorded for the new News Corp. Dow Jones posted its highest profitability for both the quarter and the full year since we acquired the company, helped by impressive results in the professional information business. In fact, taking a step back, Dow Jones has doubled its profitability in the past 4 years. And for the first time, Dow Jones was the highest contributor profits across all of News Corp in fiscal 2023 as we continue to develop the high margin B2B offerings. We are focused on Dow Jones as a pillar of News Corp's future growth with significant value appreciation for shareholders. Dow Jones is nearing an important threshold with the lucrative B2B business expected to be the highest contributor to profitability in fiscal 2024 and a key driver for future margin expansion. Dow Jones has been bolstered over the past year by the acquisitions of OPIS and Chemical Market Analytics, and by continuing double-digit growth of risk and compliance. It is worth noting that risk and compliance revenues have risen six-fold over the past decade. We believe prospects remain decidedly bright, as the corporate imperative to minimize risk and maximize compliance grows in an ever more complex regulatory regime. We believe the energy transition is an enormous global opportunity for OPIS and we will capitalize on it through new products. The establishment of compelling benchmarks and the generation of must have data, pricing and analytics, whether it be for fossil fuels, hydrogen, solar, lithium, cobalt, EVs, or carbon credits and offsets. The industry relies on OPIS for pricing transparency, which is critical to day by day decision making in a market that is undergoing massive transformation. Dow Jones digital subscription growth accelerated in the second half, partly helped by bundling of our products to capitalize on our clients need for sophisticated market analysis and analytics. We want to channel Market Watch readers to WSJ then to Barron's and Investor's Business Daily, and from there to our specialists business products, that is a pathway to profits for the company. Moreover, we are increasing our international digital focus for the Wall Street Journal, which currently has only 12% of subscriptions outside the U.S where there is much untapped potential. Subscription video services reported adjusted revenue and profit growth, which excludes currency impact for the second straight year, and also for the fourth quarter, a remarkable turnaround from the recent past. We have long-term rights for the key Australian sports and the prime international sports for Australians and have created a model that streamers around the world are now trying to emulate. Our streaming revenue growth again outpaced broadcast declines in both Q4 and the full year, with paid subscribers scaling at a double-digit rate to nearly 3.1 million. So we are particularly confident about Foxtel's future and our optionality given the imminent completion of our refinancing. We were asked frequently in the past how much more capital we would need to commit to Foxtel. But the question now is how much cash we will receive in coming years. REA continued to be impacted by macroeconomic challenges in the Australian housing market, though we do see an easing of those challenges as the interest rate cycle peaks. Home prices have again started to increase and the auction completion rate cross 70% in June, up from 55% in the prior year, REA's audience share against its nearest competitor continued to expand to north of 3.5x in June, while visits to the site have expanded year-over-year for four consecutive months. REA did benefit from product price increases linked to improvements in the quality of those products. While India remains a source of ongoing potential given that Housing.com is already the market leader in a country on a positive economic trajectory with a rapidly expanding middle class. In the U.S., we have new leadership at Move operator Realtor.com. Move experienced much success under David Doctorow and broaden its offerings with the acquisitions of Opcity, UpNest and Avail. We sincerely thank David for his positive contribution, which will resonate for years to come. Damian Eales brings vast digital experience and fiercely competitive spirit and much knowledge of how to leverage News Corp's powerful U.S platforms, whether that be the New York Post, or The Wall Street Journal, or Barron's to build the brand and expand market share. Damian has just returned from Australia, where the Realtor team spent time at REA and the creative collaboration between the two companies will certainly intensify. Scale is crucial. And to put our scale in perspective based on June ComScore data, Realtors valuable and engaged audience is well over 2x of that of Homes.com. Not only do we have scale in residential sales, we believe that we can continue to monetize that audience successfully. For HarperCollins, and for other book publishers, Q4 and fiscal '23 generally was a challenging period with the post-COVID market resetting, logistical issues at Amazon and acute inflationary pressures. Some particular signs of success were joined against Magnolia Table Volume 3, and remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby Van Pelt. And we have reason for optimism in the near future with books like Tom Lake by Ann Patchett, The Collector by Daniel Silva, and in the T.V.: Big Adventures on the Small Screen by Peter Kay. In Q2, we are looking forward to the next Pioneer Woman Cooks by Ree Drummond Reed Drummond, and The Little Liar by Mitch Albom. In News Media, advertising trends very distinctly by geography with the U.K and the U.S performing best in the quarter. In the UK, the Sun had a successful year, with digital outpacing print ads again in the fourth quarter and for the full year. This strength was accentuated by the year-over-year growth of the Sun in the U.S., which reported a substantial surge in page views, and even higher yields than the successful U.K site. The Times and Sunday Times also hit 565,000 digital subscriptions at the end of June and a 11% increase, underscoring the strength of their journalism and the global potential of the brand. News Corp Australia achieved almost 1.1 million digital subscriptions, an increase of 10%. News.com.au was the leading news website in Australia according to the Ipsos rankings, while the Australian was also in the top 10. In the U.S., the New York Post reported another year of strong profits after decades, if not centuries of endless losses. As I mentioned, the Paper's improved commercial fortunes have been accompanied by growing influence in New York, Washington, and beyond. As the Paper's founder Alexander Hamilton sagely observed, those who stand for nothing for for everything. In a fiscal year affected by the reverberations of war, inflation, interest rate hikes, supply chain disruption and other macroeconomic challenges, and in a business inevitably impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations, News Corp is proud to report its second most profitable year since its reincarnation a decade ago. Our teams have been tested and have clearly passed that exacting test. We ended the year on an upswing, with the company returning to profit growth in the quarter with inflation showing signs of abating, interest rates plateauing, and incipient signs of stability in the housing market we have sound reasons for optimism. All specious macro conditions will surely work to the benefit of a company that has become more digital, more global and with more recurring revenues in higher margin segments. We have navigated the sometimes perilous media waters adroitly and are particularly proud of our provenance, a provenance based on commitment, curiosity, and integrity. We look forward with a sense of genuine of tangible excitement in the potential of our people and our businesses. And we remain utterly determined to deliver positive results for our customers, our employees, and most certainly, for our shareholders. I will now pass you to our erudite CFO, Susan Panuccio, who will provide more insight into our financial coordinate.\nSusan Panuccio: Thank you, Robert. Our second half results show marked improvement from the first half of the year with fourth quarter profitability up year-over-year, highlighting the diversity and durability of our revenue streams, and our ongoing cost efficiencies as we navigated the ever changing macro conditions, supply chain pressures and currency headwinds. As the company continues to transition to digital, digital revenues now comprise over half of the company's fiscal 2023 revenues. We have also transformed the revenue base away from cyclical advertising revenues to one that is much more recurring and subscription base with strong growth prospects. We have made strategic acquisitions that we believe have fundamentally strengthened the company. The acquisitions of OPIS, CMA, HMH, Mortgage Choice, and IBD during fiscal 2021 and 2022, have essentially replaced the revenues from News America Marketing, providing a much stronger base for long-term growth. The company has changed and evolved since 2013, and is well-positioned for future success. We have maintained a very healthy balance sheet, while we strengthen the asset base, transformed digitally, generating healthy free cash flow and continue to improve our operating efficiencies. Turning to our financials, I'll focus on the fourth quarter performance. Fourth quarter total revenues were over $2.4 billion, down 9% year-over-year, which was heavily impacted by the $110 million or 4% negative impact related to the extra week last year, and the $72 million or 3% impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Impressively, total segment EBITDA was $341 million, up 8% year-over-year despite very difficult year-over-year comparisons and weak trading conditions at HarperCollins. Margins improved by over 2 percentage points to 14%. Fourth quarter adjusted revenues declined 7% compared to the prior year, while adjusted total segment EBITDA rose 2% versus the prior year. Both revenues and total segment EBITDA were also negatively impacted by the extra week last year. Adjusted revenue and total segment EBITDA did not exclude that impact. Earnings per share in the quarter were a loss of $0.01 compared to income of $0.19 in the prior year. The current quarter reflects $85 million of restructuring and impairment charges mostly related to our company wide headcount reduction that we communicated on the last earnings call and an $81 million noncash write-down in equity losses of affiliates related to REA's investment in PropertyGuru. The prior year income of $0.19 benefited from $149 million tax benefit. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.14 in the quarter compared to $0.37 in the prior year. Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments starting with digital real estate services. Segment revenues were $369 million, down 17% compared to the prior year, impacted by the ongoing macroeconomic pressures, a negative impact of $15 million or 4% from foreign currency fluctuations and $14 million or 3% of negative impact from the extra week last year. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues decreased 14%. Segment EBITDA declined 11% to $108 million impacted by lower revenues partially offset by the lower discretionary costs, compensation and broker commissions. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 5%. REA revenues were $223 million, which declined 11% on a reported basis or down 5% on a constant currency basis. The revenue decline was due to the impact of lower national listings and a decrease in financial services revenue driven by lower settlement activity. New buy listings for the fourth quarter were down 18% year-over-year with the higher yielding metro areas of Sydney and Melbourne showing improvement each month of the quarter, yet ended down 17% and 16%, respectively. Those declines were partially offset by the annual price increases in the residential and commercial businesses, increased uptake in premium products including Premiere Plus, favorable depth penetration and continued strong performance from REA India, which maintained its audience leadership. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details. At Move, revenues were $146 million, down 24% compared to the prior year, which reflects the $40 million or 7% negative impact related to the absence of the extra week. Excluding the extra week impact, revenue declined 17% similar to the third quarter results, with lead optimization in the lead generation products partially offsetting lower lead and transaction volume. Lead volumes moderated to down 14% year-over-year compared to a decline of 30% in the third quarter, while Realtors average monthly unique users declined 20% from the prior year to 74 million in the fourth quarter, based on internal metrics, yet up from 72 million in the third quarter. We remain focused on driving both usage and engagement through continued product enhancements and improvements to SEO, while expanding our core adjacencies of seller, rentals and new homes. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $501 million, down 4% compared to the prior year on a reported basis due to foreign currency headwinds. On a constant currency basis, revenues rose 3% versus the prior year, the sixth consecutive quarter of growth in constant currency. Streaming revenues accounted for 29% of circulation and subscription revenues compared to 23% in the prior year. OTT revenue growth again more than offset broadcast revenue declines benefiting from both increased subscribers and price increases at Kayo and BINGE. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group improved to over 4.6 million at quarter end, up 5% year-over-year. Total paid streaming subscribers approached 3.1 million, increasing 14% versus the prior year and accounted for approximately 66% of Foxtel's total paid subscriber base. Binge continued to expand advertising inventory on the basic product, generating both modest incremental revenues and some upgrade activity to the higher tiered subscription offerings. Foxtel ended the quarter with over 1.3 million residential broadcast subscribers, down only 9% year-over-year. Broadcast churn continued to improve, down more than 260 basis points year-over-year to 11.1%, the lowest level since fiscal 2016, while broadcast ARPU rose 2% to over A$84. Foxtel announced a price rise beginning in July across some of the broadcasters, the first since fiscal 2019 which will benefit the fiscal 2024 results. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $78 million was down 4% versus the prior year, but was up 4% on an adjusted basis despite higher programming costs, mostly related to contractual escalators across key sports rights. On the product front, following the successful growth in streaming, the business will be launching a streaming aggregation device leveraging the Sky Glass technology. expectation is for a commercial launch later in fiscal 2024 and we will keep you updated on our progress. Moving to Dow Jones. Dow Jones had another strong quarter with revenues of $546 million, down 3% which includes the negative impact of $40 million, or 7% related to the absence of the extra week from last year. We let the OPIS acquisition in March and CMA in June. Digital revenues accounted for 79% of total revenues this quarter, up 3 percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription based revenues represent over 79% of total revenues, up over 2 percentage points from the prior year, underscoring the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 6%, but would have delivered a modest improvement excluding the extra week. We are continuing to see strong momentum in our professional information business with revenues rising 10% year-over-year, benefiting from the continued integration of OPIS and CMA, coupled with strong revenues from risk and compliance. Results were partly offset by the extra week last year, which led to a $14 million or 8% negative impact on the performance. Excluding the extra week, PIB revenues grew 18%. PIB revenues this quarter accounted for 37% of segment revenues. And while we don't disclose specific margins, PIB margins are higher than the overall Dow Jones margin and are contributing strongly to segment EBITDA, underscoring the uniqueness and durability of the Dow Jones asset mix. Risk & Compliance revenues rose 10% despite the extra week in the prior year, and continue to grow at a high-teens rate on a like-for-like basis. While 60% of the customers are in the financial services sector, the fastest growth is now coming from corporates with demand driven by the anti-money laundering, financial corruption and ESG screening and monitoring products. Retention remains over 90%. OPIS and CMA's revenue performance remains robust benefiting from price escalators, new products and new customers. Retention rates for OPIS and CMA subscription products remain in the mid 90s, which is underpinning the transformation of Dow Jones revenue base. Circulation revenues declined 6% due to the absence of the extra week, lower print volume and weakness at IBD as we noted in the third quarter. Excluding the extra week impact of $17 million, or 7%, circulation revenues were up 1% year-over-year, which is slightly higher than the third quarter rate. Total Dow Jones digital-only subscriptions grew 12% year-over-year or by 163,000 sequentially, with the year-over-year rate improving from last quarter. Advertising revenues declined 14% to $100 million and accounted for 18% of Dow Jones revenues this quarter with digital down 10% and print down 18%. Excluding the negative impact from the absence of the extra week of $9 million or 8% the decline rate moderated from the third quarter to down 6%. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 25% to $133 million, as cost growth moderated from the first half. Margins improved to 24%, up from 19% last year. Adjusted segment EBITDA for the quarter increased 17%, a notable improvement over the third quarter and the full year performance. At book publishing, both HarperCollins and the industry more broadly faced challenging headwinds in the quarter. Revenues fell 13% to $446 million, which included approximately $20 million, or 4% of negative impact from the absence of the extra week. Consumer demand slowed in the fourth quarter more than we initially expected, leading to lower friendly [ph] sales and higher returns, particularly in Christian publishing and general books. Most of the weakness was in North America. Segment EBITDA declined 66% year-over-year to $60 million or 4% segment EBITDA margin. Segment EBITDA was impacted by the week top line performance as well as higher than normal levels of royalty write-offs due to the underperformance of certain titles, further compressing profit margins. Despite some unusual headwinds, we are seeing moderation in freight and manufacturing costs, while headcount reduction initiatives are expected to exceed the 5% target. The backlist represented 59% of revenues for the quarter, up 3 points from last year, but down slightly from Q3. Digital sales declined 10% this quarter mostly driven by lower e-book sales and accounted for 25% of consumer sales, up from 24% last year. On an adjusted basis, revenues fell 13% and segment EBITDA fell 70%. Turning to News Media. Revenues were $571 million, down 9% primarily due to the absence of the extra week, which negatively impacted revenues by $36 million, or 6% and the impact from foreign currency of $80 million or 3%. Adjusted revenues declined 7%. Advertising declined around 15%, reflecting a $15 million or 6% negative impact related to the absence of the extra week and a $6 million or 2% negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact from the extra week and currency, advertising revenues declined approximately 7% due to weaknesses at News Australia, which was impacted by last year's Federal election, and some softness in real estate and retail. News UK and New York posts were relatively stable versus the prior year. Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 7% due to the absence of the extra week negatively impacting revenues by $90 million or 6% at a $9 million or 3% negative impact from foreign currency. Excluding the extra week and currency impact, circulation and subscription revenues rose 2%, with growth driven by cover price increases in the U.K and Australia and double-digit subscriber growth across News Australia and the Times and the Sunday Times. Segment EBITDA of $45 million rose 36% due to a 12% decline in costs driven by ongoing cost saving initiatives and lower costs related to TalkTV and other digital investments. Adjustment segment EBITDA rose 42%. Turning to the outlook. Market trends remain mixed geographically. That said, we have taken aggressive action over the years to improve our asset base, including a shift to more recurring and digital revenues coupled with strong cost initiatives and focused reinvestment in our core pillars. We still expect some inflationary pressures, but are hopeful that they will be at a more modest rate. We exited the fiscal fourth quarter with a return to total segment EBITDA growth and we hope to see improvements in fiscal 2024. Looking at each of our segments, at Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for July declined 5%. REA should benefit from double-digit residential lead growth as price increases have been successfully implemented. Please refer to REA for more specific outlook commentary. At Move, while we anticipate improvements in lead volume and transactions across the full year, they will likely remain challenging in the short-term. We also expect higher marketing spend compared to the fourth quarter together with ongoing investment in adjacencies, which we will balance with cost reductions. In Subscription Video Services, we remain pleased with the performance of the streaming products and the ongoing focus on broadcast ARPU and churn as we complete the migration of customers from cable in the first half. We expect modestly higher expenses for the full year driven by sports rights and product investment, which will be more weighted to the first half. We expect full year CapEx and profitability will be relatively stable in local currency. At Dow Jones, we hope to see improvement in advertising declines. But as is typical, visibility is limited. We also expect to see continued strong growth from PIB. We expect modestly higher overall expenses in the first quarter and for the full year in contrast to the fourth quarter. In book publishing, HarperCollins in the industry exhibited more volatility last year than normal. That said, July was encouraging with a return to revenue growth. EBITDA margins lifting from the fourth quarter lows and prior year comparisons are easing. At News Media, July advertising trends remain mixed geographically. We expect TalkTV costs will be similar, if not lower from the prior year in local currency. We have also seen moderating newsprint cost pressures in the U.K. We expect CapEx in fiscal 2024 to be moderately higher than in fiscal 2023 primarily due to digital reinvestment. That being said, our CapEx came in notably lower than we expected this fiscal year. And we will be monitoring it closely with respect to macro and business conditions as we did during the current year. We expect to generate strong cash flows and expect to return a high percentage to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Karnovsky from JPMorgan. Please unmute yourself to ask question.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you. Maybe, Susan, just on the cost initiatives. I don't know if there's a way you could frame how much that was contributor in the quarter. And then I think last earnings, you'd stated, you thought the majority of the benefit would come through in the fiscal first quarter. Is that still the case? And then just on the other segment EBITDA that was better sequentially. Is that from the cost savings? And should we think about that line is sustainable?\nSusan Panuccio: Thanks, David. Look, I think we did have a really good quarter in Q4 in relation to the cost savings, and that certainly helped some of the segments, particularly News Media, you can see that coming through in the results. And yes, I did say last quarter that we would expect to see the full benefit coming through into fiscal 2024. I think that still is the case, as we sit here today. We do expect to exceed that $160 million of gross cost savings from the 5% headcount reduction. But I would note as we go into 2024, we will have some inflationary pressures related to wages, newsprint prices, and manufacturing costs. And we will continue with our digital reinvestment initiatives across the various businesses. So that number quoted was gross cost savings, and that will help offset those increases in investments. Just in relation to the other segment, there are a couple of things going on. We had the NAM settlement, the legal fees in the quarter last year. So we got the benefit of that in this quarter. We also had lower bonus accruals coming through in this year than what we did relative to the prior year. I think if you want to think about the next year, I probably have a look at the Q3 rate as sort of an indicative performance for going forward.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you.\nMichael Florin: Thank you. Leila, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alan Gould from Loop Capital. Please unmute yourself to ask your question.\nAlan Gould: Hi. Yes, thanks for taking the question. Robert, I've got two actually. On the Generative AI, can you give us an indication of this consortium? Are you in a consortium? What the process is? Is there any legislative movement? And secondly, can you give some discussion on Simon & Schuster? I realized that they had one author that speak very talkative, but it seemed like the multiple was expensive.\nRobert Thomson: Yes. Alan, look, first of all, on AI you're right by instinct that this is an important moment in the history of news and knowledge, with commercial and social implications and profound impact on creativity and integrity. If fake news and deep fakes are a concern, the potential for sophisticated forgeries for counterfeit content is almost endless. And separately, Generative AI has the potential to recycle itself in what you might call endless, perfidious permutations, and that's why the provenance of the archival base is so crucial and why refreshing daily weekly with incremental improvements is imperative. But -- so the potential is enormous, but garbage in garbage out, garbage all about. We've invested billions of dollars in knowledge creation, actually tens of billions of dollars, and that content certainly has a value in this editorial epoch. And for almost two decades, we've genuinely led the digital debate about provenance, which is echoed in Washington and London, Brussels and Canberra and Tokyo and Rome. For us, what gives me confidence for our company and our community is that the leaders of the largest digital companies are clearly sincerely focused on the issue. They understand our collective responsibility, and we are actively individually engaged in fruitful discussions. So I can't be more specific at this moment. But we see a positive financial result through consensual negotiation, not through litigation. We would like to reward journalists, not lawyers. As for Simon & Schuster, normally we don't speculate on speculation about M&A. But candidly, as you intimated, we wouldn't be prepared to go that high given that in our case, you could reasonably expect 18 months of scrupulous scrutiny by the antitrust authorities, with all related legal costs and the financial opportunity cost. We obviously have great respect for the company and its authors. But given the regulatory risk, we were quietly hoping that, frankly, Simon & Schuster would be reminded, and that we would get the company for a bargain, but it obviously didn't end up in the Barnes & Noble bargain bin.\nMichael Florin: Thanks, Alan.\nAlan Gould: Thank you.\nMichael Florin: Thanks, Alan. Leila, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kane Hannan from Goldman Sachs. Please unmute yourself to ask your question.\nKane Hannan: Good morning, guys. Just on Foxtel, should we still think about the 5 million subs, $3 billion revenue target you guys set out for next year back at the Investor Day? And just given those CapEx comments, does that -- I mean, do we still think it will eventually come down to that [indiscernible] target or something changed there?\nRobert Thomson: Okay. We're certainly aiming high when it comes to Foxtel. And you can see from the success that we've had in streaming, total streaming subs rose 14% to 3.1 million, and our streaming revenues rose 26%, so that's also healthy growth ARPU. At the same time, broadcast churn fell sharply and was 11.1% in the quarter compared to 13.8% in the prior year, while broadcast ARPU rose 2%. So where else in the world are you actually witnessing a decline in the broadcast churn rate while experiencing a continuing surge in streaming, that really is the Foxtel success story.\nSusan Panuccio: And Kane, just in relation to the CapEx, yes, we still think that's a relevant target over time. As I've mentioned in my comments, we expect CapEx to be relatively stable in the coming year because we've got the reinvestment in relation to the aggregation service that we're about to launch.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Kane. Leila, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Entcho Raykovski from Evans & Partners.\nEntcho Raykovski: Hi, Robert. Hi, Susan. My question is around the Foxtel shareholder loan. Obviously, you flagged the intention for it to be repaid. Just interested in once that's repaid, do you expect any recourse to News Corp from lenders? In other words, will you have to guarantee any of the Foxtel refi? And I guess as part of answering that question, is there anything in particular which has driven the ability of Foxtel to refinance, particularly if you're not guaranteeing the loan. And sorry, I will just extend it a little bit further. Should we read this into a preparation for a potential spin out of Foxtel down the track? Obviously, that's been speculated for a little while. Thank you.\nSusan Panuccio: Entcho, maybe I'll take the first couple. So no, we don't have a guarantee on there. And no, we don't expect that there will be anything to do with the guarantee going forward in relation to the refi. Actually, the reason that we could refi it so successfully is really because of the underlying business performance of Foxtel. They've had a great couple of years and really reinvented themselves. And it's a real credit to the team down there that they've got themselves into this position. So that's really what's driving the strong refi outcome. And maybe I'll hand over to Robert to comment on the IPO.\nRobert Thomson: Yes. Entcho, obviously, we can't comment specifically about an IPO. But what I can say with absolute certainty is that the success we've had with Foxtel has given us absolutely the option of optionality.\nEntcho Raykovski: Okay. Thank you.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Entcho. Thanks, Entcho. Leila, we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research. Please unmute yourself to ask your question.\nCraig Huber: Great. Thank you. Book publishing, obviously, the margins and the profit dollars there were much lower than I think most people expect it certainly me, but also they are much lower than what the pre-COVID stuff. Is there any reason to think this environment that the revenue performance and the margins won't continue for at least a few more quarters? This is my question.\nRobert Thomson: Craig, look, obviously, the 53rd week comparison exaggerates the decline, but the inflationary pressures are beginning to abate and some of the costs around royalty write-offs were relatively unique. So the team has Collins have obviously been taking a remedial action to improve our fortunes for this fiscal. We've implemented a price rise across various categories. And actually, the team is particularly confident about the impact of our current releases. And it's safe to say that our expectation, our firm expectation is that there will be significant margin improvement this year. This very week we have 3 of the top 10 fiction bestsellers in the U.S. with the #1 seller, Ann Patchett's Tom Lake, which has already sold more than 100,000 copies across print and digital in the first week on sale. As well in that top 10, we have Demon Copperhead from Barbara Kingsolver, and The Collector by Daniel Silva. Now that success in the top 10 will be reflected in the bottom line.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Craig. Leila we will take our next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lucy Huang from UBS. Please unmute yourself to ask your question.\nLucy Huang: Thanks, Robert, and thanks, Susan. I just had one question on Professional Information Services. Are you able to talk through kind of what drove the growth over the fourth quarter. Is it -- or what's the contribution from subscriber growth versus price growth in that business? And I guess maybe if you can talk through some of your margin expectations coming into the fourth quarter. Is there expected to be more incremental investment in this space? Or could we see margins continue to expand into next year? Thanks.\nRobert Thomson: Well, Lucy, safe to say we're delighted with the progress in the Dow Jones B2B business. You can see the impact on our margin more broadly at Dow Jones and longer term, you'll see it at News Corporation. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the EBITDA margin at Dow Jones was 13.8% [ph]. In the last quarter, it was 24.4%, and the overall margin at News Corp rose from 11.8% to 14% in a year where we were presented with real macro challenges. Net margin increase is, of course, a measure of growing profitability, but it's also a measure of our robustness. So quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year, we've seen double-digit growth increases at Risk & Compliance. We now expect the same for OPIS and CMA and we are frankly, delighted with the speed of integration of both OPIS and CMA and ensuing quarters, you will see the benefits of that.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Lucy. Leila, we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Han from Morningstar.\nBrian Han: Hi. On the Wall Street Journal, can you please provide some color on digital subscription pricing in terms of how much it rose in the June quarter and what the outlook may be for '24?\nRobert Thomson: Brian, difficult to be too specific. What you're seeing in the circulation patterns at Dow Jones is partly a matter of phasing and a modest decline in print subscriptions. The emphasis is on the digital bundle with the combination of Mark Wash Barns and the Wall Street Journal. And sometimes in the shorter term, that means the average price of age is a little lower, but we are building loyalty and reducing churn in each of the products and in the long-term, increasing the price elasticity. I mean, the biggest problem for any [indiscernible] business, apart from acquisition itself is churn.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Brian. Leila, we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darren Leung from Macquarie. Your line is open. Feel free to unmute.\nDarren Leung: Hi, guys. Thanks for the [indiscernible]. Just a quick one on Move, please. It looks like the revenues declined 24%, but listing is obviously only down 20%. So I just wanted a bit of clarity in terms of essentially the first period where we've actually seen revenue growth decline more than volume growth. So I just wanted a clarity as to what's happening to the yield and other products space, that's usually been a bit of an offset for the business, please?\nRobert Thomson: Obviously, the housing market slowdown in the U.S. is having a profound impact on all digital property companies. And that is being reflected to a certain extent at Realtor. But I have to say the company is core to News Corporation, it's complementary to other assets. And you're going to see that irrefutable fact in coming months with the impact of Damian Eales, who knows company intimately. And what you will see with a lot of digital property companies is the cost of marketing. And we're remaking our marketing and have strong plans for leveraging our platforms. And look, we're talking about enormously influential digital platforms. It helps the Wall Street Journal, by the way, to have exposure in Florida via Realtor. And it helps Realtor to have the Florida audience in the New York Post, which is in the many, many millions. As I mentioned, the post has about 145 million monthly uniques. We have about 80 million at Dow Jones. And in the U.S. alone, about $110 million at the Sun depending on the month. And so in building both listings and yield, we're going to be obsessively focused on leveraging that comparative advantage.\nSusan Panuccio: And Darren, there's a little bit of noise in the numbers because of week 53. If you exclude the week 53 impact, it was actually down 17%, which was consistent with what it was down last quarter.\nRobert Thomson: And I would just make one further observation about the Australian property market, as Susan alluded to earlier. I would say that we are seeing some particularly positive signs in the Australian housing market, which will surely benefit REA and us. There's no doubt that activity has already picked up this quarter, and that should be reflected in our results. It's a very transparent market. Anyone can track listings and the auction completion rate. So I would encourage investors to do the math in coming weeks. Sometimes we've gotten that, thanks to Lachlan Murdoch. REA is an integral part of News Corporation, and it has a market cap today of around A$21 billion.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Darren.\nDarren Leung: Thanks, guys.\nMichael Florin: Thanks, Darren. Leila, we will take our next question.\nOperator: The Next question will be a follow-up from Craig Huber from Huber Research.\nCraig Huber: Great. Thank you. I appreciate the much better results in this quarter and you guys have had some really good results you ever since COVID happened, in particular. But it comes up all the time with investors, why is this company News Corp so complicated. And is there any potential movement here to simplify the company going forward? I just -- I guess, I'd love to have updated thoughts on that with what you can tell us. Thank you.\nRobert Thomson: Look, we are constantly reviewing our structure to ensure the optimal use of resources and the best outcomes for investors. That's why we were prepared to contemplate the sale of Realtor for rather generous price. And why we've done much underlying structural and regulatory work that gives us more flexibility in our collective decision making. So we are conscious -- acutely conscious of our responsibilities to investors, but also acutely aware of the value of our assets. And we've been building a portfolio for a reason. You can see -- since our split, annual print-related revenues have decreased almost $3.2 billion. That is correct, $3.2 billion. And we've more than replace that number with digital growth and made the company far more profitable with far greater free cash flow. So we know that we do need to provide more transparency so that the value and the potential of our assets are better understood as you make clear. That's why we break out Dow Jones. And you can see the rapidly increasing revenues, particularly in the professional information business, which was the largest contributor to profitability this year. And that has already been noticed by investors.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Craig. Leila, we will take our next question.\nOperator: At this time, we have no further questions. So I'll hand over to Michael Florin for closing remarks.\nMichael Florin: Great. Well, thank you, Leila, and thank you all very much for participating. Have a wonderful day, and we will talk to you soon. Take care.",

            "name": "Susan Panuccio",
            "content": "Thank you, Robert. Our second half results show marked improvement from the first half of the year with fourth quarter profitability up year-over-year, highlighting the diversity and durability of our revenue streams, and our ongoing cost efficiencies as we navigated the ever changing macro conditions, supply chain pressures and currency headwinds. As the company continues to transition to digital, digital revenues now comprise over half of the company's fiscal 2023 revenues. We have also transformed the revenue base away from cyclical advertising revenues to one that is much more recurring and subscription base with strong growth prospects. We have made strategic acquisitions that we believe have fundamentally strengthened the company. The acquisitions of OPIS, CMA, HMH, Mortgage Choice, and IBD during fiscal 2021 and 2022, have essentially replaced the revenues from News America Marketing, providing a much stronger base for long-term growth. The company has changed and evolved since 2013, and is well-positioned for future success. We have maintained a very healthy balance sheet, while we strengthen the asset base, transformed digitally, generating healthy free cash flow and continue to improve our operating efficiencies. Turning to our financials, I'll focus on the fourth quarter performance. Fourth quarter total revenues were over $2.4 billion, down 9% year-over-year, which was heavily impacted by the $110 million or 4% negative impact related to the extra week last year, and the $72 million or 3% impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Impressively, total segment EBITDA was $341 million, up 8% year-over-year despite very difficult year-over-year comparisons and weak trading conditions at HarperCollins. Margins improved by over 2 percentage points to 14%. Fourth quarter adjusted revenues declined 7% compared to the prior year, while adjusted total segment EBITDA rose 2% versus the prior year. Both revenues and total segment EBITDA were also negatively impacted by the extra week last year. Adjusted revenue and total segment EBITDA did not exclude that impact. Earnings per share in the quarter were a loss of $0.01 compared to income of $0.19 in the prior year. The current quarter reflects $85 million of restructuring and impairment charges mostly related to our company wide headcount reduction that we communicated on the last earnings call and an $81 million noncash write-down in equity losses of affiliates related to REA's investment in PropertyGuru. The prior year income of $0.19 benefited from $149 million tax benefit. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.14 in the quarter compared to $0.37 in the prior year. Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments starting with digital real estate services. Segment revenues were $369 million, down 17% compared to the prior year, impacted by the ongoing macroeconomic pressures, a negative impact of $15 million or 4% from foreign currency fluctuations and $14 million or 3% of negative impact from the extra week last year. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues decreased 14%. Segment EBITDA declined 11% to $108 million impacted by lower revenues partially offset by the lower discretionary costs, compensation and broker commissions. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 5%. REA revenues were $223 million, which declined 11% on a reported basis or down 5% on a constant currency basis. The revenue decline was due to the impact of lower national listings and a decrease in financial services revenue driven by lower settlement activity. New buy listings for the fourth quarter were down 18% year-over-year with the higher yielding metro areas of Sydney and Melbourne showing improvement each month of the quarter, yet ended down 17% and 16%, respectively. Those declines were partially offset by the annual price increases in the residential and commercial businesses, increased uptake in premium products including Premiere Plus, favorable depth penetration and continued strong performance from REA India, which maintained its audience leadership. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details. At Move, revenues were $146 million, down 24% compared to the prior year, which reflects the $40 million or 7% negative impact related to the absence of the extra week. Excluding the extra week impact, revenue declined 17% similar to the third quarter results, with lead optimization in the lead generation products partially offsetting lower lead and transaction volume. Lead volumes moderated to down 14% year-over-year compared to a decline of 30% in the third quarter, while Realtors average monthly unique users declined 20% from the prior year to 74 million in the fourth quarter, based on internal metrics, yet up from 72 million in the third quarter. We remain focused on driving both usage and engagement through continued product enhancements and improvements to SEO, while expanding our core adjacencies of seller, rentals and new homes. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $501 million, down 4% compared to the prior year on a reported basis due to foreign currency headwinds. On a constant currency basis, revenues rose 3% versus the prior year, the sixth consecutive quarter of growth in constant currency. Streaming revenues accounted for 29% of circulation and subscription revenues compared to 23% in the prior year. OTT revenue growth again more than offset broadcast revenue declines benefiting from both increased subscribers and price increases at Kayo and BINGE. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group improved to over 4.6 million at quarter end, up 5% year-over-year. Total paid streaming subscribers approached 3.1 million, increasing 14% versus the prior year and accounted for approximately 66% of Foxtel's total paid subscriber base. Binge continued to expand advertising inventory on the basic product, generating both modest incremental revenues and some upgrade activity to the higher tiered subscription offerings. Foxtel ended the quarter with over 1.3 million residential broadcast subscribers, down only 9% year-over-year. Broadcast churn continued to improve, down more than 260 basis points year-over-year to 11.1%, the lowest level since fiscal 2016, while broadcast ARPU rose 2% to over A$84. Foxtel announced a price rise beginning in July across some of the broadcasters, the first since fiscal 2019 which will benefit the fiscal 2024 results. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $78 million was down 4% versus the prior year, but was up 4% on an adjusted basis despite higher programming costs, mostly related to contractual escalators across key sports rights. On the product front, following the successful growth in streaming, the business will be launching a streaming aggregation device leveraging the Sky Glass technology. expectation is for a commercial launch later in fiscal 2024 and we will keep you updated on our progress. Moving to Dow Jones. Dow Jones had another strong quarter with revenues of $546 million, down 3% which includes the negative impact of $40 million, or 7% related to the absence of the extra week from last year. We let the OPIS acquisition in March and CMA in June. Digital revenues accounted for 79% of total revenues this quarter, up 3 percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription based revenues represent over 79% of total revenues, up over 2 percentage points from the prior year, underscoring the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 6%, but would have delivered a modest improvement excluding the extra week. We are continuing to see strong momentum in our professional information business with revenues rising 10% year-over-year, benefiting from the continued integration of OPIS and CMA, coupled with strong revenues from risk and compliance. Results were partly offset by the extra week last year, which led to a $14 million or 8% negative impact on the performance. Excluding the extra week, PIB revenues grew 18%. PIB revenues this quarter accounted for 37% of segment revenues. And while we don't disclose specific margins, PIB margins are higher than the overall Dow Jones margin and are contributing strongly to segment EBITDA, underscoring the uniqueness and durability of the Dow Jones asset mix. Risk & Compliance revenues rose 10% despite the extra week in the prior year, and continue to grow at a high-teens rate on a like-for-like basis. While 60% of the customers are in the financial services sector, the fastest growth is now coming from corporates with demand driven by the anti-money laundering, financial corruption and ESG screening and monitoring products. Retention remains over 90%. OPIS and CMA's revenue performance remains robust benefiting from price escalators, new products and new customers. Retention rates for OPIS and CMA subscription products remain in the mid 90s, which is underpinning the transformation of Dow Jones revenue base. Circulation revenues declined 6% due to the absence of the extra week, lower print volume and weakness at IBD as we noted in the third quarter. Excluding the extra week impact of $17 million, or 7%, circulation revenues were up 1% year-over-year, which is slightly higher than the third quarter rate. Total Dow Jones digital-only subscriptions grew 12% year-over-year or by 163,000 sequentially, with the year-over-year rate improving from last quarter. Advertising revenues declined 14% to $100 million and accounted for 18% of Dow Jones revenues this quarter with digital down 10% and print down 18%. Excluding the negative impact from the absence of the extra week of $9 million or 8% the decline rate moderated from the third quarter to down 6%. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 25% to $133 million, as cost growth moderated from the first half. Margins improved to 24%, up from 19% last year. Adjusted segment EBITDA for the quarter increased 17%, a notable improvement over the third quarter and the full year performance. At book publishing, both HarperCollins and the industry more broadly faced challenging headwinds in the quarter. Revenues fell 13% to $446 million, which included approximately $20 million, or 4% of negative impact from the absence of the extra week. Consumer demand slowed in the fourth quarter more than we initially expected, leading to lower friendly [ph] sales and higher returns, particularly in Christian publishing and general books. Most of the weakness was in North America. Segment EBITDA declined 66% year-over-year to $60 million or 4% segment EBITDA margin. Segment EBITDA was impacted by the week top line performance as well as higher than normal levels of royalty write-offs due to the underperformance of certain titles, further compressing profit margins. Despite some unusual headwinds, we are seeing moderation in freight and manufacturing costs, while headcount reduction initiatives are expected to exceed the 5% target. The backlist represented 59% of revenues for the quarter, up 3 points from last year, but down slightly from Q3. Digital sales declined 10% this quarter mostly driven by lower e-book sales and accounted for 25% of consumer sales, up from 24% last year. On an adjusted basis, revenues fell 13% and segment EBITDA fell 70%. Turning to News Media. Revenues were $571 million, down 9% primarily due to the absence of the extra week, which negatively impacted revenues by $36 million, or 6% and the impact from foreign currency of $80 million or 3%. Adjusted revenues declined 7%. Advertising declined around 15%, reflecting a $15 million or 6% negative impact related to the absence of the extra week and a $6 million or 2% negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact from the extra week and currency, advertising revenues declined approximately 7% due to weaknesses at News Australia, which was impacted by last year's Federal election, and some softness in real estate and retail. News UK and New York posts were relatively stable versus the prior year. Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 7% due to the absence of the extra week negatively impacting revenues by $90 million or 6% at a $9 million or 3% negative impact from foreign currency. Excluding the extra week and currency impact, circulation and subscription revenues rose 2%, with growth driven by cover price increases in the U.K and Australia and double-digit subscriber growth across News Australia and the Times and the Sunday Times. Segment EBITDA of $45 million rose 36% due to a 12% decline in costs driven by ongoing cost saving initiatives and lower costs related to TalkTV and other digital investments. Adjustment segment EBITDA rose 42%. Turning to the outlook. Market trends remain mixed geographically. That said, we have taken aggressive action over the years to improve our asset base, including a shift to more recurring and digital revenues coupled with strong cost initiatives and focused reinvestment in our core pillars. We still expect some inflationary pressures, but are hopeful that they will be at a more modest rate. We exited the fiscal fourth quarter with a return to total segment EBITDA growth and we hope to see improvements in fiscal 2024. Looking at each of our segments, at Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for July declined 5%. REA should benefit from double-digit residential lead growth as price increases have been successfully implemented. Please refer to REA for more specific outlook commentary. At Move, while we anticipate improvements in lead volume and transactions across the full year, they will likely remain challenging in the short-term. We also expect higher marketing spend compared to the fourth quarter together with ongoing investment in adjacencies, which we will balance with cost reductions. In Subscription Video Services, we remain pleased with the performance of the streaming products and the ongoing focus on broadcast ARPU and churn as we complete the migration of customers from cable in the first half. We expect modestly higher expenses for the full year driven by sports rights and product investment, which will be more weighted to the first half. We expect full year CapEx and profitability will be relatively stable in local currency. At Dow Jones, we hope to see improvement in advertising declines. But as is typical, visibility is limited. We also expect to see continued strong growth from PIB. We expect modestly higher overall expenses in the first quarter and for the full year in contrast to the fourth quarter. In book publishing, HarperCollins in the industry exhibited more volatility last year than normal. That said, July was encouraging with a return to revenue growth. EBITDA margins lifting from the fourth quarter lows and prior year comparisons are easing. At News Media, July advertising trends remain mixed geographically. We expect TalkTV costs will be similar, if not lower from the prior year in local currency. We have also seen moderating newsprint cost pressures in the U.K. We expect CapEx in fiscal 2024 to be moderately higher than in fiscal 2023 primarily due to digital reinvestment. That being said, our CapEx came in notably lower than we expected this fiscal year. And we will be monitoring it closely with respect to macro and business conditions as we did during the current year. We expect to generate strong cash flows and expect to return a high percentage to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A. Thanks, David. Look, I think we did have a really good quarter in Q4 in relation to the cost savings, and that certainly helped some of the segments, particularly News Media, you can see that coming through in the results. And yes, I did say last quarter that we would expect to see the full benefit coming through into fiscal 2024. I think that still is the case, as we sit here today. We do expect to exceed that $160 million of gross cost savings from the 5% headcount reduction. But I would note as we go into 2024, we will have some inflationary pressures related to wages, newsprint prices, and manufacturing costs. And we will continue with our digital reinvestment initiatives across the various businesses. So that number quoted was gross cost savings, and that will help offset those increases in investments. Just in relation to the other segment, there are a couple of things going on. We had the NAM settlement, the legal fees in the quarter last year. So we got the benefit of that in this quarter. We also had lower bonus accruals coming through in this year than what we did relative to the prior year. I think if you want to think about the next year, I probably have a look at the Q3 rate as sort of an indicative performance for going forward. And Kane, just in relation to the CapEx, yes, we still think that's a relevant target over time. As I've mentioned in my comments, we expect CapEx to be relatively stable in the coming year because we've got the reinvestment in relation to the aggregation service that we're about to launch. Entcho, maybe I'll take the first couple. So no, we don't have a guarantee on there. And no, we don't expect that there will be anything to do with the guarantee going forward in relation to the refi. Actually, the reason that we could refi it so successfully is really because of the underlying business performance of Foxtel. They've had a great couple of years and really reinvented themselves. And it's a real credit to the team down there that they've got themselves into this position. So that's really what's driving the strong refi outcome. And maybe I'll hand over to Robert to comment on the IPO. And Darren, there's a little bit of noise in the numbers because of week 53. If you exclude the week 53 impact, it was actually down 17%, which was consistent with what it was down last quarter."

            "name": "Robert Thomson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Before we discuss results for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2023, I would like to acknowledge that we've now completed a decade of the News Corp's existence. So this is surely an appropriate moment to reflect on our profound transformation, a transformation faithful to the company's founding principles. Consider then and the now, our revenue basis changed fundamentally and expanded dramatically. News and information services accounted for 72% of total revenues in fiscal 2014, which included News America Marketing and Dow Jones. By fiscal 2023, News Media was 23% and revitalized Dow Jones segment was 22%. Digital real estate comprised 5% of total revenues 10 years ago, and that has tripled to over 15% this past year, which includes the acquisition of Move, were revenues have more than doubled. Subscription video services revenues increased from 6% of News Corp's total to 20%, bolstered by the consolidation and control of Foxtel, a business renewed, and Foxtel's imminent completion of a refinancing is expected to facilitate repayments of our outstanding shareholder loans beginning this fiscal year. Candidly, since our reincarnation, we have increasingly digital recurring revenues, higher margins, significantly more free cash flow, robust finances, and bright prospects for long-term growth and value creation for all our shareholders. A few facts to demonstrate our digital scale today. Based on our June metrics, we had 79 million unique visitors at Dow Jones, 159 million at the Sun, 74 million at Realtor.com, 21 million at Housing.com in India, and 145 million at the increasingly influential New York Post. And that digital momentum is surely gathering pace in the age of Generative AI. Along with this relentless focus on digitization, we have been intent on simplifying the company and heightening our cost consciousness. That cost discipline was clearly evident during a year that had a complicated plot line for books. While digital real estate was naturally inevitably affected by the interest rate hikes which appear to be plateauing in the U.S. I would like to pay sincere tribute to Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and our Directors who have been steadfast in their strategic support, and all our employees and our loyal, insightful investors. Thanks to their collective committed efforts, News Corp achieved its three strongest fiscal years ever in the last three fiscal years 2021, 2022 and 2023. In fact, fiscal '23, was our second most profitable year following fiscal '22, despite the difficult macro conditions in a couple of core segments, and our fourth quarter profitability was significantly higher than last year. There have certainly been fundamental changes in the media landscape. We have led the quest for appropriate compensation for content from the big digital platforms. And that quest began publicly in 2007 when I testified before the House of Lords about the challenges for publishers, and society in the internet age has entered a new, fascinating phase with the rise of Generative AI. Clearly, negotiations are well underway with the relevant companies. And once again, News Corp hopes to set precedents that benefit creators, publishers and journalists around the globe. It is crucial for our societies that AI is replete with EI. That re-composition does not lead to the decomposition of creativity and integrity. We have been characteristically candid about the AI challenge to publishers and to intellectual property. It is essentially a triptych. In the first instance, our content is being harvested and scraped and otherwise ingested to train AI engines. Ingestion should not lead to indigestion. Secondly, individual stories are being surfaced in specific searches. And thirdly, original content can be synthesized and presented as distinct when it is actually an extracting of our editorial essence. These super snippets distilling the effort and insight of great journalism are potentially designed so the reader will never visit a news site, thus fatally undermining journalism and damaging our societies. It is reassuring that the prescient executives at the largest digital companies can see these complexities and understand that our shared responsibilities extend far beyond the commercial, that Generative AI cannot be degenerative, that we are paving a platform for future generations and that we will be collectively held to account and not just by accountants. From the philosophical to the functional, there is no doubt that AI articulations will affect most sections of most companies, whether it be customer service, subscription management, chatbots -- the chatbots, text to audio and audio to video, experiences, efficiencies will be exponential. And we are absolutely clear in our company, there must be a confluence of the technological, the commercial and the cultural. Last earnings, I mentioned the plight of Wall Street Journal reporter, Evan Gershkovich, unjustly incarcerated by Russia for being a journalist seeking facts, seeking the truth. Both the Journal and the U.S government vehemently deny the allegations against him. Evan has now spent almost 5 months in prison. And we thank the many thoughtful people from all around the globe who have rallied to his cause and sought his release. And we thank those who are continuing to press determinedly for his emancipation, and providing support to his courageous family. Turning now to our results for Q4 and fiscal year 2023. The aforementioned macroeconomic factors, that is inflation, supply chain complications, and vaulting interest rates along with volatile foreign exchange rates, patently presented challenges, some of which are more ephemeral than eternal. Nonetheless, we still saw significant progress across several segments. And thanks to our digital and international strategic focus, and acute cost consciousness, including the announced 5% headcount reduction, which we expect to yield more than $160 million in annual gross savings. Not only was this fiscal year the second best ever in terms of profits, we believe we are poised for greater growth in the years ahead. As for the fourth quarter, revenues were over $2.43 billion, 9% lower year-over-year, though a majority of that decline is attributable to foreign exchange rates and an extra week last year, a 53rd week to balance out the multiyear calendar. Mathematically that one extra week accounts for almost half of the difference, and will obviously not be a factor in the current year. Profitability in the quarter rose 8%, which is especially notable and that it comes after a 50% rise a year earlier. We are building on our positive performances even when the headwinds are blustery. Full year revenues were $9.879 billion, down 5% on our record prior year, and total segment EBITDA was over $1.4 billion, 15% lower, thought still the second highest profits recorded for the new News Corp. Dow Jones posted its highest profitability for both the quarter and the full year since we acquired the company, helped by impressive results in the professional information business. In fact, taking a step back, Dow Jones has doubled its profitability in the past 4 years. And for the first time, Dow Jones was the highest contributor profits across all of News Corp in fiscal 2023 as we continue to develop the high margin B2B offerings. We are focused on Dow Jones as a pillar of News Corp's future growth with significant value appreciation for shareholders. Dow Jones is nearing an important threshold with the lucrative B2B business expected to be the highest contributor to profitability in fiscal 2024 and a key driver for future margin expansion. Dow Jones has been bolstered over the past year by the acquisitions of OPIS and Chemical Market Analytics, and by continuing double-digit growth of risk and compliance. It is worth noting that risk and compliance revenues have risen six-fold over the past decade. We believe prospects remain decidedly bright, as the corporate imperative to minimize risk and maximize compliance grows in an ever more complex regulatory regime. We believe the energy transition is an enormous global opportunity for OPIS and we will capitalize on it through new products. The establishment of compelling benchmarks and the generation of must have data, pricing and analytics, whether it be for fossil fuels, hydrogen, solar, lithium, cobalt, EVs, or carbon credits and offsets. The industry relies on OPIS for pricing transparency, which is critical to day by day decision making in a market that is undergoing massive transformation. Dow Jones digital subscription growth accelerated in the second half, partly helped by bundling of our products to capitalize on our clients need for sophisticated market analysis and analytics. We want to channel Market Watch readers to WSJ then to Barron's and Investor's Business Daily, and from there to our specialists business products, that is a pathway to profits for the company. Moreover, we are increasing our international digital focus for the Wall Street Journal, which currently has only 12% of subscriptions outside the U.S where there is much untapped potential. Subscription video services reported adjusted revenue and profit growth, which excludes currency impact for the second straight year, and also for the fourth quarter, a remarkable turnaround from the recent past. We have long-term rights for the key Australian sports and the prime international sports for Australians and have created a model that streamers around the world are now trying to emulate. Our streaming revenue growth again outpaced broadcast declines in both Q4 and the full year, with paid subscribers scaling at a double-digit rate to nearly 3.1 million. So we are particularly confident about Foxtel's future and our optionality given the imminent completion of our refinancing. We were asked frequently in the past how much more capital we would need to commit to Foxtel. But the question now is how much cash we will receive in coming years. REA continued to be impacted by macroeconomic challenges in the Australian housing market, though we do see an easing of those challenges as the interest rate cycle peaks. Home prices have again started to increase and the auction completion rate cross 70% in June, up from 55% in the prior year, REA's audience share against its nearest competitor continued to expand to north of 3.5x in June, while visits to the site have expanded year-over-year for four consecutive months. REA did benefit from product price increases linked to improvements in the quality of those products. While India remains a source of ongoing potential given that Housing.com is already the market leader in a country on a positive economic trajectory with a rapidly expanding middle class. In the U.S., we have new leadership at Move operator Realtor.com. Move experienced much success under David Doctorow and broaden its offerings with the acquisitions of Opcity, UpNest and Avail. We sincerely thank David for his positive contribution, which will resonate for years to come. Damian Eales brings vast digital experience and fiercely competitive spirit and much knowledge of how to leverage News Corp's powerful U.S platforms, whether that be the New York Post, or The Wall Street Journal, or Barron's to build the brand and expand market share. Damian has just returned from Australia, where the Realtor team spent time at REA and the creative collaboration between the two companies will certainly intensify. Scale is crucial. And to put our scale in perspective based on June ComScore data, Realtors valuable and engaged audience is well over 2x of that of Homes.com. Not only do we have scale in residential sales, we believe that we can continue to monetize that audience successfully. For HarperCollins, and for other book publishers, Q4 and fiscal '23 generally was a challenging period with the post-COVID market resetting, logistical issues at Amazon and acute inflationary pressures. Some particular signs of success were joined against Magnolia Table Volume 3, and remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby Van Pelt. And we have reason for optimism in the near future with books like Tom Lake by Ann Patchett, The Collector by Daniel Silva, and in the T.V.: Big Adventures on the Small Screen by Peter Kay. In Q2, we are looking forward to the next Pioneer Woman Cooks by Ree Drummond Reed Drummond, and The Little Liar by Mitch Albom. In News Media, advertising trends very distinctly by geography with the U.K and the U.S performing best in the quarter. In the UK, the Sun had a successful year, with digital outpacing print ads again in the fourth quarter and for the full year. This strength was accentuated by the year-over-year growth of the Sun in the U.S., which reported a substantial surge in page views, and even higher yields than the successful U.K site. The Times and Sunday Times also hit 565,000 digital subscriptions at the end of June and a 11% increase, underscoring the strength of their journalism and the global potential of the brand. News Corp Australia achieved almost 1.1 million digital subscriptions, an increase of 10%. News.com.au was the leading news website in Australia according to the Ipsos rankings, while the Australian was also in the top 10. In the U.S., the New York Post reported another year of strong profits after decades, if not centuries of endless losses. As I mentioned, the Paper's improved commercial fortunes have been accompanied by growing influence in New York, Washington, and beyond. As the Paper's founder Alexander Hamilton sagely observed, those who stand for nothing for for everything. In a fiscal year affected by the reverberations of war, inflation, interest rate hikes, supply chain disruption and other macroeconomic challenges, and in a business inevitably impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations, News Corp is proud to report its second most profitable year since its reincarnation a decade ago. Our teams have been tested and have clearly passed that exacting test. We ended the year on an upswing, with the company returning to profit growth in the quarter with inflation showing signs of abating, interest rates plateauing, and incipient signs of stability in the housing market we have sound reasons for optimism. All specious macro conditions will surely work to the benefit of a company that has become more digital, more global and with more recurring revenues in higher margin segments. We have navigated the sometimes perilous media waters adroitly and are particularly proud of our provenance, a provenance based on commitment, curiosity, and integrity. We look forward with a sense of genuine of tangible excitement in the potential of our people and our businesses. And we remain utterly determined to deliver positive results for our customers, our employees, and most certainly, for our shareholders. I will now pass you to our erudite CFO, Susan Panuccio, who will provide more insight into our financial coordinate. Yes. Alan, look, first of all, on AI you're right by instinct that this is an important moment in the history of news and knowledge, with commercial and social implications and profound impact on creativity and integrity. If fake news and deep fakes are a concern, the potential for sophisticated forgeries for counterfeit content is almost endless. And separately, Generative AI has the potential to recycle itself in what you might call endless, perfidious permutations, and that's why the provenance of the archival base is so crucial and why refreshing daily weekly with incremental improvements is imperative. But -- so the potential is enormous, but garbage in garbage out, garbage all about. We've invested billions of dollars in knowledge creation, actually tens of billions of dollars, and that content certainly has a value in this editorial epoch. And for almost two decades, we've genuinely led the digital debate about provenance, which is echoed in Washington and London, Brussels and Canberra and Tokyo and Rome. For us, what gives me confidence for our company and our community is that the leaders of the largest digital companies are clearly sincerely focused on the issue. They understand our collective responsibility, and we are actively individually engaged in fruitful discussions. So I can't be more specific at this moment. But we see a positive financial result through consensual negotiation, not through litigation. We would like to reward journalists, not lawyers. As for Simon & Schuster, normally we don't speculate on speculation about M&A. But candidly, as you intimated, we wouldn't be prepared to go that high given that in our case, you could reasonably expect 18 months of scrupulous scrutiny by the antitrust authorities, with all related legal costs and the financial opportunity cost. We obviously have great respect for the company and its authors. But given the regulatory risk, we were quietly hoping that, frankly, Simon & Schuster would be reminded, and that we would get the company for a bargain, but it obviously didn't end up in the Barnes & Noble bargain bin. Okay. We're certainly aiming high when it comes to Foxtel. And you can see from the success that we've had in streaming, total streaming subs rose 14% to 3.1 million, and our streaming revenues rose 26%, so that's also healthy growth ARPU. At the same time, broadcast churn fell sharply and was 11.1% in the quarter compared to 13.8% in the prior year, while broadcast ARPU rose 2%. So where else in the world are you actually witnessing a decline in the broadcast churn rate while experiencing a continuing surge in streaming, that really is the Foxtel success story. Yes. Entcho, obviously, we can't comment specifically about an IPO. But what I can say with absolute certainty is that the success we've had with Foxtel has given us absolutely the option of optionality. Craig, look, obviously, the 53rd week comparison exaggerates the decline, but the inflationary pressures are beginning to abate and some of the costs around royalty write-offs were relatively unique. So the team has Collins have obviously been taking a remedial action to improve our fortunes for this fiscal. We've implemented a price rise across various categories. And actually, the team is particularly confident about the impact of our current releases. And it's safe to say that our expectation, our firm expectation is that there will be significant margin improvement this year. This very week we have 3 of the top 10 fiction bestsellers in the U.S. with the #1 seller, Ann Patchett's Tom Lake, which has already sold more than 100,000 copies across print and digital in the first week on sale. As well in that top 10, we have Demon Copperhead from Barbara Kingsolver, and The Collector by Daniel Silva. Now that success in the top 10 will be reflected in the bottom line. Well, Lucy, safe to say we're delighted with the progress in the Dow Jones B2B business. You can see the impact on our margin more broadly at Dow Jones and longer term, you'll see it at News Corporation. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the EBITDA margin at Dow Jones was 13.8% [ph]. In the last quarter, it was 24.4%, and the overall margin at News Corp rose from 11.8% to 14% in a year where we were presented with real macro challenges. Net margin increase is, of course, a measure of growing profitability, but it's also a measure of our robustness. So quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year, we've seen double-digit growth increases at Risk & Compliance. We now expect the same for OPIS and CMA and we are frankly, delighted with the speed of integration of both OPIS and CMA and ensuing quarters, you will see the benefits of that. Brian, difficult to be too specific. What you're seeing in the circulation patterns at Dow Jones is partly a matter of phasing and a modest decline in print subscriptions. The emphasis is on the digital bundle with the combination of Mark Wash Barns and the Wall Street Journal. And sometimes in the shorter term, that means the average price of age is a little lower, but we are building loyalty and reducing churn in each of the products and in the long-term, increasing the price elasticity. I mean, the biggest problem for any [indiscernible] business, apart from acquisition itself is churn. Obviously, the housing market slowdown in the U.S. is having a profound impact on all digital property companies. And that is being reflected to a certain extent at Realtor. But I have to say the company is core to News Corporation, it's complementary to other assets. And you're going to see that irrefutable fact in coming months with the impact of Damian Eales, who knows company intimately. And what you will see with a lot of digital property companies is the cost of marketing. And we're remaking our marketing and have strong plans for leveraging our platforms. And look, we're talking about enormously influential digital platforms. It helps the Wall Street Journal, by the way, to have exposure in Florida via Realtor. And it helps Realtor to have the Florida audience in the New York Post, which is in the many, many millions. As I mentioned, the post has about 145 million monthly uniques. We have about 80 million at Dow Jones. And in the U.S. alone, about $110 million at the Sun depending on the month. And so in building both listings and yield, we're going to be obsessively focused on leveraging that comparative advantage. And I would just make one further observation about the Australian property market, as Susan alluded to earlier. I would say that we are seeing some particularly positive signs in the Australian housing market, which will surely benefit REA and us. There's no doubt that activity has already picked up this quarter, and that should be reflected in our results. It's a very transparent market. Anyone can track listings and the auction completion rate. So I would encourage investors to do the math in coming weeks. Sometimes we've gotten that, thanks to Lachlan Murdoch. REA is an integral part of News Corporation, and it has a market cap today of around A$21 billion. Look, we are constantly reviewing our structure to ensure the optimal use of resources and the best outcomes for investors. That's why we were prepared to contemplate the sale of Realtor for rather generous price. And why we've done much underlying structural and regulatory work that gives us more flexibility in our collective decision making. So we are conscious -- acutely conscious of our responsibilities to investors, but also acutely aware of the value of our assets. And we've been building a portfolio for a reason. You can see -- since our split, annual print-related revenues have decreased almost $3.2 billion. That is correct, $3.2 billion. And we've more than replace that number with digital growth and made the company far more profitable with far greater free cash flow. So we know that we do need to provide more transparency so that the value and the potential of our assets are better understood as you make clear. That's why we break out Dow Jones. And you can see the rapidly increasing revenues, particularly in the professional information business, which was the largest contributor to profitability this year. And that has already been noticed by investors."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMichael Florin: Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's fiscal third quarter 2023 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We will open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings release for the applicable periods posted on our website. With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\nRobert Thomson: Thank you, Mike. Before discussing our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 it is particularly important to begin by noting that today marks the 44th day in captivity for Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich who was wrongfully willfully detained in Russia. I would like to express our thanks and that of Mr. Latour, Emma Tucker, and all the Dow Jones for the unstinting support shown for Evan and his family by the U.S. and many other governments, media companies, journalism organizations and concerned principled people around the world. We trust that justice and common sense will prevail and that Evan will soon be released. Turning now to the third quarter results. We began to see meaningful improvements compared to the prior quarter with certain macro and sect oral trends more positive, and our cost cutting program beginning to gain traction. For context, these earnings follow record revenues and profitability in fiscal 2022. And we've been confronting the challenges of foreign exchange volatility, a surge in interest rates, persistent inflation, and ongoing supply chain disruptions. Our results demonstrate the fundamental differences in the character of News Corp, compared with other media companies. In a period in which advertising activity was clearly insipid in certain parts of the world our core non advertising revenue was particularly robust, highlighted by a 38% increase in revenues at the Dow Jones professional information business. For the quarter, total revenues were over $2.4 billion down only 2% year-over-year as compared to the 7% decline in Q2. Adjusted revenues excluding our acquisitions and distinctly unfavorable Forex movements equal those of last year. Meanwhile, profitability was $320 million down 11% despite a tough prior year comparison, and the just articulated external pressures. As for the company wide cost reduction drive, we are well advanced in taking the difficult but necessary step of reducing headcount by 5%, which is now expected to yield more than $160 million in annualized savings by the end of this calendar year. In addition, we are strictly scrutinizing spending across all categories, and expect further savings as we strive for efficiency and efficacy. There has been much discussion, some of it enlightened, some not so about the potential impact of generative AI, and there is no doubt that it will profoundly affect a media business. Candidly, generative AI may pose a challenge to our intellectual property and to the future of journalism. As those who have experimented with ChatGPT will be aware, the answers are only as insightful and factual as the source material, and are more retrospective than contemporary. Given those precepts we see three areas in which our content will be used by generative AI creators, whose products will be enhanced by our IP for which we should be compensated. Firstly, our content will inevitably be used as has already been exploited to train AI engines. Secondly, specific examples of our content will be surfaced in response to us as AI queries. And thirdly, and crucially, our content will certainly be aggregated and synthesized and those answers monetized by other parties, we expect our fair share of that monetization. Generative AI cannot be degenerative AI. The digital debate over content and journalism has evolved significantly in the past few years. And we appreciate the social and commercial commitment of our partners at Google, Apple, Microsoft and Meta. The A in AI cannot be ambiguity, nor can the I represent ignorance, integrity would be more apt, which brings us to Dow Jones among the world's foremost and most trusted purveyors of business news data and analysis. The third quarter reflected its robust revenue generation, even in testing economic times, and as I mentioned, was highlighted by the burgeoning of our professional information business, which reported a 38% surge in revenues, including a 16% rise at our risk and compliance business, and that number was negatively affected by Forex fluctuations.  Dow Jones has certainly benefited from the acquisitions of Opus and CMA, which continue their high margin growth in recent months. We will be expanding their product offerings over the next year, with particular emphasis on renewables and carbon metrics, and we are confident of many years of strong growth ahead. Digital revenues accounted for 79% of all revenues at Dow Jones a significant increase from the 60% level during fiscal 2018. Aside from the professional information business digital subscriptions continue to grow up 9% to $3.3 million at the Wall Street Journal and up 10% to $4.3 million Dow Jones as a whole with total subscriptions now at $5.1 million, despite print subscriptions, obviously being under some pressure. The strong performance overall came despite an insipid ad market in the U.S. with continued weakness in tech advertising. Though we did see an improvement in demand in April, so the auguries have improved. Dare I say the failure of Silicon Valley Bank has been a catalyst for other U.S. financial institutions to try to reassure customers and highlight their own solidity. And the Wall Street Journal, Barron's and market watch a vital platforms for any financial firm aspiring to bolster its credentials. In Australia, Foxtel group continues to build on its streaming success. Streaming now accounts for two thirds of the total Foxtel subscription base, and that revenue growth is more than offsetting the decline in broadcast. Fears that are world class streaming products would be a catalyst for cannibalization have been unfounded. Broadcast churn is at near record low levels with Foxtel retail churn in March under 10%. That success is also a tribute to our marketing and customer service teams at Foxtel and to the leadership of Patrick Delaney and Shavon. McKenna. As at the end of March, Binge entertainment streaming product launched advertising on its basic service adding a new lucrative revenue stream. Interest from advertisers has been added as the initial phase of packages were sold out. We have demand and seemingly some flexibility on pricing in the months and years ahead. After a couple of tough quarters fortunes have certainly improved at HarperCollins. With a bevy of best sellers and some moderation of supply chain snuffers. Margins were higher in the third quarter compared to the first half. We also have an attractive roster of books in this in upcoming quarters. So we believe we are on a journey to the sunlit uplands. Amazon's orders improved in a quarter, and our titles prospered. In particular Ron DeSantis, The Courage to Be Free. Barbara Kingsolver as Damon Copperhead as well as Colleen Hoover and Tarryn Fisher's Never Never and Ben Hall's Saved. In the fourth quarter contempt is already topping bestseller lists with You Can't Joke About That. If I could make a self interested recommendation it is worth a read or listen. Last week we also published the latest incarnation of the Magnolia Table Cookbook. We are justifiably optimistic about the prospects for the Bridget and prequel Queen Charlotte by Julian Quinn, and Shonda Rhimes, which went on sale this week, coinciding with the launch of the new Netflix series. The news media segment reported a substantial improvement over the second quarter with advertising in constant currency increasing 2%, so down 5% in U.S. dollars, this increase was a vastly different outcome to that of most media companies in most countries. We are confident that our teams are more skilled in sharing advertising insights across borders and platforms and that innate intelligence is reflected in our revenue numbers. One success story is the sun.com were total pageviews in the quarter search 94% year-over-year reaching close to a billion views. The site, which has benefited from the partnership with the New York Post and our other U.S. properties, has triumphed in tough times and notably, the Sun's U.S. digital advertising revenues now exceed those of the British platform. In the UK connected listing hours at wireless hit an all time high, reaching an average of 8.4 million per week in the quarter, a 10% increase from the prior year, and reflective of our superb coverage of the Premier League, which reaches its seasonal crescendo in coming days, hopefully within and against the odds triumph by arsenal. As for the New York Post, the previously perennial loss maker continued to be profitable in the third quarter, and to build on its important influence on the national debate. Engagement at the post digital properties rose 4% over the prior year to 690 million pageviews in March, providing a powerful platform for its compelling content. At digital real estate services obviously enough, the interest rate surge and accompanying uncertainty in the housing market have had an impact in the U.S. and Australia. But these are not permanent conditions and the digitization of the property market is far from complete. There were signs of improvement in the market this quarter, but we understand that the increase in rates has had an impact on affordability and created uncertainty for potential house sellers and buyers. When that uncertainty evaporates, we'll be primed to take full advantage of the opportunity. In the midst of the challenges realtor is focusing on adjacencies particularly on the sell side and rental segments. And we are continuing to see benefits from the use of our media platforms among others, the wsj.com, New York Post and the U.S. edition of the Santa Dr. brand recognition and generate traffic. The results of that campaign were seen in the past quarter, and we expect they will continue to be seen in coming quarters. Since the campaign began in February, the project has generated more than half a billion impressions and shown the unique power we have to bolster brands and turbocharged traffic. Realtor.com also further integrated up nest into its seller experiences in Q3 and is seeing significantly higher conversion rates. At REI a revenues were softer in Q3 compared to the prior year. Due to the lower listing volume, though we are seeing encouraging signs with realestate.com that is reaching almost 132 million visits in March, the highest total in 16 months and the fifth highest on record. With indications that prices and demand are against strengthening in Australia, we believe we are poised to prosper. And that is also true in India where housing.com is the leading digital property platform and saw 21% year-over-year growth in average site visits in the quarter. It is worth noting this metric, as India has just passed China as the most populous country and continues to have relative political stability and enormous economic potential. As I said at the outset, there has been much tangible progress in the third quarter, and the auguries are certainly positive for coming quarters. We will absolutely focus on our core engines of growth and prioritize simplification, cost reductions and thoughtful capital stewardship. We remain committed to constantly reviewing our structure and to creating enduring value for our shareholders. And now to provide more insight into third quarter developments I turn to Susan Panuccio.\nSusan Panuccio: Thank you, Robert. Our financial results this quarter demonstrated tangible improvements from the first half, which combined with the implementation of our aggressive cost actions should position News Corp well, for fiscal 2024. Third quarter total revenues were over $2.4 billion down just 2% year-over-year which was a significant improvement from the second quarter rate and included a $98 million or 4% negative impact from foreign currency headwinds. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures third quarter adjusted revenues were flat compared to the prior year with improving trends at the news media Subscription Video Services and publishing segments offset by the decline at digital real estate services segment. Advertising trends were mixed across our geographies. Total segment EBITDA was $320 million 11% lower compared to the prior year's record Q3 profits. Results included $7 million of professional fees related to the proposed merger with Fox and the potential sale of Move. Adjusted total segment EBITDA declined 15% versus the prior year. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.09 compared to $0.14 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were also $0.09 in the quarter compared to $ 0.16 in the prior year. Before I discuss the quarter, I wanted to provide an update on our headcount reduction program. Reductions across the business units will vary given the differing nature of our businesses and costs work done to date. We currently expect the annualized gross cost savings to exceed $160 million, up from our initial estimate of at least $130 million, with the majority of the savings to be reflected in fiscal 2024. We also expect to incur approximately $90 million to $100 million of cash restructuring charges related to the headcount reductions in the second half of fiscal '23. Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments starting the digital real estate services. Segment revenues were $363 million down 13% compared to the prior year, impacted by the ongoing macro economic pressures on both the U.S. and the Australian housing markets. The results include a negative impact of $30 million or 3% from foreign currency fluctuations. On an adjusted basis segment revenues decreased 10%. Segment EBITDA declined 26% to $102 million impacted by lower revenues, the negative impact related to currency headwinds and higher costs related to REI India, partially offset by lower costs at Move. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 24%. REI revenues were $222 million, which declined 10% on a reported basis or down 4% on a constant currency basis. The revenue decline was primarily driven by lower residential revenues and to a lesser extent softness in financial services. In the quarter Australian National residential buy listings were down 12% with Sydney and Melbourne down 20% and 18% respectively. Those declines were partially offset by the annual price increases in the residential and commercial businesses, increased uptake in premium products including premiere plus, favorable depth penetration, and another robust performance from REI India, which maintained its audience leadership. Like our other businesses at News Corp. REI is taking steps to reduce expenses with a focus on discretionary operational spend and marketing costs. Please refer to REI's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details. At Move revenues were $141 million down 17% compared to the prior year, real estate revenues were down 23% driven by lower lead and transaction volumes reflecting broader housing market challenges. Lead volume fell 30% while Realtors average monthly unique users declined 24% to $72 million in the third quarter based on internal metrics yet up from the $66 million in the second quarter. Realtor has been focusing on optimizing revenues via a prioritized set of initiatives while managing operating expenses as the business weathers ongoing market headwinds initiatives include enhancing media advertising placements, including implementing a broader partnership with the businesses across News Corp, optimizing lead allocation across markets, accelerating our go direct path for new homes and building out the rentals vertical. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $477 million down 3% compared to the prior year on a reported basis due to foreign currency headwinds. On a constant currency basis revenues rose 2% versus the prior year the fifth consecutive quarter of growth in constant currency. Streaming revenues accounted for 26% of circulation and subscription revenues compared to 20% in the prior year and again more than offset broadcast revenue declines benefiting from both volume growth and higher pricing at Kayo and Binge. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel group improved to nearly $4.6 million at quarter end up 6% year-over-year. Total paid streaming subscribers were approximately $3 million increase in 16% versus the prior year and accounted for approximately six to 5% of Foxtel's total paid subscriber base. Paid subscribers for Kayo reached a record of over 1.3 million up 14% year-over-year. Net adds from the prior quarter improved to 183,000, the largest sequential increase in seven quarters with the start of the popular winter sports codes in March. Revenues also benefited from a price rise implemented in February. Binge paid subscribers grew 22% year-over-year or 109,000 net ads from the last quarter to nearly 1.5 million subscribers benefiting from the successful release of The Last of Us. As Robert mentioned, on March the 30th Foxtel introduced advertising within the Binge basic product, the product accounts for approximately 30% of all been subscribers. We expect a modest revenue contribution from advertising beginning in the fourth quarter. Foxtel ended the quarter with over 1.3 million residential broadcast subscribers. Broadcast churn continued to improve down 200 basis points year-over-year to 12.3%. In fact, Foxtel retail churn was just under 10% for March 2023. Broadcast ARPU rose 2% to over 84 Australian dollars. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $68 million was down 14% versus the prior year. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 9% reflecting higher sports costs due to contractual escalators and enhancements. Moving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones posted healthy top line growth in the third quarter with revenues of $529 million, up 9% compared to the prior year. Digital revenues accounted for 79% of total revenues this quarter up three percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription based revenues represented over 80% of total revenues up three percentage points from the prior year, underscoring the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. On an adjusted basis revenues were flat impacted by weaker advertising revenues compared to the prior year. We are continuing to see very strong momentum in our professional information business with revenues rising 38% year-over-year reflecting the acquisitions of Opus and CMA coupled with strong revenues from risk and compliance. PIP revenues accounted for 37% of segment revenues. Risk and Compliance revenues rose 16% despite a three percentage point negative impact from foreign currency, led by an increasing demand for screening and monitoring and financial crime search products. The pipeline remains robust, most notably in EMEA. Opus and CMA strong revenue performance is helping reshape Dow Jones revenues to be more recurring, as we have increased pricing across our customer base. As Robert mentioned, its carbon index offering continues to expand and we expect will lead to the creation of new products for current and new customers. Retention rates for Opus and CMA's products remained well over 90% in the quarter. Circulation revenues declined 1%. The modest decline was driven by lower print volumes and some softness in IBD. Total Dow Jones digital only subscriptions grew 10% year-over-year or by 208,000 sequentially, the highest net add since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The focus this year has been on the launch of bundles, which expanded to include IBD in the third quarter. Advertising revenues declined 14% to $88 million and accounted for 17% of Dow Jones revenues this quarter within advertising digital fell 17% and print was down 8% with notable impacts from the technology and finance categories as we mentioned last quarter. While the advertising market remains challenged, we are seeing encouraging signs with the rate of decline abating after hitting a low in December each successive month showed an improvement with March notably down mid single digits and we saw further improvements in April. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 24% to $109 million as cost growth moderated from the first half or be at the business is still experiencing the impact of inflationary pressures. The results also reflect the lapping of transaction costs related to the Opus acquisition last year. Segment EBITDA margins rose to over 20%. Adjusted segment EBITDA for the quarter declined 11%. At book publishing revenues were flat at $550 million, driven by higher Christian book sales offset by foreign currency fluctuations. After a challenging first half of the year, we saw some positive trends with stability in Amazon orders in North America following the reset in the first half as well as stronger performance from several recent titles. Segment EBITDA declined 9% to $61 million. Costs rose approximately 1% reflecting ongoing supply chain issues in North America specifically in manufacturing, distribution and freight costs, which are now showing signs of moderation. The headcount initiative is well underway, which should result in lower employee costs in the fourth quarter. In the quarter HarperCollins also settled a three month long strike with the UAW, the backlist represents 60% of revenues for the quarter up slightly from last year. Digital sales declined 3% this quarter and accounted for 23% of consumer sales in line with the prior year. On an adjusted basis revenues rose 2% and segment EBITDA fell over 7%. Turning to news media. Revenues were $563 million down 3% and included a $42 million or 7% negative impact on revenues from foreign currency fluctuations. The adjusted revenues rose 4% improving from the prior quarter rate. Circulation and subscription revenues declined 4% but rose 4% in constant currency. Growth on a constant currency basis was driven by cover price increases in the UK and Australia and double digit digital subscriber growth across news Australia and the Times and the Sunday Times. Advertising trends improved this quarter as advertising revenues were down 5% but gained 2% in constant currency. Advertising revenues and News UK rose 8% in constant currency led by strong digital advertising performance, which is continuing to benefit from the growing scale of the sun.com in the U.S. and improved performance at the Times and Sunday Times. Advertising was flat at News Australia in constant currency and notably both Australia and the New York Post benefited from an improvement in print advertising this quarter. Segment EBITDA of $34 million declined 13% reflecting a much more modest decline from the first half rate as incremental year-over-year investments related to the Talk TV initiative in the UK, and other digital initiatives in Australia slowed to approximately $30 million. Newsprint costs remain a challenge having $14 million of negative impact this quarter from higher prices. Those pressures were partially offset by ongoing cost saving initiatives across the businesses. Adjusted segment EBITDA fell 5%. Turning to the outlook. As a reminder last year's fourth quarter, including an extra week which contributed $110 million to revenues or about 4% to revenue growth and will impact prior year compares. We continue to face some supply chain and inflationary pressures and advertising conditions remain uncertain. However, it is important to note that the company's exposure to advertising has materially declined as a result of the reshaping of our portfolio, including the acquisitions of Opus and CMA. In fact, advertising revenues represented only 16% of total revenues in the third quarter. Despite the extra week of difficult prior comparison, and ongoing foreign exchange headwinds given current spot rates, we expect to see improvements in profitability in the fourth quarter as we continue to implement aggressive cost initiatives. Looking at each of our segments a digital Real Estate Services Australian residential new by listings for April declined 24%. Please refer to REI for more specific outlook commentary. At Move like the third quarter, we expect lead volumes to remain challenged in the near term and we will continue to balance marketing spend and reinvestment in adjacencies with necessary cost reductions elsewhere. In Subscription Video Services, we continue to expect the Foxtel group's profitability in local currency for the full year to be relatively stable to the prior year despite a step up in sports rights costs in the second half related to annual contractual escalators. At Dow Jones, we saw an improvement in advertising in April, albeit visibility remains limited, as the prior year compares will be further impacted by the extra week in fiscal 2022. We expect the rate of investment spending to slow which would lead to improve profitability in the fourth quarter. We have now fully lapped the Opus acquisitions in the third quarter and will lapse CMA in June. In book publishing April, revenue trends was soft consistent with industry data, but we expect cost pressures to start to moderate and are optimistic about our release slate, which as Robert noted includes Magnolia Table, Volume 3 from Joanna Gaines and Queen Charlotte, a Prequel to Bridgerton from Julia Quinn and Shonda Rhimes. At news media, advertising trends remain volatile with limited visibility. We expect total segment costs to decline in part due to lower incremental costs related to the Talk TV investment, which launched in April 2022 and we hope to see improve profitability for the segment. We have also seen moderating newsprint cost pressures in the UK. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now start the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Karnovsky from JPMorgan.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hi. Thank you, Robert, following up on your comments about generative AI, I'd be interested to get kind of your expanded view on how you think this tech is going to impact how consumers receive their news and information and what opportunities or risks that opens up for you in terms of your relationship with readers. And then maybe as a follow on what use cases do you see for the technology and the generation or repackaging of some of the news content you produce? Thank you.\nRobert Thomson: David, a very thoughtful question. We're obviously at an early stage of the evolution of generative AI. It will have a profound impact. And I was recently in Tokyo seeing our teams. And in recent months HarperCollins, Japan has been using sophisticated programs to create images for manga stories by transforming a sketch or a photo or just inputting words three separate generative AI programs. You use an image from our library to create complete manga sets, obviously saving a lot of time, and transforming potentially the character of that business. But it's not only going to have an impact on content. It will clearly have a profound impact on the management of the business, whether customer service or billing or whatever. I mean one contradiction of any businesses that the more you customize the harder and more expensive it is to scale. And that contradiction can be overcome with AI. I think as the well known management consultant Socrates observed, the secret of change is to focus all of your energy not on fighting the old but building the new.\nMichael Florin: Thanks, David. Leila we'll take our next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kane Hannan from Goldman Sachs.\nKane Hannan: Good morning guys. Thanks for the question. Maybe just the cost out which interested, I suppose some of the commentary there particularly Dow Jones and books was pretty positive on the top line outlook and how things have been improving. There's interested why the cost targets been upgraded with that backdrop. And I suppose as a follow on to that, just what the net benefit of the [indiscernible] program was in the first quarter, if we think about all in with the restructuring charges potentially coming through? Just --\nRobert Thomson: Kane look, obviously, the headcount reduction is about calibration or celebration, but it's fair to say that the savings will exceed the significantly the 136 million that we identified in the last earnings call and will now surpass 160 million that's attributed to the diligence of our teams undertaking difficult work. And I do emphasize that's just one element of the cost cutting that's underway at the company we've severely scrutinize everything from tech spend and travel expenses. So the total savings number next year will obviously exceed that total.\nSusan Panuccio: And Kane Just to add our business units, they're quite experienced to identifying areas for improvement, and we can leverage those across the group as we looked for cost savings, which is one of the reasons we've been able to drive additional cost savings. We're not going to get into the details without sort of the net off of the cost savings but we can expect that as we head into fiscal [2024] from Q1 we really would expect to see the majority of both cost savings on with P&L.\nMichael Florin: Thanks Kane. Leyla, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research. [Operator Instructions].\nCraig Huber: Yes. Hi, Craig Huber. Thank you. Had a similar question on the costs. Obviously, you announced five headcount reduction three months ago, roughly about 2% of total costs. Can you quantify all what the other cost savings you're talking about is I mean, few companies just reduce headcount don't touch other stuff. And you guys are taking calls out elsewhere ? Can you quantify that for us? Is that possible?\nSusan Panuccio: We haven't quantified it, Craig. But what I can say is it cuts across lots of different areas. We're looking at discretionary spend, as you'd expect office expenses, T&E we have a look across our print sites, and we're constantly looking for opportunities around our manufacturing plants and what we can do there. We look at our casual cost base with the variable costs. We have a look at marketing costs as well. So it's really a variety of costs that we continue to focus on. And as I said that the businesses are pretty good at actually having a look at this now.\nMichael Florin: Thanks Craig. Leyla we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Next question will come from Darren Lung from Macquarie. \nDarren Lung: Hello, guys, thanks for the opportunity. I just want to ask around the higher printing costs and supply chain issues in books, please. So I think we're talking about it being a headwind in prior periods and looking at it looks like it's flat versus the prior year. Can you just give us a view as to what we've achieved or what's changed in the business to sort of maintain that please?\nSusan Panuccio: Actually, I think the comps are up year-on-year because we are still experiencing some of the supply chain pressures. I mean, what I would say is freight costs, we're seeing a moderating of that as we're seeing an easing of some of the supply chain pressures on shipping costs. But we are seeing enhanced paper costs still coming through and we're seeing some additional fuel costs are coming in because of the inflationary pressures. So it was a little bit mixed. We are seeing the moderation but they have been up.\nRobert Thomson: And Darren just to supplement Susan. Of course, what has been particularly prevalent over the past year is the change in purchasing rhythm, [indiscernible] Amazon and now that the reset has been reset, we have more confidence in the profitability of HarperCollins. And no doubt that the current crop of best sellers will make a positive difference in coming quarters.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Darren, Leyla we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alan Gould from Loop Capital. \nAlan Gould: Thanks for taking the question. Robert, Susan I'm always shocked how well the news media business continues to hold up. Two things on there. Can you give us a little more detail of what's happening with Talk TV and the plans to turn that profitably? And secondly, just shocked to see print advertising actually doing better than digital advertising this quarter? What is happening there?\nRobert Thomson: Well, on the Talk TV we've always said it will be a low cost high quality project. And it will constantly review progress and technological developments that give us flexibility in delivery and reduce expenses. In the coming months, you should see that incremental costs are falling with a naturally positive impact on our earnings. And I have to say the venture certainly enabled us to promote products across a plethora of our platforms and enhanced video capability globally, given that we're able to slice and dice programs in different formats for different time zones. And as you can imagine, increasing our video expertise generally is a core priority for all our businesses.\nSusan Panuccio: I mean Alan just on the print side, I mean look at it has been a pleasant surprise. And we've seen this over the last couple of years as it relates to print advertising. It really just depends on categories. Down in Australia, they've seen a pickup in travel advertising, which has really helped down there as the market has started to open up. They do get some good tailwind through retail, in different quarters as well. So it really is variable each quarter, but it's down to the different categories.\nMichael Florin: Thanks, Alan. Leyla, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: We'll take a follow up from Craig Huber from Huber Research. Go ahead Craig your line is open.\nCraig Huber: Your book revenues held up much better than we thought in the quarter. I mean, given the issues you guys were called out in the past about Amazon warehouses issues with them and stuff. You just talk through that or you think that's all behind you now?\nRobert Thomson: Craig, as I mentioned earlier, there clearly has been an adjustment at Amazon. That adjustment as we understand is complete. And so those awkward moments are past. And now really it's down to the quality of the front list and expanding impact about backlist. For example, in the most recent quarter a backlist was 60% of sales. As you know, backlist generally is more profitable for us. And so now we have an opportunity to make the most of our excellent authors and our marketing potential. \nSusan Panuccio: And Craig also I mean for April, we've just had the results come in. And there has been a little bit of softness just in consumption. So we're still waiting to see where consumption settles down in the post COVID world. But pleasingly, the results for Q3 were much better than the first half.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Craig. Thank you. Leila we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: At this time, we have no further questions. So I'll hand back to Michael Florin for closing remarks.\nMichael Florin: Great. Well, thank you, Leila. And thank you all for participating. Have a great day. And we'll talk to you soon. Take care.",

Our financial results this quarter demonstrated tangible improvements from the first half, which combined with the implementation of our aggressive cost actions should position News Corp well, for fiscal 2024. Third quarter total revenues were over $2.4 billion down just 2% year-over-year which was a significant improvement from the second quarter rate and included a $98 million or 4% negative impact from foreign currency headwinds. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures third quarter adjusted revenues were flat compared to the prior year with improving trends at the news media Subscription Video Services and publishing segments offset by the decline at digital real estate services segment. Advertising trends were mixed across our geographies. Total segment EBITDA was $320 million 11% lower compared to the prior year's record Q3 profits. Results included $7 million of professional fees related to the proposed merger with Fox and the potential sale of Move. Adjusted total segment EBITDA declined 15% versus the prior year. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.09 compared to $0.14 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were also $0.09 in the quarter compared to $ 0.16 in the prior year. Before I discuss the quarter, I wanted to provide an update on our headcount reduction program.

We currently expect the annualized gross cost savings to exceed $160 million, up from our initial estimate of at least $130 million, with the majority of the savings to be reflected in fiscal 2024. We also expect to incur approximately $90 million to $100 million of cash restructuring charges related to the headcount reductions in the second half of fiscal '23. Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments starting the digital real estate services. Segment revenues were $363 million down 13% compared to the prior year, impacted by the ongoing macro economic pressures on both the U.S. and the Australian housing markets. The results include a negative impact of $30 million or 3% from foreign currency fluctuations. On an adjusted basis segment revenues decreased 10%. Segment EBITDA declined 26% to $102 million impacted by lower revenues, the negative impact related to currency headwinds and higher costs related to REI India, partially offset by lower costs at Move. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 24%. REI revenues were $222 million, which declined 10% on a reported basis or down 4% on a constant currency basis. The revenue decline was primarily driven by lower residential revenues and to a lesser extent softness in financial services.

On a constant currency basis revenues rose 2% versus the prior year the fifth consecutive quarter of growth in constant currency. Streaming revenues accounted for 26% of circulation and subscription revenues compared to 20% in the prior year and again more than offset broadcast revenue declines benefiting from both volume growth and higher pricing at Kayo and Binge. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel group improved to nearly $4.6 million at quarter end up 6% year-over-year. Total paid streaming subscribers were approximately $3 million increase in 16% versus the prior year and accounted for approximately six to 5% of Foxtel's total paid subscriber base. Paid subscribers for Kayo reached a record of over 1.3 million up 14% year-over-year. Net adds from the prior quarter improved to 183,000, the largest sequential increase in seven quarters with the start of the popular winter sports codes in March. Revenues also benefited from a price rise implemented in February. Binge paid subscribers grew 22% year-over-year or 109,000 net ads from the last quarter to nearly 1.5 million subscribers benefiting from the successful release of The Last of Us. As Robert mentioned, on March the 30th Foxtel introduced advertising within the Binge basic product, the product accounts for approximately 30% of all been subscribers. We expect a modest revenue contribution from advertising beginning in the fourth quarter. Foxtel ended the quarter with over 1.3 million residential broadcast subscribers. Broadcast churn continued to improve down 200 basis points year-over-year to 12.3%. In fact, Foxtel retail churn was just under 10% for March 2023. Broadcast ARPU rose 2% to over 84 Australian dollars. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $68 million was down 14% versus the prior year. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 9% reflecting higher sports costs due to contractual escalators and enhancements. Moving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones posted healthy top line growth in the third quarter with revenues of $529 million, up 9% compared to the prior year. Digital revenues accounted for 79% of total revenues this quarter up three percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription based revenues represented over 80% of total revenues up three percentage points from the prior year, underscoring the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. On an adjusted basis revenues were flat impacted by weaker advertising revenues compared to the prior year. We are continuing to see very strong momentum in our professional information business with revenues rising 38% year-over-year reflecting the acquisitions of Opus and CMA coupled with strong revenues from risk and compliance. PIP revenues accounted for 37% of segment revenues. Risk and Compliance revenues rose 16% despite a three percentage point negative impact from foreign currency, led by an increasing demand for screening and monitoring and financial crime search products. The pipeline remains robust, most notably in EMEA. Opus and CMA strong revenue performance is helping reshape Dow Jones revenues to be more recurring, as we have increased pricing across our customer base. As Robert mentioned, its carbon index offering continues to expand and we expect will lead to the creation of new products for current and new customers. Retention rates for Opus and CMA's products remained well over 90% in the quarter. Circulation revenues declined 1%. The modest decline was driven by lower print volumes and some softness in IBD. Total Dow Jones digital only subscriptions grew 10% year-over-year or by 208,000 sequentially, the highest net add since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The focus this year has been on the launch of bundles, which expanded to include IBD in the third quarter. Advertising revenues declined 14% to $88 million and accounted for 17% of Dow Jones revenues this quarter within advertising digital fell 17% and print was down 8% with notable impacts from the technology and finance categories as we mentioned last quarter. While the advertising market remains challenged, we are seeing encouraging signs with the rate of decline abating after hitting a low in December each successive month showed an improvement with March notably down mid single digits and we saw further improvements in April. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 24% to $109 million as cost growth moderated from the first half or be at the business is still experiencing the impact of inflationary pressures. The results also reflect the lapping of transaction costs related to the Opus acquisition last year. Segment EBITDA margins rose to over 20%. Adjusted segment EBITDA for the quarter declined 11%. At book publishing revenues were flat at $550 million, driven by higher Christian book sales offset by foreign currency fluctuations. After a challenging first half of the year, we saw some positive trends with stability in Amazon orders in North America following the reset in the first half as well as stronger performance from several recent titles. Segment EBITDA declined 9% to $61 million. Costs rose approximately 1% reflecting ongoing supply chain issues in North America specifically in manufacturing, distribution and freight costs, which are now showing signs of moderation. The headcount initiative is well underway, which should result in lower employee costs in the fourth quarter. In the quarter HarperCollins also settled a three month long strike with the UAW, the backlist represents 60% of revenues for the quarter up slightly from last year. Digital sales declined 3% this quarter and accounted for 23% of consumer sales in line with the prior year. On an adjusted basis revenues rose 2% and segment EBITDA fell over 7%. Turning to news media. Revenues were $563 million down 3% and included a $42 million or 7% negative impact on revenues from foreign currency fluctuations. The adjusted revenues rose 4% improving from the prior quarter rate. Circulation and subscription revenues declined 4% but rose 4% in constant currency. Growth on a constant currency basis was driven by cover price increases in the UK and Australia and double digit digital subscriber growth across news Australia and the Times and the Sunday Times. Advertising trends improved this quarter as advertising revenues were down 5% but gained 2% in constant currency. Advertising revenues and News UK rose 8% in constant currency led by strong digital advertising performance, which is continuing to benefit from the growing scale of the sun.com in the U.S. and improved performance at the Times and Sunday Times. Advertising was flat at News Australia in constant currency and notably both Australia and the New York Post benefited from an improvement in print advertising this quarter. Segment EBITDA of $34 million declined 13% reflecting a much more modest decline from the first half rate as incremental year-over-year investments related to the Talk TV initiative in the UK, and other digital initiatives in Australia slowed to approximately $30 million. Newsprint costs remain a challenge having $14 million of negative impact this quarter from higher prices. Those pressures were partially offset by ongoing cost saving initiatives across the businesses. Adjusted segment EBITDA fell 5%. Turning to the outlook. As a reminder last year's fourth quarter, including an extra week which contributed $110 million to revenues or about 4% to revenue growth and will impact prior year compares. We continue to face some supply chain and inflationary pressures and advertising conditions remain uncertain. However, it is important to note that the company's exposure to advertising has materially declined as a result of the reshaping of our portfolio, including the acquisitions of Opus and CMA. In fact, advertising revenues represented only 16% of total revenues in the third quarter. Despite the extra week of difficult prior comparison, and ongoing foreign exchange headwinds given current spot rates, we expect to see improvements in profitability in the fourth quarter as we continue to implement aggressive cost initiatives. Looking at each of our segments a digital Real Estate Services Australian residential new by listings for April declined 24%. Please refer to REI for more specific outlook commentary. At Move like the third quarter, we expect lead volumes to remain challenged in the near term and we will continue to balance marketing spend and reinvestment in adjacencies with necessary cost reductions elsewhere. In Subscription Video Services, we continue to expect the Foxtel group's profitability in local currency for the full year to be relatively stable to the prior year despite a step up in sports rights costs in the second half related to annual contractual escalators. At Dow Jones, we saw an improvement in advertising in April, albeit visibility remains limited, as the prior year compares will be further impacted by the extra week in fiscal 2022. We expect the rate of investment spending to slow which would lead to improve profitability in the fourth quarter. We have now fully lapped the Opus acquisitions in the third quarter and will lapse CMA in June. In book publishing April, revenue trends was soft consistent with industry data, but we expect cost pressures to start to moderate and are optimistic about our release slate, which as Robert noted includes Magnolia Table, Volume 3 from Joanna Gaines and Queen Charlotte, a Prequel to Bridgerton from Julia Quinn and Shonda Rhimes. At news media, advertising trends remain volatile with limited visibility. We expect total segment costs to decline in part due to lower incremental costs related to the Talk TV investment, which launched in April 2022 and we hope to see improve profitability for the segment. We have also seen moderating newsprint cost pressures in the UK. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A. And Kane Just to add our business units, they're quite experienced to identifying areas for improvement, and we can leverage those across the group as we looked for cost savings, which is one of the reasons we've been able to drive additional cost savings. We're not going to get into the details without sort of the net off of the cost savings but we can expect that as we head into fiscal [2024] from Q1 we really would expect to see the majority of both cost savings on with P&L. We haven't quantified it, Craig. But what I can say is it cuts across lots of different areas. We're looking at discretionary spend, as you'd expect office expenses, T&E we have a look across our print sites, and we're constantly looking for opportunities around our manufacturing plants and what we can do there. We look at our casual cost base with the variable costs. We have a look at marketing costs as well. So it's really a variety of costs that we continue to focus on. And as I said that the businesses are pretty good at actually having a look at this now. Actually, I think the comps are up year-on-year because we are still experiencing some of the supply chain pressures. I mean, what I would say is freight costs, we're seeing a moderating of that as we're seeing an easing of some of the supply chain pressures on shipping costs. But we are seeing enhanced paper costs still coming through and we're seeing some additional fuel costs are coming in because of the inflationary pressures. So it was a little bit mixed. We are seeing the moderation but they have been up. I mean Alan just on the print side, I mean look at it has been a pleasant surprise. And we've seen this over the last couple of years as it relates to print advertising. It really just depends on categories. Down in Australia, they've seen a pickup in travel advertising, which has really helped down there as the market has started to open up. They do get some good tailwind through retail, in different quarters as well. So it really is variable each quarter, but it's down to the different categories. And Craig also I mean for April, we've just had the results come in. And there has been a little bit of softness just in consumption. So we're still waiting to see where consumption settles down in the post COVID world. But pleasingly, the results for Q3 were much better than the first half."

            "name": "Robert Thomson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Before discussing our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 it is particularly important to begin by noting that today marks the 44th day in captivity for Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich who was wrongfully willfully detained in Russia. I would like to express our thanks and that of Mr. Latour, Emma Tucker, and all the Dow Jones for the unstinting support shown for Evan and his family by the U.S. and many other governments, media companies, journalism organizations and concerned principled people around the world. We trust that justice and common sense will prevail and that Evan will soon be released. Turning now to the third quarter results. We began to see meaningful improvements compared to the prior quarter with certain macro and sect oral trends more positive, and our cost cutting program beginning to gain traction. For context, these earnings follow record revenues and profitability in fiscal 2022. And we've been confronting the challenges of foreign exchange volatility, a surge in interest rates, persistent inflation, and ongoing supply chain disruptions. Our results demonstrate the fundamental differences in the character of News Corp, compared with other media companies. In a period in which advertising activity was clearly insipid in certain parts of the world our core non advertising revenue was particularly robust, highlighted by a 38% increase in revenues at the Dow Jones professional information business. For the quarter, total revenues were over $2.4 billion down only 2% year-over-year as compared to the 7% decline in Q2. Adjusted revenues excluding our acquisitions and distinctly unfavorable Forex movements equal those of last year. Meanwhile, profitability was $320 million down 11% despite a tough prior year comparison, and the just articulated external pressures. As for the company wide cost reduction drive, we are well advanced in taking the difficult but necessary step of reducing headcount by 5%, which is now expected to yield more than $160 million in annualized savings by the end of this calendar year. In addition, we are strictly scrutinizing spending across all categories, and expect further savings as we strive for efficiency and efficacy. There has been much discussion, some of it enlightened, some not so about the potential impact of generative AI, and there is no doubt that it will profoundly affect a media business. Candidly, generative AI may pose a challenge to our intellectual property and to the future of journalism. As those who have experimented with ChatGPT will be aware, the answers are only as insightful and factual as the source material, and are more retrospective than contemporary. Given those precepts we see three areas in which our content will be used by generative AI creators, whose products will be enhanced by our IP for which we should be compensated. Firstly, our content will inevitably be used as has already been exploited to train AI engines. Secondly, specific examples of our content will be surfaced in response to us as AI queries. And thirdly, and crucially, our content will certainly be aggregated and synthesized and those answers monetized by other parties, we expect our fair share of that monetization. Generative AI cannot be degenerative AI. The digital debate over content and journalism has evolved significantly in the past few years. And we appreciate the social and commercial commitment of our partners at Google, Apple, Microsoft and Meta. The A in AI cannot be ambiguity, nor can the I represent ignorance, integrity would be more apt, which brings us to Dow Jones among the world's foremost and most trusted purveyors of business news data and analysis. The third quarter reflected its robust revenue generation, even in testing economic times, and as I mentioned, was highlighted by the burgeoning of our professional information business, which reported a 38% surge in revenues, including a 16% rise at our risk and compliance business, and that number was negatively affected by Forex fluctuations.  Dow Jones has certainly benefited from the acquisitions of Opus and CMA, which continue their high margin growth in recent months. We will be expanding their product offerings over the next year, with particular emphasis on renewables and carbon metrics, and we are confident of many years of strong growth ahead. Digital revenues accounted for 79% of all revenues at Dow Jones a significant increase from the 60% level during fiscal 2018. Aside from the professional information business digital subscriptions continue to grow up 9% to $3.3 million at the Wall Street Journal and up 10% to $4.3 million Dow Jones as a whole with total subscriptions now at $5.1 million, despite print subscriptions, obviously being under some pressure. The strong performance overall came despite an insipid ad market in the U.S. with continued weakness in tech advertising. Though we did see an improvement in demand in April, so the auguries have improved. Dare I say the failure of Silicon Valley Bank has been a catalyst for other U.S. financial institutions to try to reassure customers and highlight their own solidity. And the Wall Street Journal, Barron's and market watch a vital platforms for any financial firm aspiring to bolster its credentials. In Australia, Foxtel group continues to build on its streaming success. Streaming now accounts for two thirds of the total Foxtel subscription base, and that revenue growth is more than offsetting the decline in broadcast. Fears that are world class streaming products would be a catalyst for cannibalization have been unfounded. Broadcast churn is at near record low levels with Foxtel retail churn in March under 10%. That success is also a tribute to our marketing and customer service teams at Foxtel and to the leadership of Patrick Delaney and Shavon. McKenna. As at the end of March, Binge entertainment streaming product launched advertising on its basic service adding a new lucrative revenue stream. Interest from advertisers has been added as the initial phase of packages were sold out. We have demand and seemingly some flexibility on pricing in the months and years ahead. After a couple of tough quarters fortunes have certainly improved at HarperCollins. With a bevy of best sellers and some moderation of supply chain snuffers. Margins were higher in the third quarter compared to the first half. We also have an attractive roster of books in this in upcoming quarters. So we believe we are on a journey to the sunlit uplands. Amazon's orders improved in a quarter, and our titles prospered. In particular Ron DeSantis, The Courage to Be Free. Barbara Kingsolver as Damon Copperhead as well as Colleen Hoover and Tarryn Fisher's Never Never and Ben Hall's Saved. In the fourth quarter contempt is already topping bestseller lists with You Can't Joke About That. If I could make a self interested recommendation it is worth a read or listen. Last week we also published the latest incarnation of the Magnolia Table Cookbook. We are justifiably optimistic about the prospects for the Bridget and prequel Queen Charlotte by Julian Quinn, and Shonda Rhimes, which went on sale this week, coinciding with the launch of the new Netflix series. The news media segment reported a substantial improvement over the second quarter with advertising in constant currency increasing 2%, so down 5% in U.S. dollars, this increase was a vastly different outcome to that of most media companies in most countries. We are confident that our teams are more skilled in sharing advertising insights across borders and platforms and that innate intelligence is reflected in our revenue numbers. One success story is the sun.com were total pageviews in the quarter search 94% year-over-year reaching close to a billion views. The site, which has benefited from the partnership with the New York Post and our other U.S. properties, has triumphed in tough times and notably, the Sun's U.S. digital advertising revenues now exceed those of the British platform. In the UK connected listing hours at wireless hit an all time high, reaching an average of 8.4 million per week in the quarter, a 10% increase from the prior year, and reflective of our superb coverage of the Premier League, which reaches its seasonal crescendo in coming days, hopefully within and against the odds triumph by arsenal. As for the New York Post, the previously perennial loss maker continued to be profitable in the third quarter, and to build on its important influence on the national debate. Engagement at the post digital properties rose 4% over the prior year to 690 million pageviews in March, providing a powerful platform for its compelling content. At digital real estate services obviously enough, the interest rate surge and accompanying uncertainty in the housing market have had an impact in the U.S. and Australia. But these are not permanent conditions and the digitization of the property market is far from complete. There were signs of improvement in the market this quarter, but we understand that the increase in rates has had an impact on affordability and created uncertainty for potential house sellers and buyers. When that uncertainty evaporates, we'll be primed to take full advantage of the opportunity. In the midst of the challenges realtor is focusing on adjacencies particularly on the sell side and rental segments. And we are continuing to see benefits from the use of our media platforms among others, the wsj.com, New York Post and the U.S. edition of the Santa Dr. brand recognition and generate traffic. The results of that campaign were seen in the past quarter, and we expect they will continue to be seen in coming quarters. Since the campaign began in February, the project has generated more than half a billion impressions and shown the unique power we have to bolster brands and turbocharged traffic. Realtor.com also further integrated up nest into its seller experiences in Q3 and is seeing significantly higher conversion rates. At REI a revenues were softer in Q3 compared to the prior year. Due to the lower listing volume, though we are seeing encouraging signs with realestate.com that is reaching almost 132 million visits in March, the highest total in 16 months and the fifth highest on record. With indications that prices and demand are against strengthening in Australia, we believe we are poised to prosper. And that is also true in India where housing.com is the leading digital property platform and saw 21% year-over-year growth in average site visits in the quarter. It is worth noting this metric, as India has just passed China as the most populous country and continues to have relative political stability and enormous economic potential. As I said at the outset, there has been much tangible progress in the third quarter, and the auguries are certainly positive for coming quarters. We will absolutely focus on our core engines of growth and prioritize simplification, cost reductions and thoughtful capital stewardship. We remain committed to constantly reviewing our structure and to creating enduring value for our shareholders. And now to provide more insight into third quarter developments I turn to Susan Panuccio. David, a very thoughtful question. We're obviously at an early stage of the evolution of generative AI. It will have a profound impact. And I was recently in Tokyo seeing our teams. And in recent months HarperCollins, Japan has been using sophisticated programs to create images for manga stories by transforming a sketch or a photo or just inputting words three separate generative AI programs. You use an image from our library to create complete manga sets, obviously saving a lot of time, and transforming potentially the character of that business. But it's not only going to have an impact on content. It will clearly have a profound impact on the management of the business, whether customer service or billing or whatever. I mean one contradiction of any businesses that the more you customize the harder and more expensive it is to scale. And that contradiction can be overcome with AI. I think as the well known management consultant Socrates observed, the secret of change is to focus all of your energy not on fighting the old but building the new. Kane look, obviously, the headcount reduction is about calibration or celebration, but it's fair to say that the savings will exceed the significantly the 136 million that we identified in the last earnings call and will now surpass 160 million that's attributed to the diligence of our teams undertaking difficult work. And I do emphasize that's just one element of the cost cutting that's underway at the company we've severely scrutinize everything from tech spend and travel expenses. So the total savings number next year will obviously exceed that total. And Darren just to supplement Susan. Of course, what has been particularly prevalent over the past year is the change in purchasing rhythm, [indiscernible] Amazon and now that the reset has been reset, we have more confidence in the profitability of HarperCollins. And no doubt that the current crop of best sellers will make a positive difference in coming quarters. Well, on the Talk TV we've always said it will be a low cost high quality project. And it will constantly review progress and technological developments that give us flexibility in delivery and reduce expenses. In the coming months, you should see that incremental costs are falling with a naturally positive impact on our earnings. And I have to say the venture certainly enabled us to promote products across a plethora of our platforms and enhanced video capability globally, given that we're able to slice and dice programs in different formats for different time zones. And as you can imagine, increasing our video expertise generally is a core priority for all our businesses. Craig, as I mentioned earlier, there clearly has been an adjustment at Amazon. That adjustment as we understand is complete. And so those awkward moments are past. And now really it's down to the quality of the front list and expanding impact about backlist. For example, in the most recent quarter a backlist was 60% of sales. As you know, backlist generally is more profitable for us. And so now we have an opportunity to make the most of our excellent authors and our marketing potential."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMichael Florin: Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's fiscal second quarter 2023 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We will open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings release for the applicable periods posted on our website. With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\nRobert Thomson: Thank you, Mike. The second quarter produced challenges for some of our businesses and highlighted the progress made in other segments that had been challenged. Obviously, a surge in interest rates and persistent inflation had an impact on all of our businesses, but in particular, Digital Real Estate and Book Publishing, which remains a majority of physical business and continues to be subject to logistical exigencies. But we believe these challenges are more ephemeral than eternal. And just as our company passed the stress test of the pandemic with record preference. The reform is now underway at our businesses should create a solid platform for future profitability. Crucially, we will be reducing headcount across the company by 5%. That is a necessary response given these macro conditions. There are other broader trends that will inevitably be auspicious such as our evolving partnerships with major tech platforms and the incipient changes to the digital advertising market, which should enable us to improve yields for our valuable inventory and have more oversight of permission data. At the same time, we are absolutely focused on reducing costs across our businesses and making price adjustments where prudent. And we are continuing to work on the integration of our recent acquisitions, OPIS and CMA, which are already enhancing revenue and profits at Dow Jones. As for our discussions over the potential sale of Move, we will provide an update at the appropriate moment. Obviously, any potential deal would be designed to maximize value for our shareholders in the short and long term. Looking now at the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. We generated over $2.5 billion in revenues, representing a decline of 7% year-over-year, though most of that was due to foreign currency. Adjusted revenues were down only 3%. Profitability was $409 million compared to $586 million in the prior year, reflecting the challenges of interest rates and inflation noted earlier, and the impact of fickle ForEx movements, which have shown signs of abating in recent weeks. Even in the midst of the obvious global challenges I've described, Dow Jones had a solid quarter, and the professional information business displayed particular promise with revenues surging 45% year-over-year. The result highlights the value of our opportunistic acquisition of OPIS and CMA, where we have recently launched products, including carbon credit indices and are working on more sophisticated analytics for our growing customer base. Risk and Compliance again reported strong revenue growth, increasing 13% despite capricious currency trends, with the demand for New York customer tools expanding as governments globally continue to tighten regulations and wheeled sanctions. The imperative for an authoritative audit trial has expanded far beyond financial institutions and the credibility that Dow Jones brings is in itself an important factor for many companies. Is there anyone on this call who does not want to minimize risk and maximize compliance? Dow Jones has begun to roll out a new user interface for the Aladdin's Cave of content that is Factiva, which is an essential tool for serious businesses. The truth is that the interface was in need of simplifying and the Dow Jones team have addressed that issue. The easier Factiva is to use, the more it will be used. Overall, at Dow Jones, digital revenues now comprise 76% of total revenues, a 4 percentage point rise over the past year. Some of that expansion is due to continuing strength in digital subscriptions. Digital-only subscriptions increased 10%, while total Dow Jones consumer subscriptions rose 5%. In fact, just in recent weeks, total Dow Jones subscriptions sold past the 5 million mark for the first time. Almar Latour and the team are increasing the emphasis on upselling subscriptions with the bundling of Market Watch, the WSJ, IBD and Barron's. The basic strategy is to provide an ever more premium service for our readers as we leverage valuable audiences across platforms. I am particularly proud to highlight the continuing revival of Foxtel's fortune under the Sage leadership of Patrick and Chevron and the team, we have increased profitability and thus optionality. Reported segment revenues were down 7%, while segment EBITDA rose a healthy 5%. Even more impressively, adjusted revenues, which excludes the impact of ForEx volatility, rose 3%, while adjusted segment EBITDA rose a handsome 16%. Streaming continues to be a core strength of Foxtel, as we have added well over 0.5 million paying OTT subscribers in the past year. BINGE reached nearly 1.4 million paying subscribers in the quarter and we'll be launching an advertising tier later this fiscal year as we seek to maximize Foxtel's revenue potential. Total paying subscriptions at Foxtel were up 10% year-over-year, and we also saw the benefits of modest price increases at Kayo and BINGE. Our sports programming portfolio has been enhanced with the renewal of Australian cricket rights to 2031. We are now on the cusp of the peak selling season for Kayo as the Australian Football and Rugby League seasons will start imminently, and we solidified our entertainment offerings with an expanded multiyear content deal with NBCU. Overall, Foxtel's continuing success and positive trajectory have certainly increased our optionality for that business. HarperCollins experienced another difficult quarter, reflecting sluggish spending on books after the pandemic inspired surge, difficult front-list comparisons as well as the continuing impact of Amazon's logistics issues. Under the prevailing circumstances, it is absolutely necessary to confront the cost base as we seek to bolster long-term profitability in the post-pandemic marketplace. Some of our key titles this quarter include Fox News, host Harris Faulkner\u2019s Faith Still Moves Mountains, and Joanna Gaines' The Stories We Tell. While best-selling orders, Colleen Hoover and Tarryn Fisher's work Never Never will be released later this month. The News Media segment showed signs of real resilience in the midst of a volatile advertising market and ForEx headwinds. The standout masthead was the sun.com in the U.S., which reported 127% year-over-year increase in quarterly page views. Meanwhile, the Times and Sunday Times reached nearly 490,000 digital subscriptions in the quarter. And at News Corp Australia, total digital subs exceeded 1 million, representing an 11% rise year-over-year. Wireless had a solid quarter in connected listening, which was assisted by interest in the World Cup on talkSPORT, while TalkTV revitalized its lineup, and the New York Post remains on target for another profitable year despite the air market. As for Digital Real Estate Services, the patent complexities of the current housing market in both the U.S. and Australia are well known and have had an effect on REA and Move. The property market inevitably has interest rate-related cycles. But with rates nearing a peak in both the U.S. and Australia, we believe the next phase of the cycle is not far away. We have this week launched a new campaign to use our media inventory to drive traffic at realtor.com and the positive effect should be seen in coming months. REA continued to maintain its number one market share in Australia this quarter with over 3.3 times the audience of its nearest competitor. And our business in India, now the market leader in audience is showing much potential. While leads were down at realtor.com in the quarter, the business saw a year-over-year improvement in revenue per lead as the team is focused on pricing, sell-through and close rights. We now are increasing our emphasis on the monetization of sell-side listing as inventory time on the market has increased significantly in recent months, and we will be able to provide realtors and vendors with improved service. In closing, while we expect the macro trends to have a continuing effect on our businesses and are committed to a 5% reduction in our workforce, we are confident that the combination of prudent cost management, sound capital stewardship, commitment to digital expansion and simplification should provide a firm foundation for future growth. And we will remain acutely focused on the creation of value for our shareholders as the possible sale of Move eloquently testifies. We also remain firmly committed to our $1 billion share buyback and dividend program. And now for more granular account of our second quarter, I give you over to Susan Panuccio.\nSusan Panuccio: Thanks, Robert. Before I discuss the quarterly results, I want to expand on Robert's opening comments. As we noted in our recent SEC filing, we have been engaged in discussions with CoStar about a potential sale of move. Any potential transaction would need to not only maximize shareholder value, but also strengthen realtor.com's competitive position. We do not plan on making additional comments on this call regarding the potential transaction, and we'll update the market when appropriate. Turning to our fiscal 2023 2nd quarter results. The macro environment weighed heavily on the financial results and conditions worsened as the quarter progressed, most notably in December. Second quarter total revenues were over $2.5 billion, down 7% year-over-year, which included a $171 million or 6% negative impact from foreign currency headwinds. We -- excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, second quarter adjusted revenues fell 3% compared to the prior year. The revenue decline was primarily driven by the Book Publishing and Digital Real Estate Services segment. On a constant currency basis, we saw continued growth in circulation and subscription revenues, which was partially offset by a modest decline in advertising revenues. Total segment EBITDA was $409 million, 30% lower compared to the prior year's record profits. The results included $6 million of onetime costs incurred by the special committee and the company regarding the proposal from the Murdoch Family Trust, which has now been withdrawn and the special committee has been dissolved. Adjusted total segment EBITDA declined 28% versus the prior year period. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.12 compared to $0.40 in the prior year due to lower total segment EBITDA and higher losses from equity affiliates. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.14 in the quarter compared to $0.44 in the prior year. Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $386 million, down 15% compared to the prior year, impacted by the ongoing macroeconomic pressures on both the Australian and U.S. housing markets. The results include a negative impact of $26 million or 5% from foreign currency fluctuations. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues decreased 10%. Segment EBITDA declined 28% to $128 million, impacted by lower revenues and a negative impact related to currency headwinds, partially offset by lower broker commissions REA adjusted segment EBITDA declined 22%. REA revenues were $240 million, down 16% on a reported basis, including a 9% negative impact from foreign exchange. Revenues were impacted by the weakness in financial services due to fewer settlements amid rising interest rates and a decline in residential revenues driven by lower new buy listings. In the quarter, Australia national residential buy listings were down 21% with Sydney and Melbourne down 34% and 31%, respectively. Those declines were partially offset by price increases in the residential and commercial businesses, higher contribution from Premier Plus and favorable depth penetration as well as continued momentum at REA India, which is scaling in both traffic and revenues. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details. At Move, revenues were $146 million, down 14% compared to the prior year, with real estate revenues down 17% driven by lower lead and transaction volumes, reflective of the broader housing market challenges, unique lead volumes fell 37%, while Realtor's average monthly unique users were $66 million in the second quarter based on internal metrics. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $462 million, down 7% compared to the prior year on a reported basis due to foreign currency headwinds. On a constant currency basis, revenues rose 3% versus the prior year, the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in constant currency, underscoring the improved stability of the business. Streaming revenues accounted for 26% of circulation and subscription revenues compared to 19% in the prior year and again, more than offset broadcast revenue declines, benefiting from both volume growth and higher pricing at Kayo and BINGE, we also benefited this quarter from growth in commercial revenues as the prior year results were impacted by the pandemic-related lockdown. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group reached over $4.3 million at quarter end, up 10% year-over-year. Total paid streaming subscribers were approximately $2.7 million, increasing 25% versus the prior year and represented 62% of Foxtel's total paid subscriber base. Kayo paying subscribers reached over $1.1 million, up 11% year-over-year, but declined sequentially from the first quarter as it exhibited typical seasonal patterns with the end of the AFL and NRL seasons in September. Given its enhanced and expanded content offerings, Foxtel has rolled out a price rise to its Kayo customers effective this month on its basic to stream tier. BINGE paying subscribers grew a robust 48% year-over-year to almost 1.4 million subscribers, benefiting from a strong release slate, which included the second season of white Lotus and carryover demand from House of the Dragon. As Robert mentioned, we are looking forward to the introduction of advertising within BINGE later this fiscal year and have begun selling launch packages. Foxtel ended the quarter with 1.4 million residential broadcast subscribers, down 10% year-over-year. Broadcast churn improved sequentially and year-over-year to 12.9% despite the migration of cable subscribers to streaming or satellite. At quarter end, less than 80,000 subscribers remained on cable as Foxtel continues to migrate subscribers from cable by fiscal year-end. Broadcast ARPU rose 2% to AUD 83. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $90 million was 5% higher versus the prior year, which reflects an 11% negative impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased 16% despite higher sports and entertainment costs. Moving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones posted a strong top line performance in the second quarter with revenues of $563 million, up 11% compared to the prior year. Digital revenues accounted for 76% of total revenues this quarter, up 4 percentage points from last year. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 1%, impacted by a weaker advertising marketplace compared to the prior year. Circulation revenues grew 3%, driven by strong year-over-year volume gains, including bundled offerings with total Dow Jones digital-only subscriptions up approximately 10% to over $4.1 million. We are particularly pleased with the performance of our professional information business, which saw revenue growth accelerate from the prior quarter to 45%. PIP revenues accounted for 33% of segment revenues. The integration of OPIS and CMA are progressing in line with our expectations as the businesses benefit from the strong demand across numerous industries, including metals, carbon plastics, sustainability, biofuels and renewables, while yields continue to rise and retention remains strong. Risk and Compliance revenue growth accelerated from the prior quarter, up 13% despite a 7 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency. We saw improved growth in all regions, underpinned by a healthy new business pipeline most notably in EMEA, led by demand for screening and monitoring and financial crime search products. Retention remains strong at above 90%. Advertising revenues declined 7% to $131 million, with digital advertising revenues down 3% in the quarter and print down 13%, which was mostly due to weakness in December, with October and November reasonably stable versus the prior year.  Digital advertising accounted for 59% of total advertising revenues, which improved 3 percentage points from last year. The technology and financial categories, which are typically our 2 largest advertising categories were both impacted by the macro conditions. We saw digital advertising growth at the wallstreetjournal.com, underscoring its premium audience. However, this was more than offset by the declines at MarketWatch, which face more headwinds as its audience and advertising demand tend to be more stock market-sensitive. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter declined 3% to $139 million, reflecting a higher spending rate compared to both the prior year and first quarter, driven by costs related to the OPIS and CMA acquisitions, higher compensation costs and phasing of marketing expenses. Adjusted segment EBITDA for the quarter was down 16%. We expect cost growth to moderate in the second half, and I will provide more detail on this later in my commentary about the outlook for the upcoming quarter. At Book Publishing, while we saw some impacts from the logistic constraints at Amazon, the results were mostly hampered by significant softness in consumer demand across the industry, notably in North America. On the cost side, lower cost due to volume declines were partially offset by ongoing supply chain inventory and inflationary pressures, further contracting margins. For the quarter, revenues declined 14% to $531 million and segment EBITDA declined 52% to $51 million. The backlist represented 57% of revenues, up slightly from last year, partly driven by weaker frontlist performance with the mix being more weighted towards physical copies rather than digital, which had an adverse impact on margins. Digital sales declined 7% this quarter and accounted for 19% of consumer sales. On an adjusted basis, revenues fell 11%, and segment EBITDA declined 51%. To mitigate the recent challenges, HarperCollins has already implemented price increases and has been actively reviewing its cost structure, including the recently announced 5% company-wide headcount reduction. Turning to News Media. Revenues were $579 million, down 9%, which included a $65 million or 10% negative impact on revenues from foreign currency. Adjusted revenues rose 1%. Circulation and subscription revenues declined 7%, but were up 4% in constant currency. Growth on a constant currency basis was driven by cover price increases in the U.K. and Australia and double-digit subscriber growth across News Australia and The Times and The Sunday Times. We saw advertising conditions worsened from the prior quarter, albeit with variance across our markets. Advertising revenues were down 13%, but down 3% in constant currency. Advertising at News U.K. was down modestly in constant currency as lower print advertising revenues were partially offset by strong growth in digital advertising at -- the Sun, which has seen very strong momentum in both page views and yields from its U.S. site. Advertising trends were notably weaker in Australia and at the New York Post. During the quarter, we saw that December was the weakest month for both the U.K. and the New York Post, while in Australia, November was the most challenging with December showing modest improvements month-over-month. Segment EBITDA of $59 million declined 47%, which was driven by approximately $22 million of higher costs related to the Talk TV initiative in the U.K. and other digital investments, notably in Australia as well as nearly $21 million negative impact from higher newsprint pricing. New York Post remained a positive contributor to segment EBITDA. Adjusted segment EBITDA fell 43%. Free cash flow for the 6 months ending December 31 was lower than the prior year due to lower total segment EBITDA as well as the timing of working capital payments, which included the payment for sports rights in the second quarter. We remain focused on driving strong and positive free cash flow generation for the year. Turning to the outlook. We continue to expect a higher cost due to supply chain and inflationary pressures, advertising conditions remain challenging and visibility is limited. We expect ongoing foreign exchange headwinds, albeit at a more modest impact given recent spot rates. We remain committed to reducing costs where we can, driven by headcount reductions across our business units, prioritized marketing spending and lower discretionary costs, while balancing investment spend. Looking at each of our segments. Our digital real estate services, Australian residential new buy listings for January declined 9%. Please refer to REA for a more specific outlook commentary. At Move, we expect lead volumes to remain challenged in the near term, due to macro conditions, albeit moderating mortgage rates have led to early signs of improving trends in the housing market. In Subscription Video Services, we remain pleased with the performance of the streaming products and the ongoing focus on broadcast ARPU and churn as we continue to migrate customers off cable. We are very encouraged by the year-to-date performance and continue to expect the Foxtel Group's profitability in local currency for the full year to be relatively stable. Profitability will be skewed to the fourth quarter as we expect third quarter cost to be higher in local currency compared to the prior year given the contractual escalators and expanded content from the AFL and NRL. At Dow Jones, we remain focused on the integration of OPIS and CMA. January advertising trends were similar to December with revenues down versus the prior year, and we expect trends to remain challenged, especially given the ongoing pressures within the technology category, noting that visibility is limited as usual. As I mentioned earlier, we expect the rate of investment spending growth in the second half to be more modest than the first half rate, which should aid profitability. In Book Publishing, we are optimistic about our new release, which should help with the performance in the second half, although near-term industry trading conditions have remained challenged. At News Media, similar to the second quarter, we expect ongoing inflationary cost pressures, especially on newsprint prices, which will be balanced by targeted cost initiatives. We will continue to see incremental costs in relation to product investments, albeit at a lower rate than the second quarter. And finally, in relation to the potential sale of Move and the special committee's work on the now withdrawn proposal, we expect to see some additional onetime transaction costs in the third quarter. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kane Hannan from Goldman Sachs.\nKane Hannan: Just 2 quick ones. One, just that $0.05 head count reduction you're talking about, I mean we saw the 5% reduction for books -- do we think that's broadly consistent across the News Corp group? Or could it be more skewed to Dow Jones or NIS or some of the other segments? And then try luck, obviously seen the move and I take your comments, Susan, or how do I think about the importance of REA in the broader portfolio, if we assume that the Move -- was complete. And so some of the synergies of owning REA would diminish without the Move asset in the portfolio. So just interested, there's any comments you can make that.\nRobert Thomson: Okay. First of all, the 5% reduction will be across all businesses, and it will be conducted in coming months with a view to concluding this calendar year. We expect savings of the order of at least $130 million annualized. As for REA, what I can say is that REA is a core part of our portfolio. It's a different company to Move the -- and you can do the math for what REA is worth to us in terms of market cap, which is around AUD 16.6 billion and our shares around 61.4%. Obviously, we all loan -- gratitude for his digital property. But we're very pleased with the way the business is progressing. You heard a little from Susan about the success that we're currently having in India where traffic was up 37% to 38 million uniques. And we've transferred the oversight of the India business to the REA team whether you expertise evidence and candidly, the time zones more sympathetic. So not only do we have the most successful property site in Australia. We have the largest digital property side in India. So tell me what that's worth now and what that will be worth in a decade from now. .\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Karnovsky from JPMorgan.\nDavid Karnovsky: With Book Publishing, wondering if you could quantify the Amazon impact in the quarter or maybe relative to last quarter. And then you noted a slowing consumer demand generally -- is that a function of post-pandemic behavior of the economy or just the titles that are in the market? And then Susan, any update on when you might expect some easing on the inflationary pressures there?\nRobert Thomson: Well, first of all, it's difficult to specifically identify or quantify the Amazon effect, I wasn't to say that it's real. And you can see from the fact that there was a 14% decline in revenues and will segment EBITDA fell 52%, that the impact of inflation generally was profound. But let's be very clear, this is not the new normal. The relatively large EBITDA fall shows inflation, which over the past year, has risen significantly had an impact. And it was because of the mix of titles, you've probably heard that physical was around 81% of the business in the most recent quarter. In the past, years, digital has been as much as 24% or 25%. So -- and the physical is obviously more impacted by inflationary pressures given paper, printing and distribution. Susan? \nSusan Panuccio: David, just in relation to Amazon, just to add a couple of points on that. One, we did see a slightly lower impact in Q2 than what we did in Q1. And actually, in January, we have seen Amazon sort of patterns return to relatively normal levels, albeit that is predicated on macro conditions going forward. Just in relation to inflation, unfortunately, I think we expect those inflationary impacts to continue through the balance of this fiscal year, which is one of the reasons that we've implemented the headcount reductions that we've talked about.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research.\nMichael Florin: Craig.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\nCraig Huber: Two questions if I could real quick. If you can hear me, in your equity investment line, you had like a $29 million loss there. Can you explain that, if you would, please, is that -- is there sort of recurring here for next few quarters? And separate from that, I want to ask you, CMA and the OPIS acquisitions, what was the organic revenue growth there if you had owned it in both periods, please, in the quarter?\nSusan Panuccio: Craig, I'll just -- I'll take these. So the first question in relation to the equity losses, we've actually got a small investment in a wagering platform down in Australia, the sub USD 50 million investment, and the quarter reflects some start-up losses in relation to that venture. I think importantly, we don't expect that equity loss reflected in Q2 to the run rate going forward? And then just in relation to OPIS and CMA, we don't break out the run rate for that going forward. But you can see from the adjusted revenues was up 1%, and you can see the impact of what the reported numbers were.\nOperator: And then our next question comes from Entcho Raykovski from Credit Suisse.\nEntcho Raykovski: Susan. Just one very quick clarification around the 5% head count reduction and I'd appreciate that must be a difficult decision. Presumably, that only applies to the wholly owned assets and not REA. And then just secondly, I appreciate you're not talking about the sale move specifically. But assuming it was to go ahead, how do you think about the use of the proceeds, given they could be reasonably material. Are you thinking about reinvestment? Or are you thinking about further returns to shareholders?\nRobert Thomson: And sure, obviously, REA is a separate listed company, but I think I can assure you that they are very much focused on cost reduction in the present climate and you'll be able to hear more from the REA team a little later. Look, I can only speak generally about capital allocation. We're constantly reviewing our capital allocation policies. As I said earlier, we're committed to our $1 billion buyback to our dividend program. And obviously, we're going to consider further measures given the potential proceeds of the Move deal and the savings inherent in the cost-cutting program we've announced today. But we'll also be opportunistic on investment as OPIS and CMA providential proved and we'll seek to share those profits that providence with shareholders.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alan Gould from Loop Capital.\nAlan Gould: Yes. I've got two, please. Robert, we're seeing the U.S. streaming companies sort of get religion and now looking for profits as opposed to just growth. How does that impact Foxtel? I know Foxtel had gotten a lot of its content from HBO and some of the other U.S. companies. So does it now appear that, that content will stay on Foxtel as opposed to those companies that are starting their own streaming areas? And secondly, you talked about 1 of your policies being simplification. Obviously, selling move would help for simplification, but are there any other simplification moves we're seeing?\nRobert Thomson: Well, first of all, I think we've spoken on past calls about the prospect of Imperial overstretch among some of the U.S. entertainment companies. I think that prognostication is indeed coming to pass. And it also shows you the value of the Foxtel platform. It's of itself clearly a success story, not only for our company or for Australia, but globally. They've got the streaming mix right they've secured the sports rights long term truly matter to viewers and not only one sport in one region, but across sports and regions. And looking here from New York Foxtel genuinely being transformed by much toil and sustained sagacity and it has evolved from what you might call euphemistically, a complicated situation to a genuine opportunity, and we will be opportunistic with that opportunity.\nAlan Gould: And then the question on. Simplification. .\nRobert Thomson: As for simplification, look, simplification and transparency, obviously important, as you can see by how the company is involved in recent years. We've broken out the Data Jones numbers, which shed some light, not only on its potential and potency, but on the situation of and revival of News Media, as you know, the New York Post was profitable last year and will be likely to be profitable again this year, and that profitability should increase over time. And -- you know that in that sector, we've sold News America Marketing, which became more peripheral over time given the changes in that sector. The peripheral is we're not the integral. But simplification does not mean reductio ad observers. And it does mean focusing on core growth engines which is why we've invested in the professional information business at Dow Jones and the fruits of that investment already obvious, even in difficult trading conditions overall.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Han from Morningstar.\nBrian Han: Robert, you mentioned making price adjustments were necessary. Where do you see the priority divisions for such adjustments from this point onwards?\nSusan Panuccio: Maybe I can take that, Brian. I mean, look, I think we've all -- we've got opportunities in each of our segments. We take cover price increases as it pertains to the mastheads across news media, the journal, we're constantly having we get our yields on advertising to see what we can do to maximize those. As I've mentioned in my commentary, we've just recently announced is at Kayo that goes to the strength of the product down there. We had a price rise on BINGE not so long ago. And we've also been having a look at price rises across. So actually, we have a lot of pricing power and we think about our different segments, and we really just assess the market conditions as we work our way through what's appropriate.\nOperator: Next question comes from Johnny Huynh from Evans & Partners.\nJohnny Huynh: I just wanted to ask on the interest in the advertising per and being so far. Like I know Netflix had some issues launching in Australia. We've done two high demand, but not enough audience. So I just wanted to see your thoughts on any strategies around this as well.\nSusan Panuccio: Look, I think we're just doing a soft launch in relation to the ad tier down in Foxtel. It hasn't yet launched. So we haven't got any learnings from that, and we just expect a modest uptick in the current financial year as a consequence of that launching later in the fiscal year. So we'll have more learnings from that once we've got it out in the marketplace.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darren Lung from Macquarie.\nDarren Leung: I just wanted to ask quickly, in the release, it indicates some in relation to Realtor or Move that as part of the transaction is to create shareholder value and strengthen Realtor\u2019s competitive position. So I appreciate not talking about the transaction as such. But can you give us an idea as to what strengthened competitive position looks like, please?\nRobert Thomson: Look, sorry, Darren, to be so circumspect, but we really can't say any more about the discussion so you'll have to stay tuned. You can presume that we are very much focused on shareholder value and we would have an ongoing role in value creation. Those are imperatives and always been the imperative of News Corporation. I have to say in passing, and we have much respect to CoStar as a company, its leadership, what they've created, what they could trade what they could do for competition in a very competitive digital real estate market here and frankly, how we could partner with.\nSusan Panuccio: And look, I think I'd also add that it is important for us if and when we complete any sale, what actually goes to an owner where we believe we'll continue to invest and grow that business going forward. I think that's important for any assets that we look to sell. .\nOperator: At this time, we have no further questions. So I'll hand back to Michael Florin for closing remarks.\nMichael Florin: Great. Well, thank you, Leyla and thank you all for participating. We look forward to talking to you soon. Have a wonderful day to talk to you soon. Bye.",

            "content": "Thanks, Robert. Before I discuss the quarterly results, I want to expand on Robert's opening comments. As we noted in our recent SEC filing, we have been engaged in discussions with CoStar about a potential sale of move. Any potential transaction would need to not only maximize shareholder value, but also strengthen realtor.com's competitive position. We do not plan on making additional comments on this call regarding the potential transaction, and we'll update the market when appropriate. Turning to our fiscal 2023 2nd quarter results. The macro environment weighed heavily on the financial results and conditions worsened as the quarter progressed, most notably in December.

During the quarter, we saw that December was the weakest month for both the U.K. and the New York Post, while in Australia, November was the most challenging with December showing modest improvements month-over-month. Segment EBITDA of $59 million declined 47%, which was driven by approximately $22 million of higher costs related to the Talk TV initiative in the U.K. and other digital investments, notably in Australia as well as nearly $21 million negative impact from higher newsprint pricing. New York Post remained a positive contributor to segment EBITDA. Adjusted segment EBITDA fell 43%. Free cash flow for the 6 months ending December 31 was lower than the prior year due to lower total segment EBITDA as well as the timing of working capital payments, which included the payment for sports rights in the second quarter. We remain focused on driving strong and positive free cash flow generation for the year. Turning to the outlook. We continue to expect a higher cost due to supply chain and inflationary pressures, advertising conditions remain challenging and visibility is limited. We expect ongoing foreign exchange headwinds, albeit at a more modest impact given recent spot rates. We remain committed to reducing costs where we can, driven by headcount reductions across our business units, prioritized marketing spending and lower discretionary costs, while balancing investment spend. Looking at each of our segments. Our digital real estate services, Australian residential new buy listings for January declined 9%. Please refer to REA for a more specific outlook commentary. At Move, we expect lead volumes to remain challenged in the near term, due to macro conditions, albeit moderating mortgage rates have led to early signs of improving trends in the housing market. In Subscription Video Services, we remain pleased with the performance of the streaming products and the ongoing focus on broadcast ARPU and churn as we continue to migrate customers off cable. We are very encouraged by the year-to-date performance and continue to expect the Foxtel Group's profitability in local currency for the full year to be relatively stable. Profitability will be skewed to the fourth quarter as we expect third quarter cost to be higher in local currency compared to the prior year given the contractual escalators and expanded content from the AFL and NRL. At Dow Jones, we remain focused on the integration of OPIS and CMA. January advertising trends were similar to December with revenues down versus the prior year, and we expect trends to remain challenged, especially given the ongoing pressures within the technology category, noting that visibility is limited as usual. As I mentioned earlier, we expect the rate of investment spending growth in the second half to be more modest than the first half rate, which should aid profitability. In Book Publishing, we are optimistic about our new release, which should help with the performance in the second half, although near-term industry trading conditions have remained challenged. At News Media, similar to the second quarter, we expect ongoing inflationary cost pressures, especially on newsprint prices, which will be balanced by targeted cost initiatives. We will continue to see incremental costs in relation to product investments, albeit at a lower rate than the second quarter. And finally, in relation to the potential sale of Move and the special committee's work on the now withdrawn proposal, we expect to see some additional onetime transaction costs in the third quarter. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A. David, just in relation to Amazon, just to add a couple of points on that. One, we did see a slightly lower impact in Q2 than what we did in Q1. And actually, in January, we have seen Amazon sort of patterns return to relatively normal levels, albeit that is predicated on macro conditions going forward. Just in relation to inflation, unfortunately, I think we expect those inflationary impacts to continue through the balance of this fiscal year, which is one of the reasons that we've implemented the headcount reductions that we've talked about. Craig, I'll just -- I'll take these. So the first question in relation to the equity losses, we've actually got a small investment in a wagering platform down in Australia, the sub USD 50 million investment, and the quarter reflects some start-up losses in relation to that venture. I think importantly, we don't expect that equity loss reflected in Q2 to the run rate going forward? And then just in relation to OPIS and CMA, we don't break out the run rate for that going forward. But you can see from the adjusted revenues was up 1%, and you can see the impact of what the reported numbers were. Maybe I can take that, Brian. I mean, look, I think we've all -- we've got opportunities in each of our segments. We take cover price increases as it pertains to the mastheads across news media, the journal, we're constantly having we get our yields on advertising to see what we can do to maximize those. As I've mentioned in my commentary, we've just recently announced is at Kayo that goes to the strength of the product down there. We had a price rise on BINGE not so long ago. And we've also been having a look at price rises across. So actually, we have a lot of pricing power and we think about our different segments, and we really just assess the market conditions as we work our way through what's appropriate. Look, I think we're just doing a soft launch in relation to the ad tier down in Foxtel. It hasn't yet launched. So we haven't got any learnings from that, and we just expect a modest uptick in the current financial year as a consequence of that launching later in the fiscal year. So we'll have more learnings from that once we've got it out in the marketplace. And look, I think I'd also add that it is important for us if and when we complete any sale, what actually goes to an owner where we believe we'll continue to invest and grow that business going forward. I think that's important for any assets that we look to sell. ."

            "name": "Robert Thomson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. The second quarter produced challenges for some of our businesses and highlighted the progress made in other segments that had been challenged. Obviously, a surge in interest rates and persistent inflation had an impact on all of our businesses, but in particular, Digital Real Estate and Book Publishing, which remains a majority of physical business and continues to be subject to logistical exigencies. But we believe these challenges are more ephemeral than eternal. And just as our company passed the stress test of the pandemic with record preference. The reform is now underway at our businesses should create a solid platform for future profitability. Crucially, we will be reducing headcount across the company by 5%. That is a necessary response given these macro conditions. There are other broader trends that will inevitably be auspicious such as our evolving partnerships with major tech platforms and the incipient changes to the digital advertising market, which should enable us to improve yields for our valuable inventory and have more oversight of permission data. At the same time, we are absolutely focused on reducing costs across our businesses and making price adjustments where prudent. And we are continuing to work on the integration of our recent acquisitions, OPIS and CMA, which are already enhancing revenue and profits at Dow Jones. As for our discussions over the potential sale of Move, we will provide an update at the appropriate moment. Obviously, any potential deal would be designed to maximize value for our shareholders in the short and long term. Looking now at the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. We generated over $2.5 billion in revenues, representing a decline of 7% year-over-year, though most of that was due to foreign currency. Adjusted revenues were down only 3%. Profitability was $409 million compared to $586 million in the prior year, reflecting the challenges of interest rates and inflation noted earlier, and the impact of fickle ForEx movements, which have shown signs of abating in recent weeks. Even in the midst of the obvious global challenges I've described, Dow Jones had a solid quarter, and the professional information business displayed particular promise with revenues surging 45% year-over-year. The result highlights the value of our opportunistic acquisition of OPIS and CMA, where we have recently launched products, including carbon credit indices and are working on more sophisticated analytics for our growing customer base. Risk and Compliance again reported strong revenue growth, increasing 13% despite capricious currency trends, with the demand for New York customer tools expanding as governments globally continue to tighten regulations and wheeled sanctions. The imperative for an authoritative audit trial has expanded far beyond financial institutions and the credibility that Dow Jones brings is in itself an important factor for many companies. Is there anyone on this call who does not want to minimize risk and maximize compliance? Dow Jones has begun to roll out a new user interface for the Aladdin's Cave of content that is Factiva, which is an essential tool for serious businesses. The truth is that the interface was in need of simplifying and the Dow Jones team have addressed that issue. The easier Factiva is to use, the more it will be used. Overall, at Dow Jones, digital revenues now comprise 76% of total revenues, a 4 percentage point rise over the past year. Some of that expansion is due to continuing strength in digital subscriptions. Digital-only subscriptions increased 10%, while total Dow Jones consumer subscriptions rose 5%. In fact, just in recent weeks, total Dow Jones subscriptions sold past the 5 million mark for the first time. Almar Latour and the team are increasing the emphasis on upselling subscriptions with the bundling of Market Watch, the WSJ, IBD and Barron's. The basic strategy is to provide an ever more premium service for our readers as we leverage valuable audiences across platforms. I am particularly proud to highlight the continuing revival of Foxtel's fortune under the Sage leadership of Patrick and Chevron and the team, we have increased profitability and thus optionality. Reported segment revenues were down 7%, while segment EBITDA rose a healthy 5%. Even more impressively, adjusted revenues, which excludes the impact of ForEx volatility, rose 3%, while adjusted segment EBITDA rose a handsome 16%. Streaming continues to be a core strength of Foxtel, as we have added well over 0.5 million paying OTT subscribers in the past year. BINGE reached nearly 1.4 million paying subscribers in the quarter and we'll be launching an advertising tier later this fiscal year as we seek to maximize Foxtel's revenue potential. Total paying subscriptions at Foxtel were up 10% year-over-year, and we also saw the benefits of modest price increases at Kayo and BINGE. Our sports programming portfolio has been enhanced with the renewal of Australian cricket rights to 2031. We are now on the cusp of the peak selling season for Kayo as the Australian Football and Rugby League seasons will start imminently, and we solidified our entertainment offerings with an expanded multiyear content deal with NBCU. Overall, Foxtel's continuing success and positive trajectory have certainly increased our optionality for that business. HarperCollins experienced another difficult quarter, reflecting sluggish spending on books after the pandemic inspired surge, difficult front-list comparisons as well as the continuing impact of Amazon's logistics issues. Under the prevailing circumstances, it is absolutely necessary to confront the cost base as we seek to bolster long-term profitability in the post-pandemic marketplace. Some of our key titles this quarter include Fox News, host Harris Faulkner's Faith Still Moves Mountains, and Joanna Gaines' The Stories We Tell. While best-selling orders, Colleen Hoover and Tarryn Fisher's work Never Never will be released later this month. The News Media segment showed signs of real resilience in the midst of a volatile advertising market and ForEx headwinds. The standout masthead was the sun.com in the U.S., which reported 127% year-over-year increase in quarterly page views. Meanwhile, the Times and Sunday Times reached nearly 490,000 digital subscriptions in the quarter. And at News Corp Australia, total digital subs exceeded 1 million, representing an 11% rise year-over-year. Wireless had a solid quarter in connected listening, which was assisted by interest in the World Cup on talkSPORT, while TalkTV revitalized its lineup, and the New York Post remains on target for another profitable year despite the air market. As for Digital Real Estate Services, the patent complexities of the current housing market in both the U.S. and Australia are well known and have had an effect on REA and Move. The property market inevitably has interest rate-related cycles. But with rates nearing a peak in both the U.S. and Australia, we believe the next phase of the cycle is not far away. We have this week launched a new campaign to use our media inventory to drive traffic at realtor.com and the positive effect should be seen in coming months. REA continued to maintain its number one market share in Australia this quarter with over 3.3 times the audience of its nearest competitor. And our business in India, now the market leader in audience is showing much potential. While leads were down at realtor.com in the quarter, the business saw a year-over-year improvement in revenue per lead as the team is focused on pricing, sell-through and close rights. We now are increasing our emphasis on the monetization of sell-side listing as inventory time on the market has increased significantly in recent months, and we will be able to provide realtors and vendors with improved service. In closing, while we expect the macro trends to have a continuing effect on our businesses and are committed to a 5% reduction in our workforce, we are confident that the combination of prudent cost management, sound capital stewardship, commitment to digital expansion and simplification should provide a firm foundation for future growth. And we will remain acutely focused on the creation of value for our shareholders as the possible sale of Move eloquently testifies. We also remain firmly committed to our $1 billion share buyback and dividend program. And now for more granular account of our second quarter, I give you over to Susan Panuccio. Okay. First of all, the 5% reduction will be across all businesses, and it will be conducted in coming months with a view to concluding this calendar year. We expect savings of the order of at least $130 million annualized. As for REA, what I can say is that REA is a core part of our portfolio. It's a different company to Move the -- and you can do the math for what REA is worth to us in terms of market cap, which is around AUD 16.6 billion and our shares around 61.4%. Obviously, we all loan -- gratitude for his digital property. But we're very pleased with the way the business is progressing. You heard a little from Susan about the success that we're currently having in India where traffic was up 37% to 38 million uniques. And we've transferred the oversight of the India business to the REA team whether you expertise evidence and candidly, the time zones more sympathetic. So not only do we have the most successful property site in Australia. We have the largest digital property side in India. So tell me what that's worth now and what that will be worth in a decade from now. . Well, first of all, it's difficult to specifically identify or quantify the Amazon effect, I wasn't to say that it's real. And you can see from the fact that there was a 14% decline in revenues and will segment EBITDA fell 52%, that the impact of inflation generally was profound. But let's be very clear, this is not the new normal. The relatively large EBITDA fall shows inflation, which over the past year, has risen significantly had an impact. And it was because of the mix of titles, you've probably heard that physical was around 81% of the business in the most recent quarter. In the past, years, digital has been as much as 24% or 25%. So -- and the physical is obviously more impacted by inflationary pressures given paper, printing and distribution. Susan? And sure, obviously, REA is a separate listed company, but I think I can assure you that they are very much focused on cost reduction in the present climate and you'll be able to hear more from the REA team a little later. Look, I can only speak generally about capital allocation. We're constantly reviewing our capital allocation policies. As I said earlier, we're committed to our $1 billion buyback to our dividend program. And obviously, we're going to consider further measures given the potential proceeds of the Move deal and the savings inherent in the cost-cutting program we've announced today. But we'll also be opportunistic on investment as OPIS and CMA providential proved and we'll seek to share those profits that providence with shareholders. Well, first of all, I think we've spoken on past calls about the prospect of Imperial overstretch among some of the U.S. entertainment companies. I think that prognostication is indeed coming to pass. And it also shows you the value of the Foxtel platform. It's of itself clearly a success story, not only for our company or for Australia, but globally. They've got the streaming mix right they've secured the sports rights long term truly matter to viewers and not only one sport in one region, but across sports and regions. And looking here from New York Foxtel genuinely being transformed by much toil and sustained sagacity and it has evolved from what you might call euphemistically, a complicated situation to a genuine opportunity, and we will be opportunistic with that opportunity. As for simplification, look, simplification and transparency, obviously important, as you can see by how the company is involved in recent years. We've broken out the Data Jones numbers, which shed some light, not only on its potential and potency, but on the situation of and revival of News Media, as you know, the New York Post was profitable last year and will be likely to be profitable again this year, and that profitability should increase over time. And -- you know that in that sector, we've sold News America Marketing, which became more peripheral over time given the changes in that sector. The peripheral is we're not the integral. But simplification does not mean reductio ad observers. And it does mean focusing on core growth engines which is why we've invested in the professional information business at Dow Jones and the fruits of that investment already obvious, even in difficult trading conditions overall. Look, sorry, Darren, to be so circumspect, but we really can't say any more about the discussion so you'll have to stay tuned. You can presume that we are very much focused on shareholder value and we would have an ongoing role in value creation. Those are imperatives and always been the imperative of News Corporation. I have to say in passing, and we have much respect to CoStar as a company, its leadership, what they've created, what they could trade what they could do for competition in a very competitive digital real estate market here and frankly, how we could partner with."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mike Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMike Florin: Thank you very much, operator. Hello everyone and welcome to News Corp.'s fiscal first quarter 2023 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We'll open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp.'s business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp.'s Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as Total Segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release for the applicable periods posted on our website. With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\nRobert Thomson: Thank you, Mike. While the macro environment is potently more volatile, we believe the resilient foundations of the reincarnated News Corp. give us a platform for sustained growth and increased profitability. That clearly is evident in our revenue performance this quarter. While revenues were down 1% to $2.5 billion, that decline was obviously a consequence of foreign currency fluctuations. On an adjusted basis, our revenues grew a healthy 3%, building on the robust results from last year. Profitability for the quarter was $350 million down 15%. Although that reflects the Forex headwinds and a reset by Amazon of its book inventory levels and warehouse footprint. We view neither factors reflective of core business conditions or of our long term potential. Our results follow two successive years of record profits at News Corp. It is important to keep that unprecedented success in mind, especially as we encounter what we expect to be ephemeral challenges. Our company has changed the digital terms of trade and we expect the current situation to be transitory. We see positive prospects across all our segments and our mix of revenues and geographies is obviously advantageous in a complicated, perplexing world. Turning first to Dow Jones. Q1 was the best first quarter on record since acquisition for revenue, profitably and margin, affirming the wisdom of our acquisition of OPIS and CMA, which have bolstered the Dow Jones Professional Information business. Revenues grew a resounding 16% and advertising was up 4%, which compares rather favorably to a number of competitors. In particular, digital advertising at Dow Jones rose 11%, a noteworthy achievement in this complex environment. In fact, Q1 represents the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year digital ad growth at Dow Jones. In the past year, Dow Jones added 473,000 digital-only subscriptions, and as of the end of Q1, 83% of subscriptions at Dow Jones were digital-only. At the Wall Street Journal, despite the tough market, paid digital subscriptions increased by over 350,000 year-over-year. During the quarter Investor\u2019s Business Daily launched a paid newsletter MarketDiem to attract younger investors and commissioned an options information app that will present new analytics for options trading, a complex but potentially lucrative sector. With its panoply of premium products, Dow Jones has renewed focus on bundling our premium content, including the Wall Street Journal, Market Watch, and Barron's. These valuable combinations have already exceeded 200,000 subscriptions and we have begun to roll out a bundle featuring WSJ, Barron's and IBD. Revenues at the professional information business rose 40% year-over-year. We continue to clearly see the benefit of risk and compliance in an environment of intensifying scrutiny by regulators who are insisting that companies minimize risk and maximize compliance. The integration of OPIS and CMA has been proceeding successfully and they joined a burgeoning Dow Jones data and intelligence business providing an impressive $52 million in combined revenues in Q1 and contributing materially to profitability this quarter. OPIS and CMA continue to leverage their proprietary data and analytics with new offerings including carbon indices and are assisting companies in making sense of the dynamic market for carbon offsets. Overall, we are delighted with the tangible progress in our professional information business, which is providing an increasing flow of high yield, low churn digital clients. At digital real estate services this quarter, we saw resiliency even though housing market conditions have potently become more volatile, especially in the US. REA Group achieved substantial revenue growth in constant currency on the back of higher pricing, increased penetration of its new premier plus enhancement and strong listing value, while maintaining its more than threefold lead in traffic over the competition. There was also notable audience and revenue growth at REA India, which further consolidated its position as a number one property portal in that massive and growing market. At Move, operator of realtor.com revenues were down 6% reflecting relatively similar trends to the fourth quarter. Realtor's unique users have risen 21% since the first quarter of financial '20, thanks to product enhancements and increased marketing. To position and equip the business to take full advantage of the inevitable upswing in the market, we are expanding our offerings in rentals and in developing sell side expertise, which we expect will drive profits far into the future. Realtor is also taking decisive steps to streamline and optimize the business while enhancing reinvestment capacity and capitalizing on long-term growth opportunities. Our focus on seller leads, which are the source of most revenue in the Australian market, is building on our recently acquired UpNest. The UpNest experience has been integrated into key seller placements across the site, providing sellers the ability to get proposals from multiple agents and offering consumers significantly more choice. Meanwhile, even in a challenging housing environment with higher mortgage rates, tight inventory and inflation, home prices have remained elevated and we note that active listings at Realtor improved by 29% in the quarter compared to the prior year period. Realtor remains focused on the long-term opportunities in what is an estimated $200 billion addressable market. As mentioned earlier, the Amazon reset affected many publishers in Q1 including HarperCollins. This reset relates to Amazon's decision to reduce inventory levels and shutter warehouses and accounted for almost the entirety of HarperCollins revenue contraction and the vast majority of its profit decline this quarter. Notably, consumer appetite which expanded during the pandemic continued to be robust and provides us with increasing confidence going forward, and we are absolutely focused on cost control at HarperCollins and the imperative to improve margins in these challenging conditions. Key front list titles in the quarter included Portrait of an Unknown Woman by Daniel Silva, Live Wire by Kelly Ripa and Breaking History by Jared Kushner. We are prospering from our global ownership rights to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, given the popularity of the Amazon series and we are looking forward to the release of The Stories We Tell by Joanna Gaines and Colleen Hoover's next work. Finally, we note that HarperCollins Focus last month acquired Cider Mill Press Book Publishers, an independent publisher of quality gift books. Cider Mill specialize in cooking, wine and spirits and humor books and includes Applesauce Press, a children's brand. Its deep back list should provide an ongoing source of incremental revenue. At subscription video services Foxtel had another strong quarter. Streaming subscriber penetration continues to expand and costs have been thoughtfully controlled. Foxtel has recently renewed or signed valuable long-term sports rights and content agreements including the IFL, WWE and NBC Universal. We have obvious optionality at Foxtel where the conversation is no longer about how much capital we plan to invest, but the potential for capital return. Foxtel streaming services attained 2.8 million paying subscribers as of the end of September, surging 34% versus the prior year, and accounting for 63% of the total paying subscriber base. Kayo and BINGE added nearly three quarters of a million paying subscribers in the past year alone underscoring the potential of Foxtel in a still expanding Australian market. Foxtel Group delivered record audiences for the recent IFL and NRL finals. Meanwhile, Motorsport, the Rugby League World Cup and T-20 World Cup Cricket are bolstering subscriber loyalty as we near the spring selling season. The News Media segment experienced a revenue decline of 4%, though it rose a healthy 6% on an adjusted basis when taking into account Forex fluctuations and other items. In constant currency, we saw healthy growth in advertising, circulation and subscription revenues. At News Corp Australia, circulation revenues improved in constant currency and digital subscriptions exceeded the one million mark for the first time up 13% year-over-year. News.com.au asserted its leadership in the free media environment with an audience of 13 million in the month of September. Meanwhile, the New York Post continued to improve profitability, thanks in part to a strong increase in digital advertising revenues. The Post digital network also flexed its muscles with a 24% increase in page views reaching an average of 129 million per week in Q1 and 151 million average monthly uniques in September. At News UK, The Sun\u2019s digital advertising exceeded print for the fourth consecutive quarter and accelerated its growth and we're delighted by the success of the sun.com, which continued to increase its already sizeable audience, particularly in the United States. And The Times Sunday Times also saw a 23% increase in digital paid subscriptions reaching 468,000 marking its second best ever quarter of digital growth. News Broadcasting, the new name for the radio and television brands of News UK reported an increase in both reach and listening hours according to the latest RAJAR\u2019s report. Talk Sport reached 2.9 million listeners who tuned in for more than 18 million hours up 10% quarter-on-quarter, and we expect the imminent World Cup to be a source of audiences and of advertising. News Corp is building on a base that has grown stronger, more global, and more digital in recent years. We have seen record profitability in each of the last two fiscal years. By many key measures, our resounding progress has continued. Digital advertising on the rise, streaming surging and subscriptions soaring. Despite the macroeconomic uncertainty, having streamlined and digitized our businesses and reached substantial agreements with the big tech platforms to compensate us for our premium journalism, we are better equipped to generate increasing value to our investors and our strong cash position means that we have been able to return capital to shareholders and invest thoughtfully in future growth while honoring our proud provenance. One last point. As announced last month following the receipt of letters from Rupert Murdoch and the Murdoch Family Trust, the News Corp Board of Directors has formed a special committee of independent Board members to begin exploring a potential combination with Fox Corporation. There can be no certainty that the company will engage in such a transaction. We do not intend to comment further at this time, and for that reason, we will not be taking questions on this topic today. We are of course happy to answer your questions about the performance of and prospects for our business, particularly as it relates to the first quarter of this fiscal year. As always, we thank our investors for their faith and confidence in us and all our employees, advertisers, readers and audiences for their valuable contributions and enduring support. Now I turn to Susan to expound and expand on these results.\nSusan Panuccio: Thank you, Robert. We have entered fiscal 2023 with a different macro environment, including volatility in foreign currency impacting our headline results from our Australian and UK businesses. Throughout fiscal 2022, we successfully navigated the company to be in a position of strength, guided by our ongoing cost transformation work, which we have balanced with investment and innovation to drive digital expansion. The first quarter of fiscal 2023 presented some challenges, particularly at HarperCollins, but most of the businesses performed well in constant currency and suffice to say that News Corp remains well positioned given the strength of our asset mix, healthy balance sheet, and the continued diversification of our revenue base. First quarter total revenues were approximately $2.5 billion down 1%, which included a $153 million or 6% negative impact from foreign currency headwinds. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, first quarter adjusted revenues grew 3% compared to the prior year. Total segment EBITDA was $350 million down 15% compared to the prior year, which saw a record profit with 53% growth. That being said, total segment EBITDA this quarter was still up 31% over fiscal 2021, underscoring the material changes in recent years. Also noteworthy is that the majority of the profit decline this quarter was driven by lower sales from Amazon due to the reset of its inventory levels and the right sizing of its warehouse footprint, as well as foreign currency fluctuations, neither of which we believe are reflective of underlying performance. Adjusted EBITDA declined 13% versus the prior year period. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.07 compared to $0.33 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.12 in the quarter compared to $0.23 in the prior year. Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with digital real estate services, segment revenues were $421 million down 1% compared to the prior year. The results include a negative impact of $20 million or 5% from foreign currency fluctuations. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues increased 3%. Segment EBITDA declined 14% to $119 million impacted by higher employee costs and increased marketing costs driven by strategic investment activities of both Move and REA together with negative impact related to currency headwinds. The increasing investment costs at Move was due to the expansion into adjacencies including seller leads, rentals and new homes as we focus on the longer term opportunity. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 7%. Move's revenues were $169 million, down 6%, following 30% growth in the prior year period. For the quarter, real estate revenues fell 9% driven by lower lead and transaction volumes, reflective of the broader industry trends. Consumer affordability constraints impacted unique lead volumes, which declined 32% in the quarter, although that was a slight improvement from the fourth quarter rate. Those trends were partially offset by price optimization within the traditional lead gen business, higher sell-through of our hybrid offering, market VIP, home price appreciation and continued advertising gains. We also had revenue growth from our adjacencies, including the acquisition of UpNest albeit these revenue streams are still in the early stages of development. Referral offerings accounted for approximately 30% of total revenues, down from 32% last year, impacted by lower transaction volumes, partially offset by higher home prices. Based on our internal metrics, Realtor\u2019s average monthly unique users were 86 million in the first quarter. REA had another strong quarter, with revenues rising 2% year-on-year on a reported basis to $252 million, which included a $20 million or 9% negative impact from foreign exchange. Growth was driven by price increases, contribution from Premier Plus, favorable debt penetration and product mix and growth in national [listings] (ph), partially offset by a modest decline in financial services revenues due to lower settlement activity. Overall, new buy listings rose 5% with Sydney and Melbourne up 5% and 12% respectively. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $502 million, down approximately 2% compared to the prior year on a reported basis due to foreign currency headwinds. Importantly, on an adjusted basis, revenues rose 6% versus the prior year, accelerating from the prior quarter rate of 4% growth. Streaming revenues accounted for 25% of circulation and subscription revenues versus 19% in the prior year and again, more than offset broadcast revenue declines. Total closing paid subscribers across Foxtel Group reached almost 4.5 million at quarter end, up 16% year-over-year with the growth rate improving 3 percentage points from the fourth quarter. Total subscribers, including triallers reached over 4.6 million. Total paid stream subscribers reached over 2.8 million, increasing 34% versus the prior year and adding 117,000 sequentially with streaming subscribers now representing 63% of Foxtel's total paid subscriber base. Kayo paying subscribers reached almost 1.3 million, up nearly 19% year-over-year, slightly down from the fourth quarter levels due to typical seasonal patterns with the end of the AFL and NRL seasons in September. BINGE paying subscribers grew a robust 67% year-over-year to over 1.3 million subscribers benefiting from the release of the House of the Dragon and the popularity of the Foxtel Original series, The 12. Foxtel ended the quarter with over 1.4 million residential broadcast subscribers, down 10% year-over-year, similar to the fourth quarter rate. Broadcast churn was 14.2% compared to 14% in the prior year, partly reflecting the acceleration of migrating subscribers of cable. Broadcast ARPU rose over 1% to approximately AUD 83. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $111 million fell 3% versus the prior year, significantly impacted by currency, with adjusted segment EBITDA increasing 5%. Moving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones continued to post strong performance in the first quarter with revenues of $515 million, up 16% compared to the prior year, with digital revenues accounting for 79% of total revenues this quarter, up 4 percentage points from last year. Results included a full quarter from both the OPIS and Chemical Market Analytics acquisitions. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose approximately 6%. Circulation revenue grew 5%, driven by strong year-over-year volume gains with The Wall Street Journal digital-only subscriptions, up 13% to over 3.1 million and total Dow Jones digital-only subscriptions also up 13%. Professional information business revenues rose 40% and accounted for approximately 35% of segment revenues driven by the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA. Revenues from the acquisitions are progressing in line with our expectations as the businesses benefited from strong demand across numerous industries, including metals, carbon, plastics, sustainability, biofuels and renewables while yields continue to rise and retention remains strong. Risk and Compliance revenues grew 6%, although currency had a 10 percentage point negative impact on revenue growth given the business' higher exposure to Europe and APAC. Advertising revenues grew a healthy 4% to $94 million despite lapping 29% growth in the prior year. Digital advertising revenues rose 11% in the quarter as we continue to see very strong yield improvement and saw growth in all categories, especially in B2B this quarter. Digital advertising accounted for approximately 65% of total advertising revenues, which improved 4 percentage points from last year. Print advertising revenues were down 6%. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 19% to $113 million as margins continued to improve with 50 basis points expansion year-over-year to nearly 22%, helped by the inclusion of OPIS and CMA. Adjusted segment EBITDA for the quarter was down 1%, reflecting higher employee costs. At Book Publishing, as we flagged during the quarter, results were materially hampered by Amazon's reset of inventory levels and rightsizing of its warehouse footprint resulting in significantly lower orders and higher returns. Supply chain pressures continue to impact freight and manufacturing costs but are showing some signs of easing from recent quarters. As it relates to Amazon, we have not seen similar inventory level adjustments from other book distributors or retailers. And as Robert noted, consumer demand has remained healthy, and consumer sales data remained consistent with prior quarters. For the quarter, revenues declined 11% to $487 million and segment EBITDA declined 54% to $39 million. We estimate Amazon accounted for almost the entire year-over-year revenue decline and the majority of the year-over-year segment EBITDA shortfall. Our backlist contributed 65% of revenues, up slightly from last year, benefiting from the demand of Tolkien titles helped by the premier of the Rings of Power on Amazon. Digital sales rose 1% this quarter and accounted for 23% of consumer sales. On an adjusted basis, revenues fell 7% and segment EBITDA declined 51%. Turning to News Media. We continue to see relatively strong advertising trends, particularly at News Australia. Revenues were $553 million, down 4% versus the prior year, largely due to currency, which had a $62 million or 11% negative impact on revenues. Importantly, despite macro uncertainty, adjusted revenues for the segment increased a healthy 6% compared to the prior year due to strength in circulation and subscription and advertising revenues in constant currency. Circulation and subscription revenues declined 6%, but that included a 12% or $32 million negative impact from currency fluctuations. Growth in constant currency was driven by cover price increases in the U.K. and Australia and increase in content licensing revenues and double-digit subscriber gains across News Australia and The Times and The Sunday Times. Advertising revenues declined 4% compared to the prior year, which included a 9% or $22 million negative impact from currency fluctuations. Growth in constant currency was driven by an increase in digital advertising revenues, primarily at The Sun where digital revenue yet again eclipsed print revenue, while Australia benefited from strong print preperformance led by a recovery in retail and travel, which were impacted by the lockdowns in the prior year. The New York Post also posted strong digital gains. Segment EBITDA of $18 million declined 47%, driven by over $20 million of higher costs related to Talk TV and other digital investments, together with higher newsprint production and distribution costs across the businesses, which are being impacted by the current inflationary and supply chain challenges. Adjusted segment EBITDA fell 44%. Before we look at the outlook for the next quarter, I would like to touch on free cash flow. First quarter free cash flow is typically lower due to the timing of working capital payments, and we remain focused on driving strong and positive free cash flow generation for the year. Turning to the upcoming quarter. We continue to expect higher costs due to supply chain and inflationary pressures. Advertising conditions and mix and visibility remains limited across the businesses. We also expect ongoing foreign exchange headwinds, given the current spot rate for the Australian dollar and pound sterling compared to the prior year. Looking at each of our segments. At Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for October declined 18% as we lapped tougher prior year comparisons. Please refer to REA for more specific outlook commentary. At Move, we expect lead and transaction volumes will be challenged in the short term, and we will continue to take steps to mitigate those pressures while balancing ongoing investments with cost discipline. In Subscription Video Services, we remain pleased with the performance of the streaming products and the ongoing focus of broadcast ARPU and churn as we continue to migrate customers from cable to streaming. At Dow Jones, we remain focused on the integration of OPIS and CMA. Advertising visibility remains short term. However, we are expecting a more challenging second quarter. We also expect the rate of investment in the second quarter to be higher than the prior year as we continue to focus on driving consumer subscription and enhancing our PIB offerings. In book publishing supply chain and inflationary pressures continue to persist, albeit are showing signs of easing. We still expect headwinds from Amazon in the second quarter, although with strong customer demand, we expect any issues to be short term in nature. At News Media, like the first quarter, we expect incremental costs in relation to product investments across the businesses, including top TV and other digital initiatives, together with ongoing inflationary pressures, including newsprint prices. Before we open for questions, I would like to remind everyone that we will not be addressing any questions related to the special committee and/or a potential combination with FOX Corporation, as Robert stated earlier. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Kane Hannan from Goldman Sachs.\nKane Hannan: Maybe just on the book publishing side of things. Helpful comments there at the end around Amazon and the broader inflationary pressures. Just give us a sense of, I suppose, the margin decline in the first quarter, some 50 basis points and what you'd attribute to Amazon's impact and what you'd attribute to, I suppose, the inflationary side of things that is probably going to continue for the rest of the year? And then just as a second sort of quick follow-on. Just talk about how you're thinking about M&A in the book publishing space and whether you think Harper would have any of the regulatory pushback that Penguin Random House had with their proposed acquisition?\nRobert Thomson: Ken, look, clearly, the supply chain is a factor. But as for Amazon, it's fair to say, it's ephemeral, not eternal, but meaningful in the first quarter. The combination of both inventory adjustment and warehouse closures clearly created logistic issues, which we trust Amazon will resolve relatively soon. But the demand for books is undiminished, and we certainly have some alluring titles looming including Joanna Gaines and Colleen Hoover. So -- and in the meantime, Brian Murray and his team are resolutely focused on cost control and necessarily improving margins. As for Simon & Schuster, look, clearly, there is much more work ahead for the lawyers at both companies. The legal documents must already run to many volumes themselves. But it is appropriate that the judge rule that the proposed merger would create a book behemoth, literally a leviathan, a titan of terms that would wield disproportionate weight in the industry. For ourselves, we're absolutely resolutely focused on building the HarperCollins business and continuing the integration of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.\nSusan Panuccio: And Ken, maybe just to frame the Amazon impact. The majority of the EBITDA decrease was due to Amazon. We had hopes that it will be limited to Q1, but we are expecting to see some impacts coming into the second quarter. But all things being while we expect the second half to pick back up. And the inflationary impacts have been coming down actually. We are seeing it slightly offset by volume, but we can hopefully again, expect to see those subside a little bit in the second half.\nOperator: Next question comes from David Karnovsky from JPMorgan.\nDavid Karnovsky: Robert, on Wall Street Journal digital subscribers. Can you talk to the trends there for the prior 2 quarters? I think you mentioned a tough market. I wanted to see how you view factors like new cycle or economy? And then Dow Jones digital ads grew strongly in the quarter. Is that sort of disassociated to the macro or would you expect some impact to the demand eventually?\nRobert Thomson: Second part of the question was a little unclear but on digital subs, they were up 13% for both Dow Jones and the Wall Street Journal. Our total subs were up 8% at Dow Jones, 4.9 million and the WSJ, that's 3.8 million. What we're seeing with Dow Jones generally is that we're able to take advantage of a massive audience, which is 116 million monthly uniques and then gradually push people up for the hierarchy of premium products at a premium price. And clearly, as we've taken on more professional information content, the ability to take advantage of that opportunity is realized. And secondly, we believe in vertical bundling. So for example, MarketWatch and WSJ, WSJ and IBD, IBD and Barron's not what you might call horizontal bundling which other companies in indulge in. And there's no doubt that you'll see, over the next 6 months, the virtue of those bundles that Dow Jones has just begun marketing. So we'll be able to update you in succeeding quarters, but we have no doubt that the strategy is a wise one.\nSusan Panuccio: And David, look, I think on the advertising. We didn't quite catch what the question was, but we actually been really pleased with the performance of advertising in Dow Jones, they have been growing advertising quarter-on-quarter for quite a few quarters now, which has been really pleasing and actually have surpassed our expectations as to how well they've been doing. I did say in my comments that we were expecting it to be a little bit more challenged come Q2. Q2 is one of the biggest advertising quarters across our markets, but it's still pretty early days, and we'll see how that pans out. So we do expect it to be a little bit more challenged in the second quarter against tougher comps.\nOperator: Next question is from Darren Leung from Macquarie.\nDarren Leung: Just a quick one about the BINGE subscriber growth. So it's up quarter-on-quarter. Any feel for how much was driven by House of the Dragon versus potential [Indiscernible] from cost conscious consumers, and maybe another way to frame that is did the trend pace increase?\nRobert Thomson: We are very pleased with the subscription performance at BINGE. And frankly, at Kayo both have around 1.3 million subscribers now. And what we're seeing is very uplifting in the sense that even though the streaming subscription has increased notably, in fact, up 35%. while broadcast ARPU is actually higher. So we're not seeing the feared cannibalization. And what it has done with Foxtel, it's given us optionality, which is a tribute to the toil of Patrick, [Siobhan] (ph) and the team in Australia, we've secured long-term rights, the most watched sports and entertainment in Australia, and they have been working relentlessly to improve the customer experience. And the focus not only on what the customer watches, but how they watch and that's why the churn performance has been so good.\nOperator: And next question is from Brian Han from Morningstar.\nBrian Han: Just a quick one. In digital real estate, can you please confirm that News Corp is still investing in those adjacencies and seller lead businesses in the U.S. Or is cost cutting the main thing now for the division?\nRobert Thomson: Brian, very much so because we see a bright long-term future for Realtor. And that's why we are indeed investing. We're rightly cost-conscious. But whether it's rentals, whether it's the sell side as well as the buyer side, we're continuing to invest in products because there is absolutely no doubt about the long-term opportunity that digital real estate presents in the United States.\nSusan Panuccio: And Brian, just to add to that, our actual core operating expenses at Realtor are flat in the core business year-on-year and actually the increase that we've seen in costs year-on-year are due to those 3 adjacencies in the investment [Indiscernible].\nOperator: Next question is from [Jonny Hein from Emerson Partners] (ph).\nUnidentified Analyst: I just wanted to ask about BINGE again and then specifically on the ad [Indiscernible]. Can you talk about expectations on ARPU and then also the demand from advertisers as well?\nRobert Thomson: Well, generally, we're very pleased with the BINGE performance. Bringing in advertising gives us another layer of revenue potential and I have no doubt that as the team does its modeling of that potential that we'll be able to update you in coming quarters as it's unfurled to the market.\nSusan Panuccio: And Johnny, just to add to that. So I think there's been a couple of questions just in relation to the pricing. We've been really pleased actually with how customers have been retained for BINGE and the price-rise that's been put through. So we've been very, very pleased with that. And as Robert said, we're expecting strong performance across BINGE with the content that we've got and the work that, that business has been doing down there.\nOperator: There are no further questions from the line.\nMike Florin: Great. Well, thank you, Tatiana. Thank you all for participating. Have a great day, and we will talk to you soon. Take care.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Susan Panuccio",
            "content": "Thank you, Robert. We have entered fiscal 2023 with a different macro environment, including volatility in foreign currency impacting our headline results from our Australian and UK businesses. Throughout fiscal 2022, we successfully navigated the company to be in a position of strength, guided by our ongoing cost transformation work, which we have balanced with investment and innovation to drive digital expansion. The first quarter of fiscal 2023 presented some challenges, particularly at HarperCollins, but most of the businesses performed well in constant currency and suffice to say that News Corp remains well positioned given the strength of our asset mix, healthy balance sheet, and the continued diversification of our revenue base. First quarter total revenues were approximately $2.5 billion down 1%, which included a $153 million or 6% negative impact from foreign currency headwinds. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, first quarter adjusted revenues grew 3% compared to the prior year. Total segment EBITDA was $350 million down 15% compared to the prior year, which saw a record profit with 53% growth. That being said, total segment EBITDA this quarter was still up 31% over fiscal 2021, underscoring the material changes in recent years. Also noteworthy is that the majority of the profit decline this quarter was driven by lower sales from Amazon due to the reset of its inventory levels and the right sizing of its warehouse footprint, as well as foreign currency fluctuations, neither of which we believe are reflective of underlying performance. Adjusted EBITDA declined 13% versus the prior year period. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.07 compared to $0.33 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.12 in the quarter compared to $0.23 in the prior year. Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with digital real estate services, segment revenues were $421 million down 1% compared to the prior year. The results include a negative impact of $20 million or 5% from foreign currency fluctuations. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues increased 3%. Segment EBITDA declined 14% to $119 million impacted by higher employee costs and increased marketing costs driven by strategic investment activities of both Move and REA together with negative impact related to currency headwinds. The increasing investment costs at Move was due to the expansion into adjacencies including seller leads, rentals and new homes as we focus on the longer term opportunity. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 7%. Move's revenues were $169 million, down 6%, following 30% growth in the prior year period. For the quarter, real estate revenues fell 9% driven by lower lead and transaction volumes, reflective of the broader industry trends. Consumer affordability constraints impacted unique lead volumes, which declined 32% in the quarter, although that was a slight improvement from the fourth quarter rate. Those trends were partially offset by price optimization within the traditional lead gen business, higher sell-through of our hybrid offering, market VIP, home price appreciation and continued advertising gains. We also had revenue growth from our adjacencies, including the acquisition of UpNest albeit these revenue streams are still in the early stages of development. Referral offerings accounted for approximately 30% of total revenues, down from 32% last year, impacted by lower transaction volumes, partially offset by higher home prices. Based on our internal metrics, Realtor's average monthly unique users were 86 million in the first quarter. REA had another strong quarter, with revenues rising 2% year-on-year on a reported basis to $252 million, which included a $20 million or 9% negative impact from foreign exchange. Growth was driven by price increases, contribution from Premier Plus, favorable debt penetration and product mix and growth in national [listings] (ph), partially offset by a modest decline in financial services revenues due to lower settlement activity. Overall, new buy listings rose 5% with Sydney and Melbourne up 5% and 12% respectively. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $502 million, down approximately 2% compared to the prior year on a reported basis due to foreign currency headwinds. Importantly, on an adjusted basis, revenues rose 6% versus the prior year, accelerating from the prior quarter rate of 4% growth. Streaming revenues accounted for 25% of circulation and subscription revenues versus 19% in the prior year and again, more than offset broadcast revenue declines. Total closing paid subscribers across Foxtel Group reached almost 4.5 million at quarter end, up 16% year-over-year with the growth rate improving 3 percentage points from the fourth quarter. Total subscribers, including triallers reached over 4.6 million. Total paid stream subscribers reached over 2.8 million, increasing 34% versus the prior year and adding 117,000 sequentially with streaming subscribers now representing 63% of Foxtel's total paid subscriber base. Kayo paying subscribers reached almost 1.3 million, up nearly 19% year-over-year, slightly down from the fourth quarter levels due to typical seasonal patterns with the end of the AFL and NRL seasons in September. BINGE paying subscribers grew a robust 67% year-over-year to over 1.3 million subscribers benefiting from the release of the House of the Dragon and the popularity of the Foxtel Original series, The 12. Foxtel ended the quarter with over 1.4 million residential broadcast subscribers, down 10% year-over-year, similar to the fourth quarter rate. Broadcast churn was 14.2% compared to 14% in the prior year, partly reflecting the acceleration of migrating subscribers of cable. Broadcast ARPU rose over 1% to approximately AUD 83. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $111 million fell 3% versus the prior year, significantly impacted by currency, with adjusted segment EBITDA increasing 5%. Moving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones continued to post strong performance in the first quarter with revenues of $515 million, up 16% compared to the prior year, with digital revenues accounting for 79% of total revenues this quarter, up 4 percentage points from last year. Results included a full quarter from both the OPIS and Chemical Market Analytics acquisitions. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose approximately 6%. Circulation revenue grew 5%, driven by strong year-over-year volume gains with The Wall Street Journal digital-only subscriptions, up 13% to over 3.1 million and total Dow Jones digital-only subscriptions also up 13%. Professional information business revenues rose 40% and accounted for approximately 35% of segment revenues driven by the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA. Revenues from the acquisitions are progressing in line with our expectations as the businesses benefited from strong demand across numerous industries, including metals, carbon, plastics, sustainability, biofuels and renewables while yields continue to rise and retention remains strong. Risk and Compliance revenues grew 6%, although currency had a 10 percentage point negative impact on revenue growth given the business' higher exposure to Europe and APAC. Advertising revenues grew a healthy 4% to $94 million despite lapping 29% growth in the prior year. Digital advertising revenues rose 11% in the quarter as we continue to see very strong yield improvement and saw growth in all categories, especially in B2B this quarter. Digital advertising accounted for approximately 65% of total advertising revenues, which improved 4 percentage points from last year. Print advertising revenues were down 6%. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 19% to $113 million as margins continued to improve with 50 basis points expansion year-over-year to nearly 22%, helped by the inclusion of OPIS and CMA. Adjusted segment EBITDA for the quarter was down 1%, reflecting higher employee costs. At Book Publishing, as we flagged during the quarter, results were materially hampered by Amazon's reset of inventory levels and rightsizing of its warehouse footprint resulting in significantly lower orders and higher returns. Supply chain pressures continue to impact freight and manufacturing costs but are showing some signs of easing from recent quarters. As it relates to Amazon, we have not seen similar inventory level adjustments from other book distributors or retailers. And as Robert noted, consumer demand has remained healthy, and consumer sales data remained consistent with prior quarters. For the quarter, revenues declined 11% to $487 million and segment EBITDA declined 54% to $39 million. We estimate Amazon accounted for almost the entire year-over-year revenue decline and the majority of the year-over-year segment EBITDA shortfall. Our backlist contributed 65% of revenues, up slightly from last year, benefiting from the demand of Tolkien titles helped by the premier of the Rings of Power on Amazon. Digital sales rose 1% this quarter and accounted for 23% of consumer sales. On an adjusted basis, revenues fell 7% and segment EBITDA declined 51%. Turning to News Media. We continue to see relatively strong advertising trends, particularly at News Australia. Revenues were $553 million, down 4% versus the prior year, largely due to currency, which had a $62 million or 11% negative impact on revenues. Importantly, despite macro uncertainty, adjusted revenues for the segment increased a healthy 6% compared to the prior year due to strength in circulation and subscription and advertising revenues in constant currency. Circulation and subscription revenues declined 6%, but that included a 12% or $32 million negative impact from currency fluctuations. Growth in constant currency was driven by cover price increases in the U.K. and Australia and increase in content licensing revenues and double-digit subscriber gains across News Australia and The Times and The Sunday Times. Advertising revenues declined 4% compared to the prior year, which included a 9% or $22 million negative impact from currency fluctuations. Growth in constant currency was driven by an increase in digital advertising revenues, primarily at The Sun where digital revenue yet again eclipsed print revenue, while Australia benefited from strong print preperformance led by a recovery in retail and travel, which were impacted by the lockdowns in the prior year. The New York Post also posted strong digital gains. Segment EBITDA of $18 million declined 47%, driven by over $20 million of higher costs related to Talk TV and other digital investments, together with higher newsprint production and distribution costs across the businesses, which are being impacted by the current inflationary and supply chain challenges. Adjusted segment EBITDA fell 44%. Before we look at the outlook for the next quarter, I would like to touch on free cash flow. First quarter free cash flow is typically lower due to the timing of working capital payments, and we remain focused on driving strong and positive free cash flow generation for the year. Turning to the upcoming quarter. We continue to expect higher costs due to supply chain and inflationary pressures. Advertising conditions and mix and visibility remains limited across the businesses. We also expect ongoing foreign exchange headwinds, given the current spot rate for the Australian dollar and pound sterling compared to the prior year. Looking at each of our segments. At Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for October declined 18% as we lapped tougher prior year comparisons. Please refer to REA for more specific outlook commentary. At Move, we expect lead and transaction volumes will be challenged in the short term, and we will continue to take steps to mitigate those pressures while balancing ongoing investments with cost discipline. In Subscription Video Services, we remain pleased with the performance of the streaming products and the ongoing focus of broadcast ARPU and churn as we continue to migrate customers from cable to streaming. At Dow Jones, we remain focused on the integration of OPIS and CMA. Advertising visibility remains short term. However, we are expecting a more challenging second quarter. We also expect the rate of investment in the second quarter to be higher than the prior year as we continue to focus on driving consumer subscription and enhancing our PIB offerings. In book publishing supply chain and inflationary pressures continue to persist, albeit are showing signs of easing. We still expect headwinds from Amazon in the second quarter, although with strong customer demand, we expect any issues to be short term in nature. At News Media, like the first quarter, we expect incremental costs in relation to product investments across the businesses, including top TV and other digital initiatives, together with ongoing inflationary pressures, including newsprint prices. Before we open for questions, I would like to remind everyone that we will not be addressing any questions related to the special committee and/or a potential combination with FOX Corporation, as Robert stated earlier. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A. And Ken, maybe just to frame the Amazon impact. The majority of the EBITDA decrease was due to Amazon. We had hopes that it will be limited to Q1, but we are expecting to see some impacts coming into the second quarter. But all things being while we expect the second half to pick back up. And the inflationary impacts have been coming down actually. We are seeing it slightly offset by volume, but we can hopefully again, expect to see those subside a little bit in the second half. And David, look, I think on the advertising. We didn't quite catch what the question was, but we actually been really pleased with the performance of advertising in Dow Jones, they have been growing advertising quarter-on-quarter for quite a few quarters now, which has been really pleasing and actually have surpassed our expectations as to how well they've been doing. I did say in my comments that we were expecting it to be a little bit more challenged come Q2. Q2 is one of the biggest advertising quarters across our markets, but it's still pretty early days, and we'll see how that pans out. So we do expect it to be a little bit more challenged in the second quarter against tougher comps. And Brian, just to add to that, our actual core operating expenses at Realtor are flat in the core business year-on-year and actually the increase that we've seen in costs year-on-year are due to those 3 adjacencies in the investment [Indiscernible]. And Johnny, just to add to that. So I think there's been a couple of questions just in relation to the pricing. We've been really pleased actually with how customers have been retained for BINGE and the price-rise that's been put through. So we've been very, very pleased with that. And as Robert said, we're expecting strong performance across BINGE with the content that we've got and the work that, that business has been doing down there."

            "name": "Robert Thomson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. While the macro environment is potently more volatile, we believe the resilient foundations of the reincarnated News Corp. give us a platform for sustained growth and increased profitability. That clearly is evident in our revenue performance this quarter. While revenues were down 1% to $2.5 billion, that decline was obviously a consequence of foreign currency fluctuations. On an adjusted basis, our revenues grew a healthy 3%, building on the robust results from last year. Profitability for the quarter was $350 million down 15%. Although that reflects the Forex headwinds and a reset by Amazon of its book inventory levels and warehouse footprint. We view neither factors reflective of core business conditions or of our long term potential. Our results follow two successive years of record profits at News Corp. It is important to keep that unprecedented success in mind, especially as we encounter what we expect to be ephemeral challenges. Our company has changed the digital terms of trade and we expect the current situation to be transitory. We see positive prospects across all our segments and our mix of revenues and geographies is obviously advantageous in a complicated, perplexing world. Turning first to Dow Jones. Q1 was the best first quarter on record since acquisition for revenue, profitably and margin, affirming the wisdom of our acquisition of OPIS and CMA, which have bolstered the Dow Jones Professional Information business. Revenues grew a resounding 16% and advertising was up 4%, which compares rather favorably to a number of competitors. In particular, digital advertising at Dow Jones rose 11%, a noteworthy achievement in this complex environment. In fact, Q1 represents the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year digital ad growth at Dow Jones. In the past year, Dow Jones added 473,000 digital-only subscriptions, and as of the end of Q1, 83% of subscriptions at Dow Jones were digital-only. At the Wall Street Journal, despite the tough market, paid digital subscriptions increased by over 350,000 year-over-year. During the quarter Investor's Business Daily launched a paid newsletter MarketDiem to attract younger investors and commissioned an options information app that will present new analytics for options trading, a complex but potentially lucrative sector. With its panoply of premium products, Dow Jones has renewed focus on bundling our premium content, including the Wall Street Journal, Market Watch, and Barron's. These valuable combinations have already exceeded 200,000 subscriptions and we have begun to roll out a bundle featuring WSJ, Barron's and IBD. Revenues at the professional information business rose 40% year-over-year. We continue to clearly see the benefit of risk and compliance in an environment of intensifying scrutiny by regulators who are insisting that companies minimize risk and maximize compliance. The integration of OPIS and CMA has been proceeding successfully and they joined a burgeoning Dow Jones data and intelligence business providing an impressive $52 million in combined revenues in Q1 and contributing materially to profitability this quarter. OPIS and CMA continue to leverage their proprietary data and analytics with new offerings including carbon indices and are assisting companies in making sense of the dynamic market for carbon offsets. Overall, we are delighted with the tangible progress in our professional information business, which is providing an increasing flow of high yield, low churn digital clients. At digital real estate services this quarter, we saw resiliency even though housing market conditions have potently become more volatile, especially in the US. REA Group achieved substantial revenue growth in constant currency on the back of higher pricing, increased penetration of its new premier plus enhancement and strong listing value, while maintaining its more than threefold lead in traffic over the competition. There was also notable audience and revenue growth at REA India, which further consolidated its position as a number one property portal in that massive and growing market. At Move, operator of realtor.com revenues were down 6% reflecting relatively similar trends to the fourth quarter. Realtor's unique users have risen 21% since the first quarter of financial '20, thanks to product enhancements and increased marketing. To position and equip the business to take full advantage of the inevitable upswing in the market, we are expanding our offerings in rentals and in developing sell side expertise, which we expect will drive profits far into the future. Realtor is also taking decisive steps to streamline and optimize the business while enhancing reinvestment capacity and capitalizing on long-term growth opportunities. Our focus on seller leads, which are the source of most revenue in the Australian market, is building on our recently acquired UpNest. The UpNest experience has been integrated into key seller placements across the site, providing sellers the ability to get proposals from multiple agents and offering consumers significantly more choice. Meanwhile, even in a challenging housing environment with higher mortgage rates, tight inventory and inflation, home prices have remained elevated and we note that active listings at Realtor improved by 29% in the quarter compared to the prior year period. Realtor remains focused on the long-term opportunities in what is an estimated $200 billion addressable market. As mentioned earlier, the Amazon reset affected many publishers in Q1 including HarperCollins. This reset relates to Amazon's decision to reduce inventory levels and shutter warehouses and accounted for almost the entirety of HarperCollins revenue contraction and the vast majority of its profit decline this quarter. Notably, consumer appetite which expanded during the pandemic continued to be robust and provides us with increasing confidence going forward, and we are absolutely focused on cost control at HarperCollins and the imperative to improve margins in these challenging conditions. Key front list titles in the quarter included Portrait of an Unknown Woman by Daniel Silva, Live Wire by Kelly Ripa and Breaking History by Jared Kushner. We are prospering from our global ownership rights to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, given the popularity of the Amazon series and we are looking forward to the release of The Stories We Tell by Joanna Gaines and Colleen Hoover's next work. Finally, we note that HarperCollins Focus last month acquired Cider Mill Press Book Publishers, an independent publisher of quality gift books. Cider Mill specialize in cooking, wine and spirits and humor books and includes Applesauce Press, a children's brand. Its deep back list should provide an ongoing source of incremental revenue. At subscription video services Foxtel had another strong quarter. Streaming subscriber penetration continues to expand and costs have been thoughtfully controlled. Foxtel has recently renewed or signed valuable long-term sports rights and content agreements including the IFL, WWE and NBC Universal. We have obvious optionality at Foxtel where the conversation is no longer about how much capital we plan to invest, but the potential for capital return. Foxtel streaming services attained 2.8 million paying subscribers as of the end of September, surging 34% versus the prior year, and accounting for 63% of the total paying subscriber base. Kayo and BINGE added nearly three quarters of a million paying subscribers in the past year alone underscoring the potential of Foxtel in a still expanding Australian market. Foxtel Group delivered record audiences for the recent IFL and NRL finals. Meanwhile, Motorsport, the Rugby League World Cup and T-20 World Cup Cricket are bolstering subscriber loyalty as we near the spring selling season. The News Media segment experienced a revenue decline of 4%, though it rose a healthy 6% on an adjusted basis when taking into account Forex fluctuations and other items. In constant currency, we saw healthy growth in advertising, circulation and subscription revenues. At News Corp Australia, circulation revenues improved in constant currency and digital subscriptions exceeded the one million mark for the first time up 13% year-over-year. News.com.au asserted its leadership in the free media environment with an audience of 13 million in the month of September. Meanwhile, the New York Post continued to improve profitability, thanks in part to a strong increase in digital advertising revenues. The Post digital network also flexed its muscles with a 24% increase in page views reaching an average of 129 million per week in Q1 and 151 million average monthly uniques in September. At News UK, The Sun's digital advertising exceeded print for the fourth consecutive quarter and accelerated its growth and we're delighted by the success of the sun.com, which continued to increase its already sizeable audience, particularly in the United States. And The Times Sunday Times also saw a 23% increase in digital paid subscriptions reaching 468,000 marking its second best ever quarter of digital growth. News Broadcasting, the new name for the radio and television brands of News UK reported an increase in both reach and listening hours according to the latest RAJAR's report. Talk Sport reached 2.9 million listeners who tuned in for more than 18 million hours up 10% quarter-on-quarter, and we expect the imminent World Cup to be a source of audiences and of advertising. News Corp is building on a base that has grown stronger, more global, and more digital in recent years. We have seen record profitability in each of the last two fiscal years. By many key measures, our resounding progress has continued. Digital advertising on the rise, streaming surging and subscriptions soaring. Despite the macroeconomic uncertainty, having streamlined and digitized our businesses and reached substantial agreements with the big tech platforms to compensate us for our premium journalism, we are better equipped to generate increasing value to our investors and our strong cash position means that we have been able to return capital to shareholders and invest thoughtfully in future growth while honoring our proud provenance. One last point. As announced last month following the receipt of letters from Rupert Murdoch and the Murdoch Family Trust, the News Corp Board of Directors has formed a special committee of independent Board members to begin exploring a potential combination with Fox Corporation. There can be no certainty that the company will engage in such a transaction. We do not intend to comment further at this time, and for that reason, we will not be taking questions on this topic today. We are of course happy to answer your questions about the performance of and prospects for our business, particularly as it relates to the first quarter of this fiscal year. As always, we thank our investors for their faith and confidence in us and all our employees, advertisers, readers and audiences for their valuable contributions and enduring support. Now I turn to Susan to expound and expand on these results. Ken, look, clearly, the supply chain is a factor. But as for Amazon, it's fair to say, it's ephemeral, not eternal, but meaningful in the first quarter. The combination of both inventory adjustment and warehouse closures clearly created logistic issues, which we trust Amazon will resolve relatively soon. But the demand for books is undiminished, and we certainly have some alluring titles looming including Joanna Gaines and Colleen Hoover. So -- and in the meantime, Brian Murray and his team are resolutely focused on cost control and necessarily improving margins. As for Simon & Schuster, look, clearly, there is much more work ahead for the lawyers at both companies. The legal documents must already run to many volumes themselves. But it is appropriate that the judge rule that the proposed merger would create a book behemoth, literally a leviathan, a titan of terms that would wield disproportionate weight in the industry. For ourselves, we're absolutely resolutely focused on building the HarperCollins business and continuing the integration of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Second part of the question was a little unclear but on digital subs, they were up 13% for both Dow Jones and the Wall Street Journal. Our total subs were up 8% at Dow Jones, 4.9 million and the WSJ, that's 3.8 million. What we're seeing with Dow Jones generally is that we're able to take advantage of a massive audience, which is 116 million monthly uniques and then gradually push people up for the hierarchy of premium products at a premium price. And clearly, as we've taken on more professional information content, the ability to take advantage of that opportunity is realized. And secondly, we believe in vertical bundling. So for example, MarketWatch and WSJ, WSJ and IBD, IBD and Barron's not what you might call horizontal bundling which other companies in indulge in. And there's no doubt that you'll see, over the next 6 months, the virtue of those bundles that Dow Jones has just begun marketing. So we'll be able to update you in succeeding quarters, but we have no doubt that the strategy is a wise one. We are very pleased with the subscription performance at BINGE. And frankly, at Kayo both have around 1.3 million subscribers now. And what we're seeing is very uplifting in the sense that even though the streaming subscription has increased notably, in fact, up 35%. while broadcast ARPU is actually higher. So we're not seeing the feared cannibalization. And what it has done with Foxtel, it's given us optionality, which is a tribute to the toil of Patrick, [Siobhan] (ph) and the team in Australia, we've secured long-term rights, the most watched sports and entertainment in Australia, and they have been working relentlessly to improve the customer experience. And the focus not only on what the customer watches, but how they watch and that's why the churn performance has been so good. Brian, very much so because we see a bright long-term future for Realtor. And that's why we are indeed investing. We're rightly cost-conscious. But whether it's rentals, whether it's the sell side as well as the buyer side, we're continuing to invest in products because there is absolutely no doubt about the long-term opportunity that digital real estate presents in the United States. Well, generally, we're very pleased with the BINGE performance. Bringing in advertising gives us another layer of revenue potential and I have no doubt that as the team does its modeling of that potential that we'll be able to update you in coming quarters as it's unfurled to the market."

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMichael Florin: Thank you very much, Operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's fiscal fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We will open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings release for the applicable periods posted on our website. With that, I will pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\nRobert Thomson: Thank you, Mike. Before we begin the examination of our excellent fourth quarter results, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to all who contributed to the amount of emancipation of Evan Gershkovich. His freedom was made possible by the concerted efforts of concerned principled people who recognized that his incarceration was unjust and immoral. And so many thanks are due to our leaders at Dow Jones, Emma Tucker and Almar Latour and to all at News Corp who campaigned vigorously for Evans release. We also acknowledge the sterling work of the U.S. government, which I oversaw the handover and the role of several other enlightened governments whose divine interventions were crucial. As for the fourth quarter, revenues grew 6% from the prior year to almost $2.6 billion, while profitability improved by a healthy 11% to $380 million, a fourth quarter record for News Corp. Reported EPS and net income were also markedly higher. Moreover, despite the negative impact of high interest rates in some of our businesses, fiscal 2024 was the second best year on record with profitability rising 8% to $1.54 billion. Our core pillars of growth book publishing, Digital Real Estate Services and Dow Jones inspired that increasing profitability and revenue growth, and we believe their strength augurs well for fiscal '25. Prior to delving into the details, I would like to highlight several consequential matters for our company. We took a significant step to prepare for an e-book, which we believe will be defined by the confluence of artificial intelligence and emotional intelligence. Our landmark agreement with OpenAI is not only expected to be lucrative but will enable us to work closely with a trusted preeminent partner to fashion a future for professional journalism and for provenance. That partnership is already fructifying. We have also begun to take legal steps against the Gen AI aggressive, the egregious aggregators who are less principled and more predatory in their confiscation of our content. So-called open source can never be a justification for open slather. We are also considering our legal options in confronting the blatant political bias of advertising industry bodies who have done serious damage and denied many advertisers access to a significant audience. We applaud the work of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee in pursuing the misnomer that is the Global Alliance for Responsible Media or GARM, and its coordinated boycott of media platforms perceived to be unfashionable by illiberal liberals. GARM harm has been real, and there need to be commercial consequences. We believe the company's prospects are patently propitious, and we are also continuing to review our portfolio with a view to maximizing returns for shareholders. That review has coincided recently with third-party interest in a potential transaction involving the Foxtel Group, which has been positively transformed in recent years with record numbers of streaming subscribers, low broadcast churn and rising and broadcast and streaming ARPU. We had no imminent intent to sell Foxtel but are reviewing potential strategic and financial options for the business with our advisers and engaging with third parties in light of that external interest. That process should not be interpreted as a sign that we are not reviewing the status of other segments. As I mentioned, we were not actively looking for purchases and we believe strongly in the potential of Foxtel, given its world-class technology and unique aggregation of sports and entertainment content. With that context, let us analyze the laudable performance in the fourth quarter. Digital real estate had a particularly strong quarter as revenues rose 21% and segment EBITDA surged 25%. That resounding performance was mainly driven by REA, where listings flourished and Financial Services returned to growth, while revenues expanded substantially at REA India. Listings growth continued into July as REA broadened its suite of successful premium products to improve results for clients and lift yields. In the United States, we enhanced both the technology and the offerings to sell and buy-side agents at Realtor.com as we prepare for an upturn in our property market that has been pummeled by high mortgage rates, limited inventory, lofty prices and historically low home sales. While prognostication is not our profession, we are hopeful that interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve are imminent and will have a positive impact on affordability and liquidity in this stagnant market. Certainly, the lesson of the Australian market is that when suppressed demand is emancipated, activity in the housing sector accelerates rapidly and listings prosper. We have already seen sequential improvement in revenue at Realtor.com as the company has taken astute advantage of the complementarity of our media platforms to drive traffic and improve the content experience. There was particular improvement on the sell side, which has become a priority for Realtor.com and which is the core source of revenue for our thriving Australian business. The progress at Dow Jones continues to apace with revenue growth in the quarter of 4% despite a mixed advertising market. At the heart of that growth is the continued strength of B2B, where revenues climbed 14% of Dow Jones Energy and 12% at Risk & Compliance. In fact, fiscal '24 was a pivotal moment in the history of the company. As it was the first year in which more than 50% of Dow Jones profitability was driven by the surging B2B segment. Indeed, it is difficult to overstate the impact of B2B growth on Dow Jones and News Corp over the past four years as B2B revenue has expanded at a compound annual rate of 17% and the margin at Dow Jones has broadened from 15% to 24% while segment EBITDA has more than doubled. Crucially, Digital accounted for 80% of fiscal 2024 segment revenue, up from 67% in 2020. And the core B2B products have renewal rates north of 90%. In that same 4-year span, total subscriptions in the consumer business have burgeoned nearly 55% with digital subs almost doubling. For the fourth quarter, Dow Jones gained 158,000 digital subscribers sequentially and digital advertising expanded 14% year-over-year, more than offsetting the expected declines in print advertising. The quality of Wall Street Journal content continues to be a differentiator as our company signed a valuable multiyear content licensing agreement with the London Stock Exchange Group to provide WSJ news and analysis to its corporate clients, thus building our brand in the European marketplace. HarperCollins reported a notably strong quarter with a more than 250% increase in segment EBITDA to $57 million. As revenue rose 15% to $512 million, reflecting strength in Bible sales in Amazon demand and in audio books, thanks in part to our successful partnership with Spotify. The HarperCollins back catalog continued to perform vibrantly with the Bridgerton collection benefiting from the latest streaming series, while new works like Lucy Foley's The Midnight Feast and Sarah A. Parkers, When the Moon Hatched reached fresh audiences. Overall, digital sales grew 12%. And for the first time, audio books were a largest share of that segment than e-books, soaring by 28% in the quarter. That's right, 28%. There is much to cherish this quarter, including the latest works from best-selling authors, Daniel Silva, Tessa Bailey, Lysa TerKeurst and Jeffrey Archer among others. One interesting sales phenomenon is the resurgence of interest in J.D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy, which sold 150,000 copies in various formats within 24 hours after his selection as Donald Trump's running mate was announced. In July alone, Hillbilly Elegy sold 877,000 units which will have a positive impact on our Q1 results for fiscal 2025. At subscription video services revenue in the quarter grew on both a reported and constant currency basis and streaming strength more than offset broadcast declines. Audiences are continuing to transition from traditional broadcast to over-the-top consumption. We believe Foxtel is particularly well positioned for both subscriber and advertising growth. As Kayo and Binge have gained traction given their unique strengths in sports and entertainment programming. Those two services added almost 200,000 paying subscribers in the quarter and digital advertising now represents more than 40% of Foxtel's total advertising, with Kayo growing 42% compared to the prior year and the recently rolled out ad offering at Binge growing fourfold. We will keep you updated on the advertising renaissance as the quarters unfold. Our launch of the Hubbl service is still in its early days, but encouragingly, more than 30% of Hubbl customers are new to Foxtel, which is significant given our existing presence and profile in the Australian marketplace. About 75% of customers of the Hubbl aggregation service purchased an additional Foxtel product along with their device and subscription. On the broadcast side, ARPU grew 6% and churn was a pleasingly low 11.7% for the quarter. Foxtel continued to generate strong cash flow as we were able to monetize our long-term sports rights across multiple platforms. In News Media, our profile and impact have only grown over the past year when many news organizations lost the plot editorially and commercially. The collapse of old and new media titles is in stark contrast to our mastheads and our journalists. The quality of our journalism was a prime motivator for Sam Altman and his talented team at OpenAI with whom we are genuinely proud to partner. Leaders from both companies have already begun working together to improve the flow of trustworthy information and develop contemporary distribution channels. Those learnings will be deployed in newsrooms around the world to strengthen our journalists understanding of how the digital reading experience is evolving and how we need to adapt to that changed content consciousness. Meanwhile, we are far from complacent and continuing to develop and reform our news media operations. We are in the midst of a restructuring in Australia designed to enhance our digital progress. While the New York Post was once again profitable this year after decades of chronic losses, and we will look to expand its audience and influence and profitability in the coming year. It is worth highlighting that the post reached a monthly digital audience of 117 million unique visitors in June and that News Corp owns two of the top three best-selling print mastheads in the U.S. with The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post. News U.K. under Rebecca Brooks' leadership saw an improved profit contribution for the quarter and the full year. As we benefited from lower newsprint costs, increased digital subscriptions, cover price rises and lower television expenses. Our strong results for the year and record returns for the quarter would not have been possible without the leadership of Lachlan and Rupert Murdoch, the support of our Board and the admirable efforts of our employees around the world. The company's enduring success is built on an honorable tradition of creativity and curiosity and integrity. Our success would also be impossible without the support of our shareholders and we are acutely conscious of our responsibility to generate value and provide robust returns to those who have invested both money and faith in News Corporation. And we are certainly not beholden to pass structures as we confront the future. I now hand you to our CFO, the Sage Susan Panuccio.\nSusan Panuccio: Thank you, Robert, and good afternoon to everyone. As Robert highlighted, our transformation of News Corp continues apace. We have materially grown recurring and digital revenues, added incremental high-margin licensing revenues and focused our reinvestment plans primarily around the core pillars of Book Publishing Digital Real Estate Services and Dow Jones, where we expect the highest rate of returns and shareholder value creation. We continue to deliver cost efficiencies to mitigate inflationary pressures, but more importantly, to allow for investment in growth initiatives across our businesses. This disciplined approach has allowed us to deliver our second best year on record and our strongest ever fiscal fourth quarter profitability. For today's discussion, I will focus on the fourth quarter performance. Fourth quarter total revenues were almost $2.6 billion, up 6% year-over-year, and total segment EBITDA was $380 million, up 11% year-over-year. Margins improved by 70 basis points to 14.7% our core pillars accounted for 87% of News Corp's profits and grew at a robust 28%. Fourth quarter adjusted revenues rose 6% compared to the prior year, while adjusted total segment EBITDA rose 13% versus the prior year. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.09 compared to a $0.01 loss in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.17 in the quarter compared to $0.14 in the prior year. Moving on to the results for the individual segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $448 million, up 21% versus the prior year on both a reported and adjusted basis. Segment EBITDA was $135 million, up 25% as higher profit contribution from the REA Group was partly offset by approximately $11 million of higher costs at Move, a similar increase to the third quarter. Adjusted segment EBITDA grew 28%. REA had another outstanding quarter with revenues rising 37% year-on-year. Growth was driven by a combination of residential yield increases and improved growth in national listings favorable geographic mix and customer contract upgrades. New buy listings rose approximately 16% with Sydney up 26% and Melbourne, up 32%. In addition, REA saw strong growth at Financial Services, which benefited from the absence of a negative valuation adjustment in the prior year and some improvement in settlements, together with higher revenue at REA India. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call for more details. Move's revenues for the quarter of $143 million were down just 2% compared to the prior year as declines continued to moderate from last year. For the quarter, real estate revenues fell 2%, driven by lower referral and lead generation revenues, reflective of the broader macro trends and lower transaction volumes. Lead volume was flat, still constrained by higher mortgage rates, while average monthly unique users for the quarter were also flat versus the prior year at $74 million, but up sequentially 3%. And -- it is worth noting that we have been able to maintain market share according to the MACOM score data. Encouragingly, we are continuing to have notable success diversifying our revenue base with accelerating performance from our sell-side offerings, rentals, which includes our newly formed partnership with Zillow and New Homes. Collectively, those businesses accounted for 19% of revenues in the quarter and grew substantially versus the prior year. As we communicated last quarter, we are focused on best positioning Realtor.com for a housing recovery. Our key strategic focus areas remain the same as we head into the new financial year and include modernizing our technology stack, investing in content for our product offerings, which most recently included the release of a new dynamic mapping feature and leveraging News Corp's network to drive audience share. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $506 million, up 1% compared to the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 2% versus the prior year. Streaming revenues accounted for 32% of circulation and subscription revenues versus 29% in the prior year. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group were nearly $4.7 million at quarter end, up 1% from the prior year. Total paid streaming subscribers reached a record $3.2 million, increasing 5% versus the prior year and accounting for nearly 70% of the total paying subscriber base. With Kayo adding 108,000 subscribers and Binge adding 76,000 compared to the prior quarter. This speaks to the success of our winter sports codes and strong entertainment content. Foxtel ended the quarter with over 1.2 million residential broadcast subscribers, down 10% year-over-year. Broadcast churn was 11.7% versus 11.1% in the prior year, but down from over 13% last quarter, while broadcast ARPU rose 6% to AUD90, benefiting from new pricing and packaging plans implemented in March. As a result, broadcast revenues declined at the lowest rate in constant currency in over five years. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $74 million was down only $4 million or 5% versus the prior year, despite including approximately $28 million of costs related to Hubbl for devices and marketing. Excluding the Hubbl investment, Foxtel's profitability would have been higher for the quarter. For the quarter, adjusted segment EBITDA fell 4%. Moving on to Dow Jones. Fourth quarter results were again strong at Dow Jones with revenues of $566 million, up 4% year-over-year with digital revenue accounting for 81% of total revenues this quarter, up two percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription-based revenues represented 79% of total revenues, again reinforcing the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. We continue to see strong growth at PIB with revenues rising 8% year-over-year, including 12% growth at Risk & Compliance to $76 million and 14% growth at Dow Jones Energy to $65 million. At Risk & Compliance, demand remained strong from new and existing customers with notable success in new products, including advanced media screening and financial instruments. From a customer mix perspective, corporate customers remain the fastest growth segment, growing over 20% and accounting for 45% of our customer base. At Dow Jones Energy, revenue in the quarter continued to benefit from the pricing review together with the launch of a number of new products and benchmarks. Overall, retention remains strong at approximately 90%. Within the Dow Jones consumer business, Circulation revenues rose 1% versus the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions improving by 16% year-over-year and higher by 158,000 sequentially. Bundling accounted for approximately 40% of the sequential digital-only volume growth in Q4. ARPU was stable sequentially as the introductory pricing is starting to rise and the subscribers acquired over the past year have started to migrate to higher pricing. Advertising revenues increased 2% to $102 million, marking the first quarter of year-over-year growth since the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Digital advertising improved 12%, and that marked the strongest growth since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, principally due to a rebound in the technology category. Print remained challenged down 13% and broadly consistent with recent quarters. Digital represented 66% of advertising revenues, up from 60% last year. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 3% to $137 million and was again the largest segment EBITDA contributor across the company. As expected, expenses were higher this quarter, reflective of the phasing of marketing and higher employee costs, which includes a retro payment related to the ratification of a new union agreement. The Dow Jones segment finished as the highest contributor to full year company revenue in financial year '24 for the first time and the highest contributor to total segment EBITDA for the second consecutive year. At Book Publishing, the fourth quarter delivered very strong results and capped a robust turnaround for the full year at HarperCollins, which benefited from normalization of customer demand, strong Amazon sales, moderating inflationary pressure and upswing in digital revenues and much lower return rates. Revenues were $512 million, up 15%, while segment EBITDA improved over 250% to $57 million driven by strong top line growth, coupled with easy comparisons in the prior year. That said, HarperCollins nearly matched its highest fourth quarter revenue on record and achieved its highest fourth quarter profitability since 2018 underscoring that the performance clearly wasn't just a function of easy comparisons. The backlist contributed 62% of consumer revenues, up from 59% last year, while digital sales rose 12%, reaching 24% of consumer sales. Audio books rose 28% in part helped by the recent Spotify partnership at increased promotions from Audible, which led to audio books exceeding e-books for the first time this quarter. Turning to News Media, Performance was mixed with News U.K. posting an improved performance for the quarter, which was more than offset by challenging conditions at News Corp Australia. Revenues for the quarter were $545 million, down 5% versus the prior year, while adjusted revenues fell 4%. Circulation and subscription revenue fell 3% on a reported and constant currency basis due to lower print volumes in the absence of meta-revenues in Australia, which more than offset cover price increases and digital subscriber growth. Advertising was down 5% on a reported basis and 4% in constant currency, with U.K. digital advertising more challenged due to the continued impact from platform algorithm changes. As our news media businesses face ongoing print challenges, they continue to focus on their transition to digital revenues and ongoing cost efficiencies. Segment EBITDA of $28 million declined $17 million or 38%, which was attributed to challenges at News Australia, including higher newsprint prices. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 38%. Turning to the outlook. Market trends remain mixed geographically. However, we exited the fiscal fourth quarter with total segment EBITDA growth, and we hope to see improvements again in fiscal 2025. Some themes across each of our segments. At Digital Real Estate, Australian residential new buy listings for July are up 12%, although the listing volume increase benefited from two additional working days. REA should benefit from an average 10% price increase in Premier Plus that has been successfully implemented. Year-over-year growth rates for fiscal 2025 will reflect strong prior period listing volumes, particularly for Melbourne and Sydney. Move plans to continue with their investment strategy focused on technology improvements and enhanced content and product offerings. We hope to see some revenue improvements given expected interest rate cuts and continued growth from adjacencies. We will be closely monitoring the impact from the implementation of the new buyer agent rules, but we believe we are well placed to benefit from the expected market recovery given the scale of our audience, the quality of our leads and expansion of our adjacencies. At subscription video services, we plan to continue to scale streaming products while retaining high-value broadcast customers through improved ARPU and churn measures. While we anticipate the rate of investment at Hubbl to be lower in fiscal 2025, we do expect modestly higher programming costs related to sports rights escalators. At Dow Jones, we will remain focused on B2B growth, including upselling and new products across Risk & Compliance and Dow Jones Energy. We expect to see improved circulation revenue growth through digital subscription step-up pricing, and we'll be monitoring those trends very closely. While we expect the rate of expenses to be moderately higher year-over-year due to investment, notably in B2B, we will continue to focus on cost efficiencies to drive growth. At Book Publishing, we have seen strong momentum from the backlist in July, including a resurgence from J.D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy and are very pleased with the partnership with Spotify, which is driving increased competition in audio books. We hope to see further profit improvements in 2025, albeit likely at a much more modest rate given more normalized prior year comparisons. At News Media, the advertising market remains challenging, and the businesses will continue to focus on enhancing first-party data offerings with an emphasis on video to drive higher-quality advertising. We expect the segment to benefit from lower Talk TV costs together with savings associated with the new commercial printing joint venture in the U.K. and ongoing operational efficiencies will remain a focus. We will see new revenue from our OpenAI partnerships in fiscal 2025 reflected in the Dow Jones and News Media segments. We expect CapEx in fiscal 2025 to be moderately higher than in fiscal 2024, primarily due to digital reinvestment in our growth pillars. With that, let me hand it over to the Operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Karnovsky from JPMorgan. Please unmute your line and ask your question.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hi, thank you. Robert, on the Foxtel third-party interest, can you say anything about the nature of the transaction that's being contemplated? And are you engaged with one or multiple parties. It was a little unclear for your remarks. And then how does the potential interest here complicate the thinking or maybe even the timeline behind kind of the broader process of the strategic review?\nRobert Thomson: Well, David, you can see from my earlier statement that there are various processes in motion. We have had an overture a significant overdue, which we're naturally assessing -- but let me make absolutely clear that we have full faith in the potential of Foxtel and our talented team at Foxtel who've fashioned a world-class viewing experience and created Kayo, which really is the best at streaming platform globally, hence the interest in emulating its success in the U.S. But on behalf of shareholders, we obviously have to evaluate any interest knowing that we are ourselves further Foxtel fans. I mean the streaming business is surging and broadcast ARPU in the most recent quarter was 6% higher than a year earlier. But secondly, strategically, we have been undertaking a broad review of our portfolio and its potential in the quest to increase shareholder value. Now that review continues apace. But on that particular matter, you'll have to stay tuned, but not indefinitely, not perpetually not at infinitum.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, David. Leila, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kane Hannan from Goldman Sachs. Please unmute your line and ask your question.\nKane Hannan: Morning, guys. Just to deal with OpenAI. I mean your patents were talking about US$250 over five years. Is there any more color or things you can talk about around that deal that would help us I mean particularly, so how much of that value in the deal was around the back catalog, which may not need to be renewed in five years' time versus for the ongoing content production?\nRobert Thomson: Okay. And we really can't go into the precise details, but you will be able to see the impact in our news businesses. It's tangible, it's meaningful. The way to regard the OpenAI agreement is that there will be a guaranteed amount and the two companies will be working to create products that generate even more value for both companies. The OpenAI team under Sam Altman has a sophisticated sense of how to productize profitably and with principal. And neither of those qualities are given with all Gen AI players, some of whom are merely content carpetbaggers.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Kane. Leila, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Entcho Raykovski from Evans & Partners. Please go ahead.\nEntcho Raykovski: Hi, Robert. Hi, Susan. I've got a Foxtel transaction question as well. I mean assuming some sort of Foxtel transaction goes ahead, do you still expect to be able to recoup all of the Foxtel shareholder loans? And if you can remind us how much is still outstanding. I think that would be quite helpful in relation to those loans. And I mean, I appreciate there's only so much you can say, but is that a trade or financial buyer that's most interested? What do you, I mean, what do you think is the most likely identity of the buyer that ends up coming through?\nRobert Thomson: Well, look, Entcho, as for Foxtel, we just want to be sure that the process is full and fair and to reassure our cherished colleagues that the external interest should be seen as a clear vote of confidence in what they have achieved and how they have positively transformed the company. I mean you recall the skepticism about Foxtel's fate four or five years ago. that skepticism has become optimism and the company's performance has obviously caught the eye at the discerning eye, dare I say, others, who not only see a great company, but in these turbulent troubled times, an expanding market like Australia, which offers regulatory certainty and ongoing economic opportunity.\nSusan Panuccio: And Entcho, just in relation to the shareholder loans, they're just shy of $600 million outstanding at the moment. And clearly, any transaction would contemplate what we do with those loans.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Entcho. Leila, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Han from Morningstar.\nBrian Han: Good morning. You guys have been investing in Move for some time now, yet the traffic numbers for Realtor.com continued to be pretty stagnant. So will there be any changes in the kind of investments you'll be making in move?\nRobert Thomson: Brian, our unique users in Q4 were 3% higher sequentially at $74 million, even though the market itself is sluggish and the competition is more intense. But the most important thing to bear in mind with Realtors that Damian and the team have been doing a vast amount of work in improving the tech, the experience. And so they're poised with poised, I say, given that the market does seem on the cusp of a revival. And as mentioned earlier, we've seen from our Australian experience that an extended period of suppressed demand can lead to almost an explosion in activity as families can finally afford to make the moves that they've been delaying. And once those movements start, there will be more liquidity, which of itself stimulates further demand. Have to say that Damian has done an excellent job in taking full advantage of our media platforms to raise the profile of Realtor and drive traffic. And there's much anticipation, excitement at Realtor. And in particular, because the revenue of the newer product lines, seller, for example, is markedly higher than a year ago. The U.S. has traditionally been a bio-led market, but the Australian market where we've had stunning success with REA is a seller market. So we're pleased to see that growth trend here. And we're also pleased to see today that 30-year mortgage rates dropped to a 15-month low to 6.47%. Now it's fair to presume that rate will continue to fall over time. And historically, there's been a corresponding increase in housing activity.\nSusan Panuccio: And Brian, to that end, and to what Robert was saying, we will keep investing in the business because we believe in the business. We expect the cost increases to be modest for the full year, with the increases more weighted to the second half. but you can expect that the dollar value of those increments are going to be less than the dollar value of the increments that you saw in Q3 and Q4 of this year.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Brian. Leila, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darren Leung from Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nDarren Leung: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the opportunity and congrats on the good results. My question was just in relation to Foxtel maybe just on the operational side. Robert, you made some comments about the improvement in Foxtel thus far. I guess when I think about the Investor Day in 2021, there were sort of three major aspirational targets, subscribers, revenue, sort of CapEx targets, things like -- sort of hit 2024, and we're just a little bit share of those targets. I guess I'm keen to hear if there's any update in terms of how you're thinking about those new targets either from a commentative perspective or from a timeline perspective, particularly in light of the strategic new.\nRobert Thomson: Darren, we can't really reveal any more figures than we already have today. But our ambitions for Foxtel are undaunted. And I think what is particularly striking is that you're seeing growth in the streaming business. while combined with about 6% increase in ARPU in the Broadcast segment. So you're not seeing the fundamentally fatal contradictions that you are at some broadcasting companies in other parts of the world, which is why no doubt, the success of Kayo, the success of Binge, the emerging success of Hubbl have attracted a certain amount of attention.\nSusan Panuccio: And Darren, since we had that Investor Day, I mean, it's fair to say that the landscape has changed materially over the last couple of years. But we're really proud of the fact that the streaming subscribers are an all-time high. We have been taking price across our broadcast and our streaming products in order to focus on that revenue growth. And our CapEx, notwithstanding the investment in Hubbl in the current year, it has been coming down. So I think we feel pretty good about those targets that we put out there.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Darren. Leila, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lucy Huang from UBS. Please unmute your line.\nLucy Huang: Hi, Robert, and hi, Susan. So my question is on cost as well coming into FY '25. I mean I think this year, we've seen pretty strong cost control across the business. Just wondering how we should be thinking about the cost momentum into '25. I note that recently, you made some changes in the Australian business as well to take some cost out. So just wondering if we can go through some puts and takes?\nSusan Panuccio: Look, we talk about this each quarter. I think we feel pretty good about our cost cadence. Clearly, it's going to be different depending on the segments that we operate in. We're just talking about Realtor expecting that whilst they will still focus on cost efficiencies there's likely to be reinvestment in that segment. Within News Media, we have sort of got a little bit ahead of the game in that the U.K. has done their transition from linear of Talk TV and the commercial joint venture printing venture that we've mentioned. So that will give them some good cost savings coming into '25. And as you mentioned, News Corp Australia has restructured down there. So that will also give some added momentum going into the new year. We expect across Dow Jones that costs would increase probably mid-single digits. That's pretty consistent with what we saw this year, and that supports the fact that, that business is growing, particularly on the B2B side of the business. And HarperCollins really their costs have started to stabilize off the back of a pretty choppy couple of years. And so we expect that the margins of that business will be broadly consistent as we go into 2025.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Lucy. Leila, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alan Gould from Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nAlan Gould: Thank you. I've got two questions, please. First, Robert, how is signing the OpenAI deal impacting your negotiations with other Gen AI companies? And my second question is, both you and Susan in the press release discussed the divisions -- the three divisions that are the pillars of growth, it makes one thing when we have the other two divisions. Now Foxtel may take care of itself. And I don't know if Rupert and Lalchan are on the call, but I know that News Media is sort of the genesis of the company. But you see it'd be simpler and the company would be growing quicker without those two divisions? So just your thoughts on those two questions. Thank you.\nRobert Thomson: Well, Alan I'll take the second question first. We're constantly reviewing our structure. We're very proud of all the divisions and the growth that we're seeing across the majority of them over the past quarter and the past year, you can see from yourself from new accounts. As for OpenAI, we have made clear in the past that we would prefer to we rather than to sue to negotiate rather than to litigate. But for some, the process of seeing has started. Now sometimes the threat of suing can be a precursor to wing, but we will surely see the upcoming coming months.\nSusan Panuccio: And Alan, just to add just on News Media, we have been really focusing on that segment in order to keep that segment stable and transition to digital. They've faced enormous headwinds since we separated. And the businesses have actually done an enormous job in light of the huge print declines that we've seen across those businesses. And those businesses also provide a valuable audience that we use across the rest of the portfolio. They've really helped REA with advertising from a marketing perspective, they help audience growth across Move. They've helped support Foxtel with some of the marketing efforts down in Australia. And so -- we do utilize those segments in a broader way across the portfolio.\nRobert Thomson: And just to reinforce that point, for example, at the New York Post, we have 117 million monthly uniques. There's content complementarity with Realtor. That's true for many of our media properties around the world, the combination between our news media properties in Australia and REA and Foxtel. So these companies together far more than the sum of the parts.\nSusan Panuccio: And the content is hugely valuable when we think about these content deals that we're doing across the business. They have valuable archives that go back hundreds of years that are hugely important to us.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Alan. Leila, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research. Please go ahead.\nCraig Huber: Yes hi, thank you. Robert, I just wanted to ask you if I asking you in prior calls about the simplifying the company, obviously, almost nine months to the day, you made the formal public announcement of looking at the process of simplifying the company we're here nine months later. When I asked you three months ago, you sort of hinted that part of the holdup here with on the regulatory side of things and stuff. I guess my question, honestly, is why was that not anticipated? And also, why would -- did you guys go public with your thoughts that you want to simplify the company nine months? I suppose to just wait longer here and do more homework in the background. Because you talked about before, you did a lot of work on this before you made the public announcement, and we're still sitting on nine months later. I know a lot of investors are quite eager to see a simplification of the company here, and so we're sitting here nine months into it. It doesn't sound like it's around the quarter. I don't know that for sure, but I guess my question is how much longer is this going to -- the process is going to take? I know it's a complicated company, but is it just simple just the regulatory side of things is what slowing this whole thing down.\nRobert Thomson: Thank you, Craig. We're constantly institutionally in perspective, we've obviously been engaged in the process. And as I indicated earlier, that process will not continue indefinitely nor perpetually. But we have actually already completed a significant amount of regulatory work to make possible that kind of introspection. But we cannot give you a specific date. We can assure you that there's much effort going on. And obviously, that effort now coincides with interest in Foxtel, that process has to play out in in a full and fair manner for all concerned. But clearly, there will be a certain amount of tension on that in coming weeks and coming days.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Craig. Leila, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: At this time, we have no further questions. I'll now hand over to Michael Florin for closing remarks.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Leila, and thank you all for participating. Have a wonderful day, and we will talk to you soon. Take care.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Susan Panuccio",
            "content": "Thank you, Robert, and good afternoon to everyone. As Robert highlighted, our transformation of News Corp continues apace. We have materially grown recurring and digital revenues, added incremental high-margin licensing revenues and focused our reinvestment plans primarily around the core pillars of Book Publishing Digital Real Estate Services and Dow Jones, where we expect the highest rate of returns and shareholder value creation. We continue to deliver cost efficiencies to mitigate inflationary pressures, but more importantly, to allow for investment in growth initiatives across our businesses. This disciplined approach has allowed us to deliver our second best year on record and our strongest ever fiscal fourth quarter profitability. For today's discussion, I will focus on the fourth quarter performance. Fourth quarter total revenues were almost $2.6 billion, up 6% year-over-year, and total segment EBITDA was $380 million, up 11% year-over-year. Margins improved by 70 basis points to 14.7% our core pillars accounted for 87% of News Corp's profits and grew at a robust 28%. Fourth quarter adjusted revenues rose 6% compared to the prior year, while adjusted total segment EBITDA rose 13% versus the prior year. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.09 compared to a $0.01 loss in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.17 in the quarter compared to $0.14 in the prior year. Moving on to the results for the individual segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $448 million, up 21% versus the prior year on both a reported and adjusted basis. Segment EBITDA was $135 million, up 25% as higher profit contribution from the REA Group was partly offset by approximately $11 million of higher costs at Move, a similar increase to the third quarter. Adjusted segment EBITDA grew 28%. REA had another outstanding quarter with revenues rising 37% year-on-year. Growth was driven by a combination of residential yield increases and improved growth in national listings favorable geographic mix and customer contract upgrades. New buy listings rose approximately 16% with Sydney up 26% and Melbourne, up 32%. In addition, REA saw strong growth at Financial Services, which benefited from the absence of a negative valuation adjustment in the prior year and some improvement in settlements, together with higher revenue at REA India. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call for more details. Move's revenues for the quarter of $143 million were down just 2% compared to the prior year as declines continued to moderate from last year. For the quarter, real estate revenues fell 2%, driven by lower referral and lead generation revenues, reflective of the broader macro trends and lower transaction volumes. Lead volume was flat, still constrained by higher mortgage rates, while average monthly unique users for the quarter were also flat versus the prior year at $74 million, but up sequentially 3%. And -- it is worth noting that we have been able to maintain market share according to the MACOM score data. Encouragingly, we are continuing to have notable success diversifying our revenue base with accelerating performance from our sell-side offerings, rentals, which includes our newly formed partnership with Zillow and New Homes. Collectively, those businesses accounted for 19% of revenues in the quarter and grew substantially versus the prior year. As we communicated last quarter, we are focused on best positioning Realtor.com for a housing recovery. Our key strategic focus areas remain the same as we head into the new financial year and include modernizing our technology stack, investing in content for our product offerings, which most recently included the release of a new dynamic mapping feature and leveraging News Corp's network to drive audience share. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $506 million, up 1% compared to the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 2% versus the prior year. Streaming revenues accounted for 32% of circulation and subscription revenues versus 29% in the prior year. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group were nearly $4.7 million at quarter end, up 1% from the prior year. Total paid streaming subscribers reached a record $3.2 million, increasing 5% versus the prior year and accounting for nearly 70% of the total paying subscriber base. With Kayo adding 108,000 subscribers and Binge adding 76,000 compared to the prior quarter. This speaks to the success of our winter sports codes and strong entertainment content. Foxtel ended the quarter with over 1.2 million residential broadcast subscribers, down 10% year-over-year. Broadcast churn was 11.7% versus 11.1% in the prior year, but down from over 13% last quarter, while broadcast ARPU rose 6% to AUD90, benefiting from new pricing and packaging plans implemented in March. As a result, broadcast revenues declined at the lowest rate in constant currency in over five years. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $74 million was down only $4 million or 5% versus the prior year, despite including approximately $28 million of costs related to Hubbl for devices and marketing. Excluding the Hubbl investment, Foxtel's profitability would have been higher for the quarter. For the quarter, adjusted segment EBITDA fell 4%. Moving on to Dow Jones. Fourth quarter results were again strong at Dow Jones with revenues of $566 million, up 4% year-over-year with digital revenue accounting for 81% of total revenues this quarter, up two percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription-based revenues represented 79% of total revenues, again reinforcing the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. We continue to see strong growth at PIB with revenues rising 8% year-over-year, including 12% growth at Risk & Compliance to $76 million and 14% growth at Dow Jones Energy to $65 million. At Risk & Compliance, demand remained strong from new and existing customers with notable success in new products, including advanced media screening and financial instruments. From a customer mix perspective, corporate customers remain the fastest growth segment, growing over 20% and accounting for 45% of our customer base. At Dow Jones Energy, revenue in the quarter continued to benefit from the pricing review together with the launch of a number of new products and benchmarks. Overall, retention remains strong at approximately 90%. Within the Dow Jones consumer business, Circulation revenues rose 1% versus the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions improving by 16% year-over-year and higher by 158,000 sequentially. Bundling accounted for approximately 40% of the sequential digital-only volume growth in Q4. ARPU was stable sequentially as the introductory pricing is starting to rise and the subscribers acquired over the past year have started to migrate to higher pricing. Advertising revenues increased 2% to $102 million, marking the first quarter of year-over-year growth since the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Digital advertising improved 12%, and that marked the strongest growth since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, principally due to a rebound in the technology category. Print remained challenged down 13% and broadly consistent with recent quarters. Digital represented 66% of advertising revenues, up from 60% last year. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 3% to $137 million and was again the largest segment EBITDA contributor across the company. As expected, expenses were higher this quarter, reflective of the phasing of marketing and higher employee costs, which includes a retro payment related to the ratification of a new union agreement. The Dow Jones segment finished as the highest contributor to full year company revenue in financial year '24 for the first time and the highest contributor to total segment EBITDA for the second consecutive year. At Book Publishing, the fourth quarter delivered very strong results and capped a robust turnaround for the full year at HarperCollins, which benefited from normalization of customer demand, strong Amazon sales, moderating inflationary pressure and upswing in digital revenues and much lower return rates. Revenues were $512 million, up 15%, while segment EBITDA improved over 250% to $57 million driven by strong top line growth, coupled with easy comparisons in the prior year. That said, HarperCollins nearly matched its highest fourth quarter revenue on record and achieved its highest fourth quarter profitability since 2018 underscoring that the performance clearly wasn't just a function of easy comparisons. The backlist contributed 62% of consumer revenues, up from 59% last year, while digital sales rose 12%, reaching 24% of consumer sales. Audio books rose 28% in part helped by the recent Spotify partnership at increased promotions from Audible, which led to audio books exceeding e-books for the first time this quarter. Turning to News Media, Performance was mixed with News U.K. posting an improved performance for the quarter, which was more than offset by challenging conditions at News Corp Australia. Revenues for the quarter were $545 million, down 5% versus the prior year, while adjusted revenues fell 4%. Circulation and subscription revenue fell 3% on a reported and constant currency basis due to lower print volumes in the absence of meta-revenues in Australia, which more than offset cover price increases and digital subscriber growth. Advertising was down 5% on a reported basis and 4% in constant currency, with U.K. digital advertising more challenged due to the continued impact from platform algorithm changes. As our news media businesses face ongoing print challenges, they continue to focus on their transition to digital revenues and ongoing cost efficiencies. Segment EBITDA of $28 million declined $17 million or 38%, which was attributed to challenges at News Australia, including higher newsprint prices. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 38%. Turning to the outlook. Market trends remain mixed geographically. However, we exited the fiscal fourth quarter with total segment EBITDA growth, and we hope to see improvements again in fiscal 2025. Some themes across each of our segments. At Digital Real Estate, Australian residential new buy listings for July are up 12%, although the listing volume increase benefited from two additional working days. REA should benefit from an average 10% price increase in Premier Plus that has been successfully implemented. Year-over-year growth rates for fiscal 2025 will reflect strong prior period listing volumes, particularly for Melbourne and Sydney. Move plans to continue with their investment strategy focused on technology improvements and enhanced content and product offerings. We hope to see some revenue improvements given expected interest rate cuts and continued growth from adjacencies. We will be closely monitoring the impact from the implementation of the new buyer agent rules, but we believe we are well placed to benefit from the expected market recovery given the scale of our audience, the quality of our leads and expansion of our adjacencies. At subscription video services, we plan to continue to scale streaming products while retaining high-value broadcast customers through improved ARPU and churn measures. While we anticipate the rate of investment at Hubbl to be lower in fiscal 2025, we do expect modestly higher programming costs related to sports rights escalators. At Dow Jones, we will remain focused on B2B growth, including upselling and new products across Risk & Compliance and Dow Jones Energy. We expect to see improved circulation revenue growth through digital subscription step-up pricing, and we'll be monitoring those trends very closely. While we expect the rate of expenses to be moderately higher year-over-year due to investment, notably in B2B, we will continue to focus on cost efficiencies to drive growth. At Book Publishing, we have seen strong momentum from the backlist in July, including a resurgence from J.D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy and are very pleased with the partnership with Spotify, which is driving increased competition in audio books. We hope to see further profit improvements in 2025, albeit likely at a much more modest rate given more normalized prior year comparisons. At News Media, the advertising market remains challenging, and the businesses will continue to focus on enhancing first-party data offerings with an emphasis on video to drive higher-quality advertising. We expect the segment to benefit from lower Talk TV costs together with savings associated with the new commercial printing joint venture in the U.K. and ongoing operational efficiencies will remain a focus. We will see new revenue from our OpenAI partnerships in fiscal 2025 reflected in the Dow Jones and News Media segments. We expect CapEx in fiscal 2025 to be moderately higher than in fiscal 2024, primarily due to digital reinvestment in our growth pillars. With that, let me hand it over to the Operator for Q&A. And Entcho, just in relation to the shareholder loans, they're just shy of $600 million outstanding at the moment. And clearly, any transaction would contemplate what we do with those loans. And Brian, to that end, and to what Robert was saying, we will keep investing in the business because we believe in the business. We expect the cost increases to be modest for the full year, with the increases more weighted to the second half. but you can expect that the dollar value of those increments are going to be less than the dollar value of the increments that you saw in Q3 and Q4 of this year. And Darren, since we had that Investor Day, I mean, it's fair to say that the landscape has changed materially over the last couple of years. But we're really proud of the fact that the streaming subscribers are an all-time high. We have been taking price across our broadcast and our streaming products in order to focus on that revenue growth. And our CapEx, notwithstanding the investment in Hubbl in the current year, it has been coming down. So I think we feel pretty good about those targets that we put out there. Look, we talk about this each quarter. I think we feel pretty good about our cost cadence. Clearly, it's going to be different depending on the segments that we operate in. We're just talking about Realtor expecting that whilst they will still focus on cost efficiencies there's likely to be reinvestment in that segment. Within News Media, we have sort of got a little bit ahead of the game in that the U.K. has done their transition from linear of Talk TV and the commercial joint venture printing venture that we've mentioned. So that will give them some good cost savings coming into '25. And as you mentioned, News Corp Australia has restructured down there. So that will also give some added momentum going into the new year. We expect across Dow Jones that costs would increase probably mid-single digits. That's pretty consistent with what we saw this year, and that supports the fact that, that business is growing, particularly on the B2B side of the business.

            "name": "Robert Thomson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Before we begin the examination of our excellent fourth quarter results, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to all who contributed to the amount of emancipation of Evan Gershkovich. His freedom was made possible by the concerted efforts of concerned principled people who recognized that his incarceration was unjust and immoral. And so many thanks are due to our leaders at Dow Jones, Emma Tucker and Almar Latour and to all at News Corp who campaigned vigorously for Evans release. We also acknowledge the sterling work of the U.S. government, which I oversaw the handover and the role of several other enlightened governments whose divine interventions were crucial. As for the fourth quarter, revenues grew 6% from the prior year to almost $2.6 billion, while profitability improved by a healthy 11% to $380 million, a fourth quarter record for News Corp. Reported EPS and net income were also markedly higher. Moreover, despite the negative impact of high interest rates in some of our businesses, fiscal 2024 was the second best year on record with profitability rising 8% to $1.54 billion. Our core pillars of growth book publishing, Digital Real Estate Services and Dow Jones inspired that increasing profitability and revenue growth, and we believe their strength augurs well for fiscal '25. Prior to delving into the details, I would like to highlight several consequential matters for our company. We took a significant step to prepare for an e-book, which we believe will be defined by the confluence of artificial intelligence and emotional intelligence. Our landmark agreement with OpenAI is not only expected to be lucrative but will enable us to work closely with a trusted preeminent partner to fashion a future for professional journalism and for provenance. That partnership is already fructifying. We have also begun to take legal steps against the Gen AI aggressive, the egregious aggregators who are less principled and more predatory in their confiscation of our content. So-called open source can never be a justification for open slather. We are also considering our legal options in confronting the blatant political bias of advertising industry bodies who have done serious damage and denied many advertisers access to a significant audience. We applaud the work of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee in pursuing the misnomer that is the Global Alliance for Responsible Media or GARM, and its coordinated boycott of media platforms perceived to be unfashionable by illiberal liberals. GARM harm has been real, and there need to be commercial consequences. We believe the company's prospects are patently propitious, and we are also continuing to review our portfolio with a view to maximizing returns for shareholders. That review has coincided recently with third-party interest in a potential transaction involving the Foxtel Group, which has been positively transformed in recent years with record numbers of streaming subscribers, low broadcast churn and rising and broadcast and streaming ARPU. We had no imminent intent to sell Foxtel but are reviewing potential strategic and financial options for the business with our advisers and engaging with third parties in light of that external interest. That process should not be interpreted as a sign that we are not reviewing the status of other segments. As I mentioned, we were not actively looking for purchases and we believe strongly in the potential of Foxtel, given its world-class technology and unique aggregation of sports and entertainment content. With that context, let us analyze the laudable performance in the fourth quarter. Digital real estate had a particularly strong quarter as revenues rose 21% and segment EBITDA surged 25%. That resounding performance was mainly driven by REA, where listings flourished and Financial Services returned to growth, while revenues expanded substantially at REA India. Listings growth continued into July as REA broadened its suite of successful premium products to improve results for clients and lift yields. In the United States, we enhanced both the technology and the offerings to sell and buy-side agents at Realtor.com as we prepare for an upturn in our property market that has been pummeled by high mortgage rates, limited inventory, lofty prices and historically low home sales. While prognostication is not our profession, we are hopeful that interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve are imminent and will have a positive impact on affordability and liquidity in this stagnant market. Certainly, the lesson of the Australian market is that when suppressed demand is emancipated, activity in the housing sector accelerates rapidly and listings prosper. We have already seen sequential improvement in revenue at Realtor.com as the company has taken astute advantage of the complementarity of our media platforms to drive traffic and improve the content experience. There was particular improvement on the sell side, which has become a priority for Realtor.com and which is the core source of revenue for our thriving Australian business. The progress at Dow Jones continues to apace with revenue growth in the quarter of 4% despite a mixed advertising market. At the heart of that growth is the continued strength of B2B, where revenues climbed 14% of Dow Jones Energy and 12% at Risk & Compliance. In fact, fiscal '24 was a pivotal moment in the history of the company. As it was the first year in which more than 50% of Dow Jones profitability was driven by the surging B2B segment. Indeed, it is difficult to overstate the impact of B2B growth on Dow Jones and News Corp over the past four years as B2B revenue has expanded at a compound annual rate of 17% and the margin at Dow Jones has broadened from 15% to 24% while segment EBITDA has more than doubled. Crucially, Digital accounted for 80% of fiscal 2024 segment revenue, up from 67% in 2020. And the core B2B products have renewal rates north of 90%. In that same 4-year span, total subscriptions in the consumer business have burgeoned nearly 55% with digital subs almost doubling. For the fourth quarter, Dow Jones gained 158,000 digital subscribers sequentially and digital advertising expanded 14% year-over-year, more than offsetting the expected declines in print advertising. The quality of Wall Street Journal content continues to be a differentiator as our company signed a valuable multiyear content licensing agreement with the London Stock Exchange Group to provide WSJ news and analysis to its corporate clients, thus building our brand in the European marketplace. HarperCollins reported a notably strong quarter with a more than 250% increase in segment EBITDA to $57 million. As revenue rose 15% to $512 million, reflecting strength in Bible sales in Amazon demand and in audio books, thanks in part to our successful partnership with Spotify. The HarperCollins back catalog continued to perform vibrantly with the Bridgerton collection benefiting from the latest streaming series, while new works like Lucy Foley's The Midnight Feast and Sarah A. Parkers, When the Moon Hatched reached fresh audiences. Overall, digital sales grew 12%. And for the first time, audio books were a largest share of that segment than e-books, soaring by 28% in the quarter. That's right, 28%. There is much to cherish this quarter, including the latest works from best-selling authors, Daniel Silva, Tessa Bailey, Lysa TerKeurst and Jeffrey Archer among others. One interesting sales phenomenon is the resurgence of interest in J.D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy, which sold 150,000 copies in various formats within 24 hours after his selection as Donald Trump's running mate was announced. In July alone, Hillbilly Elegy sold 877,000 units which will have a positive impact on our Q1 results for fiscal 2025. At subscription video services revenue in the quarter grew on both a reported and constant currency basis and streaming strength more than offset broadcast declines. Audiences are continuing to transition from traditional broadcast to over-the-top consumption. We believe Foxtel is particularly well positioned for both subscriber and advertising growth. As Kayo and Binge have gained traction given their unique strengths in sports and entertainment programming. Those two services added almost 200,000 paying subscribers in the quarter and digital advertising now represents more than 40% of Foxtel's total advertising, with Kayo growing 42% compared to the prior year and the recently rolled out ad offering at Binge growing fourfold. We will keep you updated on the advertising renaissance as the quarters unfold. Our launch of the Hubbl service is still in its early days, but encouragingly, more than 30% of Hubbl customers are new to Foxtel, which is significant given our existing presence and profile in the Australian marketplace. About 75% of customers of the Hubbl aggregation service purchased an additional Foxtel product along with their device and subscription. On the broadcast side, ARPU grew 6% and churn was a pleasingly low 11.7% for the quarter. Foxtel continued to generate strong cash flow as we were able to monetize our long-term sports rights across multiple platforms. In News Media, our profile and impact have only grown over the past year when many news organizations lost the plot editorially and commercially. The collapse of old and new media titles is in stark contrast to our mastheads and our journalists. The quality of our journalism was a prime motivator for Sam Altman and his talented team at OpenAI with whom we are genuinely proud to partner. Leaders from both companies have already begun working together to improve the flow of trustworthy information and develop contemporary distribution channels. Those learnings will be deployed in newsrooms around the world to strengthen our journalists understanding of how the digital reading experience is evolving and how we need to adapt to that changed content consciousness. Meanwhile, we are far from complacent and continuing to develop and reform our news media operations. We are in the midst of a restructuring in Australia designed to enhance our digital progress. While the New York Post was once again profitable this year after decades of chronic losses, and we will look to expand its audience and influence and profitability in the coming year. It is worth highlighting that the post reached a monthly digital audience of 117 million unique visitors in June and that News Corp owns two of the top three best-selling print mastheads in the U.S. with The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post. News U.K. under Rebecca Brooks' leadership saw an improved profit contribution for the quarter and the full year. As we benefited from lower newsprint costs, increased digital subscriptions, cover price rises and lower television expenses. Our strong results for the year and record returns for the quarter would not have been possible without the leadership of Lachlan and Rupert Murdoch, the support of our Board and the admirable efforts of our employees around the world. The company's enduring success is built on an honorable tradition of creativity and curiosity and integrity. Our success would also be impossible without the support of our shareholders and we are acutely conscious of our responsibility to generate value and provide robust returns to those who have invested both money and faith in News Corporation. And we are certainly not beholden to pass structures as we confront the future. I now hand you to our CFO, the Sage Susan Panuccio. Well, David, you can see from my earlier statement that there are various processes in motion. We have had an overture a significant overdue, which we're naturally assessing -- but let me make absolutely clear that we have full faith in the potential of Foxtel and our talented team at Foxtel who've fashioned a world-class viewing experience and created Kayo, which really is the best at streaming platform globally, hence the interest in emulating its success in the U.S. But on behalf of shareholders, we obviously have to evaluate any interest knowing that we are ourselves further Foxtel fans. I mean the streaming business is surging and broadcast ARPU in the most recent quarter was 6% higher than a year earlier. But secondly, strategically, we have been undertaking a broad review of our portfolio and its potential in the quest to increase shareholder value. Now that review continues apace. But on that particular matter, you'll have to stay tuned, but not indefinitely, not perpetually not at infinitum. Okay. And we really can't go into the precise details, but you will be able to see the impact in our news businesses. It's tangible, it's meaningful. The way to regard the OpenAI agreement is that there will be a guaranteed amount and the two companies will be working to create products that generate even more value for both companies. The OpenAI team under Sam Altman has a sophisticated sense of how to productize profitably and with principal. And neither of those qualities are given with all Gen AI players, some of whom are merely content carpetbaggers. Well, look, Entcho, as for Foxtel, we just want to be sure that the process is full and fair and to reassure our cherished colleagues that the external interest should be seen as a clear vote of confidence in what they have achieved and how they have positively transformed the company. I mean you recall the skepticism about Foxtel's fate four or five years ago. that skepticism has become optimism and the company's performance has obviously caught the eye at the discerning eye, dare I say, others, who not only see a great company, but in these turbulent troubled times, an expanding market like Australia, which offers regulatory certainty and ongoing economic opportunity. Brian, our unique users in Q4 were 3% higher sequentially at $74 million, even though the market itself is sluggish and the competition is more intense. But the most important thing to bear in mind with Realtors that Damian and the team have been doing a vast amount of work in improving the tech, the experience. And so they're poised with poised, I say, given that the market does seem on the cusp of a revival. And as mentioned earlier, we've seen from our Australian experience that an extended period of suppressed demand can lead to almost an explosion in activity as families can finally afford to make the moves that they've been delaying. And once those movements start, there will be more liquidity, which of itself stimulates further demand. Have to say that Damian has done an excellent job in taking full advantage of our media platforms to raise the profile of Realtor and drive traffic. And there's much anticipation, excitement at Realtor. And in particular, because the revenue of the newer product lines, seller, for example, is markedly higher than a year ago. The U.S. has traditionally been a bio-led market, but the Australian market where we've had stunning success with REA is a seller market. So we're pleased to see that growth trend here. And we're also pleased to see today that 30-year mortgage rates dropped to a 15-month low to 6.47%. Now it's fair to presume that rate will continue to fall over time. And historically, there's been a corresponding increase in housing activity. Darren, we can't really reveal any more figures than we already have today. But our ambitions for Foxtel are undaunted. And I think what is particularly striking is that you're seeing growth in the streaming business. while combined with about 6% increase in ARPU in the Broadcast segment. So you're not seeing the fundamentally fatal contradictions that you are at some broadcasting companies in other parts of the world, which is why no doubt, the success of Kayo, the success of Binge, the emerging success of Hubbl have attracted a certain amount of attention. Well, Alan I'll take the second question first. We're constantly reviewing our structure. We're very proud of all the divisions and the growth that we're seeing across the majority of them over the past quarter and the past year, you can see from yourself from new accounts. As for OpenAI, we have made clear in the past that we would prefer to we rather than to sue to negotiate rather than to litigate. But for some, the process of seeing has started. Now sometimes the threat of suing can be a precursor to wing, but we will surely see the upcoming coming months. And just to reinforce that point, for example, at the New York Post, we have 117 million monthly uniques. There's content complementarity with Realtor. That's true for many of our media properties around the world, the combination between our news media properties in Australia and REA and Foxtel. So these companies together far more than the sum of the parts. Thank you, Craig. We're constantly institutionally in perspective, we've obviously been engaged in the process. And as I indicated earlier, that process will not continue indefinitely nor perpetually. But we have actually already completed a significant amount of regulatory work to make possible that kind of introspection. But we cannot give you a specific date. We can assure you that there's much effort going on. And obviously, that effort now coincides with interest in Foxtel, that process has to play out in in a full and fair manner for all concerned. But clearly, there will be a certain amount of tension on that in coming weeks and coming days."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMichael Florin: Thank you very much, operator. Hello everyone, and welcome to News Corp's fiscal third quarter 2024 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We will open with some prepared remarks and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements, such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings release for the applicable periods posted on our website. With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\nRobert Thomson: Thank you Mike. News Corp has again made substantial progress on our strategic imperative to transform the company and increase value for all shareholders. Our profitability rose slightly in the third quarter, as compared to the prior year, continuing our growth this fiscal year, and that increase follows the three most profitable years since the company was reincarnated in 2013. That improvement, which gathered pace in April came despite certain macroeconomic circumstances that were far from auspicious whether a strong dollar that devalued our revenues outside the U.S. particularly in Australia or the punitively high mortgage rates that obviously undermined activity in the U.S. housing market. The U.S. housing market contrasts starkly with that of Australia, where strong performance underpinned robust revenue growth at Digital Real Estate Services. While at Dow Jones, the professional information business continued to prosper and the segment's profit margin expanded from 20.6% to 21.7%. We remain well on track for the full year of strong results at News Corp. It is by the way worth highlighting that our free cash flow in the first three quarters was $491 million, a 53% increase on the $320 million for the same period last year. It is also worth noting that for more than a year, digital revenue has accounted for over half of our total revenues and we believe that trend is destined to continue. We are in the midst of an exponential digital revolution and our own company has continued to change significantly and profitably. Importantly, we are working to promote our quality journalism in the age of generative AI and are gratified that the most enlightened leaders in the industry appreciate the commercial and social value of that content. Separately to that end, we have this week extended our existing partnership with Google. As mentioned previously, we have been reviewing our company's structure, and that work is intense and ongoing, and we have made underlying changes to provide maximum flexibility. Through three quarters of fiscal 2024, circulation and subscriptions accounted for 45% of revenues, with advertising at a modest 16%. 10 years ago we were dependent on advertising for almost half our revenues. Most tellingly, advertising at News Media then our largest source of revenue now accounts for only 8% of total revenue. I should repeat that number 8%, and half of that figure is now digital advertising. So the character of the company has fundamentally changed. Dow Jones continue to increase both revenue and profitability this quarter. The professional information business at Dow Jones is an increasingly powerful earnings engine, with yet another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. It remains on track to be the largest contributor to the segment's profitability by the end of this fiscal year and we believe far into the future given its high margins and 90-plus percent retention rate. Dow Jones Energy where revenues rose 15% has just launched the APAC Carbon Market Report, which provides data and insights into emissions trading in Australia, China, New Zealand and South Korea. This important new offering complements OPIS's carbon price coverage for North America and other international markets. At risk and compliance, where revenues also rose 15%, the team debuted its first Gen AI-powered product, Integrity Check, a fully automated research platform that rapidly produces due diligence reports on businesses and individuals from our unique database. Created in partnership with SAPIEN, Integrity Check will help companies ensure they are compliant in a fiendishly complicated and legally fraught regulatory environment. Digital subscriptions at Dow Jones increased 17% year-over-year, and experienced their highest sequential quarterly net growth, with 322,000 added in the third quarter. Average daily digital subscriptions to Dow Jones brands, including the Wall Street Journal, Barron's, MarketWatch, Investor's Business Daily, crossed 5 million for the first time during Q3. That total is approximately double the number 4 years ago. Given the access to a bundle of premium products with the Wall Street Journal at the heart, the Dow Jones team is confident we should see a reduction in churn and an increase in circulation revenues in quarters to come. As for advertising, the market for print remains somewhat soft, though digital advertising rose 4% compared to the prior year, and advertising trends overall improved on the preceding quarter. In digital real estate, REA continued to show robust growth, with revenues surging 15% year-over-year. A 6% increase in listings across Australia helped spur that success, and I should note that listing growth has again improved in April compared to March, which we believe augurs well for the fourth quarter. REA also remains by far the number one digital real estate platform in Australia, with 4.1x more monthly visits on average than its nearest competitor. That strength and enhanced product mix for its customers enabled REA to introduce 10% average price increases. That new pricing schedule will apply from July, and we look forward to the benefits in the next fiscal year. Meanwhile, we are pleased with the continuing progress at REA India, with a 31% advance in revenues in the quarter. Our site, housing.com, is the leading digital real estate platform in the most populous country in the world. Given that country's economic growth, widely forecast to be around 7% this year, and the prospect of ongoing political continuity, we are confident that we have a world-class asset with much potential for expansion. At Move, we are obviously subject to the abnormal aberrant conditions in a US housing market buffeted by high interest rates. However, revenue declines moderated this quarter, and lead volume has turned positive for the first time in 2 years. The results this quarter are broadly consistent with our expectations, and we are improving the product and user experience to position ourselves to take advantage when the market trends change from headwind to tailwind. In the wake of legal developments involving the National Association of Realtors, I would echo move CEO, Damian Eales 's recent perspicacious comments about the importance of buy-side agents for those seeking professional guidance when purchasing a home, which is surely the most significant investment decision for many families. We continue to closely monitor industry developments, but believe realtor.com is well-positioned to capitalize on its relationship with home buyers and with buy- and sell-side agents in this evolving landscape. We expect that interest rates will ultimately ease, and our experience in Australia suggests that the market will surge dramatically after an extended period of suppressed activity. It is worth noting our landmark rental agreement between realtor.com and Zillow. This deal upgrades the rental experience for consumers and allows landlords and property managers to benefit from the combined audience of both the realtor.com and Zillow platforms. There is also a clear financial benefit for realtor.com, which will allow us to focus on our core buy- and sell-side offerings. Finally, I would point out that in March, according to Comscore, a verified third-party source, realtor's unique users grew 5% month over month, comparing very favorably to homes.com, which experienced a decline in the same period. Moreover, realtor.com is 1.4x bigger in terms of monthly unique users and has approximately 3x the page views and minutes per visit. Independent verification ensures statistical sumptuous, not metrics mumsmus. Our media platforms from the Wall Street Journal to the New York Post and MarketWatch and Bible Gateway give us a distinct advantage in expanding reach and building brands. Speaking of Bible Gateway, at HarperCollins, while revenues for the quarter were slightly behind the record Q3 results in the prior year, segment EBITDA rose 2%. And for the year-to-date period, EBITDA was 40% higher. In April, we saw a stronger performance and hope that will continue for the fourth quarter. We continue to believe the audio book market holds much promise, especially given our unique partnership with Spotify, which has already broadened the book audience. We hope to benefit from Spotify's recent expansion of its audio offerings to Canada, Ireland and New Zealand. And by the way fueled by the growth of audio books, HarperCollins digital revenues hit 25% of total consumer revenues in Q3. We believe there is little doubt that the audio segment will continue its expedition expansion. Bestsellers in Q3 included Shelby Van Pelt's novel Remarkably Bright Creatures. While Savannah Guthrie's, Mostly What God Does continues to thrive as does Peter Schweizer's Blood Money, and Fangirl Down by Tessa Bailey. Pope Francis' memoir, Life: My Story Through History, which we publish in eight languages is selling well and will surely have an enduring people presence in libraries. We anticipate a strong performance in Q4 with Lucy Foley's, The Midnight Feast; The War on Warriors by Pete Hegseth; and Day Trading Attention by Gary Vaynerchuk. At Subscription Video Services, the Hubbl streaming aggregation product launched in March and we are working with our partners at Comcast to shepherd its adoption throughout Australia. The intent is to reduce churn by increasing engagement and improving the customer experience. Excluding ForEx fluctuations, adjusted segment EBITDA overall improved by 1% in the segment. Kayo is benefiting from the impact of a fascinating season of both Aussie Rules Football and Rugby League and had its highest sequential quarterly net additions since inception, powered by both new customer growth and reactivations. We anticipate that recent price increases at Kayo and expected strong subscriber growth will continue to benefit the bottom line as both leading sports codes are drawing record audiences. Foxtel continued to grow its streaming revenues in Q3, which now account for 29% of circulation and subscription revenues up from 26% last year, which is helping to drive overall margins, which rose from 14.3% to 14.5%. In News Media, our brands continue to increase their digital penetration across the globe and we were vigilant on costs, which were 5% lower than a year earlier. We anticipate further significant savings as a result of our transition of TalkTV to focus on streaming and original video content for our established British brands. And we also expect tangible cost benefits following the regulatory approval for the joint printing agreement between News UK and the Daily Mail Group. The Times of London will expand digitally and gradually into the US during Q4 inspired by the success of the US Sun in reaching new audiences and enhancing digital revenues. Much journalism is unfortunately Jaundice [ph], but our imperative is for reporters to have the objective of being objective and for our economists to have the objective of being subjective. As of the end of March, The Times and Sunday Times closing digital subscribers including The Times literary supplement were at 582,000, up 5% year-over-year. Meanwhile digital subscribers at News Corp Australia as of the end of March were over 1.1 million, up 7% compared to the prior year. In the first three quarters of fiscal year 2024, News Corp delivered strong profit growth and we fervently believe that the company is firmly on a pathway to continued success. Our trusted premium intellectual property resonates in an era of polarization and amidst a rising tide of AI field falsehoods and fuss. For us, AI stands for authentic and authenticated intelligence, not artificial intelligence or the artifice of intelligence. As always, we remain sincerely grateful for the astute leadership of Lachlan and Rupert Murdoch and for the sage support of our Board, investors and customers, and for the sterling efforts of all of our employees. One final note. For more than a year, our colleague Evan Gershkovich has been falsely and cruelly imprisoned in Moscow. In public and not so public ways, we are actively seeking his release. We deeply appreciate those who have assisted the cause and we sincerely look forward to his emancipation. I now turn to Susan Panuccio for additional details of our performance in Q3.\nSusan Panuccio: Thank you, Robert, and good afternoon to everyone. As Robert highlighted, we remain focused on the execution of our strategy to transform News Corp with an increased mix of recurring and digital revenues as we continue to expand our information services businesses. This has been balanced with reinvestment in key growth initiatives and cost efficiencies as we navigate ongoing inflationary pressures in our markets. Our third quarter total revenues were over $2.4 billion, down 1% compared to the prior year, while adjusted revenues were flat compared to the prior year. Total segment EBITDA was $322 million for the quarter, up 1% compared to the prior year on a reported and adjusted basis and ranked as the second most profitable Q3 since the company's separation in 2013. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.05 compared to $0.09 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.11 in the quarter compared to $0.09 in the prior year. Moving on to the results of the individual segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $388 million, up 7% versus the prior year and up 9% on an adjusted basis. Segment EBITDA was $104 million, up 2% as higher profit contribution from the REA Group was partly offset by lower revenues and approximately $11 million of higher costs at Move. Adjusted segment EBITDA grew 7%. REA had another very strong quarter with revenues rising 15% year-on-year on a reported basis to $256 million and up 20% in constant currency. Growth was again driven by a combination of residential yield increases and improved growth in national listings, favorable geographic mix and customer contract upgrades. New buyer listings rose approximately 6% with Sydney up 20% and Melbourne up 18% despite an early Easter which negatively impacted March volumes. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call for more details. Move's revenues of $132 million were down 6% compared to the prior year with declines continuing to moderate from recent quarters. For the quarter, real estate revenues fell 5% driven by lower referral and lead gen revenues, reflective of the broader industry trends and lower transaction volumes. We saw an improvement in lead volumes for the first time in over two years growing 4% year-over-year, benefiting from product enhancements and some stabilization in the housing market. Average monthly unique users for the quarter were flat versus the prior year at 72 million, but improving 9% from the second quarter. As Robert mentioned,.we announced a rentals partnership with Zillow to syndicate large multifamily rental listings which went live May 1. The agreement financially beneficial allows us to materially expand and improve our rental content offerings and to reallocate investment to marketing and our core buy and sell-side offerings. As we communicated last quarter, we are focused on best positioning realtor.com for a housing recovery and as a result are increasing the rate of reinvestment in the second half of fiscal 2024. To reiterate, some of the key strategic focuses include modernizing the technology stack, ensuring we have the best content for our product offerings and leveraging News Corp's network to drive audience share. Damian has been very focal about the ongoing benefits of buyer agents. And while we will closely monitor the impact of the proposed NAR settlement, we continue to believe in the long-term opportunity for realtor.com and have not altered our strategic direction which already includes diversifying revenues and expanding our seller offerings which continue to scale. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $455 million, down 5% compared to the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues were down 1% versus the prior year. Streaming revenues accounted for over 29% of circulation and subscription revenues versus 26% in the prior year. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group were over 4.5 million at quarter end, down 1% from the prior year, but up 5% versus the second quarter as Foxtel transitions into the winter sports season. Total paid streaming subscribers were nearly 3.1 million, increasing 3% versus the prior year, benefiting from a strong start to the AFL and NRL seasons. Kayo added 269,000 paying subscribers this quarter, the highest sequential quarterly net addition since its launch in fiscal 2019, which is consistent with recent trends of customers returning post summer. Foxtel ended the quarter with over 1.2 million residential broadcast subscribers down 9% year-over-year. Broadcast churn was 13.3% versus 12.3% in the prior year, while broadcast ARPU rose 2% to AUD 85 benefiting modestly from new pricing and packaging plans implemented in March. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $66 million was down only 3% versus the prior year despite the inclusion of $13 million of costs related to Hubbl, which launched in early March and a 4% negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased 1%. Moving on to Dow Jones. Third quarter results were again strong at Dow Jones with revenues of $544 million, up 3% year-over-year with digital revenue accounting for 81% of total revenues this quarter, up 2 percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription-based revenues represented 82% of total revenues, again reinforcing the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. We saw strong growth at PIB, with revenues rising 10% year-over-year including a 15% growth at Risk and Compliance to $76 million and 15% growth at DJ Energy to $63 million. Total PIB retention rates remained strong at over 90%. Across the B2B portfolio this quarter over two-thirds of the growth is coming from new customers, new products or upsells with the balance coming from annual price increases. At Dow Jones Energy, the mix between pricing and volume is more balanced this year due to the benefit of a pricing review, which led to above-average increases. Within the Dow Jones Consumer business, circulation revenues were flat versus the prior year, with digital-only subscription growth accelerating from the Q2 rate to 17% year-over-year and higher by 322,000 subscriptions sequentially helped by increased penetration of the Dow Jones bundling offer as they look to better leverage subscription acquisition costs across multiple products, capitalize on minimal overlap between products and drive greater engagement. Bundling accounted for approximately 45% of the incremental digital-only volume growth in Q3 and now represents about 14% of total subscriptions. We have taken price rises this quarter increasing monthly rates by nearly 20% to a cohort of tenured print subscribers. Advertising revenues declined 2% to $86 million with year-over-year declines moderating slightly from the first half with digital improving up 4%, driven by a rebound in technology spend. wsj.com grew 12%, underscoring the strength of the platform and its valuable audience. Print advertising declined 11% due to weakness in the financial sector. Digital represented 63% of advertising revenues, up from 59% last year. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 8% to $118 million and was again the largest segment EBITDA contributor across the company. Margins improved year-over-year by 110 basis points to 21.7%, driven by the strong B2B performance, which remains on track to be the largest contributor to Dow Jones profitability in fiscal 2024. Costs as expected rose modestly, partly due to the phasing of sales and marketing expenses as we mentioned last quarter. At Book Publishing strong growth in our Christian business was not enough to offset some softness in our road map general books and children's divisions. Consumer softness and headwinds in the mass merchandiser accounts such as Costco and Walmart were greater than we expected in March. Revenues were $506 million, down 2% but that compares with a record third quarter last year, while segment EBITDA improved 2% to $62 million compared to the prior year largely due to the easing of supply chain pressures and the cost efficiencies, driven by the HarperCollins team over the past 12 months. Margin improved slightly to over 12%. We continue to see improvements in supply chain-related costs, with freight distribution and manufacturing costs all down versus the prior year. Return rates again improved compared to last year while inventory levels appear to have normalized across our distribution network. The backlist contributed 63% of consumer revenues, up from 60% last year, while digital sales rose 5% this quarter reaching 25% of consumer sales. Downloadable audio rose mid-teens helped by the recent Spotify partnership. Turning to News Media, performance continued to be challenged in the quarter with print advertising declines returning to more historic levels. Revenues were $530 million, down 6% versus the prior year while adjusted revenues also declined 6%. Circulation and subscription revenues were flat and down 1% in constant currency as cover price increases and digital subscriber growth were offset by lower print volumes. Advertising remained challenging, down 13% both on a reported basis and in local currency, with print advertising trends notably weak across all markets. As our News Media businesses face ongoing print challenges they continue to work hard on their transition to digital and ongoing cost efficiencies. Segment EBITDA of $26 million declined $8 million, which was due to the lower revenue partly offset by lower print volume and newsprint expenses. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 26%. As for the outlook, similar to our comments last quarter, it is challenging to forecast in the short-term albeit economic indicators vary across markets. Looking at each of our segments, at Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for April grew 32% due to the timing of Easter, as well as easier comparisons to the prior year. Please refer to REA for a more specific outlook commentary. At Move, we hope to see continued moderation in revenue declines. Like the third quarter, we expect continued reinvestment in marketing and product development, which will be partially offset by cost reductions elsewhere and the new rental agreement with Zillow. In Subscription Video Services, consistent with our message last quarter, we continue to expect modestly higher expenses for the full year and some softness in streaming revenues due to the first half, which may impact full year profitability in local currency. At Dow Jones, while we continue to expect strong revenue and profitability performance for the full year, underpinned by our B2B offerings, we expect modestly higher overall expenses for the fourth quarter and full year. At Book Publishing, overall industry revenue trends appear relatively stable, albeit third quarter was a bit softer than the first half for physical sales, but we are encouraged by the strength in downloadable audio. We continue to expect margins to improve versus the prior year and expect strong performance in Q4, partly due to the prior year comparison. At News Media, advertising revenue trends remain challenging, particularly in Australia, and we will continue to focus on ongoing cost efficiencies in our digital product offerings. For the other segment, we expect costs for the fourth quarter to be in line with the previous three quarters. We now expect CapEx to be relatively stable to last year, slightly lower than our initial expectations. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now start the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Entcho Raykovski from Evans & Partners. Please un-mute yourself to ask the question.\nEntcho Raykovski: Hi, Robert. Hi, Susan. So my question is around the Move investment, which you've made during the quarter and you flagged is ongoing. It sounds like it's both marketing and product development. Are you able to confirm that? And how much is going into marketing? How much is going to product development? And on the product development side, are you specifically targeting the sell-side agents with that spend given the NIR settlements? If you can provide some more detail around the sort of products you're investing in? And just more broadly, how do you think that settlement is going to impact the business model going forward? Thank you.\nRobert Thomson: Entcho, look, obviously, I don't intend to comment on specific legal cases. And the US real estate industry is clearly in transition. But there's no doubt that realtors have a crucial role in the purchasing process, and we are proud to serve them. As for realtor.com, our experience in Australia and our complementary media platforms and US position us perfectly to take advantage of that tradition, where transition. We are very focused in the interim of on making sure that the back end is solid, that the user interface is great and that our customers get value for money. We are very focused on buy-sell, hence our partnership deal with Zillow on rentals, which will be beneficial to both companies. And the imperative, really, is to focus on the world's largest property market, which is still relatively early in its digital evolution. And we have the media assets and now, from our global experience, to make the most of that moment.\nSusan Panuccio: And Entcho, maybe just to add on that, too, I mean the spend itself is probably broadly focused roughly evenly across both categories. But I think the thing to remember is in relation to the back half of last year, we pulled back significantly on the marketing spend, particularly in Q3 and a little bit in Q4. So the prior year compares will look more challenging in relation to marketing spend. But to think about it more broadly, it's focused on both areas, product and marketing.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Entcho. We will take our next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Karnovsky from JPMorgan. Please unmute yourself to ask your question.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you. Maybe on Book Publishing. I wanted to see if you could speak a little more broadly to what you're seeing in terms of demand trends right now. You mentioned some softness at big box retailers. And then with Spotify, what potential tailwind do you see for streaming and widening kind of the overall market for audio books? And can you say if you've seen any incremental interest from other DSPs to carry HarperCollins content?\nRobert Thomson: Well, as for HarperCollins, we are all bookish to a certain degree and purchases ebb and flow like the pilot books on the bedside table. Early last quarter, sales were strong, and then there was clearly a slight pause in purchasing. But what I can say is that we have seen a return to strong year-on-year performance in April and have a compelling roster of new releases. And even in Q3, we saw an improvement in margin from 11.8% last year to 12.3% this year. We're certainly benefiting from the international expansion of audio books as you mentioned and the efforts of Spotify who have transformed audio book streaming revenue, which rose 14% in the third quarter. So, we're proud to partner with Daniel Ek and his talented team as they roll out streaming globally.\nSusan Panuccio: And David maybe just to complement that a little bit. It's not like a perfect comparison. The Book Scan data when we have a look at it for Q3 showed consumption down 3%. So, that gives you an indication that the market was a little bit softer for Q3. But going into Q4 we did have a particularly weak Q4 last year so we would expect to see pretty strong compares as we finish out the year.\nMichael Florin: Thanks David. Leila, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alan Gould from Loop Capital. Please unmute yourself to ask a question.\nAlan Gould: Thanks for taking the question. Hello Robert, hello Susan. Question on the Google transaction. Can you flesh -- or this renewal can you flesh this out a little bit? And remember at one point last year you talked about a nine-figure deal with the digital companies, I don't recall if that was just Google or others. And does this include generative AI in addition to using your using your journalism for other sources?\nRobert Thomson: Look I can't comment on the financial details of the deal other than to say that this is a renewal of the existing deal. It has nothing to do with a payment for AI, Gen AI use of our content, servicing of that content, training of that content, or grounding of the content. So, any negotiations for that particular use of our content will come later.\nSusan Panuccio: And Alan just from a financial perspective well we've never given a doubt specifically you can assume that it's broadly consistent with the financials of the previous deal.\nAlan Gould: Okay. Thank you.\nRobert Thomson: Thanks Alan. Operator, we'll take our next question, please.\nMichael Florin: Thanks Alan. Leila, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research.\nCraig Huber: Yes, hi. Can you hear me okay?\nRobert Thomson: Yes Craig.\nCraig Huber: Yes hi. Just I think everybody is really curious just about the progress that you're trying to make here to transform the company to simplify the company and stuff. And obviously we talked about this three months ago and six months when you talked about it privately -- I mean publicly I should say. And obviously you've done a lot of work on this before you made the announcement six months ago. I'm just kind of curious can you give investors at all any sort of timeline when you guys might wrap this up and stuff? I mean obviously things are pretty quiet out there for most of the investment banks and the legal folks after that work on this sort of stuff. So, I know it's very complicated what you guys are doing here, but what -- how much longer do you think we should have to wait with the next quarter or so? Or do you really have no idea?\nRobert Thomson: Craig I'm sure that you and all on the call are sage enough to pass the phrases used in my earlier explanation and define the potential meaning. You can see that we're well advanced now thinking and planning and that planning has involved necessary regulatory steps and those were not simple steps to ensure that we have maximum flexibility genuine optionality. We want to continue to generate momentum and create maximum value for our shareholders. And we're certainly not complacent. Even though the share price has risen as of yesterday just over 46% in the past year we do recognize that there is a significant sum of the parts discount so stay tuned and not indefinitely.\nMichael Florin: Thanks Craig. And Leila, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darren Leung from Macquarie. Please unmute your line.\nDarren Leung: Hi guys. Thanks for the opportunity. Just a quick one for me. Looking at the BINGE subscribers in Foxtel, they're down sequentially quarter-on-quarter. So, the second time it has happened. But I'm just keen to understand a little bit about the drivers here and your response and thought process here please? Thank you.\nSusan Panuccio: Darren I think when we think about it from the last quarter I think we talked about this there was the writers' strike towards the back end of last year and that obviously had an impact on the content that was flowing through there. So, that did have an impact on the subscribers and we're seeing a carry forward of that. I mean that's really what the impact is.\nMichael Florin: Thanks Darren. Leila, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lucy Huang from UBS.\nLucy Huang: Thanks, Rob and Susan. My question is in relation to cost out. I guess right now the macro outlook still seems relatively uncertain particularly for advertising and similar way with like the US housing market. So just wondering if there's any script for some further cost reductions through the course of the next year if these conditions start to improve?\nSusan Panuccio: I think Lucy you might remember we did --we sort of announced I think probably a year ago the 5% head count reduction. And I think we quoted a number of 160 million for the cost out. I mean it's great that we're actually -- we hit those numbers and exceeded those numbers actually. But the really good thing is that the businesses are actually always focused on costs. So whilst that was a particular exercise that we did across the whole group. Across all our businesses there are different transformation initiatives that they continue to work on as they look for efficiencies. So we feel pretty confident that we've got a good cadence in relation to that that can help offset any shortfalls in revenue. And that's why you've seen such good margin expansion in the year.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Lucy. Laila, we will take our next question, please\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Han from Morningstar. Please unmute your line to ask your question.\nBrian Han: Susan just on that cost out question. So it looks like some sort of cost reduction initiatives will be ongoing in the current fourth quarter. But how much of that do you think will be reinvested in realtor.com?\nSusan Lee: We sort of we're trying to keep the balanced reinvestment within REALTOR itself. So I think I said in my prepared remarks we've got some benefit from the upside in the new rental agreements that we've done with Zillow and we've got some other cost savings that we're doing with realtor. So whilst there is an increase in cost we are trying to manage it there. I think when we sort of think more broadly about costs across the business and sort of to the earlier point that we talked to with Lucy -- we just constantly focus on looking for efficiency. So the UK, we've announced a pivot in the TalkTV strategy to streaming and that should unlock some savings which we'll really see come through in fiscal 2025. The UK team have also announced a joint venture with the Daily Mail Group in relation to joint printing that should unlock further savings. We know our Australian team are constantly iterating when it comes to savings. So we sort of we try and have to think about it broadly across the whole company but specifically in the divisions that we look for those cost savings.\nMichael Florin:\n.:\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Laskovski from Goldman Sachs.\nJamie Laskovski: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on the underlying company structure changes that have happened so far that were called out and what we should expect over the medium-term growth? Thank you.\nRobert Thomson: Jamie they were regulatory changes related to the original composition of the company in Australia. And really other than what I said earlier I'm not at the liberty to say -- say anything more at this moment.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Jamie. Laila, we will take our next question please/\nOperator: At this time we have no further questions. I'll now hand back to you for closing remarks.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Laila. Thank you all for participating. Have a wonderful day and we will talk to you soon. Take care.",

            "name": "Susan Panuccio",
            "content": "Thank you, Robert, and good afternoon to everyone. As Robert highlighted, we remain focused on the execution of our strategy to transform News Corp with an increased mix of recurring and digital revenues as we continue to expand our information services businesses. This has been balanced with reinvestment in key growth initiatives and cost efficiencies as we navigate ongoing inflationary pressures in our markets. Our third quarter total revenues were over $2.4 billion, down 1% compared to the prior year, while adjusted revenues were flat compared to the prior year. Total segment EBITDA was $322 million for the quarter, up 1% compared to the prior year on a reported and adjusted basis and ranked as the second most profitable Q3 since the company's separation in 2013. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.05 compared to $0.09 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.11 in the quarter compared to $0.09 in the prior year. Moving on to the results of the individual segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $388 million, up 7% versus the prior year and up 9% on an adjusted basis. Segment EBITDA was $104 million, up 2% as higher profit contribution from the REA Group was partly offset by lower revenues and approximately $11 million of higher costs at Move. Adjusted segment EBITDA grew 7%. REA had another very strong quarter with revenues rising 15% year-on-year on a reported basis to $256 million and up 20% in constant currency. Growth was again driven by a combination of residential yield increases and improved growth in national listings, favorable geographic mix and customer contract upgrades. New buyer listings rose approximately 6% with Sydney up 20% and Melbourne up 18% despite an early Easter which negatively impacted March volumes. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call for more details. Move's revenues of $132 million were down 6% compared to the prior year with declines continuing to moderate from recent quarters. For the quarter, real estate revenues fell 5% driven by lower referral and lead gen revenues, reflective of the broader industry trends and lower transaction volumes. We saw an improvement in lead volumes for the first time in over two years growing 4% year-over-year, benefiting from product enhancements and some stabilization in the housing market. Average monthly unique users for the quarter were flat versus the prior year at 72 million, but improving 9% from the second quarter. As Robert mentioned,.we announced a rentals partnership with Zillow to syndicate large multifamily rental listings which went live May 1. The agreement financially beneficial allows us to materially expand and improve our rental content offerings and to reallocate investment to marketing and our core buy and sell-side offerings. As we communicated last quarter, we are focused on best positioning realtor.com for a housing recovery and as a result are increasing the rate of reinvestment in the second half of fiscal 2024. To reiterate, some of the key strategic focuses include modernizing the technology stack, ensuring we have the best content for our product offerings and leveraging News Corp's network to drive audience share. Damian has been very focal about the ongoing benefits of buyer agents. And while we will closely monitor the impact of the proposed NAR settlement, we continue to believe in the long-term opportunity for realtor.com and have not altered our strategic direction which already includes diversifying revenues and expanding our seller offerings which continue to scale. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $455 million, down 5% compared to the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues were down 1% versus the prior year. Streaming revenues accounted for over 29% of circulation and subscription revenues versus 26% in the prior year. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group were over 4.5 million at quarter end, down 1% from the prior year, but up 5% versus the second quarter as Foxtel transitions into the winter sports season. Total paid streaming subscribers were nearly 3.1 million, increasing 3% versus the prior year, benefiting from a strong start to the AFL and NRL seasons. Kayo added 269,000 paying subscribers this quarter, the highest sequential quarterly net addition since its launch in fiscal 2019, which is consistent with recent trends of customers returning post summer. Foxtel ended the quarter with over 1.2 million residential broadcast subscribers down 9% year-over-year. Broadcast churn was 13.3% versus 12.3% in the prior year, while broadcast ARPU rose 2% to AUD 85 benefiting modestly from new pricing and packaging plans implemented in March. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $66 million was down only 3% versus the prior year despite the inclusion of $13 million of costs related to Hubbl, which launched in early March and a 4% negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased 1%. Moving on to Dow Jones. Third quarter results were again strong at Dow Jones with revenues of $544 million, up 3% year-over-year with digital revenue accounting for 81% of total revenues this quarter, up 2 percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription-based revenues represented 82% of total revenues, again reinforcing the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. We saw strong growth at PIB, with revenues rising 10% year-over-year including a 15% growth at Risk and Compliance to $76 million and 15% growth at DJ Energy to $63 million. Total PIB retention rates remained strong at over 90%. Across the B2B portfolio this quarter over two-thirds of the growth is coming from new customers, new products or upsells with the balance coming from annual price increases. At Dow Jones Energy, the mix between pricing and volume is more balanced this year due to the benefit of a pricing review, which led to above-average increases. Within the Dow Jones Consumer business, circulation revenues were flat versus the prior year, with digital-only subscription growth accelerating from the Q2 rate to 17% year-over-year and higher by 322,000 subscriptions sequentially helped by increased penetration of the Dow Jones bundling offer as they look to better leverage subscription acquisition costs across multiple products, capitalize on minimal overlap between products and drive greater engagement. Bundling accounted for approximately 45% of the incremental digital-only volume growth in Q3 and now represents about 14% of total subscriptions. We have taken price rises this quarter increasing monthly rates by nearly 20% to a cohort of tenured print subscribers. Advertising revenues declined 2% to $86 million with year-over-year declines moderating slightly from the first half with digital improving up 4%, driven by a rebound in technology spend. wsj.com grew 12%, underscoring the strength of the platform and its valuable audience. Print advertising declined 11% due to weakness in the financial sector. Digital represented 63% of advertising revenues, up from 59% last year. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 8% to $118 million and was again the largest segment EBITDA contributor across the company. Margins improved year-over-year by 110 basis points to 21.7%, driven by the strong B2B performance, which remains on track to be the largest contributor to Dow Jones profitability in fiscal 2024. Costs as expected rose modestly, partly due to the phasing of sales and marketing expenses as we mentioned last quarter. At Book Publishing strong growth in our Christian business was not enough to offset some softness in our road map general books and children's divisions. Consumer softness and headwinds in the mass merchandiser accounts such as Costco and Walmart were greater than we expected in March. Revenues were $506 million, down 2% but that compares with a record third quarter last year, while segment EBITDA improved 2% to $62 million compared to the prior year largely due to the easing of supply chain pressures and the cost efficiencies, driven by the HarperCollins team over the past 12 months. Margin improved slightly to over 12%. We continue to see improvements in supply chain-related costs, with freight distribution and manufacturing costs all down versus the prior year. Return rates again improved compared to last year while inventory levels appear to have normalized across our distribution network. The backlist contributed 63% of consumer revenues, up from 60% last year, while digital sales rose 5% this quarter reaching 25% of consumer sales. Downloadable audio rose mid-teens helped by the recent Spotify partnership. Turning to News Media, performance continued to be challenged in the quarter with print advertising declines returning to more historic levels. Revenues were $530 million, down 6% versus the prior year while adjusted revenues also declined 6%. Circulation and subscription revenues were flat and down 1% in constant currency as cover price increases and digital subscriber growth were offset by lower print volumes. Advertising remained challenging, down 13% both on a reported basis and in local currency, with print advertising trends notably weak across all markets. As our News Media businesses face ongoing print challenges they continue to work hard on their transition to digital and ongoing cost efficiencies. Segment EBITDA of $26 million declined $8 million, which was due to the lower revenue partly offset by lower print volume and newsprint expenses. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 26%. As for the outlook, similar to our comments last quarter, it is challenging to forecast in the short-term albeit economic indicators vary across markets. Looking at each of our segments, at Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for April grew 32% due to the timing of Easter, as well as easier comparisons to the prior year. Please refer to REA for a more specific outlook commentary. At Move, we hope to see continued moderation in revenue declines. Like the third quarter, we expect continued reinvestment in marketing and product development, which will be partially offset by cost reductions elsewhere and the new rental agreement with Zillow. In Subscription Video Services, consistent with our message last quarter, we continue to expect modestly higher expenses for the full year and some softness in streaming revenues due to the first half, which may impact full year profitability in local currency. At Dow Jones, while we continue to expect strong revenue and profitability performance for the full year, underpinned by our B2B offerings, we expect modestly higher overall expenses for the fourth quarter and full year. At Book Publishing, overall industry revenue trends appear relatively stable, albeit third quarter was a bit softer than the first half for physical sales, but we are encouraged by the strength in downloadable audio. We continue to expect margins to improve versus the prior year and expect strong performance in Q4, partly due to the prior year comparison. At News Media, advertising revenue trends remain challenging, particularly in Australia, and we will continue to focus on ongoing cost efficiencies in our digital product offerings. For the other segment, we expect costs for the fourth quarter to be in line with the previous three quarters. We now expect CapEx to be relatively stable to last year, slightly lower than our initial expectations. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A. And Entcho, maybe just to add on that, too, I mean the spend itself is probably broadly focused roughly evenly across both categories. But I think the thing to remember is in relation to the back half of last year, we pulled back significantly on the marketing spend, particularly in Q3 and a little bit in Q4. So the prior year compares will look more challenging in relation to marketing spend. But to think about it more broadly, it's focused on both areas, product and marketing. And David maybe just to complement that a little bit. It's not like a perfect comparison. The Book Scan data when we have a look at it for Q3 showed consumption down 3%. So, that gives you an indication that the market was a little bit softer for Q3. But going into Q4 we did have a particularly weak Q4 last year so we would expect to see pretty strong compares as we finish out the year. And Alan just from a financial perspective well we've never given a doubt specifically you can assume that it's broadly consistent with the financials of the previous deal. Darren I think when we think about it from the last quarter I think we talked about this there was the writers' strike towards the back end of last year and that obviously had an impact on the content that was flowing through there. So, that did have an impact on the subscribers and we're seeing a carry forward of that. I mean that's really what the impact is. I think Lucy you might remember we did --we sort of announced I think probably a year ago the 5% head count reduction. And I think we quoted a number of 160 million for the cost out. I mean it's great that we're actually -- we hit those numbers and exceeded those numbers actually. But the really good thing is that the businesses are actually always focused on costs. So whilst that was a particular exercise that we did across the whole group. Across all our businesses there are different transformation initiatives that they continue to work on as they look for efficiencies. So we feel pretty confident that we've got a good cadence in relation to that that can help offset any shortfalls in revenue. And that's why you've seen such good margin expansion in the year."

            "name": "Robert Thomson",
            "content": "Thank you Mike. News Corp has again made substantial progress on our strategic imperative to transform the company and increase value for all shareholders. Our profitability rose slightly in the third quarter, as compared to the prior year, continuing our growth this fiscal year, and that increase follows the three most profitable years since the company was reincarnated in 2013. That improvement, which gathered pace in April came despite certain macroeconomic circumstances that were far from auspicious whether a strong dollar that devalued our revenues outside the U.S. particularly in Australia or the punitively high mortgage rates that obviously undermined activity in the U.S. housing market. The U.S. housing market contrasts starkly with that of Australia, where strong performance underpinned robust revenue growth at Digital Real Estate Services. While at Dow Jones, the professional information business continued to prosper and the segment's profit margin expanded from 20.6% to 21.7%. We remain well on track for the full year of strong results at News Corp. It is by the way worth highlighting that our free cash flow in the first three quarters was $491 million, a 53% increase on the $320 million for the same period last year. It is also worth noting that for more than a year, digital revenue has accounted for over half of our total revenues and we believe that trend is destined to continue. We are in the midst of an exponential digital revolution and our own company has continued to change significantly and profitably. Importantly, we are working to promote our quality journalism in the age of generative AI and are gratified that the most enlightened leaders in the industry appreciate the commercial and social value of that content. Separately to that end, we have this week extended our existing partnership with Google. As mentioned previously, we have been reviewing our company's structure, and that work is intense and ongoing, and we have made underlying changes to provide maximum flexibility. Through three quarters of fiscal 2024, circulation and subscriptions accounted for 45% of revenues, with advertising at a modest 16%. 10 years ago we were dependent on advertising for almost half our revenues. Most tellingly, advertising at News Media then our largest source of revenue now accounts for only 8% of total revenue. I should repeat that number 8%, and half of that figure is now digital advertising. So the character of the company has fundamentally changed. Dow Jones continue to increase both revenue and profitability this quarter. The professional information business at Dow Jones is an increasingly powerful earnings engine, with yet another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. It remains on track to be the largest contributor to the segment's profitability by the end of this fiscal year and we believe far into the future given its high margins and 90-plus percent retention rate. Dow Jones Energy where revenues rose 15% has just launched the APAC Carbon Market Report, which provides data and insights into emissions trading in Australia, China, New Zealand and South Korea. This important new offering complements OPIS's carbon price coverage for North America and other international markets. At risk and compliance, where revenues also rose 15%, the team debuted its first Gen AI-powered product, Integrity Check, a fully automated research platform that rapidly produces due diligence reports on businesses and individuals from our unique database. Created in partnership with SAPIEN, Integrity Check will help companies ensure they are compliant in a fiendishly complicated and legally fraught regulatory environment. Digital subscriptions at Dow Jones increased 17% year-over-year, and experienced their highest sequential quarterly net growth, with 322,000 added in the third quarter. Average daily digital subscriptions to Dow Jones brands, including the Wall Street Journal, Barron's, MarketWatch, Investor's Business Daily, crossed 5 million for the first time during Q3. That total is approximately double the number 4 years ago. Given the access to a bundle of premium products with the Wall Street Journal at the heart, the Dow Jones team is confident we should see a reduction in churn and an increase in circulation revenues in quarters to come. As for advertising, the market for print remains somewhat soft, though digital advertising rose 4% compared to the prior year, and advertising trends overall improved on the preceding quarter. In digital real estate, REA continued to show robust growth, with revenues surging 15% year-over-year. A 6% increase in listings across Australia helped spur that success, and I should note that listing growth has again improved in April compared to March, which we believe augurs well for the fourth quarter. REA also remains by far the number one digital real estate platform in Australia, with 4.1x more monthly visits on average than its nearest competitor. That strength and enhanced product mix for its customers enabled REA to introduce 10% average price increases. That new pricing schedule will apply from July, and we look forward to the benefits in the next fiscal year. Meanwhile, we are pleased with the continuing progress at REA India, with a 31% advance in revenues in the quarter. Our site, housing.com, is the leading digital real estate platform in the most populous country in the world. Given that country's economic growth, widely forecast to be around 7% this year, and the prospect of ongoing political continuity, we are confident that we have a world-class asset with much potential for expansion. At Move, we are obviously subject to the abnormal aberrant conditions in a US housing market buffeted by high interest rates. However, revenue declines moderated this quarter, and lead volume has turned positive for the first time in 2 years. The results this quarter are broadly consistent with our expectations, and we are improving the product and user experience to position ourselves to take advantage when the market trends change from headwind to tailwind. In the wake of legal developments involving the National Association of Realtors, I would echo move CEO, Damian Eales 's recent perspicacious comments about the importance of buy-side agents for those seeking professional guidance when purchasing a home, which is surely the most significant investment decision for many families. We continue to closely monitor industry developments, but believe realtor.com is well-positioned to capitalize on its relationship with home buyers and with buy- and sell-side agents in this evolving landscape. We expect that interest rates will ultimately ease, and our experience in Australia suggests that the market will surge dramatically after an extended period of suppressed activity. It is worth noting our landmark rental agreement between realtor.com and Zillow. This deal upgrades the rental experience for consumers and allows landlords and property managers to benefit from the combined audience of both the realtor.com and Zillow platforms. There is also a clear financial benefit for realtor.com, which will allow us to focus on our core buy- and sell-side offerings. Finally, I would point out that in March, according to Comscore, a verified third-party source, realtor's unique users grew 5% month over month, comparing very favorably to homes.com, which experienced a decline in the same period. Moreover, realtor.com is 1.4x bigger in terms of monthly unique users and has approximately 3x the page views and minutes per visit. Independent verification ensures statistical sumptuous, not metrics mumsmus. Our media platforms from the Wall Street Journal to the New York Post and MarketWatch and Bible Gateway give us a distinct advantage in expanding reach and building brands. Speaking of Bible Gateway, at HarperCollins, while revenues for the quarter were slightly behind the record Q3 results in the prior year, segment EBITDA rose 2%. And for the year-to-date period, EBITDA was 40% higher. In April, we saw a stronger performance and hope that will continue for the fourth quarter. We continue to believe the audio book market holds much promise, especially given our unique partnership with Spotify, which has already broadened the book audience. We hope to benefit from Spotify's recent expansion of its audio offerings to Canada, Ireland and New Zealand. And by the way fueled by the growth of audio books, HarperCollins digital revenues hit 25% of total consumer revenues in Q3. We believe there is little doubt that the audio segment will continue its expedition expansion. Bestsellers in Q3 included Shelby Van Pelt's novel Remarkably Bright Creatures. While Savannah Guthrie's, Mostly What God Does continues to thrive as does Peter Schweizer's Blood Money, and Fangirl Down by Tessa Bailey. Pope Francis' memoir, Life: My Story Through History, which we publish in eight languages is selling well and will surely have an enduring people presence in libraries. We anticipate a strong performance in Q4 with Lucy Foley's, The Midnight Feast; The War on Warriors by Pete Hegseth; and Day Trading Attention by Gary Vaynerchuk. At Subscription Video Services, the Hubbl streaming aggregation product launched in March and we are working with our partners at Comcast to shepherd its adoption throughout Australia. The intent is to reduce churn by increasing engagement and improving the customer experience. Excluding ForEx fluctuations, adjusted segment EBITDA overall improved by 1% in the segment. Kayo is benefiting from the impact of a fascinating season of both Aussie Rules Football and Rugby League and had its highest sequential quarterly net additions since inception, powered by both new customer growth and reactivations. We anticipate that recent price increases at Kayo and expected strong subscriber growth will continue to benefit the bottom line as both leading sports codes are drawing record audiences. Foxtel continued to grow its streaming revenues in Q3, which now account for 29% of circulation and subscription revenues up from 26% last year, which is helping to drive overall margins, which rose from 14.3% to 14.5%. In News Media, our brands continue to increase their digital penetration across the globe and we were vigilant on costs, which were 5% lower than a year earlier. We anticipate further significant savings as a result of our transition of TalkTV to focus on streaming and original video content for our established British brands. And we also expect tangible cost benefits following the regulatory approval for the joint printing agreement between News UK and the Daily Mail Group. The Times of London will expand digitally and gradually into the US during Q4 inspired by the success of the US Sun in reaching new audiences and enhancing digital revenues. Much journalism is unfortunately Jaundice [ph], but our imperative is for reporters to have the objective of being objective and for our economists to have the objective of being subjective. As of the end of March, The Times and Sunday Times closing digital subscribers including The Times literary supplement were at 582,000, up 5% year-over-year. Meanwhile digital subscribers at News Corp Australia as of the end of March were over 1.1 million, up 7% compared to the prior year. In the first three quarters of fiscal year 2024, News Corp delivered strong profit growth and we fervently believe that the company is firmly on a pathway to continued success. Our trusted premium intellectual property resonates in an era of polarization and amidst a rising tide of AI field falsehoods and fuss. For us, AI stands for authentic and authenticated intelligence, not artificial intelligence or the artifice of intelligence. As always, we remain sincerely grateful for the astute leadership of Lachlan and Rupert Murdoch and for the sage support of our Board, investors and customers, and for the sterling efforts of all of our employees. One final note. For more than a year, our colleague Evan Gershkovich has been falsely and cruelly imprisoned in Moscow. In public and not so public ways, we are actively seeking his release. We deeply appreciate those who have assisted the cause and we sincerely look forward to his emancipation. I now turn to Susan Panuccio for additional details of our performance in Q3. Entcho, look, obviously, I don't intend to comment on specific legal cases. And the US real estate industry is clearly in transition. But there's no doubt that realtors have a crucial role in the purchasing process, and we are proud to serve them. As for realtor.com, our experience in Australia and our complementary media platforms and US position us perfectly to take advantage of that tradition, where transition. We are very focused in the interim of on making sure that the back end is solid, that the user interface is great and that our customers get value for money. We are very focused on buy-sell, hence our partnership deal with Zillow on rentals, which will be beneficial to both companies. And the imperative, really, is to focus on the world's largest property market, which is still relatively early in its digital evolution. And we have the media assets and now, from our global experience, to make the most of that moment. Well, as for HarperCollins, we are all bookish to a certain degree and purchases ebb and flow like the pilot books on the bedside table. Early last quarter, sales were strong, and then there was clearly a slight pause in purchasing. But what I can say is that we have seen a return to strong year-on-year performance in April and have a compelling roster of new releases. And even in Q3, we saw an improvement in margin from 11.8% last year to 12.3% this year. We're certainly benefiting from the international expansion of audio books as you mentioned and the efforts of Spotify who have transformed audio book streaming revenue, which rose 14% in the third quarter. So, we're proud to partner with Daniel Ek and his talented team as they roll out streaming globally. Look I can't comment on the financial details of the deal other than to say that this is a renewal of the existing deal. It has nothing to do with a payment for AI, Gen AI use of our content, servicing of that content, training of that content, or grounding of the content. So, any negotiations for that particular use of our content will come later. Thanks Alan. Operator, we'll take our next question, please. Yes Craig. Craig I'm sure that you and all on the call are sage enough to pass the phrases used in my earlier explanation and define the potential meaning. You can see that we're well advanced now thinking and planning and that planning has involved necessary regulatory steps and those were not simple steps to ensure that we have maximum flexibility genuine optionality. We want to continue to generate momentum and create maximum value for our shareholders. And we're certainly not complacent. Even though the share price has risen as of yesterday just over 46% in the past year we do recognize that there is a significant sum of the parts discount so stay tuned and not indefinitely. Jamie they were regulatory changes related to the original composition of the company in Australia. And really other than what I said earlier I'm not at the liberty to say -- say anything more at this moment."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMichael Florin: Thank you very much, Operator. Hello, everyone. And welcome to News Corp\u2019s fiscal second quarter 2024 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago and it\u2019s now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We will open with some prepared remarks and then we\u2019ll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp\u2019s business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp\u2019s Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements, such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings releases for the applicable periods posted on our website. With that, I\u2019ll pass over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\nRobert Thomson: Thank you, Mike. For the second quarter in succession, News Corp has achieved growth in both revenue and profitability, and we believe there are strong prospects for further growth as difficult, inauspicious macro conditions ease in some of our markets. We saw particularly robust results across the three core pillars of our company, Dow Jones, Book Publishing and Digital Real Estate Services, where there was resounding improvement in Australia in Q2 and there are early signs of recovery in the U.S. residential sector after the most sluggish market conditions in almost three decades. Given the potential of our world-leading brands, we remain intent on creating long-term value for investors, and, as part of that commitment, our diligent, concerted review of the company\u2019s structure continues apace. Looking at the topline results, News Corp\u2019s second quarter revenues rose 3% to $2.6 billion and profitability surged 16%, marking the third consecutive quarter of profit growth in testing economic times. Our net income for the quarter rose to $183 million from $94 million in the same quarter last year, while our reported EPS was $0.27 against $0.12 for the same period last year. The company\u2019s digital progress and prowess are increasingly evident. Halfway through fiscal 2024, digital now comprises approximately 52% of all revenues. That is more than an e-evolution, it is an e-revolution, one that has touched and transformed every element of every business and we are far from satisfied, far from complacent, far from completion. We are seeing the collective benefit of our conscious strategic shift away from potentially volatile advertising revenues to growth in circulation and subscription revenues. In fiscal 2014, nearly half of News Corp revenues were from advertising, with 31% from circulation and subscriptions. There has been a fundamental metamorphosis. In the first half of the fiscal year, advertising had receded to 16%, with circulation and subscriptions surging to 44%. Overall, News Corp, as of Q2, had over 7 million subscriptions to our news brands, including the Wall Street Journal, Barron\u2019s, The Times and Sunday Times, The Australian and other publications. And we have an additional 4.3 million paid subscribers at Foxtel in Australia, which includes our popular streaming services Kayo and BINGE. And those figures don\u2019t include the growing number of loyal subscribers at our professional information business at Dow Jones, where the average retention rate is comfortably above 90%. Artificial intelligence, with all its permutations and perturbations, will play an increasingly important role at most businesses. We expect to be a core content provider for generative AI companies who need the highest quality, timely content to ensure the relevance of their products. The Corny, Kellogg, Clich\u00e9 is that AI companies are selling the picks and shovels during this seeming gold rush. Well, we are selectively reselling gold nuggets and those crucial negotiations are at an advanced stage. It is reassuring that certain digital companies appreciate the value of integrity, quality and creativity. And while certain other media companies prefer litigation, we prefer consultation, as the former is merely creating a gold rush for lawyers. Courtship is preferable to courtrooms. We are wooing, not suing. But let\u2019s be clear. In my view, those who are repurposing our content without approval are stealing. They are undermining creativity. Counterfeiting is not creating and the AI world is replete with content counterfeiters. I would like to compliment Sam Altman of OpenAI, who has shown a clear understanding of the social importance of journalism. He also appears to have emerged unscathed from his first visit to Davos, where there is always attitude at altitude. We are hopeful that again, News Corp will be able to set meaningful global precedents with digital companies that will assist journalists and journalism, and ensure that gen AI is not fueled by digital dross. We speak of the AI hallucinating, yet we as a society are hallucinating, if we don\u2019t focus firmly on provenance at a time when even the very words misinformation and disinformation have themselves become sources of misinformation and disinformation. Too many media companies are scanning the landscape and presuming that they have a glimpse of the future, and yet they cannot distinguish between trendiness and actual trends. Too many media companies, for too long, have been guilty of the Abilene Paradox. Before I return to the results in detail, I must mention once again our colleague Evan Gershkovich, who continues to be unjustly detained in a Moscow prison. He has been incarcerated for almost a year, solely for being a highly professional journalist. We at News Corp, and of course, Evan\u2019s family and many friends, hope that justice will prevail and that he will be released immediately. I would like to personally thank all those who publicly and not so publicly have been working diligently to secure his emancipation. Turning now to Dow Jones, which yet again achieved its highest level of quarterly revenues and profitability since News Corp\u2019s acquisition. That result is thanks to solid performance across the business, most notably in the increasingly successful professional information business, which remains on track to be the largest contributor to profitability at Dow Jones this fiscal year. The professional information business is seeing robust growth due to the integration of OPIS, which was completed ahead of schedule, and CMA, which is near complete. I would like to compliment in particular the News Corp finance team for masterminding, executing and delivering the OPIS and Base Chemicals deals, which have been so critical to Dow Jones burgeoning growth. Executives at Dow Jones are far from smug and are building a bevy of new and compelling products. For example, OPIS\u2019 Analytics Pro utilizes a database of more than 130,000 fuel stations to track visits and help customers assess their pricing strategies and market trends, as well as compile customer loyalty rates and demographics, among other valuable actionable data points. Meanwhile, risk and compliance\u2019s financial instruments product, in partnership with BigTXN, provides a feed of R&C sanctioned profiles mapped to commonly used financial instruments, which is crucial compliance cartography in a heavily regulated world. And DJ Integrity Check, a partnership with SAPIEN, provides generative AI-driven insight into companies and relevant, potentially problematic individuals. Subscriptions at the news business are continuing to grow and during the month of January, average daily digital subscriptions to Dow Jones portfolio, including the Wall Street Journal, Barron\u2019s, MarketWatch and Investor\u2019s Business Daily, reached over 4.9 million, which represents more than double the pre-COVID average level of 2.4 million digital subscriptions in Q2 fiscal 2020. The acceleration of digital subscription growth has been driven, in part, by the team\u2019s bundling of products, which is designed to increase reader engagement and reduce long-term churn. While we have purposefully shifted emphasis to recurring revenues at Dow Jones, we are happy to report that although we face some challenges in print advertising, digital advertising grew year-over-year for the first time since the first quarter of fiscal 2023. This positive result has been driven primarily by growth in the tech and automotive sectors, and most notably at wsj.com. Digital Real Estate Services had a strong quarter, thanks largely to the prospering of REA, where there was 22% revenue growth year-over-year, fueled by an 8% increase in listings, with heightened activity in the core Melbourne and Sydney markets and higher pricing. REA India continues to expand rapidly and reported over 19 million monthly average unique visitors in December, solidifying its lead as the foremost digital housing platform in the world\u2019s most populous country, where strong economic growth and political stability have created a platform for further expansion. At Move, Realtor.com continued to be affected by the high U.S. interest rates that have undermined activity in the market, but mortgage rates are beginning to moderate and in recent weeks there have been early signs of an increase in all important leads. The National Association of Realtors announced that the index for pending home sales increased just over 8% in December versus the prior year, the largest increase since June 2020. Realtor.com\u2019s latest housing report revealed that January marked the third consecutive month of year-over-year inventory growth, with a 2.8% increase in newly listed homes for sale compared to January 2023. Unique users at Realtor have also stabilized, with December ComScore data signaling a return to growth. During the downturn, the Realtor.com team has been assiduously improving the user experience, broadening the portfolio of products for our customers and bolstering the back-end technology so we are poised to take full advantage of the incipient recovery in the U.S. housing market. HarperCollins had stellar results for the second successive quarter. This was thanks to strength in both the front list and the back list, notably in the blossoming audio books category. We saw 15% digital revenue growth in the quarter, fueled by a 29% audio book sales increase due to a flourishing market and our new partnership with Spotify. Spotify appears to be expanding demand for audio books and opening the category up to new consumers. I would like to commend our thoughtful partner, Daniel Ek, for his commitment to creativity. In Q2, we saw success with bestsellers like The Pioneer Woman Cooks Dinner\u2019s Ready by Ree Drummond, The Little Liar by Mitch Albom, Ann Patchett\u2019s Tom Lake and Barbara Kingsolver\u2019s Demon Copperhead. We also saw strong sales for Christian books, including The Great Disappearance by Dr. David Jeremiah, who is Rapture Ready, and the Bible itself. Looking ahead to Q3, we have great expectations for, among others, A.J. Finn\u2019s End of Story and I Am More Than by LeBron James. At Subscription Video Services, our new streaming aggregation product, Hubbl, is expected to launch next month and improve the search experience for our cherished customers seeking entertainment and sports. We believe Hubbl would be the most effective conduit between consumer and content, and add to the Foxtel success story. In a volatile world, Foxtel has achieved eight consecutive quarters of revenue growth in constant currency, while being acutely and astutely cost-conscious in managing the transition to streaming. At Kayo, we are looking forward to the upcoming winter sports season for Australian Rules Football and Rugby League, the two dominant sports, and at BINGE, there has been early success with advertising at the basic tier, while continuing ad-free service for premium customers. In News Media, our news brands have seen improvement in traffic in recent weeks, a turnaround after convulsions in the first half, where there were algorithmic aberrations. Gratifyingly, we experienced digital subscription growth during the quarter. Rebecca Brooks and her team at News U.K. have overseen continuing progress at the Times and Sunday Times, which set a new record for the quarter in digital subscriptions at 575,000, and saw significant digital ad growth, up 21% on a reported basis and over 15% in local currency. We expect the success of the Times to continue beyond Britain\u2019s borders with the imminent digital launch of the Times in the U.S. We are confident that it will resonate with discerning readers, hungry for objective news coverage in a market saturated with narrative non-journalism. Our News Corp Australia, news.com.au, was again the country\u2019s leading news website, with nearly 13 million monthly uniques in December, according to metrics from Ipsos. And the New York Post is again on course to be profitable and has expanded its positive political influence in these vexed and vexing times. With the strong results in Q2 and Q1, we are off to a sterling start in fiscal year 2024, which follows the three most profitable years for the new News Corp. We can sense that investors are beginning to appreciate keenly the value of our brands and the potential of our portfolio. On behalf of all our investors, we have transformed free cash flow generation, bolstered our balance sheet, initiated a dividend and are continuing our $1 billion buyback plan. For that transformative success, I would like to pay tribute to the strategic support of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, and to our highly engaged directors, and to the commitment of our employees around the world. I am now pleased to turn to my talented colleague, Susan Panuccio, who will elaborate on these buoyant results.\nSusan Panuccio: Thank you, Robert, and good afternoon to everyone. As Robert mentioned, we had a strong second quarter, resulting in first half year-over-year improvements in both profitability and revenues. We continue to transform the company and move towards higher, recurring and digital revenues, together with exercising strong capital allocation discipline and balancing reinvestment across the portfolio with ongoing fixed cost reductions. Our second quarter total revenues were $2.6 billion, up 3% compared to the prior year, an increase from the 1% growth delivered in the first quarter. Adjusted revenues grew 2% compared to the prior year. Total segment EBITDA was $473 million for the quarter, up 16% compared to the prior year, driven by strong performances across our three key growth pillars, Book Publishing, Digital Real Estate Services and Dow Jones, which all posted double-digit profit gains. In fact, in the aggregate, those key segments delivered 24% profitability growth this quarter. Our second quarter total segment EBITDA was also the highest in two years. Adjusted total segment EBITDA grew 14% versus the prior year. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.27, compared to $0.12 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.26 in the quarter, compared to $0.14 in the prior year. Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $419 million, up 9%, a notable improvement from the first quarter rate and a return to revenue growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of financial year 2022. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues rose 8%. Segment EBITDA rose an impressive 15% to $147 million due to a higher contribution from the REA Group partially offset by revenue headwinds at Move. Adjusted segment EBITDA rose a healthy 16%. REA had another very strong quarter with revenues rising 22% year-on-year on a reported basis to a quarterly record of $292 million with minimal impact from foreign exchange. Growth was again primarily driven by residential yield increases, improved growth in national listings, favorable geographic mix and customer contract upgrades. Overall, new buy listings rose approximately 8% with Melbourne up 24% and Sydney up 22%. Please refer to REA\u2019s earnings release and their conference call, which will commence directly after hours, for more details. Moves revenues of $127 million were down 13% compared to the prior year, with declines moderating from recent quarters. For the quarter, Real Estate revenues fell 14% driven by lower lead and transaction volumes, reflective of the broader industry trends. Lead volumes fell 7% year-over-year, with December improving to down just 2%, benefiting from a combination of easier comparisons as well as recent declines in mortgage rates. Average monthly unique users for the quarter were flat compared to the prior year at 66 million. The U.S. housing environment remains tough, with existing home sales hitting 30-year lows, although we are hopeful the market will start to show improvement in the second half given recent declines in mortgage rates. That said, irrespective of any market considerations, we are determined to strengthen Realtor.com\u2019s product and content offering so it\u2019s best positioned for success when the housing market improves. To that end, the Realtor.com team is focused on executing several key strategic priorities, which include modernizing the technology platform to help with unifying the customer experience across all platforms, creating unique and scaled data for proprietary content to assist with increased personalization, leveraging News Corp\u2019s network in relation to AI initiatives and capturing audience share and accelerating the diversification of revenues with a greater focus on the sell-side offering. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment, revenues for the quarter were $470 million, up 2% compared to the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 3% versus the prior year. Streaming revenues accounted for 29% of circulation and subscription revenues versus 26% in the prior year. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group were over 4.3 million at quarter end, flat with the prior year. Total paid streaming subscribers were 2.8 million, increasing 4% versus the prior year, although declining sequentially due to seasonality at Kayo, tougher financial conditions caused by the inflationary environment for consumers and a weaker sports cycle. Foxtel ended the quarter with 1.3 million residential broadcast subscribers, down 9% year-over-year. Broadcast churn was flat at 12.9% despite the final migration off cable in October, while broadcast ARPU rose 3% to approximately AU$86, helped in part by a price rise for non-platinum subscribers implemented in July. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $77 million was down 14% versus the prior year, driven by contractual price escalators in Foxtel sports rights agreements and $10 million related to the upcoming launch of Hubbl, partially offset by higher revenues and lower technology and marketing costs. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 13%. Moving on to Dow Jones. As Robert mentioned, the second quarter results delivered the highest quarterly revenue and segment EBITDA performance since the acquisition of Dow Jones over 15 years ago. Dow Jones delivered revenues of $584 million, up 4% year-over-year, which made Dow Jones the highest segment revenue contributor for the quarter for the first time since it was re-segmented. Digital revenues accounted for 78% of total revenues this quarter, up 2 percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription-based revenues represented almost 76% of total revenues, up approximately 2 percentage points from the prior year, reinforcing the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. On an adjusted basis, revenues grew 3%. We saw very strong growth at PIB, with revenues rising 13% year-over-year, including 16% growth at risk and compliance to $72 million and 15% growth at Dow Jones Energy to $62 million. Factiva again posted growth, benefiting from a new licensing deal. Total PIB retention rates remained very strong at over 90%. We are continuing to review our disclosures, with the primary focus on increasing transparency to help the market appropriately value Dow Jones. To that end, we are now providing revenues for both risk and compliance and Dow Jones Energy in the 10Q. Within the Dow Jones consumer business, circulation revenues were flat versus the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions growing 15% year-over-year or by 135,000 sequentially, driven by an increased focus on the Dow Jones bundling offer as they look to better leverage subscription acquisition costs across multiple products, capitalize on minimal overlap between products and drive greater engagement. Bundling accounted for over 70% of the incremental digital-only volume growth in quarter two. Advertising revenues declined 4% to $126 million, relatively stable with the first quarter rate, although digital returned to year-over-year revenue growth for the first time since the first quarter of financial year 2023, rising 1% driven by strength in the technology and auto categories. Print declined 11% due to weaknesses in financial services. Digital represented 62% of advertising revenues, up 59% last year. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 17% to $163 million and was the largest segment EBITDA contributor, with margins improving 320 basis points to 27.9%, driven by the strong B2B performance, which remains on track to be the largest contributor to Dow Jones profitability in fiscal 2024. Costs declined about 1%, driven by headcount reductions and lower newsprint production and distribution costs, in addition to phasing of sales and marketing expenditure. At Book Publishing, financial performance again meaningfully exceeded our expectations, particularly in profitability. Revenues were $550 million, up 4%, while segment EBITDA improved 67% to $85 million compared to the prior year. Margins increased by almost 600 basis points to 15.5%. The strong performance this quarter benefited from the success of some key front list titles, as Robert mentioned, and saw improvement in backlist sales, including a notable increase from Christian Publishing. Return rates again improved materially due to better sell-through compared to last year, while inventory levels appear to have normalized across our distribution network. Inflationary costs moderated, with lower manufacturing costs, helped by product mix and lower freight and distribution costs this quarter. The backlist contributed 60% of revenues, up from 57% last year, while digital sales rose 15% this quarter and accounted for 21% of consumer sales. Downloadable audio accounted for nearly 50% of digital sales, a record high, and we are pleased with the early positive signs from our partnership with Spotify, which generated incremental digital revenues and EBITDA this quarter. As way of background, Spotify is a usage-based model, not a pooled model. On an adjusted basis, revenues gained 2% and segment EBITDA rose 65%. Turning to News Media, performance in the segment was more challenged. Revenues were $563 million, down 3% versus the prior year, while adjusted revenues declined 5%. Advertising declined 9% and was down 11% in constant currency, while circulation and subscription rose 5% and was up 2% in constant currency, benefiting from cover price increases. Advertising remained particularly challenged, with digital advertising trends again negatively impacted by the lower traffic at several mastheads related to changes in algorithms at the large platforms. That said, as Robert noted, encouragingly, we are seeing some recovery in recent weeks, particularly at the Sun in the U.S. Segment EBITDA of $52 million declined $7 million, which was due to the lower revenue partly offset by lower print volume and newsprint expense and lower spend at TalkTV. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 15%. As for the outlook, similar to our comments last quarter, it is challenging to forecast in the short-term, albeit economic conditions vary across markets. Looking at each of our segments, at Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for January grew 12%. Please refer to REA for more specific outlook commentary. At Move, we hope to see continued improvements in lead volumes, with January up 1% year-over-year, given recent declines in borrowing costs, albeit off low prior year comparisons. As we mentioned last quarter, we are expecting some reinvestment in marketing and product development in the second half, increasing from depressed levels last year, which will be partially offset by cost reductions elsewhere. In Subscription Video Services, as mentioned last quarter, we continue to expect modestly higher expenses for the full year. Ongoing inflationary pressures, fewer new releases across entertainment due to the writers and actors strike, and a weaker summer sports schedule has created some softness in streaming revenues, which may impact full year profitability in local currency. At Dow Jones, we expect strong revenue and profitability performance, underpinned by the transformation of our B2B offerings, and as mentioned previously, continue to expect modestly higher overall expenses for the full year. At Book Publishing, overall industry revenue trends remain relatively stable and we are encouraged by the strength in the downloadable audio. We continue to expect margins to improve versus the prior year. At News Media, advertising revenue trends remain challenging, particularly in Australia and we will continue to focus on ongoing cost efficiencies. Finally, given the current spot rate for the Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar, we do expect some negative translation in the third quarter. With that, let me hand it over to the Operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Karnovsky from JPMorgan.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I\u2019ll ask the AI topic. Robert, you noted in the release you expect to be a core content provider for gen AI companies. Maybe you can speak a bit to current negotiations. What are the key sticking points, key priorities for you or even the red lines for News Corp as you engage on this?\nRobert Thomson: Yes. David, obviously, these are confidential negotiations and so I can\u2019t go into too much detail. I mean, it is fair to say that we\u2019ve been leading the intellectual debate among media companies on AI, and also fair to say that we\u2019re probably leading the commercial discussions. I mean, 17 years ago, when prestige-craving media executives were sashaying with Silicon Valley, we were raising doubts, doubts about provenance, but also about the baleful impact on vulnerable young people, the smartest engineers on the planet, creating compulsive, addictive experiences. Anyway, we\u2019re certainly not naive as well about the potentially positive and negative impacts of AI on our journalism, our creativity, our content. We\u2019ve had almost two decades of distribution dominating creation and almost 60% or so of journalists have lost jobs in the U.S. And candidly, unfortunately, a certain percentage of that is down to journalistic pomposity and prize consciousness, not audience consciousness and relevance consciousness. But AI is a hyper-effective form of or gen AI is a hyper-effective form of derivative distribution. It\u2019s retrospective, not prospective, and the thoughtful AI companies understand that fact, and so that\u2019s why on this occasion, I would like to highlight the thoughtfulness of Sam Altman. Thoughtful people do understand that counterfeiting is not creating, and crucially, in this exceedingly erratic era, we have deep facts, not deep fakes.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, David. Leila, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Entcho Raykovski from Evans & Partners.\nEntcho Raykovski: Hi, Robert. Hi, Susan. Maybe if I can pick up on the generative AI question as well. I appreciate there\u2019s only so much you can say, but how do you think about the potential payments which could come for the value of your content relative to what you\u2019re currently receiving from the digital platforms? Is it a similar sort of quantum, could it be even a greater quantum over time? At least on a relative basis, I\u2019d be interested in how you\u2019re thinking about it. And longer term, do you expect that those payments from the digital platforms will continue to come through? Thank you.\nRobert Thomson: Entcho, I\u2019m sorry to be a basic, but I simply can\u2019t comment on the content of the negotiations. But I can say they\u2019re at an advanced stage and we are dealing with willing partners.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Entcho. Leila, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kane Hannan from Goldman Sachs.\nKane Hannan: Good morning, guys. Thank you. Maybe just Dow Jones. I think the costs were down about $3 million in the quarter. We can talk a bit more about the Dow Jones cost base, whether we can extrapolate that sort of performance going forward. And maybe to follow on to that, just the professional information services within Dow Jones. I mean, obviously, appreciate the extra disclosure. Did that business see margin expansion in the quarter or is the strong margin expansion for Dow Jones overall more of a mix and cost out in the other businesses?\nSusan Panuccio: Hi, Kane. Welcome back. Just in relation to the cost, we did see a pretty good cost performance for the first half of Dow Jones and I think like all our businesses, they are pretty cost focused. So they do constantly have a look at transformation opportunities within the business and they certainly participated in the 5% headcount reduction and they\u2019re getting the benefit of that. But like all the businesses, we do like to invest in them. So we do see variable costs going up as the revenue scales. They\u2019ve had inflationary costs in relation to headcount and will continue to invest in headcount given the growth in that business. And the second half of the year, we would expect to see some phasing and additional costs coming through for marketing. We do tend to have seasonally higher net ads in the second half than we do in the first half and so that typically warrants some additional marketing costs. So that\u2019s sort of in relation to the cost base. And then in relation to PIB, we don\u2019t give out the margins, as you know. But the PIB margins did improve for the quarter, which was really pleasing to see as they continue to scale that business. And as we said in our prepared remarks, for the full year, we\u2019re continuing to expect to see the majority of the profit come from the PIB segment.\nRobert Thomson: Yeah. And just to supplement Susan\u2019s answer, obviously, PIB is a priority for Dow Jones and for News Corp. And we are providing more visibility overall about Dow Jones because it\u2019s such a positive story, and frankly, the more you see, the more you\u2019ll like. I mean, overall, the margin at Dow Jones has risen from 24.7% a year ago to 27.9% and now that we\u2019re lapping the purchases of OPIS and CMA, the strong growth rates are clear at these companies, which we have grouped into Dow Jones Energy, where revenues expanded by 15% and it is also, though, worth noting the results of the always burgeoning risk and compliance segment where revenues rose 16%. In short, these are high margin recurring businesses providing essential services and thus have renewal rates well north of 90%.\nMichael Florin: Thank you very much. Leila, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research.\nCraig Huber: Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask on a portfolio review and simplification announcement that you mentioned three months ago and you briefly touched on it today. Can you just give us a further update? I\u2019m just curious on the timing of this. I mean, I personally didn\u2019t expect a major announcement within just this first three months. But also, the flip side, I wouldn\u2019t expect it to take another six-plus months from this stage going forward. Can you just give investors a little sense of the timing there and I assume you guys did an awful lot of work behind the scenes before you even talked about it three months ago in your conference call. You\u2019ve certainly done some -- I\u2019m sure some, in this last three months. Just give us a little sense of the timing when we might get an announcement here, please? Thank you.\nRobert Thomson: Craig, your presumption about preparation is not ill-conceived. But this being a rather sophisticated audience, one which understands the nuances of phrases and the subtleties of the SEC, you can take the words I used in my statement as purposefully delivered. There is clearly much introspection, not casual, not peripheral, but significant, serious introspection about structure, and it\u2019s functional, not emotional. And the prevailing truth is that we have created options for our shareholders and that\u2019s a tribute to all at News Corp, with the active support of an enlightened Board and leadership from Rupert and Lachlan, and the efforts of our employees around the world. Let us not forget that misguided investment bankers were decidedly downbeat at the time of the split a decade ago. And now, however, the discussion is how to get full value from, how to fully monetize a precious, prestigious portfolio that has an obvious growth trajectory. That is indeed not an evolution, but a revolution.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Craig. Leila, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lucy Huang from UBS.\nLucy Huang: Good morning, Rob and Susan. My question\u2019s on PIB as well. Given we\u2019re kind of getting through the end of the integration of OPIS and CMA, just wondering strategically how you\u2019re thinking about the growth in business and are there any other data sets that you would be looking to maybe build out or acquire over time? Are there intentions or I guess capabilities you\u2019ll like to plug with PIB?\nRobert Thomson: Lucy, obviously, we\u2019re pleased with the progress of the PIB business, and as I said, you can see the overall increase in margin at Dow Jones and that is to a large extent due to the success of the PIB businesses. I can\u2019t go into any more details about what plans are, but needless to say, PIB is core to Dow Jones and its core to News Corp.\nSusan Panuccio: And Lucy, what I can say is that, the thing that\u2019s great about PIB and the Energy businesses is that the new products can leverage the existing data sets that we have, so the pricing, reporting, analytics and newsletters, and they can draw off a lot of the core data that we have. So I think that\u2019s fantastic. And I think Robert\u2019s mentioned in previous quarters, we\u2019ve got areas like renewables that are coming in that we really think that could provide an exciting opportunity for us.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Lucy. Leila, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Han from Morningstar.\nBrian Han: Susan, I noticed the second quarter PCP growth in books EBITDA is exactly the same as the first quarter PCP growth, both exactly, I think, two-thirds up on prior period. Is there some sort of a contracted step up in earnings for books or is that just pure coincidence?\nSusan Panuccio: I\u2019d like to think there would be at that level, but no, no, I think, it\u2019s just a coincidence. As we sort of said in the remarks, the Book Publishing segment has continued to exceed our expectations. And look, it\u2019s partly because we\u2019ve had a return to more stability in the revenue post-COVID. So the returns have settled down and the market has settled down a little bit. And it\u2019s also partly because of the great work that the HarperCollins team has done in relation to their cost base in the face of some pretty challenging conditions last year. They also took the opportunity to push through some price rises on books. So a combination of all of that has really helped with putting the good results in for the first half. Look, I think across the full year, we\u2019re still expecting margins to be sort of in low-double digits, a good improvement from the prior year, but probably not to the levels that we\u2019ve seen in the first half.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Brian. Leila, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darren Leung from Macquarie.\nDarren Leung: Hi, guys. Thanks for the opportunity. I just wanted to ask a bit about the cost out program. Can you give us a feel as to how much has been completed so far this fiscal year of the previous $160 million number? And just a feel for, you know, do you expect more of it to be weighted in third quarter or fourth quarter or maybe another way to answer the question is, what divisions should we expect to see a lot of this cost out come from, please?\nSusan Panuccio: Yeah. Look, we are -- it\u2019s pleasing to say that actually we quoted I think $160 million number in relation to that cost out program and we are going to exceed that number. And actually, from a run rate perspective, we\u2019re pretty much there already. We have said in previous statements, though, that\u2019s the gross cost savings. And we do have reinvestments across our businesses, as you can see, within Dow Jones, within our REA, we\u2019re investing in new Foxtel with the Hubbl launch. And so that is the gross cost savings. What I would say is, notwithstanding that, we are always looking at cost savings across our businesses and so that was pertaining just to headcount reductions. We\u2019re constantly looking at our cost space and our workflows and our efficiencies, and we do continue to drive greater savings than that, which helps us reinvest in these businesses.\nRobert Thomson: And Darren, I\u2019d just like to supplement Susan\u2019s point where we are not going to let these excellent results in any way induce complacency in the company. All the teams are extremely cost conscious and we already are seeing very interesting trends in the ability of AI to reduce costs related to technology spend, to the creation of code, to the cultivation of code. And so not only are we going to be pursuing conventional costs, but we\u2019re looking ahead and trying to make the most of new developments.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Darren. Leila, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] At this time, we have no further questions. I\u2019ll now hand over to Michael Florin for closing remarks.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Leila, and thank you all for participating. Have a wonderful day and we will talk to you soon. Take care.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Susan Panuccio",
            "content": "Thank you, Robert, and good afternoon to everyone. As Robert mentioned, we had a strong second quarter, resulting in first half year-over-year improvements in both profitability and revenues. We continue to transform the company and move towards higher, recurring and digital revenues, together with exercising strong capital allocation discipline and balancing reinvestment across the portfolio with ongoing fixed cost reductions. Our second quarter total revenues were $2.6 billion, up 3% compared to the prior year, an increase from the 1% growth delivered in the first quarter. Adjusted revenues grew 2% compared to the prior year. Total segment EBITDA was $473 million for the quarter, up 16% compared to the prior year, driven by strong performances across our three key growth pillars, Book Publishing, Digital Real Estate Services and Dow Jones, which all posted double-digit profit gains. In fact, in the aggregate, those key segments delivered 24% profitability growth this quarter. Our second quarter total segment EBITDA was also the highest in two years. Adjusted total segment EBITDA grew 14% versus the prior year. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.27, compared to $0.12 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.26 in the quarter, compared to $0.14 in the prior year. Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $419 million, up 9%, a notable improvement from the first quarter rate and a return to revenue growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of financial year 2022. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues rose 8%. Segment EBITDA rose an impressive 15% to $147 million due to a higher contribution from the REA Group partially offset by revenue headwinds at Move. Adjusted segment EBITDA rose a healthy 16%. REA had another very strong quarter with revenues rising 22% year-on-year on a reported basis to a quarterly record of $292 million with minimal impact from foreign exchange. Growth was again primarily driven by residential yield increases, improved growth in national listings, favorable geographic mix and customer contract upgrades. Overall, new buy listings rose approximately 8% with Melbourne up 24% and Sydney up 22%. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call, which will commence directly after hours, for more details. Moves revenues of $127 million were down 13% compared to the prior year, with declines moderating from recent quarters. For the quarter, Real Estate revenues fell 14% driven by lower lead and transaction volumes, reflective of the broader industry trends. Lead volumes fell 7% year-over-year, with December improving to down just 2%, benefiting from a combination of easier comparisons as well as recent declines in mortgage rates. Average monthly unique users for the quarter were flat compared to the prior year at 66 million. The U.S. housing environment remains tough, with existing home sales hitting 30-year lows, although we are hopeful the market will start to show improvement in the second half given recent declines in mortgage rates. That said, irrespective of any market considerations, we are determined to strengthen Realtor.com's product and content offering so it's best positioned for success when the housing market improves. To that end, the Realtor.com team is focused on executing several key strategic priorities, which include modernizing the technology platform to help with unifying the customer experience across all platforms, creating unique and scaled data for proprietary content to assist with increased personalization, leveraging News Corp's network in relation to AI initiatives and capturing audience share and accelerating the diversification of revenues with a greater focus on the sell-side offering. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment, revenues for the quarter were $470 million, up 2% compared to the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 3% versus the prior year. Streaming revenues accounted for 29% of circulation and subscription revenues versus 26% in the prior year. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group were over 4.3 million at quarter end, flat with the prior year. Total paid streaming subscribers were 2.8 million, increasing 4% versus the prior year, although declining sequentially due to seasonality at Kayo, tougher financial conditions caused by the inflationary environment for consumers and a weaker sports cycle. Foxtel ended the quarter with 1.3 million residential broadcast subscribers, down 9% year-over-year. Broadcast churn was flat at 12.9% despite the final migration off cable in October, while broadcast ARPU rose 3% to approximately AU$86, helped in part by a price rise for non-platinum subscribers implemented in July. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $77 million was down 14% versus the prior year, driven by contractual price escalators in Foxtel sports rights agreements and $10 million related to the upcoming launch of Hubbl, partially offset by higher revenues and lower technology and marketing costs. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 13%. Moving on to Dow Jones. As Robert mentioned, the second quarter results delivered the highest quarterly revenue and segment EBITDA performance since the acquisition of Dow Jones over 15 years ago. Dow Jones delivered revenues of $584 million, up 4% year-over-year, which made Dow Jones the highest segment revenue contributor for the quarter for the first time since it was re-segmented. Digital revenues accounted for 78% of total revenues this quarter, up 2 percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription-based revenues represented almost 76% of total revenues, up approximately 2 percentage points from the prior year, reinforcing the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. On an adjusted basis, revenues grew 3%. We saw very strong growth at PIB, with revenues rising 13% year-over-year, including 16% growth at risk and compliance to $72 million and 15% growth at Dow Jones Energy to $62 million. Factiva again posted growth, benefiting from a new licensing deal. Total PIB retention rates remained very strong at over 90%. We are continuing to review our disclosures, with the primary focus on increasing transparency to help the market appropriately value Dow Jones. To that end, we are now providing revenues for both risk and compliance and Dow Jones Energy in the 10Q. Within the Dow Jones consumer business, circulation revenues were flat versus the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions growing 15% year-over-year or by 135,000 sequentially, driven by an increased focus on the Dow Jones bundling offer as they look to better leverage subscription acquisition costs across multiple products, capitalize on minimal overlap between products and drive greater engagement. Bundling accounted for over 70% of the incremental digital-only volume growth in quarter two. Advertising revenues declined 4% to $126 million, relatively stable with the first quarter rate, although digital returned to year-over-year revenue growth for the first time since the first quarter of financial year 2023, rising 1% driven by strength in the technology and auto categories. Print declined 11% due to weaknesses in financial services. Digital represented 62% of advertising revenues, up 59% last year. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 17% to $163 million and was the largest segment EBITDA contributor, with margins improving 320 basis points to 27.9%, driven by the strong B2B performance, which remains on track to be the largest contributor to Dow Jones profitability in fiscal 2024. Costs declined about 1%, driven by headcount reductions and lower newsprint production and distribution costs, in addition to phasing of sales and marketing expenditure. At Book Publishing, financial performance again meaningfully exceeded our expectations, particularly in profitability. Revenues were $550 million, up 4%, while segment EBITDA improved 67% to $85 million compared to the prior year. Margins increased by almost 600 basis points to 15.5%. The strong performance this quarter benefited from the success of some key front list titles, as Robert mentioned, and saw improvement in backlist sales, including a notable increase from Christian Publishing. Return rates again improved materially due to better sell-through compared to last year, while inventory levels appear to have normalized across our distribution network. Inflationary costs moderated, with lower manufacturing costs, helped by product mix and lower freight and distribution costs this quarter. The backlist contributed 60% of revenues, up from 57% last year, while digital sales rose 15% this quarter and accounted for 21% of consumer sales. Downloadable audio accounted for nearly 50% of digital sales, a record high, and we are pleased with the early positive signs from our partnership with Spotify, which generated incremental digital revenues and EBITDA this quarter. As way of background, Spotify is a usage-based model, not a pooled model. On an adjusted basis, revenues gained 2% and segment EBITDA rose 65%. Turning to News Media, performance in the segment was more challenged. Revenues were $563 million, down 3% versus the prior year, while adjusted revenues declined 5%. Advertising declined 9% and was down 11% in constant currency, while circulation and subscription rose 5% and was up 2% in constant currency, benefiting from cover price increases. Advertising remained particularly challenged, with digital advertising trends again negatively impacted by the lower traffic at several mastheads related to changes in algorithms at the large platforms. That said, as Robert noted, encouragingly, we are seeing some recovery in recent weeks, particularly at the Sun in the U.S. Segment EBITDA of $52 million declined $7 million, which was due to the lower revenue partly offset by lower print volume and newsprint expense and lower spend at TalkTV. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 15%. As for the outlook, similar to our comments last quarter, it is challenging to forecast in the short-term, albeit economic conditions vary across markets. Looking at each of our segments, at Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for January grew 12%. Please refer to REA for more specific outlook commentary. At Move, we hope to see continued improvements in lead volumes, with January up 1% year-over-year, given recent declines in borrowing costs, albeit off low prior year comparisons. As we mentioned last quarter, we are expecting some reinvestment in marketing and product development in the second half, increasing from depressed levels last year, which will be partially offset by cost reductions elsewhere. In Subscription Video Services, as mentioned last quarter, we continue to expect modestly higher expenses for the full year. Ongoing inflationary pressures, fewer new releases across entertainment due to the writers and actors strike, and a weaker summer sports schedule has created some softness in streaming revenues, which may impact full year profitability in local currency. At Dow Jones, we expect strong revenue and profitability performance, underpinned by the transformation of our B2B offerings, and as mentioned previously, continue to expect modestly higher overall expenses for the full year. At Book Publishing, overall industry revenue trends remain relatively stable and we are encouraged by the strength in the downloadable audio. We continue to expect margins to improve versus the prior year. At News Media, advertising revenue trends remain challenging, particularly in Australia and we will continue to focus on ongoing cost efficiencies. Finally, given the current spot rate for the Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar, we do expect some negative translation in the third quarter. With that, let me hand it over to the Operator for Q&A. Hi, Kane. Welcome back. Just in relation to the cost, we did see a pretty good cost performance for the first half of Dow Jones and I think like all our businesses, they are pretty cost focused. So they do constantly have a look at transformation opportunities within the business and they certainly participated in the 5% headcount reduction and they're getting the benefit of that. But like all the businesses, we do like to invest in them. So we do see variable costs going up as the revenue scales. They've had inflationary costs in relation to headcount and will continue to invest in headcount given the growth in that business. And the second half of the year, we would expect to see some phasing and additional costs coming through for marketing. We do tend to have seasonally higher net ads in the second half than we do in the first half and so that typically warrants some additional marketing costs. So that's sort of in relation to the cost base. And then in relation to PIB, we don't give out the margins, as you know. But the PIB margins did improve for the quarter, which was really pleasing to see as they continue to scale that business. And as we said in our prepared remarks, for the full year, we're continuing to expect to see the majority of the profit come from the PIB segment. And Lucy, what I can say is that, the thing that's great about PIB and the Energy businesses is that the new products can leverage the existing data sets that we have, so the pricing, reporting, analytics and newsletters, and they can draw off a lot of the core data that we have. So I think that's fantastic. And I think Robert's mentioned in previous quarters, we've got areas like renewables that are coming in that we really think that could provide an exciting opportunity for us. I'd like to think there would be at that level, but no, no, I think, it's just a coincidence. As we sort of said in the remarks, the Book Publishing segment has continued to exceed our expectations. And look, it's partly because we've had a return to more stability in the revenue post-COVID. So the returns have settled down and the market has settled down a little bit. And it's also partly because of the great work that the HarperCollins team has done in relation to their cost base in the face of some pretty challenging conditions last year. They also took the opportunity to push through some price rises on books. So a combination of all of that has really helped with putting the good results in for the first half. Look, I think across the full year, we're still expecting margins to be sort of in low-double digits, a good improvement from the prior year, but probably not to the levels that we've seen in the first half. Yeah. Look, we are -- it's pleasing to say that actually we quoted I think $160 million number in relation to that cost out program and we are going to exceed that number. And actually, from a run rate perspective, we're pretty much there already. We have said in previous statements, though, that's the gross cost savings. And we do have reinvestments across our businesses, as you can see, within Dow Jones, within our REA, we're investing in new Foxtel with the Hubbl launch. And so that is the gross cost savings.

            "name": "Robert Thomson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. For the second quarter in succession, News Corp has achieved growth in both revenue and profitability, and we believe there are strong prospects for further growth as difficult, inauspicious macro conditions ease in some of our markets. We saw particularly robust results across the three core pillars of our company, Dow Jones, Book Publishing and Digital Real Estate Services, where there was resounding improvement in Australia in Q2 and there are early signs of recovery in the U.S. residential sector after the most sluggish market conditions in almost three decades. Given the potential of our world-leading brands, we remain intent on creating long-term value for investors, and, as part of that commitment, our diligent, concerted review of the company's structure continues apace. Looking at the topline results, News Corp's second quarter revenues rose 3% to $2.6 billion and profitability surged 16%, marking the third consecutive quarter of profit growth in testing economic times. Our net income for the quarter rose to $183 million from $94 million in the same quarter last year, while our reported EPS was $0.27 against $0.12 for the same period last year. The company's digital progress and prowess are increasingly evident. Halfway through fiscal 2024, digital now comprises approximately 52% of all revenues. That is more than an e-evolution, it is an e-revolution, one that has touched and transformed every element of every business and we are far from satisfied, far from complacent, far from completion. We are seeing the collective benefit of our conscious strategic shift away from potentially volatile advertising revenues to growth in circulation and subscription revenues. In fiscal 2014, nearly half of News Corp revenues were from advertising, with 31% from circulation and subscriptions. There has been a fundamental metamorphosis. In the first half of the fiscal year, advertising had receded to 16%, with circulation and subscriptions surging to 44%. Overall, News Corp, as of Q2, had over 7 million subscriptions to our news brands, including the Wall Street Journal, Barron's, The Times and Sunday Times, The Australian and other publications. And we have an additional 4.3 million paid subscribers at Foxtel in Australia, which includes our popular streaming services Kayo and BINGE. And those figures don't include the growing number of loyal subscribers at our professional information business at Dow Jones, where the average retention rate is comfortably above 90%. Artificial intelligence, with all its permutations and perturbations, will play an increasingly important role at most businesses. We expect to be a core content provider for generative AI companies who need the highest quality, timely content to ensure the relevance of their products. The Corny, Kellogg, Cliche\u0301 is that AI companies are selling the picks and shovels during this seeming gold rush. Well, we are selectively reselling gold nuggets and those crucial negotiations are at an advanced stage. It is reassuring that certain digital companies appreciate the value of integrity, quality and creativity. And while certain other media companies prefer litigation, we prefer consultation, as the former is merely creating a gold rush for lawyers. Courtship is preferable to courtrooms. We are wooing, not suing. But let's be clear. In my view, those who are repurposing our content without approval are stealing. They are undermining creativity. Counterfeiting is not creating and the AI world is replete with content counterfeiters. I would like to compliment Sam Altman of OpenAI, who has shown a clear understanding of the social importance of journalism. He also appears to have emerged unscathed from his first visit to Davos, where there is always attitude at altitude. We are hopeful that again, News Corp will be able to set meaningful global precedents with digital companies that will assist journalists and journalism, and ensure that gen AI is not fueled by digital dross. We speak of the AI hallucinating, yet we as a society are hallucinating, if we don't focus firmly on provenance at a time when even the very words misinformation and disinformation have themselves become sources of misinformation and disinformation. Too many media companies are scanning the landscape and presuming that they have a glimpse of the future, and yet they cannot distinguish between trendiness and actual trends. Too many media companies, for too long, have been guilty of the Abilene Paradox. Before I return to the results in detail, I must mention once again our colleague Evan Gershkovich, who continues to be unjustly detained in a Moscow prison. He has been incarcerated for almost a year, solely for being a highly professional journalist. We at News Corp, and of course, Evan's family and many friends, hope that justice will prevail and that he will be released immediately. I would like to personally thank all those who publicly and not so publicly have been working diligently to secure his emancipation. Turning now to Dow Jones, which yet again achieved its highest level of quarterly revenues and profitability since News Corp's acquisition. That result is thanks to solid performance across the business, most notably in the increasingly successful professional information business, which remains on track to be the largest contributor to profitability at Dow Jones this fiscal year. The professional information business is seeing robust growth due to the integration of OPIS, which was completed ahead of schedule, and CMA, which is near complete. I would like to compliment in particular the News Corp finance team for masterminding, executing and delivering the OPIS and Base Chemicals deals, which have been so critical to Dow Jones burgeoning growth. Executives at Dow Jones are far from smug and are building a bevy of new and compelling products. For example, OPIS' Analytics Pro utilizes a database of more than 130,000 fuel stations to track visits and help customers assess their pricing strategies and market trends, as well as compile customer loyalty rates and demographics, among other valuable actionable data points. Meanwhile, risk and compliance's financial instruments product, in partnership with BigTXN, provides a feed of R&C sanctioned profiles mapped to commonly used financial instruments, which is crucial compliance cartography in a heavily regulated world. And DJ Integrity Check, a partnership with SAPIEN, provides generative AI-driven insight into companies and relevant, potentially problematic individuals. Subscriptions at the news business are continuing to grow and during the month of January, average daily digital subscriptions to Dow Jones portfolio, including the Wall Street Journal, Barron's, MarketWatch and Investor's Business Daily, reached over 4.9 million, which represents more than double the pre-COVID average level of 2.4 million digital subscriptions in Q2 fiscal 2020. The acceleration of digital subscription growth has been driven, in part, by the team's bundling of products, which is designed to increase reader engagement and reduce long-term churn. While we have purposefully shifted emphasis to recurring revenues at Dow Jones, we are happy to report that although we face some challenges in print advertising, digital advertising grew year-over-year for the first time since the first quarter of fiscal 2023. This positive result has been driven primarily by growth in the tech and automotive sectors, and most notably at wsj.com. Digital Real Estate Services had a strong quarter, thanks largely to the prospering of REA, where there was 22% revenue growth year-over-year, fueled by an 8% increase in listings, with heightened activity in the core Melbourne and Sydney markets and higher pricing. REA India continues to expand rapidly and reported over 19 million monthly average unique visitors in December, solidifying its lead as the foremost digital housing platform in the world's most populous country, where strong economic growth and political stability have created a platform for further expansion. At Move, Realtor.com continued to be affected by the high U.S. interest rates that have undermined activity in the market, but mortgage rates are beginning to moderate and in recent weeks there have been early signs of an increase in all important leads. The National Association of Realtors announced that the index for pending home sales increased just over 8% in December versus the prior year, the largest increase since June 2020. Realtor.com's latest housing report revealed that January marked the third consecutive month of year-over-year inventory growth, with a 2.8% increase in newly listed homes for sale compared to January 2023. Unique users at Realtor have also stabilized, with December ComScore data signaling a return to growth. During the downturn, the Realtor.com team has been assiduously improving the user experience, broadening the portfolio of products for our customers and bolstering the back-end technology so we are poised to take full advantage of the incipient recovery in the U.S. housing market. HarperCollins had stellar results for the second successive quarter. This was thanks to strength in both the front list and the back list, notably in the blossoming audio books category. We saw 15% digital revenue growth in the quarter, fueled by a 29% audio book sales increase due to a flourishing market and our new partnership with Spotify. Spotify appears to be expanding demand for audio books and opening the category up to new consumers. I would like to commend our thoughtful partner, Daniel Ek, for his commitment to creativity. In Q2, we saw success with bestsellers like The Pioneer Woman Cooks Dinner's Ready by Ree Drummond, The Little Liar by Mitch Albom, Ann Patchett's Tom Lake and Barbara Kingsolver's Demon Copperhead. We also saw strong sales for Christian books, including The Great Disappearance by Dr. David Jeremiah, who is Rapture Ready, and the Bible itself. Looking ahead to Q3, we have great expectations for, among others, A.J. Finn's End of Story and I Am More Than by LeBron James. At Subscription Video Services, our new streaming aggregation product, Hubbl, is expected to launch next month and improve the search experience for our cherished customers seeking entertainment and sports. We believe Hubbl would be the most effective conduit between consumer and content, and add to the Foxtel success story. In a volatile world, Foxtel has achieved eight consecutive quarters of revenue growth in constant currency, while being acutely and astutely cost-conscious in managing the transition to streaming. At Kayo, we are looking forward to the upcoming winter sports season for Australian Rules Football and Rugby League, the two dominant sports, and at BINGE, there has been early success with advertising at the basic tier, while continuing ad-free service for premium customers. In News Media, our news brands have seen improvement in traffic in recent weeks, a turnaround after convulsions in the first half, where there were algorithmic aberrations. Gratifyingly, we experienced digital subscription growth during the quarter. Rebecca Brooks and her team at News U.K. have overseen continuing progress at the Times and Sunday Times, which set a new record for the quarter in digital subscriptions at 575,000, and saw significant digital ad growth, up 21% on a reported basis and over 15% in local currency. We expect the success of the Times to continue beyond Britain's borders with the imminent digital launch of the Times in the U.S. We are confident that it will resonate with discerning readers, hungry for objective news coverage in a market saturated with narrative non-journalism. Our News Corp Australia, news.com.au, was again the country's leading news website, with nearly 13 million monthly uniques in December, according to metrics from Ipsos. And the New York Post is again on course to be profitable and has expanded its positive political influence in these vexed and vexing times. With the strong results in Q2 and Q1, we are off to a sterling start in fiscal year 2024, which follows the three most profitable years for the new News Corp. We can sense that investors are beginning to appreciate keenly the value of our brands and the potential of our portfolio. On behalf of all our investors, we have transformed free cash flow generation, bolstered our balance sheet, initiated a dividend and are continuing our $1 billion buyback plan. For that transformative success, I would like to pay tribute to the strategic support of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, and to our highly engaged directors, and to the commitment of our employees around the world. I am now pleased to turn to my talented colleague, Susan Panuccio, who will elaborate on these buoyant results. Yes. David, obviously, these are confidential negotiations and so I can't go into too much detail. I mean, it is fair to say that we've been leading the intellectual debate among media companies on AI, and also fair to say that we're probably leading the commercial discussions. I mean, 17 years ago, when prestige-craving media executives were sashaying with Silicon Valley, we were raising doubts, doubts about provenance, but also about the baleful impact on vulnerable young people, the smartest engineers on the planet, creating compulsive, addictive experiences. Anyway, we're certainly not naive as well about the potentially positive and negative impacts of AI on our journalism, our creativity, our content. We've had almost two decades of distribution dominating creation and almost 60% or so of journalists have lost jobs in the U.S. And candidly, unfortunately, a certain percentage of that is down to journalistic pomposity and prize consciousness, not audience consciousness and relevance consciousness. But AI is a hyper-effective form of or gen AI is a hyper-effective form of derivative distribution. It's retrospective, not prospective, and the thoughtful AI companies understand that fact, and so that's why on this occasion, I would like to highlight the thoughtfulness of Sam Altman. Thoughtful people do understand that counterfeiting is not creating, and crucially, in this exceedingly erratic era, we have deep facts, not deep fakes. Entcho, I'm sorry to be a basic, but I simply can't comment on the content of the negotiations. But I can say they're at an advanced stage and we are dealing with willing partners. Yeah. And just to supplement Susan's answer, obviously, PIB is a priority for Dow Jones and for News Corp. And we are providing more visibility overall about Dow Jones because it's such a positive story, and frankly, the more you see, the more you'll like. I mean, overall, the margin at Dow Jones has risen from 24.7% a year ago to 27.9% and now that we're lapping the purchases of OPIS and CMA, the strong growth rates are clear at these companies, which we have grouped into Dow Jones Energy, where revenues expanded by 15% and it is also, though, worth noting the results of the always burgeoning risk and compliance segment where revenues rose 16%. In short, these are high margin recurring businesses providing essential services and thus have renewal rates well north of 90%. Craig, your presumption about preparation is not ill-conceived. But this being a rather sophisticated audience, one which understands the nuances of phrases and the subtleties of the SEC, you can take the words I used in my statement as purposefully delivered. There is clearly much introspection, not casual, not peripheral, but significant, serious introspection about structure, and it's functional, not emotional. And the prevailing truth is that we have created options for our shareholders and that's a tribute to all at News Corp, with the active support of an enlightened Board and leadership from Rupert and Lachlan, and the efforts of our employees around the world. Let us not forget that misguided investment bankers were decidedly downbeat at the time of the split a decade ago. And now, however, the discussion is how to get full value from, how to fully monetize a precious, prestigious portfolio that has an obvious growth trajectory. That is indeed not an evolution, but a revolution. Lucy, obviously, we're pleased with the progress of the PIB business, and as I said, you can see the overall increase in margin at Dow Jones and that is to a large extent due to the success of the PIB businesses. I can't go into any more details about what plans are, but needless to say, PIB is core to Dow Jones and its core to News Corp. And Darren, I'd just like to supplement Susan's point where we are not going to let these excellent results in any way induce complacency in the company. All the teams are extremely cost conscious and we already are seeing very interesting trends in the ability of AI to reduce costs related to technology spend, to the creation of code, to the cultivation of code. And so not only are we going to be pursuing conventional costs, but we're looking ahead and trying to make the most of new developments."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMichael Florin: Thank you very much, Operator. Hello, everyone. And welcome to News Corp\u2019s fiscal first quarter 2024 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago and it\u2019s now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We will open with some prepared remarks and I will be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp\u2019s business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp\u2019s Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings release for the applicable periods posted on our website. With that, I will pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\nRobert Thomson: Thank you, Mike. In a world replete with uncertainty, News Corp is proud to report rising revenues and increased profitability in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. These distinctly positive results come despite specious macroeconomic conditions including steep interest rates and unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations. The potential for even greater profitability should be even more pronounced when we return to economic equilibrium. These results follow the three most profitable years since the creation of the new News Corp and our digital transformation has continued at pace. And in our view, these results certainly highlight the disparity between the value of our company and our share price, which we believe does not reflect our present profitability yet alone the potential of our incomparable growing businesses. We are acutely focused on enhancing long-term value for all of our investors, and in that quest, have the patent advantage of prized assets, whose value we believe is increasing. We are also assiduously reviewing our structure in the quest to optimize that value. Our first quarter revenues rose modestly to $2.5 billion, while profitability rose 4%, marking the second consecutive quarter of profit growth in these challenging conditions. We believe these positive results are a harbinger of our potential in the medium- and long-term. We expect to continue to drive our digital growth, the scale of which has been transformative over the past decade. It is worth noting a couple of metrics for context and to highlight the intrinsic value of our company. In 2014, print related advertising accounted for 39% of our revenue and now it is trying to get less than 5%, while digital revenues exceeded 50% of revenues last year, up almost 300%. Our loyal investors understand the inherent value of our assets and the scale of our dramatic transition. But we believe the market has yet to fully comprehend the magnitude of the metamorphosis or the future potential of our platform. We have been and expect to continue to generate significant free cash flow this fiscal year and we have a $1 billion buyback plan well underway and ample opportunity to be opportunistic. That opportunistic efficacy, we have shown in our purchases of OPIS and CMA for Dow Jones to high margin digital businesses with recurring revenues which have added much profitable prowess. Their impact means that we are at a pivotal point at our Dow Jones business. The B2B segment at Dow Jones is now outpacing the B2C segment in contributing to profit and at a far higher margin. The net result is that we expect both Dow Jones and News Corporation are becoming more profitable, more digital and even less dependent on the ebb and flow of advertising. That is why we are highlighting the Dow Jones results today and expect to be providing increasing visibility over the coming year. So the potential investors can appreciate the full glory of our valuable assets, while we intensify our institutional introspection on structure. As a reminder, Dow Jones profitability has more than doubled since we re-segmented in fiscal 2020, generating close to $500 million in segment EBITDA last year with strong growth prospects ahead. And the EBITDA margin has been actually transformed. In Q1 fiscal 2018 it was approximately 9%, in Q1 fiscal 2020 it was 12.8% and in Q1 this fiscal year 23.1%. We certainly agree with the perceptive commentators and analysts, who suggest that News Corp is undervalued and its asset quality underappreciated. Our Board, our leaders and our teams deserve much credit for skillfully navigating the turbulent media waters of the past decade. Waters, which have proven treacherous for many media companies. As always, we remain focused on maximizing that value to the benefit of all shareholders. We are also looking into the future in maximizing the value of our premium content for AI. We are in advanced discussions with a range of digital companies that we anticipate will bring significant revenue in return for the use of our unmatched content sets. Generative AI engines are only as sophisticated as their inputs and need constant replenishing to remain relevant and we are proud to partner with responsible purveyors of AI products and their prescient leaders. One observation about Generative AI. We often hear about misinformation and disinformation to the point where the very words become politicized and polluted. The potential for the proselytizing of the perverse will become ever more real with the inevitable inexorable rise of artificial intelligence. But, however, aren\u2019t fully artificial intelligence, it is no match for great reporting and for genuine journalistic nous. On the subject of journalism, I would like to pay tribute to our reporters in the Middle East and in Ukraine who are each day taking calculated risks to bring insight and intelligence to readers around the world during a period of unpredictable turbulence. And I would like to highlight the fate of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter, who has been unjustly incarcerated in Russia for more than seven months nearly for doing his job as a journalist. Let me begin the more detailed extra juices with the increasingly valuable PLS Dow Jones where revenues rose 4% in Q1, despite the volatility of the ad market, while segment EBITDA was lifted by an impressive 10% as revenue and profit contribution continued to expand in the professional information business. Dow Jones offers a unique set of services and products for global business users and readers. As a result, many of our customers encountered Dow Jones products several times each day, not just the Wall Street Journal, Barron\u2019s, MarketWatch and Dow Jones Newswires, but also risk and compliance Dow Jones Energy and Factiva. Risk and compliance revenues surged 23%. Thanks to the increased demand from the financial and corporate sectors seeking to minimize risk and maximize compliance. I trust all of the institutions on the call today aspire to those two worthy goals. RNC has expanded revenues by over 60%, let me repeat that number, over 600% since we relaunched News in 2013. It\u2019s worth emphasizing that the business is fully digital and has retention rates of over 90%. Dow Jones Energy, which includes both OPIS and CMA continues to see excellent double-digit revenue growth, driven in part by higher pricing and is exceeding our initial expectations. Thanks to the global energy transition and opportunities emerging in renewable energy, along with continued reinvestment. Our customer base is growing as we launch compelling products and create critical pricing benchmarks. We are genuinely impressed by the vitality and drive an initiative among our new colleagues at both OPIS and CMA. Factiva is benefiting from its innovative partnership with Cision. And Factiva should be an important building block in the AI future given that it has a database of 33,000 sources in 32 languages from more than 200 countries and territories. That impressive content collection complements our contemporaneous news offerings as we seek to serve corporate, professional and consumer audiences. Across Dow Jones, subscription volume remains strong with digital subscriptions reaching 4.6 million, up 12%, while total subscriptions reached 5.3 million, up 8%. Our teams are focused on reducing churn and maximizing the lifetime value of each and every subscriber. As for advertising, we saw particularly improvement in trends with declines of past quarters abating and digital advertising down only 2%. In Digital Real Estate, it was a tale of two markets during the quarter with the Australian property market improving and the U.S. market still bearing the burden of particularly high mortgage rates which obviously suppressed demand. But it is fair to say that the revenue rebound in the Australian market certainty surpassed the sluggishness in the U.S. market. REA reported strong growth in listing volumes in the two key markets of Sydney and Melbourne, and our value-add clients were keen to subscribe to premium products, thus improving yield. We also saw resounding topline performance and volumes remained strong in October. REA, India is a number one property portal in a country with a rapidly expanding middle class and both its audience and revenue continued to surge during the quarter. As REA has disclosed, the total audience in India in the quarter was up 16% year-over-year, while revenue during the quarter was 25% higher than a year ago. Given a relative political stability in India and ongoing economic growth, REA India is a jewel in the crown. In the U.S. realtor.com like the industry at large was affected by the unusually high interest rates, which do appear to have plateaued and are expected to ease over the coming year. But the short-term conditions do not change our long-term optimism for realtor to capitalize on the increasing digitization of the world\u2019s largest property market. It is easy to buy transient traffic in the short-term, but that is merely a sugar high that leads to digital diabetes. We have a long-term commitment to all Americans who are buying and selling a home and to Real Estate professionals. We also have the ability to leverage our unique media platform from wsj.com to the New York Post among many others, who had a combined monthly audience of over 200 million uniques in September. These are verified authenticated numbers, not a cocktail of cockamania. Under Damian Eales, energetic decisive leadership, realtor is building on the gains of his predecessors and focusing on developing core markets, core clients and core profitability. The realtor team is working even more closely with REA executives in ways that are benefiting both businesses with the sharing of software, marketing mechanics and AI insights. The script for our publishing business was completely rewritten in the first quarter. After a few difficult quarters, segment EBITDA at HarperCollins lifted 67%. Revenues posted a healthy 8% increase and that growth combined with cost initiatives undertaken over the past year and an easing of supply chain inflationary impacts recalibrated the performance at HarperCollins. The logistical upheaval at Amazon has past, return rates are far lower, and both the frontlist and backlist notch gains during the quarter. Among the many and varied strong sellers were Tom Lake by Ann Patchett, Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver, The Collector by Daniel Silva and Remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby Van Pelt. We saw particular strength in our Christian books business, including Reba McEntire\u2019s Not That Fancy. Reba was clearly not describing the HarperCollins performance. And speaking of Christian books, we look forward to publishing a new book His Holiness Pope Francis next spring. I would like to highlight our new partnership with Spotify to broaden the reach of audio books. This is a project we have discussed for some time with the S Mobile [ph] Daniel Ek, with whom I share a passion for books and for the Arsenal Football Club. The new partnership has begun with the U.K. and Australia and in the U.S. announced yesterday, and we are genuinely confident that it will be positive for both companies for authors and for those who love to read and to listen to books. This market has needed a strong new entrant and Daniel and his team are among the most skillful players on the pitch. At Subscription Video Services, revenues were up in constant currency for the seventh consecutive quarter. As expected, the decline in EBITDA was mainly due to sports costs and ForEx fluctuations. But we have no doubt that our streaming strategy has been successful at a time when other companies in other markets are struggling. Overall, paid streaming subscriptions rose 8% on the same quarter last year, while broadcast churn was down from 14.2% to 11.4%, showing that the two products are undoubtedly complementary. But the team at Foxtel is far from complacent and so we are on the cusp of launching our new streaming aggregation product, Hubbell, which will greatly simplify the search for fascinating entertainment and sports from our own companies and from those of our cherished partners to the benefit of all in particular, to the benefit of viewers. The News Media segment faced macroeconomic headwinds and volatility caused by algorithmic changes at the large platforms, but these trends are more femoral than eternal. Subscriptions continue to increase at The Times and Sunday Times, which reported an 8% rise and at News Corp Australia, where we saw a 4% increase in digital subs. As I mentioned earlier, we are increasingly less reliant on advertising, which is now a smaller fraction of our overall revenue and focused on digital recurring revenue streams. We saw strong performance at Wireless in the UK, which had a record 45 million listening hours over the April to September period, up 17% from the prior year, according to RAJAR, led by sports and news. Our teams in the U.K. and Australia were also acutely cost conscious and we are retooling the infrastructure to reflect the contemporary and future initiatives, including printing operations, advertising networks and back office expenses. Rebecca and our teams in the U.K. have been leaders in creating programmatic ad partnerships, which enable all to increase yield and harvest valuable data. This was, in another way, an historic quarter. Our Executive Chair, Rupert Murdoch, announced that he will be transitioning to Chairman Emeritus next week at our AGM. I can personally assure you that there has been no change in his heightened levels of curiosity and energy since the announcement and his vast experience will be an important ongoing resource for the company. All of us at News Corp stand on the shoulders of a giant. And I genuinely look forward to Lachlan becoming sole Chair next week. His thoughtful engagement with our teams already enhances the business each working day and his passion for principal journalism is obvious to all who work with him. There is no doubt that Lachlan\u2019s multidisciplinary expertise and his philosophical integrity will be invaluable as we continue the next phase of our crucial journey. And now our esteemed CFO, Susan Panuccio, will provide more financial granularity.\nSusan Panuccio: Thank you, Robert, and good afternoon, everyone. As Robert mentioned, we are pleased with the positive start to the new fiscal year, returning to revenue growth and posting the second consecutive quarter of profit growth despite the macroeconomic conditions. We have been diligently executing on our long-term plan to drive greater value for our shareholders and believe this is yet to be reflected in our current market value. Our first quarter total revenues were $2.5 billion, up 1% compared to the prior year, marking the first year-over-year revenue growth since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Adjusted revenues also grew 1% compared to the prior year. Total segment EBITDA was $364 million, up 4% compared to the prior year. HarperCollins was the largest contributor to the profit improvement, which is encouraging on the back of last year\u2019s challenging results. Adjusted total segment EBITDA grew 5% versus the prior year. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.05, compared to $0.07 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.16 in the quarter, compared to $0.12 in the prior year. Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $403 million, down 4% compared to the prior year, a notable improvement from the fourth quarter rate. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues declined just 2%. Despite the revenue decline, segment EBITDA rose 3% to $122 million due to higher contribution from the REA Group and cost saving initiatives that move that were partially offset by revenue headwinds. Adjusted segment EBITDA rose a healthy 8%. REA had a very strong quarter with revenues rising 4% year-on-year on a reported basis to $261 million, which included an $11 million or 4% negative impact from foreign exchange. Growth was driven by residential yield increases and growth in national listings, along with 25% revenue growth at REA India. Results were partially offset by a modest decline in Financial Services revenues due to lower settlement activity. Overall, new buy listings rose 1%, with Sydney and Melbourne up 16% and 14%, respectively, enabling upward pressure on yields. Please refer to REA\u2019s earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details. Move\u2019s revenues of $142 million were down 16% compared to the prior year, relatively similar to the fourth quarter trend absent the 53rd-week impact. For the quarter, Real Estate revenues fell 20%, driven by lower lead and transaction volumes reflective of the broader industry trends. Lead volumes fell 11% year-over-year, while realtor\u2019s average monthly unique users declined 12% from the prior year to 76 million in the first quarter based on internal metrics, but improved from 74 million in the fourth quarter. As Robert mentioned, despite challenging market and competitive conditions, we have made solid progress in Q1 across a number of strategic areas including SEO improvements, expanding our sell-side offerings into the launch of a listing agent tool kit, deepening our collaboration with News Corp\u2019s powerful global platform to drive further reach and the recent launch of a new brand campaign. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $486 million, down approximately 3% compared to the prior year on a reported basis due to foreign currency headwinds. Importantly, on an adjusted basis, revenues rose 1% versus the prior year, the seventh consecutive quarter of growth. Streaming revenues accounted for 30% of circulation and subscription revenues versus 25% in the prior year, and again, more than offset broadcast revenue declines benefiting from both a year-over-year increase in subscribers and price rises at Kayo and BINGE. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group reached almost $4.6 million at quarter end, up 2% year-over-year. Total paid streaming subscribers were 3 million, increasing 8% versus the prior year, although declining sequentially impacted by less output at BINGE related to the strikes in Hollywood, as well as typical seasonality at Kayo due to the end of the winter sports codes in September. Foxtel ended the quarter with over 1.3 million residential broadcast subscribers, down 9% year-over-year. Broadcast churn continued to improve, down 280 basis points year-over-year to 11.4%, while broadcast ARPU rose 3% to over A$85 helped in part by a price rise for non-platinum subscribers implemented in July. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $93 million was down 16% versus the prior year driven by contractual price escalators in Foxtel sports rights agreements. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 13%. We completed the debt refinancing in the first quarter, which included securing a new A$1.2 billion credit facility. As we said last quarter, given the improved performance and the completion of the refinancing, this provides a pathway for repayment of our shareholder loans. Moving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones had a strong quarter with revenues of $537 million, up 4% year-over-year despite fully lapping recent acquisitions. Digital revenues accounted for 81% of total revenues this quarter, up 2 percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription-based revenues represented over 81% of total revenues, up approximately 1 percentage point from the prior year, underscoring the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. On an adjusted basis, revenues grew 3%. We are continuing to see very strong growth in our Professional Information business with revenues rising 14% year-over-year driven by risk and compliance and strong gains at Dow Jones Energy. Factiva posted modest growth benefiting from a new licensing deal. Retention across B2B offerings remains at over 90% with nearly all of the revenues recurring. Risk and compliance revenues rose 23% with consistent growth between financials and corporates. Europe remained the largest territory at over 50% of revenues and also the fastest source of growth. Secular trends remain very favorable with global corporations navigating complex sanctions and trade guidance, particularly as it relates to Russia and China. We were really pleased with the 20% growth at Dow Jones Energy, which benefited from price escalators, the rollout of new products and new customers. The results also benefited mid-single digits from one-time items and the World Chemical Forum, a new annual event this quarter, which leveraged the wider Dow Jones experience in corporate events. Circulation revenues gained 1% versus the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions growing 12% year-over-year or 101,000 sequentially, which was principally driven by an increased focus on Dow Jones bundling offer as they look to better leverage subscription acquisition costs across multiple products, capitalize on minimal overlap between products and drive greater engagement from customers. We believe that in the medium-term, bundling will drive higher ARPU per subscriber and reduce long-term churn. Advertising revenues declined 3% to $91 million due to 6% and 2% declines in print and digital advertising revenues, respectively, with trends improving from the fourth quarter. Advertising accounted for 17% of total revenue with 66% being digital, up 100 basis points from last year. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 10% to $124 million with margins improving 120 basis points to 23.1%, the highest first quarter margin since News Corp\u2019s acquisition of Dow Jones, driven by the strong B2B performance, which is on track to be the largest contributor to Dow Jones profitability in fiscal 2024. At Book Publishing, we saw a big recovery from fiscal 2023 results. Revenues were $525 million, up 8%, while segment EBITDA improved 67% to $65 million compared to the prior year. Margins improved over 400 basis points to 12.4%. You will recall the results a year ago were significantly impacted by the Amazon reset of inventory levels and rightsizing of its warehouse footprint. The strong performance this quarter benefited from the success of some key frontlist titles, as Robert mentioned, and also saw improvement in backlist sales, including a notable increase from Christian Publishing. Return rates improved materially, while inventory levels appear to have normalized. Inflationary costs are beginning to moderate with lower manufacturing costs helped by product mix and lower freight and distribution costs this quarter. The backlist contributed 61% of revenues, down from 65% last year, while digital sales rose 3% this quarter and accounted for 22% of consumer sales, within the 22% downloadable audio accounted for 45% of digital revenues. On an adjusted basis, revenues gained 6% and segment EBITDA rose 59%. Turning to News Media. Overall trends continue to be mixed geographically. Revenues were $548 million, down 1% versus the prior year, while adjusted revenues declined 2%. Advertising declined 5% and was down 6% in constant currency, while circulation and subscription rose 2% and was flat in constant currency. At News Australia, advertising saw some improvement compared to the fourth quarter, while the U.K. weakened notably in digital. As Robert mentioned, we did see declines in our traffic at several mastheads related to changes in algorithms at the large platforms which we are monitoring closely and have been felt across the wider publishing industry. Segment EBITDA of $14 million declined $4 million, results included approximately $3 million related to one-time costs as a result of the proposed combination of printing operations in the U.K. with DMG. This initiative demonstrates the continued focus on driving cost efficiencies across our News Media businesses. Before we look at the outlook for the next quarter, I would like to touch on free cash flow. First quarter free cash flow is typically lower due to the timing of working capital payments, including sports rights payments at Foxtel, and this year, it was also impacted from the lower HarperCollins sales in Q4 of the prior year. We anticipate generating strong and positive free cash flow for the year weighted to the second half consistent with prior years. As for the outlook, similar to our comments last quarter, we are continuing to operate in a difficult environment that remains unpredictable in the short-term. That said, we expect the second quarter to continue to show an improvement in revenues and profitability. Looking at each of our segments. At Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for October grew 16%. Please refer to REA for a more specific outlook commentary. At Move, U.S. housing conditions remain challenging and we are expecting some reinvestment in marketing to improve share of voice levels, including the recently launched advertising campaign and also in product development to ensure we are best positioned to take advantage of market conditions when they improve. In Subscription Video Services, as mentioned last quarter, we continue to expect modestly higher expenses for the full year, driven by sports rights and some costs related to the launch of Foxtel streaming aggregation service, Hubbell, but remain on track to deliver relatively stable results for the year in local currency. At Dow Jones, we hope to see continued improvements in advertising declines, but as typical, visibility is limited. We continue to expect modestly higher overall expenses for the full year and strong revenue growth in B2B revenues. At Book Publishing, while we expect year-over-year improvements versus the prior year, revenue and profit growth is expected to be more modest than the first quarter given overall industry trends and the normalization of return rates. At News Media, revenue trends remain mixed geographically and we will continue to focus on ongoing cost efficiencies. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lucy Huang from UBS.\nLucy Huang: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking questions. My one question is in relation to Move. So I just wonder if you can give us an update into the competitive landscape in the U.S. And just any early thoughts on the recent U.S. court ruling around agent commissions, like do you think this could have an impact on industry dynamics more broadly, and I guess, for the Move business longer term? Thanks.\nRobert Thomson: Yes, Lucy. Well, first of all, we will have to see what transpires on appeal in that particular case. But it\u2019s clear that the U.S. property market has already been evolving if rather incrementally. I mean our focus is solely on providing the best possible service for vendors, for purchases and for Real Estate professionals, and we will continue to build audience through the use of our rather large media platforms. We have been taking advantage of the present downturn in the market to build out our sell-side operations and there is definitely a downturn in existing home sales when you have an annual rate of $3.9 million, which is well below the normal average of $5.5 million. We certainly foresee stronger activity longer term on the sell-side, a bit like the Australian market and we have acquired a company UpNest, which is particularly strong in that area. And there are interesting lessons for the U.S. market generally from Australia about what happens when the market turns. There\u2019s patently much suppressed demand here at the moment. In Australia, we saw listings in Melbourne and Sydney surged 14% and 16% in the last quarter, and those numbers were even higher in October, Melbourne listings surged 32% and Sydney saw 33%. So we look forward to similar surging and soaring in the U.S. market when mortgage rates moderate.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Lucy. Laila\u2026\nLucy Huang: Thank you.\nMichael Florin: \u2026 we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alan Gould from Loop Capital. Please unmute yourself to ask the question.\nAlan Gould: Thank you. Robert, I was wondering if you can get into a little bit more detail about this residulously reviewing our structure? And secondly, if you could comment on how the recent Real Estate lawsuit might affect the realtor and Move? Thank you.\nRobert Thomson: I think, Alan, I answered the second question just now. So we will have to wait for the appeal there. The market itself is still obviously suffering from the heavy burden of mortgage rates here in the U.S. As for structure, look, we agree with the general thesis that the company has been transformed over the past decade and the full value of our incomparable assets is not fully represented in the share price. And that\u2019s a tribute to the leaders of all our business from Rebecca in London to Patrick at Foxtel and to all our teams who have navigated through fundamental changes in each of their sectors and through the pandemic and the subsequent surge in interest rates. And as you can divine from today\u2019s numbers, we are in a truly different position to most media companies with a robust balance sheet and are poised for even greater growth and profitability in the coming years when the economic heavens return to equilibrium. But at the same time, we are consciously and constantly reviewing our structure and have already taken tangible steps to clarify internal corporate structures to ensure that we have maximum flexibility in that overall structural consideration.\nMichael Florin: Thanks, Alan. Laila, we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Karnovsky from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTed Karakostas: Yes. Hi. Thank you. This is Ted on for David. I wanted to ask if you could give us an update on digital ad trends. Any color you can share on the quarter and expectations moving forward would be appreciated? Thank you.\nRobert Thomson: Sure. Obviously, the trends across the mass heads vary by segment and region and algorithm changes can have a short-term impact. Though we do have a strong relationship with both Google and Facebook, and they tend to respond thoughtfully to any infulicities that we identify and I\u2019d particularly like to call out Sundar Pichai and his trustee team, who are conscious of the importance of journalists and journalism. Specifically, at Dow Jones, advertising was down 3%, which was a marked improvement after a 14% decline in the prior quarter, both digital and print reported improvement in trend lines. And there was a more modest decline of 8% in the U.K. But most of that was actually in print as digital advertising was flat compared to the same quarter last year. And the New York Post, while flat overall, actually saw an increase in print related advertising as the paper continued to expand its social, political and commercial reach.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Ted. Laila, we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Entcho Raykovski from Evans & Partners.\nEntcho Raykovski: Hi, Robert. Hi, Susan. So, firstly, I just wanted to ask, given that there have been some public comments from a shareholder over the past month about a proposal to spin out REA, interested in your comment as to whether you see merit in that proposal and is that something you are willing to explore or are you looking at other ways, as you have spoken about of closing the valuation gap? And if I can quickly throw a second one in there as well, hopefully, a straightforward one. Given that Foxtel refinanced over the quarter, when do you think the shareholder lines will be repaid? Are there any other impediments or hurdles to that repayment taking place now? Thank you.\nRobert Thomson: Entcho, it would obviously be inappropriate to comment on any shareholder in particular and actually inappropriate to comment on any shareholder comment. But as I have made clear, we are conscientiously reviewing our structure and have taken steps corporately to ensure that we have maximum flexibility that of itself reflects the constant institutional introspection that characterizes the way we oversee these very valuable assets.\nSusan Panuccio: And Entcho, just in relation to your question on Foxtel, we expect a modest return this year and anticipate the bulk of the repayments to come over the next few years. That\u2019s obviously dependent on the current plans and cash flow position.\nMichael Florin: Thanks, Entcho. Laila, we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research. Craig, your dial star six on your keypad to unmute.\nCraig Huber: Great. Thank you. Robert, it\u2019s nice to hear that you guys are reviewing your structure. I have long talked about for the last 10 years or so. I mean, the company is very complicated for an investor -- an outside investor standpoint. So I am glad to hear you guys are looking at that seriously. I mean, when I look at the stock, I mean, I looked at 35% to 40% conglomerate discount that\u2019s embedded in your stock in order to justify the stock in the low 20%s here and stuff. So I guess we will see what happens. I hope some significant happens on that front. If I could ask a question about books, I mean it\u2019s nice to see the recovery from a year ago. Are you guys seeing anything in the book area, whether it be on the cost side or on the revenue side that would stop you from getting back to your EBITDA level that you are at in the low 300s back in fiscal 2021 and 2022? Thank you.\nRobert Thomson: Craig, look, obviously, HarperCollins\u2019 journey through a rather unique period of unusual circumstances. The pandemic, logistical issues at Amazon, cost pressures and it has emerged from that confluence -- complexity with a strong front, backlist and margins actually dramatically improvement -- improving from the 4% in the final quarter of last fiscal to 12.4%. So we are seeing that margin improvement already. And there\u2019s also no doubt that there\u2019s reason for excitement about the entry of Spotify into audio books. Over the past few years, audio books have been by far the fastest-growing sector. And Spotify itself has really transformed both the concept and the experience of streaming. And so Daniel Ek and I have been discussing audio books for a few years, and we have reached an agreement on a model that is great for orders, for book lovers, for Spotify, and for us. The early signs from the U.K. and Australian markets are certainly positive. And if those trends hold, audio, which now comprise about 45% of digital sales will reach a far higher threshold level, we will be generating significantly more revenue, and as you asked, be improving our EBITDA.\nSusan Panuccio: And Craig, maybe just to add, we do expect continued profit growth in the balance of the year given certainly the prior year compares subject, of course, to that consumer demand that Robert talked about, but we expect it to be at a more modest rate than Q1. And we are hopeful that the EBITDA margin can remain positive to last year and in the low double digits for the full year having delivered the 12.3% in Q1. So I expect that margin rate will be more over the medium-term when we look to lift it.\nMichael Florin: Thanks, Craig. Laila, we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Han from Morningstar. Please unmute yourself to ask a question.\nBrian Han: Robert or Susan, can you please clarify, did you guys say in Dow Jones B2B earnings are larger than B2C earnings or did you mean its contribution to growth is now larger than B2C?\nSusan Panuccio: They are larger and on track to be larger for the full year. So, yes, we did say that.\nBrian Han: On track to be larger?\nSusan Panuccio: And they were for the quarter.\nRobert Thomson: And for the quarter and they are obviously a higher margin digital high retention rates.\nBrian Han: Thank you.\nMichael Florin: Thank you. Thanks, Brian. Laila, we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darren Leung from Macquarie.\nDarren Leung: Hi, guys. Thanks for the opportunity. I just have one on Move please and the Real Estate revenues were obviously down 20% and you called out listings down 11%, pretty crude, but it sort of implies that yield -- average yield was down about 9%. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers on this front please and how we should be thinking about the yield driver in the remainder of the year? Thanks.\nSusan Panuccio: Darren, we don\u2019t, as you know, give out specific yields. You may recollect that actually over the course of probably the last 18 months, we have been seeing increases in yields that have helped us offset some of those declines. You could imagine in the current market it\u2019s obviously challenging to be pushing yields up in the U.S. So look, I think what we would say is that we just continue to balance where we think we can push yields in certain markets with the current macro environment. That\u2019s probably all we can say on that.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Darren. Laila, we will take the next\u2026\nDarren Leung: Thanks. Thanks.\nMichael Florin: Thanks, Darren. Thank you, Darren.\nOperator: One moment\u2026\nMichael Florin: Sorry, Laila, we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: We can go to Craig Huber with a follow-up.\nCraig Huber: Yeah. I have a follow-up question on realtor.com please. Can you maybe just comment a little further on what you are planning to do on the cost side of the business for the rest of the fiscal year here? I understand obviously the pressure on the topline. But I mean, where do you guys think profits in realtor.com are going to go the -- issue on the topline from a macro standpoint, but you want to invest more it sounds like on the R&D side and in marketing? Thank you.\nSusan Panuccio: Craig. Look, if you think about the next quarter, you could probably expect costs to be relatively in line with what we have seen in Q1. As we mentioned, we do want to continue to invest in that business. We see a huge opportunity in that business when the market picks up. We want to make sure that we are in the best position to take advantage of that. Some of the investment areas that we are looking at are building our product investment having a look at marketing, obviously, just given the competitive position there. It\u2019s really important that we do that. So we will probably back in some of those cost investments depending on how revenue trends.\nMichael Florin: Thank you. Thank you, Craig. Laila, any other questions?\nOperator: There are no further questions on the line at this time.\nMichael Florin: All right. Well, thank you all for participating. Have a wonderful day and we will talk to you soon. Take care.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Susan Panuccio",
            "content": "Thank you, Robert, and good afternoon, everyone. As Robert mentioned, we are pleased with the positive start to the new fiscal year, returning to revenue growth and posting the second consecutive quarter of profit growth despite the macroeconomic conditions. We have been diligently executing on our long-term plan to drive greater value for our shareholders and believe this is yet to be reflected in our current market value. Our first quarter total revenues were $2.5 billion, up 1% compared to the prior year, marking the first year-over-year revenue growth since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Adjusted revenues also grew 1% compared to the prior year. Total segment EBITDA was $364 million, up 4% compared to the prior year. HarperCollins was the largest contributor to the profit improvement, which is encouraging on the back of last year's challenging results. Adjusted total segment EBITDA grew 5% versus the prior year. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.05, compared to $0.07 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.16 in the quarter, compared to $0.12 in the prior year. Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $403 million, down 4% compared to the prior year, a notable improvement from the fourth quarter rate. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues declined just 2%. Despite the revenue decline, segment EBITDA rose 3% to $122 million due to higher contribution from the REA Group and cost saving initiatives that move that were partially offset by revenue headwinds. Adjusted segment EBITDA rose a healthy 8%. REA had a very strong quarter with revenues rising 4% year-on-year on a reported basis to $261 million, which included an $11 million or 4% negative impact from foreign exchange. Growth was driven by residential yield increases and growth in national listings, along with 25% revenue growth at REA India. Results were partially offset by a modest decline in Financial Services revenues due to lower settlement activity. Overall, new buy listings rose 1%, with Sydney and Melbourne up 16% and 14%, respectively, enabling upward pressure on yields. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details. Move's revenues of $142 million were down 16% compared to the prior year, relatively similar to the fourth quarter trend absent the 53rd-week impact. For the quarter, Real Estate revenues fell 20%, driven by lower lead and transaction volumes reflective of the broader industry trends. Lead volumes fell 11% year-over-year, while realtor's average monthly unique users declined 12% from the prior year to 76 million in the first quarter based on internal metrics, but improved from 74 million in the fourth quarter. As Robert mentioned, despite challenging market and competitive conditions, we have made solid progress in Q1 across a number of strategic areas including SEO improvements, expanding our sell-side offerings into the launch of a listing agent tool kit, deepening our collaboration with News Corp's powerful global platform to drive further reach and the recent launch of a new brand campaign. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $486 million, down approximately 3% compared to the prior year on a reported basis due to foreign currency headwinds. Importantly, on an adjusted basis, revenues rose 1% versus the prior year, the seventh consecutive quarter of growth. Streaming revenues accounted for 30% of circulation and subscription revenues versus 25% in the prior year, and again, more than offset broadcast revenue declines benefiting from both a year-over-year increase in subscribers and price rises at Kayo and BINGE. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group reached almost $4.6 million at quarter end, up 2% year-over-year. Total paid streaming subscribers were 3 million, increasing 8% versus the prior year, although declining sequentially impacted by less output at BINGE related to the strikes in Hollywood, as well as typical seasonality at Kayo due to the end of the winter sports codes in September. Foxtel ended the quarter with over 1.3 million residential broadcast subscribers, down 9% year-over-year. Broadcast churn continued to improve, down 280 basis points year-over-year to 11.4%, while broadcast ARPU rose 3% to over A$85 helped in part by a price rise for non-platinum subscribers implemented in July. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $93 million was down 16% versus the prior year driven by contractual price escalators in Foxtel sports rights agreements. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 13%. We completed the debt refinancing in the first quarter, which included securing a new A$1.2 billion credit facility. As we said last quarter, given the improved performance and the completion of the refinancing, this provides a pathway for repayment of our shareholder loans. Moving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones had a strong quarter with revenues of $537 million, up 4% year-over-year despite fully lapping recent acquisitions. Digital revenues accounted for 81% of total revenues this quarter, up 2 percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription-based revenues represented over 81% of total revenues, up approximately 1 percentage point from the prior year, underscoring the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. On an adjusted basis, revenues grew 3%. We are continuing to see very strong growth in our Professional Information business with revenues rising 14% year-over-year driven by risk and compliance and strong gains at Dow Jones Energy. Factiva posted modest growth benefiting from a new licensing deal. Retention across B2B offerings remains at over 90% with nearly all of the revenues recurring. Risk and compliance revenues rose 23% with consistent growth between financials and corporates. Europe remained the largest territory at over 50% of revenues and also the fastest source of growth. Secular trends remain very favorable with global corporations navigating complex sanctions and trade guidance, particularly as it relates to Russia and China. We were really pleased with the 20% growth at Dow Jones Energy, which benefited from price escalators, the rollout of new products and new customers. The results also benefited mid-single digits from one-time items and the World Chemical Forum, a new annual event this quarter, which leveraged the wider Dow Jones experience in corporate events. Circulation revenues gained 1% versus the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions growing 12% year-over-year or 101,000 sequentially, which was principally driven by an increased focus on Dow Jones bundling offer as they look to better leverage subscription acquisition costs across multiple products, capitalize on minimal overlap between products and drive greater engagement from customers. We believe that in the medium-term, bundling will drive higher ARPU per subscriber and reduce long-term churn. Advertising revenues declined 3% to $91 million due to 6% and 2% declines in print and digital advertising revenues, respectively, with trends improving from the fourth quarter. Advertising accounted for 17% of total revenue with 66% being digital, up 100 basis points from last year. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 10% to $124 million with margins improving 120 basis points to 23.1%, the highest first quarter margin since News Corp's acquisition of Dow Jones, driven by the strong B2B performance, which is on track to be the largest contributor to Dow Jones profitability in fiscal 2024. At Book Publishing, we saw a big recovery from fiscal 2023 results. Revenues were $525 million, up 8%, while segment EBITDA improved 67% to $65 million compared to the prior year. Margins improved over 400 basis points to 12.4%. You will recall the results a year ago were significantly impacted by the Amazon reset of inventory levels and rightsizing of its warehouse footprint. The strong performance this quarter benefited from the success of some key frontlist titles, as Robert mentioned, and also saw improvement in backlist sales, including a notable increase from Christian Publishing. Return rates improved materially, while inventory levels appear to have normalized. Inflationary costs are beginning to moderate with lower manufacturing costs helped by product mix and lower freight and distribution costs this quarter. The backlist contributed 61% of revenues, down from 65% last year, while digital sales rose 3% this quarter and accounted for 22% of consumer sales, within the 22% downloadable audio accounted for 45% of digital revenues. On an adjusted basis, revenues gained 6% and segment EBITDA rose 59%. Turning to News Media. Overall trends continue to be mixed geographically. Revenues were $548 million, down 1% versus the prior year, while adjusted revenues declined 2%. Advertising declined 5% and was down 6% in constant currency, while circulation and subscription rose 2% and was flat in constant currency. At News Australia, advertising saw some improvement compared to the fourth quarter, while the U.K. weakened notably in digital. As Robert mentioned, we did see declines in our traffic at several mastheads related to changes in algorithms at the large platforms which we are monitoring closely and have been felt across the wider publishing industry. Segment EBITDA of $14 million declined $4 million, results included approximately $3 million related to one-time costs as a result of the proposed combination of printing operations in the U.K. with DMG. This initiative demonstrates the continued focus on driving cost efficiencies across our News Media businesses. Before we look at the outlook for the next quarter, I would like to touch on free cash flow. First quarter free cash flow is typically lower due to the timing of working capital payments, including sports rights payments at Foxtel, and this year, it was also impacted from the lower HarperCollins sales in Q4 of the prior year. We anticipate generating strong and positive free cash flow for the year weighted to the second half consistent with prior years. As for the outlook, similar to our comments last quarter, we are continuing to operate in a difficult environment that remains unpredictable in the short-term. That said, we expect the second quarter to continue to show an improvement in revenues and profitability. Looking at each of our segments. At Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for October grew 16%. Please refer to REA for a more specific outlook commentary. At Move, U.S. housing conditions remain challenging and we are expecting some reinvestment in marketing to improve share of voice levels, including the recently launched advertising campaign and also in product development to ensure we are best positioned to take advantage of market conditions when they improve. In Subscription Video Services, as mentioned last quarter, we continue to expect modestly higher expenses for the full year, driven by sports rights and some costs related to the launch of Foxtel streaming aggregation service, Hubbell, but remain on track to deliver relatively stable results for the year in local currency. At Dow Jones, we hope to see continued improvements in advertising declines, but as typical, visibility is limited. We continue to expect modestly higher overall expenses for the full year and strong revenue growth in B2B revenues. At Book Publishing, while we expect year-over-year improvements versus the prior year, revenue and profit growth is expected to be more modest than the first quarter given overall industry trends and the normalization of return rates. At News Media, revenue trends remain mixed geographically and we will continue to focus on ongoing cost efficiencies. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A. And Entcho, just in relation to your question on Foxtel, we expect a modest return this year and anticipate the bulk of the repayments to come over the next few years. That's obviously dependent on the current plans and cash flow position. And Craig, maybe just to add, we do expect continued profit growth in the balance of the year given certainly the prior year compares subject, of course, to that consumer demand that Robert talked about, but we expect it to be at a more modest rate than Q1. And we are hopeful that the EBITDA margin can remain positive to last year and in the low double digits for the full year having delivered the 12.3% in Q1. So I expect that margin rate will be more over the medium-term when we look to lift it. They are larger and on track to be larger for the full year. So, yes, we did say that. And they were for the quarter. Darren, we don't, as you know, give out specific yields. You may recollect that actually over the course of probably the last 18 months, we have been seeing increases in yields that have helped us offset some of those declines. You could imagine in the current market it's obviously challenging to be pushing yields up in the U.S. So look, I think what we would say is that we just continue to balance where we think we can push yields in certain markets with the current macro environment. That's probably all we can say on that. Craig. Look, if you think about the next quarter, you could probably expect costs to be relatively in line with what we have seen in Q1. As we mentioned, we do want to continue to invest in that business. We see a huge opportunity in that business when the market picks up. We want to make sure that we are in the best position to take advantage of that. Some of the investment areas that we are looking at are building our product investment having a look at marketing, obviously, just given the competitive position there. It's really important that we do that. So we will probably back in some of those cost investments depending on how revenue trends."

            "content": "Thank you, Mike. In a world replete with uncertainty, News Corp is proud to report rising revenues and increased profitability in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. These distinctly positive results come despite specious macroeconomic conditions including steep interest rates and unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations. The potential for even greater profitability should be even more pronounced when we return to economic equilibrium. These results follow the three most profitable years since the creation of the new News Corp and our digital transformation has continued at pace. And in our view, these results certainly highlight the disparity between the value of our company and our share price, which we believe does not reflect our present profitability yet alone the potential of our incomparable growing businesses. We are acutely focused on enhancing long-term value for all of our investors, and in that quest, have the patent advantage of prized assets, whose value we believe is increasing. We are also assiduously reviewing our structure in the quest to optimize that value. Our first quarter revenues rose modestly to $2.5 billion, while profitability rose 4%, marking the second consecutive quarter of profit growth in these challenging conditions. We believe these positive results are a harbinger of our potential in the medium- and long-term. We expect to continue to drive our digital growth, the scale of which has been transformative over the past decade. It is worth noting a couple of metrics for context and to highlight the intrinsic value of our company. In 2014, print related advertising accounted for 39% of our revenue and now it is trying to get less than 5%, while digital revenues exceeded 50% of revenues last year, up almost 300%. Our loyal investors understand the inherent value of our assets and the scale of our dramatic transition. But we believe the market has yet to fully comprehend the magnitude of the metamorphosis or the future potential of our platform. We have been and expect to continue to generate significant free cash flow this fiscal year and we have a $1 billion buyback plan well underway and ample opportunity to be opportunistic. That opportunistic efficacy, we have shown in our purchases of OPIS and CMA for Dow Jones to high margin digital businesses with recurring revenues which have added much profitable prowess. Their impact means that we are at a pivotal point at our Dow Jones business. The B2B segment at Dow Jones is now outpacing the B2C segment in contributing to profit and at a far higher margin. The net result is that we expect both Dow Jones and News Corporation are becoming more profitable, more digital and even less dependent on the ebb and flow of advertising. That is why we are highlighting the Dow Jones results today and expect to be providing increasing visibility over the coming year. So the potential investors can appreciate the full glory of our valuable assets, while we intensify our institutional introspection on structure. As a reminder, Dow Jones profitability has more than doubled since we re-segmented in fiscal 2020, generating close to $500 million in segment EBITDA last year with strong growth prospects ahead. And the EBITDA margin has been actually transformed. In Q1 fiscal 2018 it was approximately 9%, in Q1 fiscal 2020 it was 12.8% and in Q1 this fiscal year 23.1%. We certainly agree with the perceptive commentators and analysts, who suggest that News Corp is undervalued and its asset quality underappreciated. Our Board, our leaders and our teams deserve much credit for skillfully navigating the turbulent media waters of the past decade. Waters, which have proven treacherous for many media companies. As always, we remain focused on maximizing that value to the benefit of all shareholders. We are also looking into the future in maximizing the value of our premium content for AI. We are in advanced discussions with a range of digital companies that we anticipate will bring significant revenue in return for the use of our unmatched content sets. Generative AI engines are only as sophisticated as their inputs and need constant replenishing to remain relevant and we are proud to partner with responsible purveyors of AI products and their prescient leaders. One observation about Generative AI. We often hear about misinformation and disinformation to the point where the very words become politicized and polluted. The potential for the proselytizing of the perverse will become ever more real with the inevitable inexorable rise of artificial intelligence. But, however, aren't fully artificial intelligence, it is no match for great reporting and for genuine journalistic nous. On the subject of journalism, I would like to pay tribute to our reporters in the Middle East and in Ukraine who are each day taking calculated risks to bring insight and intelligence to readers around the world during a period of unpredictable turbulence. And I would like to highlight the fate of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter, who has been unjustly incarcerated in Russia for more than seven months nearly for doing his job as a journalist. Let me begin the more detailed extra juices with the increasingly valuable PLS Dow Jones where revenues rose 4% in Q1, despite the volatility of the ad market, while segment EBITDA was lifted by an impressive 10% as revenue and profit contribution continued to expand in the professional information business. Dow Jones offers a unique set of services and products for global business users and readers. As a result, many of our customers encountered Dow Jones products several times each day, not just the Wall Street Journal, Barron's, MarketWatch and Dow Jones Newswires, but also risk and compliance Dow Jones Energy and Factiva. Risk and compliance revenues surged 23%. Thanks to the increased demand from the financial and corporate sectors seeking to minimize risk and maximize compliance. I trust all of the institutions on the call today aspire to those two worthy goals. RNC has expanded revenues by over 60%, let me repeat that number, over 600% since we relaunched News in 2013. It's worth emphasizing that the business is fully digital and has retention rates of over 90%. Dow Jones Energy, which includes both OPIS and CMA continues to see excellent double-digit revenue growth, driven in part by higher pricing and is exceeding our initial expectations. Thanks to the global energy transition and opportunities emerging in renewable energy, along with continued reinvestment. Our customer base is growing as we launch compelling products and create critical pricing benchmarks. We are genuinely impressed by the vitality and drive an initiative among our new colleagues at both OPIS and CMA. Factiva is benefiting from its innovative partnership with Cision. And Factiva should be an important building block in the AI future given that it has a database of 33,000 sources in 32 languages from more than 200 countries and territories. That impressive content collection complements our contemporaneous news offerings as we seek to serve corporate, professional and consumer audiences. Across Dow Jones, subscription volume remains strong with digital subscriptions reaching 4.6 million, up 12%, while total subscriptions reached 5.3 million, up 8%. Our teams are focused on reducing churn and maximizing the lifetime value of each and every subscriber. As for advertising, we saw particularly improvement in trends with declines of past quarters abating and digital advertising down only 2%. In Digital Real Estate, it was a tale of two markets during the quarter with the Australian property market improving and the U.S. market still bearing the burden of particularly high mortgage rates which obviously suppressed demand. But it is fair to say that the revenue rebound in the Australian market certainty surpassed the sluggishness in the U.S. market. REA reported strong growth in listing volumes in the two key markets of Sydney and Melbourne, and our value-add clients were keen to subscribe to premium products, thus improving yield. We also saw resounding topline performance and volumes remained strong in October. REA, India is a number one property portal in a country with a rapidly expanding middle class and both its audience and revenue continued to surge during the quarter. As REA has disclosed, the total audience in India in the quarter was up 16% year-over-year, while revenue during the quarter was 25% higher than a year ago. Given a relative political stability in India and ongoing economic growth, REA India is a jewel in the crown. In the U.S. realtor.com like the industry at large was affected by the unusually high interest rates, which do appear to have plateaued and are expected to ease over the coming year. But the short-term conditions do not change our long-term optimism for realtor to capitalize on the increasing digitization of the world's largest property market. It is easy to buy transient traffic in the short-term, but that is merely a sugar high that leads to digital diabetes. We have a long-term commitment to all Americans who are buying and selling a home and to Real Estate professionals. We also have the ability to leverage our unique media platform from wsj.com to the New York Post among many others, who had a combined monthly audience of over 200 million uniques in September. These are verified authenticated numbers, not a cocktail of cockamania. Under Damian Eales, energetic decisive leadership, realtor is building on the gains of his predecessors and focusing on developing core markets, core clients and core profitability. The realtor team is working even more closely with REA executives in ways that are benefiting both businesses with the sharing of software, marketing mechanics and AI insights. The script for our publishing business was completely rewritten in the first quarter. After a few difficult quarters, segment EBITDA at HarperCollins lifted 67%. Revenues posted a healthy 8% increase and that growth combined with cost initiatives undertaken over the past year and an easing of supply chain inflationary impacts recalibrated the performance at HarperCollins. The logistical upheaval at Amazon has past, return rates are far lower, and both the frontlist and backlist notch gains during the quarter. Among the many and varied strong sellers were Tom Lake by Ann Patchett, Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver, The Collector by Daniel Silva and Remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby Van Pelt. We saw particular strength in our Christian books business, including Reba McEntire's Not That Fancy. Reba was clearly not describing the HarperCollins performance. And speaking of Christian books, we look forward to publishing a new book His Holiness Pope Francis next spring. I would like to highlight our new partnership with Spotify to broaden the reach of audio books. This is a project we have discussed for some time with the S Mobile [ph] Daniel Ek, with whom I share a passion for books and for the Arsenal Football Club. The new partnership has begun with the U.K. and Australia and in the U.S. announced yesterday, and we are genuinely confident that it will be positive for both companies for authors and for those who love to read and to listen to books. This market has needed a strong new entrant and Daniel and his team are among the most skillful players on the pitch. At Subscription Video Services, revenues were up in constant currency for the seventh consecutive quarter. As expected, the decline in EBITDA was mainly due to sports costs and ForEx fluctuations. But we have no doubt that our streaming strategy has been successful at a time when other companies in other markets are struggling. Overall, paid streaming subscriptions rose 8% on the same quarter last year, while broadcast churn was down from 14.2% to 11.4%, showing that the two products are undoubtedly complementary. But the team at Foxtel is far from complacent and so we are on the cusp of launching our new streaming aggregation product, Hubbell, which will greatly simplify the search for fascinating entertainment and sports from our own companies and from those of our cherished partners to the benefit of all in particular, to the benefit of viewers. The News Media segment faced macroeconomic headwinds and volatility caused by algorithmic changes at the large platforms, but these trends are more femoral than eternal. Subscriptions continue to increase at The Times and Sunday Times, which reported an 8% rise and at News Corp Australia, where we saw a 4% increase in digital subs. As I mentioned earlier, we are increasingly less reliant on advertising, which is now a smaller fraction of our overall revenue and focused on digital recurring revenue streams. We saw strong performance at Wireless in the UK, which had a record 45 million listening hours over the April to September period, up 17% from the prior year, according to RAJAR, led by sports and news. Our teams in the U.K. and Australia were also acutely cost conscious and we are retooling the infrastructure to reflect the contemporary and future initiatives, including printing operations, advertising networks and back office expenses. Rebecca and our teams in the U.K. have been leaders in creating programmatic ad partnerships, which enable all to increase yield and harvest valuable data. This was, in another way, an historic quarter. Our Executive Chair, Rupert Murdoch, announced that he will be transitioning to Chairman Emeritus next week at our AGM. I can personally assure you that there has been no change in his heightened levels of curiosity and energy since the announcement and his vast experience will be an important ongoing resource for the company. All of us at News Corp stand on the shoulders of a giant. And I genuinely look forward to Lachlan becoming sole Chair next week. His thoughtful engagement with our teams already enhances the business each working day and his passion for principal journalism is obvious to all who work with him. There is no doubt that Lachlan's multidisciplinary expertise and his philosophical integrity will be invaluable as we continue the next phase of our crucial journey. And now our esteemed CFO, Susan Panuccio, will provide more financial granularity. Yes, Lucy. Well, first of all, we will have to see what transpires on appeal in that particular case. But it's clear that the U.S. property market has already been evolving if rather incrementally. I mean our focus is solely on providing the best possible service for vendors, for purchases and for Real Estate professionals, and we will continue to build audience through the use of our rather large media platforms. We have been taking advantage of the present downturn in the market to build out our sell-side operations and there is definitely a downturn in existing home sales when you have an annual rate of $3.9 million, which is well below the normal average of $5.5 million. We certainly foresee stronger activity longer term on the sell-side, a bit like the Australian market and we have acquired a company UpNest, which is particularly strong in that area. And there are interesting lessons for the U.S. market generally from Australia about what happens when the market turns. There's patently much suppressed demand here at the moment. In Australia, we saw listings in Melbourne and Sydney surged 14% and 16% in the last quarter, and those numbers were even higher in October, Melbourne listings surged 32% and Sydney saw 33%. So we look forward to similar surging and soaring in the U.S. market when mortgage rates moderate. I think, Alan, I answered the second question just now. So we will have to wait for the appeal there. The market itself is still obviously suffering from the heavy burden of mortgage rates here in the U.S. As for structure, look, we agree with the general thesis that the company has been transformed over the past decade and the full value of our incomparable assets is not fully represented in the share price. And that's a tribute to the leaders of all our business from Rebecca in London to Patrick at Foxtel and to all our teams who have navigated through fundamental changes in each of their sectors and through the pandemic and the subsequent surge in interest rates. And as you can divine from today's numbers, we are in a truly different position to most media companies with a robust balance sheet and are poised for even greater growth and profitability in the coming years when the economic heavens return to equilibrium. But at the same time, we are consciously and constantly reviewing our structure and have already taken tangible steps to clarify internal corporate structures to ensure that we have maximum flexibility in that overall structural consideration. Sure. Obviously, the trends across the mass heads vary by segment and region and algorithm changes can have a short-term impact. Though we do have a strong relationship with both Google and Facebook, and they tend to respond thoughtfully to any infulicities that we identify and I'd particularly like to call out Sundar Pichai and his trustee team, who are conscious of the importance of journalists and journalism. Specifically, at Dow Jones, advertising was down 3%, which was a marked improvement after a 14% decline in the prior quarter, both digital and print reported improvement in trend lines. And there was a more modest decline of 8% in the U.K. But most of that was actually in print as digital advertising was flat compared to the same quarter last year. And the New York Post, while flat overall, actually saw an increase in print related advertising as the paper continued to expand its social, political and commercial reach. Entcho, it would obviously be inappropriate to comment on any shareholder in particular and actually inappropriate to comment on any shareholder comment. But as I have made clear, we are conscientiously reviewing our structure and have taken steps corporately to ensure that we have maximum flexibility that of itself reflects the constant institutional introspection that characterizes the way we oversee these very valuable assets. Craig, look, obviously, HarperCollins' journey through a rather unique period of unusual circumstances. The pandemic, logistical issues at Amazon, cost pressures and it has emerged from that confluence -- complexity with a strong front, backlist and margins actually dramatically improvement -- improving from the 4% in the final quarter of last fiscal to 12.4%. So we are seeing that margin improvement already. And there's also no doubt that there's reason for excitement about the entry of Spotify into audio books. Over the past few years, audio books have been by far the fastest-growing sector. And Spotify itself has really transformed both the concept and the experience of streaming. And so Daniel Ek and I have been discussing audio books for a few years, and we have reached an agreement on a model that is great for orders, for book lovers, for Spotify, and for us. The early signs from the U.K. and Australian markets are certainly positive. And if those trends hold, audio, which now comprise about 45% of digital sales will reach a far higher threshold level, we will be generating significantly more revenue, and as you asked, be improving our EBITDA. And for the quarter and they are obviously a higher margin digital high retention rates."
