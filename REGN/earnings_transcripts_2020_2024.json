Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the Investor Relations team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.\nLeonard Schleifer: Thank you, Justin, and thanks to everyone joining on today's call. 2020 was a devastating year for so many individuals and their families who succumbed to COVID-19. At Regeneron, we have done all we can to be part of the solution, and we'll spend quite a bit of time today trying to inform you of our efforts. \nGeorge Yancopoulos : Thank you, Len. With the world still in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, I will start with our efforts on REGEN-COV, our antibody cocktail targeting the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  Over the last few months, we have achieved several important milestones. On November 21, our antibody cocktail received FDA emergency use authorization for recently diagnosed, mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in high-risk patients. The EUA was granted based on the initial results in patients from our large study in the non-hospitalized setting. \nMarion McCourt : Thank you, George. We ended 2020 with positive momentum across our commercial portfolio as our core products, EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo, delivered strong performance in the fourth quarter. Our 2020 results coupled with near-term launch opportunities position us for continued diversified growth in 2021.  Beginning with EYLEA, fourth quarter global net sales grew 10% year-over-year to $2.2 billion. As we reported last month, US EYLEA net sales grew 10% year-over-year to $1.34 billion, the highest reported net sales since EYLEA's launch. EYLEA again outperformed the category with share gains from both branded and unbranded competition. EYLEA share of the branded category approached 75% for the quarter and EYLEA remains the number one prescribed anti-VEGF therapy overall in wet AMD and diabetic eye disease.  While volume in the overall anti-VEGF category declined in 2020, EYLEA was the only product in the category to grow. Patient volumes are now normalizing. EYLEA sets a high bar on efficacy, safety, dosing inflexibility and real world experience for current and future competition.  The anti-VEGF category continues to be supported by the aging population and increasing prevalence of diabetes. Realizing the full potential in diabetic eye disease remains a key initiative, representing a significant growth opportunity for EYLEA and is largely unpenetrated. We intend to initiate a direct to consumer campaign to create awareness for patients on the importance of vision care as part of managing their diabetes.  In summary, EYLEA had an impressive quarter and we remain confident in its outlook.  Next, we recorded $146 million for our antibody cocktail, REGEN-COV, in the fourth quarter. Where appropriate, we are deploying commercial efforts under the EUA to improve availability for this important treatment against COVID-19 for at-risk patients. We are engaging with all stakeholders to reduce bottlenecks and drive utilization rates higher. Regeneron is working to educate stakeholders, including patients, on the urgency to treat at-risk non-hospitalized patients within 10 days of receiving a positive COVID-19 diagnosis.  Initiatives to reduce administrative burden and direct patients to treatment centers are beginning to yield encouraging results. Physicians using REGEN-COV are providing very positive feedback on treatment results.  Let me also briefly discuss another new medicine, evinacumab, brand name Evkeeza. We're prepared for the February 11 PDUFA date for Evkeeza for the treatment of HoFH, a rare disease that affects approximately 1,300 patients in the US. There's high unmet need for these patients with this rare genetic condition as they struggle to keep their LDL cholesterol levels under control.  These patients face an increased risk of premature heart disease as early as their teenage years. We are leveraging our cardio metabolic expertise and existing commercial platform to drive uptake in this rare disease category.  Turning now to Libtayo, for the fourth quarter, global net sales grew to $97 million. In the US, net sales were $74 million, driven by steady volume growth in advanced CSCC. We are nearing the potential approval of two additional indications for Libtayo in basal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer, both of which received priority reviews and have upcoming PDUFA dates. Our teams are eager and ready to launch once approved.  For basal cell carcinoma, there are no FDA approved treatment options once a patient progresses on or becomes intolerant to hedgehog inhibitors. Just as we did with CSCC, we will work to establish Libtayo as the standard of care in appropriate BCC patients.  We also look forward to competing in non-small cell lung cancer, where there's a large opportunity among patients with PD-L1 expressions at least 50%. Libtayo has a favorable product profile and a growing majority of treatment centers and oncologists have experience using Libtayo in their CSCC patients.  Physicians preferred choice and recent market research shows that nearly two-thirds of physicians are highly motivated to evaluate Libtayo for their lung cancer patients if approved. Additionally, we've built a highly experienced commercialization team with a significant launch experience with this class. If approved, we aim to rapidly increase market awareness of Libtayo as a compelling new anti-PD-1 monotherapy treatment option. Finally, moving to Dupixent, global net sales in the fourth quarter were $1.17 billion, representing 56% growth compared to the prior year. In the US, broad-based growth across all approved indications contributed to net sales of $926 million. We continue to see strong prescription trends across all approved indications. And weekly new patient shares have recently eclipsed pre-pandemic levels.  Atopic dermatitis, the largest indication, is a significant growth driver on Dupixent's rapid onset, proven efficacy and well established safety profile. Physicians continued to expand prescribing across both moderate and severe disease and in younger populations where safety is paramount.  Despite the impressive launch growth trajectory, there remains significant opportunity as only a small percentage of the over 2 million biologic eligible patients in the US have been unprescribed Dupixent.  Our initiatives aim to grow new patient starts as there is substantial opportunity for many more patients to benefit and support patients already on Dupixent to continue their treatment.  Moving to asthma, Dupixent is performing well in this competitive market based on its clinical efficacy and safety profile, which is compelling and differentiated to prescribers. Our market expansion efforts supporting HCPs and patients, including DTC, continue to have a meaningful impact on new initiations and launch preparations are underway in pediatric  pediatric asthma setting.  For chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, we see healthy demand and continued strong prescribing trends among ENTs and allergists. Dupixent is core to our diversified growth strategy where there remains substantial opportunity for future expansion.  In closing, we ended 2020 with momentum, delivering strong performance across our business. With several near-term launches ahead, we have important opportunities to strengthen our thriving commercial portfolio and capitalize on growth.  Now I'll turn the call to Bob.\nRobert Landry : Thanks, Marion. And good morning and good afternoon, everybody. My comments today on financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. For the fourth quarter of 2020, Regeneron delivered again double-digit broad-based top and bottom line growth. Our revenue streams continue to diversify with significant growth contributions from Dupixent and REGEN-COV, as we invest in our best in class pipeline for sustained future growth.  For the fourth quarter, total revenue grew 30% year-over-year to $2.4 billion, driven by growth in US EYLEA sales; higher collaboration revenues from our partners, Sanofi and Bayer; and sales of our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail. Diluted net income per share grew 27% year-over-year to $9.53 on net income of $1.1 billion. Since Marion discussed our US EYLEA results, I will start with our Bayer and Sanofi collaborations.  Starting with the Bayer collaboration. Ex-US EYLEA net product sales reported to us by Bayer were $859 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, representing growth of 10% on a reported basis compared to the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $361 million, of which we recorded $335 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the US.  Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $317 million in the fourth quarter. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of non-IO antibodies was $230 million, which compares favorably to profits of $104 million in the prior year. This growth was primarily driven by higher Dupixent profits.  Other revenue increased to $123 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $96 million in the prior year. The primary driver is the recognition of $42 million from the US government associated with reimbursements of REGEN-COV development.  As we said on the third quarter call, this line item continues to trend lower due to the wind down of development reimbursements from the US government. In 2021, we expect to record approximately half of the $557 million recorded in other revenue for full-year 2020.  Moving on to our operating expenses, and starting with R&D. R&D increased 50% year-over-year to $675 million, primarily due to continued clinical development costs for our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail and higher headcount to support our expanding pipeline.  Next, SG&A expense increased 22% year-over-year to $381 million. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by increased headcount launch preparations for Libtayo and continued investments for growth in EYLEA. Cost of goods sold increased 79% from the prior year from $93 million to $166 million due to sales of REGEN-COV and Praluent in the US. Cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing was $174 million compared to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to increased sales of Dupixent.  Additionally, in other operating income and expense, we recorded $145 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2020. This includes approximately $100 million of income related to higher recognition of upfront and milestone payments previously received from our collaborators with Sanofi, Teva and Mitsubishi Tanabe. Finally, in other income and expense, we recorded $2 million of expense compared to $25 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2019. This is driven by interest expense related to our $2 billion debt issuance in August 2020 and lower investment returns on our existing cash and marketable securities. Turning now to taxes. The effective tax rate was 7.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 10.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. For the full-year 2020, Regeneron generated $2 billion in free cash flow and ended the year with cash and marketable securities, less long term debt, of $4.7 billion. We also exhausted our inaugural $1 billion share repurchase program in the fourth quarter.  As a result of our strong balance sheet and confidence in the growth trajectory of our business, we are announcing a new board authorized share repurchase program of $1.5 billion. This program is consistent with our capital allocation priorities of funding our broad R&D pipeline, investing in enabling and synergizing R&D business development opportunities, and returning cash to our shareholders. With this new authorization, we will continue to be opportunistic buyers where we see dislocation between our stock price and our intrinsic valuation.  Having reviewed our fourth quarter performance, I'd like to take some time to discuss the 2021 financial outlook. Starting with R&D guidance. We forecast our 2021 R&D expense to be in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.85 billion. We are continuing to advance programs in our diverse R&D portfolio with up to 7 INDs to enter the clinic in 2021, of which six were discovered in-house. This is an addition to INDs that entered the clinic in 2020, which George mentioned.  Included in our R&D guidance and based on current plans, we expect to spend between $275 million and $350 million on the REGEN-COV development program. We expect most of this REGEN-COV spend to occur in the first half of the year.  Next, we forecast our 2021 SG&A expense to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.63 billion. We continue to invest in multiple launches in 2021, including two new indications for Libtayo and efforts for REGEN-COV. Also, as you heard from Marion, this increased spending will also be driven by a DTC campaign for EYLEA as we continue to see significant growth opportunity in diabetic eye disease.  Next, we expect our 2021 product gross margin on a percentage of net product sales that we record to be between 87% and 89%. We expect 2021 cost of collaboration manufacturing to be in the range of $670 million to $750 million, driven by continued growth in our Dupixent franchise.  We forecast 2021 operating income and expense to be income of $150 million to $175 million.  Finally, we expect our 2021 non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 12% to 14%, inclusive of REGEN-COV sales in the US, which are taxed at the US statutory rate.  I'd also like to review our current supply agreements with the US government for REGEN-COV. We expect to recognize the remainder of the $466 million initial US government contract in the first quarter of 2021. We also announced last month a new agreement with the US government for additional doses of REGEN-COV. Right now, we expect to deliver approximately 750,000 doses by the agreed delivery date of June 30 of this year at the contracted price of $2,100 per dose, with the vast majority of these deliveries occurring in the second quarter.  As George mentioned earlier, we are evaluating a lower 1.2 gram dose for REGEN-COV. Should this lower treatment dose receive emergency use authorization or approval from the FDA, we aim to deliver up to 1.25 million doses by June 30, which is the maximum quantity that is authorized for purchase by the US government under the supply agreement. Importantly, if the lower dose is approved, the pricing per dose does not change.  Our ability to fulfill these finished doses is predicated on continued success in the manufacture of bulk product and access to third-party finished capacity, which is under heavy demand from COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers.  In conclusion, we are well positioned for significant growth with durable core products, multiple near-term launches and specialized growth opportunities, while investing in our R&D engine to drive sustainable long-term growth.  With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Justin. \nJustin Holko : Thank you, Bob. Michelle, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. We have more than 20 callers in the queue today. So, to ensure that we were able to address as many of these questions as possible, we are only going to answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. So, please do limit yourself to that one question. Please go ahead, Michelle.\nOperator: . Our first question comes from Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. \nChristopher Raymond: This question is on REGEN-COV. So, I heard Marion's prepared remarks around working to iron out some of the reported logistical and, arguably, financial barriers that have been talked about so much in the real world setting. But I'm guessing, with the development path being as compressed as it was, your commercial support is probably playing catch up a bit here. But can you maybe talk a little bit about \u2013 more specifically what you guys feel needs to be worked on the most? Is it education of physicians? Is it the logistical issues? What kind of support \u2013 any color there in terms of what exactly you need to do to sort of smooth things out would be great.\nLeonard Schleifer: Marion can give you more details. But the way we look at it, we need to do work at all parts of the funnel, the top end of the funnel being getting physicians to actually prescribe the product for the appropriate patients and as well as at the bottom end of the funnel which gets quite narrow in some places allowing people to easily get administered the product once the physician wants to treat the patient.  And there's been a lot of progress on both ends there. On the bottom end of the funnel, there have been best practices emerging where people have linked directly medical record algorithms to positive patients, asking their doctor if they want to get a consult to administer the cocktail, and they've administered lots and lots of doses of monoclonal antibodies and these best practices are emerging around the country.  On the top end, there is still some skepticism that the data is incomplete, that the data isn't robust enough. And we certainly would agree that we don't have the normal data standards that you might have for a full FDA approval, but we remind everybody that we are in the midst of a pandemic where hundreds of thousands of people are going to die and have died. And sometimes, one has to look at the totality of the evidence and make decisions in that regard. So, we continue on the top end education and the logistics on the bottom end.  Marion might want to add something.\nMarion McCourt: Chris, I would just add that, as Len pointed out, we continue to work with all of our stakeholders to improve in all dimensions, top level; and at the local level, it is not a traditional commercialization. Under the emergency use authorization, we're working very closely with the government in helping stakeholders with education. The efforts of our medical affairs team in the marketplace has been paramount, our trade and market access group, our policy and government teams. So, we have a lot of work to do. But we are making progress. And I do think that's very, very encouraging.  Most encouraging of all is when we talk to the physicians and KOLs that have used REGEN-COV, they report positive results. And some at this point, some facilities have used antibodies and our antibody cocktail to treat hundreds and thousands of patients. So, the best practices are growing, and we're trying to appropriately accelerate that learning. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan.\nCory Kasimov: On Dupixent, given the time on market and the broad favorable feedback everyone seems to get on the product, why do you believe it's only penetrated roughly 6% in the US for atopic derm? And what do you think is the key here over the next year or two to unlocking a lot more? Thank you.\nMarion McCourt: Let me take a stab, Cory, on that. I think that for patients with atopic dermatitis, there had been so little for so long that, over the course of several years now where Dupixent has been in the marketplace, the amazing efficacy, the safety profile, the convenience of use is something that has required a lot of market education and a lot of market understanding.  And across the approved indications that we have in the US today, there are about 2.2 million eligible patients and only about 6% are getting treatment today. So, while favorable results in the understanding of Dupixent with dermatologists, allergists, all of our prescribers and obviously, in asthma, now with pulmonologists and allergists, for nasal polyps with ENTs as well, this is a remarkable alternative across Type 2 disease for approved indications today. But there's a lot of unmet need, and obviously the future indications will take us into new populations and new prescribers.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: I also think there's a lot of education that needs to be done, because obviously there's a long legacy in which people believe that drugs that you might take by mouth, things like JAK inhibitors or things like steroids are not as serious drugs as drugs that you take by an injection or biologicals.  And I think that most people \u2013 or most sophisticated people are beginning to realize now that it's the biologicals, particularly a drug like Dupixent which is more targeted, more natural, and less prone to an assortment of both on-target and off-target toxicities.  And so, people think, a pill, it's less serious. And I think we have to do a lot of education to explain that these biologicals are actually more targeted, more natural, they can be a lot safer. And though they're more powerful, you don't have to think of them as more serious in a negative way. So, I think there's a huge legacy of thinking of things like that, but the emerging data that's coming out now is going to help, I think, with these points that, if you're suffering from a disease like atopic dermatitis, you want to be on a natural approach, targeted biological, something that has an exquisite safety profile, like Dupixent.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.\nTerence Flynn: Thanks, again, for all the work on the COVID front. Really appreciate all the effort. I know you guys have been working hard there. Just a question for George. You mentioned the efficacy signals you're seeing with your MUC16 bispecific in ovarian cancer. Just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more there. Is that a RECIST response? Is it CA-125 or maybe another biomarker? And then, on the safety front, anything initially you can share there as well? Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: I can tell you when I say efficacy, it relates to both RECIST and CA-125 measures. I don't think that we have given any specifics on that, and we're waiting for an appropriate medical venue in which to present the data, but we are pretty excited about the preliminary evidence of activity. And as I said, we'll be giving all the details at an upcoming scientific meeting.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink. \nGeoffrey Porges: George, a couple of questions on the \u2013 allergy related. You sound quite excited about the allergy programs now. And just wondering if you could tell us a little bit about the path forward for peanut allergy and whether you think this will ultimately be a maintenance treatment for a significant population. Thanks.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: I think that we're very excited about our entire allergy portfolio because we really think we have a collection of powerful, but also groundbreaking new approaches. So, as we all know, so many people, millions in the United States, are taking, for example, multiple shots weekly to try to get desensitized or undergo these very long prolonged oral approaches and so forth, often with unsatisfying results even after years of therapy. So, I think it's exciting as we announced that we were able to demonstrate a significant improvement in the amount of peanut tolerization that could occur in conjunction with a new oral desensitization approach.  And we think that this is going to prove to be generalizable across the board to many of these desensitization approaches where we hope that Dupixent will aid in making patients more desensitized, maybe able to tolerate these regimens better, as well as maybe improve more quickly.  And that's only one component of our allergy program. We're equally excited about a somewhat unrelated effort. We're the first people who are moving into the clinic antibodies that directly bind and neutralize allergens. I for one don't understand why this hasn't been done before. But our data, some of which we have, talked about publicly and even published, and some of it we will be presenting at upcoming meetings show that these are very powerful approaches. From the first injection, almost immediately, at the first time measures, we're getting the sorts of improvements that you see across studies resulting after years of desensitization therapy.  And we're talking about two of the most important allergies, which are both associated with asthma, in which settings because of safety concerns, desensitization approaches are not indicated. That is cat allergy and birch allergy. The results are really striking. We think this is an entirely new way to fight allergy, one in which you can almost see the benefit immediately. Once again, it's a very natural and biologic and targeted approach. There are millions of people who are affected by these, and I think many of them having \u2013 many of them in my family, I can tell you that they would \u2013 if we can really continue to show the sort of safety and efficacy that the initial studies are showing, I think a lot of people would welcome the opportunity to take a shot and have immediate benefit in terms of their serious allergies. And it's an entirely new approach.  And all of these things are synergistic, of course. We can imagine many ways in which we can be combining and mixing and matching various parts of our portfolio, including things like Dupixent and these anti-allergens, but with other approaches as well. So, we really think that we may be at the dawn of a whole new era of biologics approach to treating allergy, which I think can really change everything for so many people.  And we know that, according to the CDC, allergic diseases are now approaching and increasing in epidemic proportions. So, there's a real need out there. And there's a real need for totally new approaches. And so we're very excited about them.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ronny Gal with Bernstein.\nRonny Gal: Question around the plan for non-small cell lung cancer. With you guys being so close to the launch, I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit more about your launch plans. It seems that you'll have to use some sort of a targeting approach and segmentation to see where you will be able to penetrate the market given you coming in late. Can you share a little bit more about it? Kind of like what range of upside do we expect from this market? What would you be happy with?\nLeonard Schleifer: I want to just make one comment about that we're coming in late, and then say that we probably won't answer our lunch plans. We have to get our final label. And we certainly don't want to tip off any of our competitors of what we're up to. But we're spending a lot of time obviously thinking about that.  But let me just address one comment you made, which was that, you said coming in late. I remember, it may have been you, but it probably was somebody else who asked this question, why were we even bothering with Libtayo in non-small cell lung cancer because by the time you get it approved, there'll be 10 others that are there. And I remember George answering that question saying, well, he's not so sure that there'll be 10 others, all antibodies aren't created equal, plus it would be a foundation for the rest of our business. And that wisdom has really panned out because if you look almost every day, there's another failure of a PD-L1 or an inferior PD-1 that doesn't combine, right? All sorts of things. And there really is only one right now, one gold standard, which is Keytruda. And obviously, we don't have any head to head data.  But when you look at our data, it's really impressive data. And so, we think that we should remind everybody that the questions that we got 5 or 10 years ago, why bother have sort of panned out more the way George had anticipated, rather than maybe everybody else had.  As far as specific lunch plans, we'll ask you to stay tuned because we're working hard at preparing. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kennen MacKay with RBC Capital Markets.\nKennen MacKay: What a year indeed! Maybe a question on EYLEA. Len, a couple of years ago, you got it completely right on some of the emerging competition not being as big a risk as myself and some of the Street had anticipated would be. Just would love to get your perspective on some of the new data from the Ang2 and sort of how you're thinking about some of the evolving competition there again, given you're certainly right in the path?\nLeonard Schleifer: I think George touched on it, but let me deal specifically as best we can for the product you referenced from Roche, which is a combination of anti-VEGF and anti-Ang2. I might start out by saying we have the greatest respect for Roche Genentech, the group, we partner with them in our COVID global efforts, and we watch them really establish the anti-VEGF class with Lucentis. So, we have tremendous respect for them.  But I think when it comes to Ang2, history has a very important lesson here, in that I was with George, I remember it, we were tracking \u2013 I was with George when one of his colleagues, they were working so hard to identify, purify and clone and sequence this really important molecule that was seemed to be a critical player in blood vessel formation and development, et cetera. And maybe the only real other critical factor other than VEGF. So, George and his group discovered this molecule, and nobody would like to see it bear fruit in terms of a treatment. But the data that we have just don't support that. Our data, we look very carefully, we could not find the benefit of adding Ang2 to the amazing effects that you get with a highly potent anti-VEGF compound, such as EYLEA.  So, when we look at the data you refer to, we haven't seen all their data and we'll look for it, but from what they've disclosed, some ways in the 40s-percent to be able to get to a 16-week regimen is what George referred to is exactly what EYLEA gets in the ALTAIR study.  So, we don't see so far any evidence \u2013 we'll look at the data \u2013 that there's anything more there than high dose anti-VEGF therapy, higher than Lucentis on a molar basis. And so, we'll have to wait and see. But one has to remember, though, so that safety, George mentioned, we have 30 million injections under our belt, that's a tremendous safety database. And you can see what happens that there's been a reminder out there just how important the safety side of this is.  So, we'll see. We have great respect for them. But we don't see any data right now to suggest Ang2 blockade is playing any differentiated role, if any role at all. I don't know, George, the discover of Ang2, you want to comment further. \nGeorge Yancopoulos: Just very quickly. As Len said, we discovered the entire family of the angiopoietins. And we obviously made the first and we think the best antibodies against these factors. We tried them in combination studies. I think there is no evidence at all from any of the faricimab data that there's any additional benefit vis-\u00e0-vis mechanism of action of the combined blockade of the angiopoietin.  Two, I think that it's sort of a regulatory trick to try to create a differentiated molecule, put both activities within one. We think it's a better, more convincing, frankly, safer approach to actually test both blocking agents separately, rather than combining them in one molecule when there's no benefit other than pure regulatory tricks for combining them into one molecule.  The way we think that the data looks right now, it looks as if this is merely high dose Lucentis. And the data that they've at least reported to date suggests similar data to what we see right now currently with EYLEA. As Len mentioned, we have studies that show that up to 40% of patients can achieve 16-week dosing. I think the important add-on to it is, of course \u2013 is that we have our upcoming studies with high dose EYLEA. So, basically, what people are doing are they're taking carbon molecules which didn't fare as well, and they're high dosing them. Okay? We're taking EYLEA and we're high dosing it. And it's already starting at a place where its duration and its efficacy and its safety seem to be leading with really no evidence that the competition has anything significantly different. But now, we're testing the higher dose to see whether we can make EYLEA even better while still delivering the same safety and efficacy.  So, we're pretty excited about that. And as we said, we see there's no evidence that any of the competitors are providing anything different at this point. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with Credit Suisse.\nEvan Seigerman: Thanks for all the work on the COVID-19 antibody. So I'm looking at REGN1979. Assuming that the trial resumes near term, what do you really need to demonstrate in this Phase II, potentially pivotal file for submission next year? I believe you kind of highlighted that earlier in the year. \nGeorge Yancopoulos: I think that, basically, what we have to do is just continue to see the efficacy and build on the duration that we've seen, while continuing to also decrease on any of the safety concerns and so forth. But I think the data, as it stands right now, would be very supportive of an approval as long as we can confirm it in larger numbers. And importantly, build on the already very impressive duration with some responses exceeding the year timeframes. So, we're very excited about it. Obviously, there's always concerns and hurdles we have to get over. But assuming that we can get past them and we can resume enrollment and continue with the study, we hope that the data as it matures and accrues will continue to support that it's an important option that these patients could have. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Cowen.\nYaron Werber: George, maybe just for you, you're all very excited about the costim strategy. We'll get data at some point in the late this year or next year. But how do you \u2013 when you're thinking about costim with a CD-28 and also hitting the CD-3 axis or the bispecific, how would that work? If you could just give us a preview. \nGeorge Yancopoulos: Just in terms of the costim, so as we've shown in some very high profile papers in Science and Science Translational, basically, nature uses to activate T cells to do their job, particularly, for example, to kill cells. They need signal 1 through the T cell receptor itself, which is a CD-3 is an important components of that. But they also need signal 2 which some people refer to as a costimulatory signal. And so, by combining bispecifics that involve CD-3 engagement and bispecifics that involve CD-28 or costimulatory engagement, you're simultaneously activating both signal 1 and signal 2.  And we have shown rather compellingly in preclinical models that this really accentuates and really dramatically increases the ability of T cells to kill the target itself. Let me also remind you that the PD-1 and other checkpoint inhibitors provide a break. So, you have signal 1 and signal 2, which are driving the cells to kill. And then, you can have a brake signal that acts through checkpoints, such as PD-1. So, combining all three or combining them in pairwise fashion, in animal models, shows that you can just increase the amount of tumor killing that you get as compared with having just one of the approaches.  So, we're just trying to understand what nature does and how nature optimizes the process and then mimic it with these natural approaches to biologics that can activate in a targeted fashion only on the tumor target cells, depending on how well the targeting is, signal 1, signal 2, while releasing the brake.  So, the preclinical data is pretty compelling. And we can only hope that we approach it with what we're going to see in the clinic. And we do think that, over the next year, it's going to be very interesting to see how these dose escalation trials play out. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Luchini with BMO Capital. \nMatthew Luchini: I wanted to quickly come back to EYLEA competitive dynamics and just try to understand a little bit what your internal kind of market research is indicating about physicians' willingness to even really consider new drugs. In other words, maybe you could share a little bit of your perspective on what impact the brolucizumab experience last year has had on their willingness to step away from a proven agent like EYLEA.\nMarion McCourt: I'm happy to take it. I'll start with where you ended. I do think that the experience of the Novartis launch reset the table on the importance of safety. And frankly, never assuming safety or assuming efficacy for any category, let alone when you're injecting into someone's eye and seeking to save their vision.  We look at the competitive dynamic, as you know, very, very thoroughly. And I do think that EYLEA during this period of time, the last couple of years, but certainly during the pandemic, the characteristics of the breath of indications, experience, the ability to treat and extend, now in a prefilled syringe for efficiency and throughput in the offices, and this remarkable safety and efficacy profile make it an incredibly compelling choice for retinal specialists and injectors.  We, obviously, even within our own portfolio, look to improvements, like the EYLEA high dose for the future, the ability to treat and extend even further. But obviously, we've very deliberately with our scientific team set very, very high bar for competition.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: I think that vision is so important. We all know it, we all treasure it. Okay? And I think that there's, hopefully, a new \u2013 a realization once again about how important it is and how a catastrophic event that causes permanent loss of vision can be so catastrophic and so damning. And I think that when you have such a safe and effective agent, with such an experience, one really has to take into consideration the risks, the potential catastrophic risks of trying new approaches, unknown safety risks with the potential catastrophic risk. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Citigroup. \nMohit Bansal: Congrats on the progress. In our conversations with experts, doctors did talk about the potential use of Dupixent in milder patients, given the safety. So, to that end, do you need to do a clinical trial to get there? Or do you think it is already happening to some extent at dermatologists' offices? Thank you.\nMarion McCourt: The profile today for Dupixent treatment is for patients with moderate to severe disease, both in atopic dermatitis and also for patients that require biologic asthma treatment. I'll let team members talk about additional clinical work to that component. But that is our focus of the population. As we discussed earlier, in the US alone, we probably have about 2.2 million eligible patients, just on the indications where we have approval today. But to your comment, what I hear about time and time again from our physician prescribers and key opinion leaders is the remarkable safety profile based on a very specific mechanism of action. And that confidence in being able to treat not only adults, now the younger age groups where we have indications, for example, in atopic dermatitis, not only for adolescence, but on pediatric patients down to six years of age.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: I think it's a great question and it reflects back on this issue about penetration and so forth. It didn't take much market research to know how Dupixent was initially being used or how most drugs are used. Though it was approved, for example, in the moderate to severe population in atopic dermatitis, all physicians initially started with their toughest, their hardest, their most serious patients before then gradually going backwards in the treatment paradigm. And that is one of the reasons why we're only penetrating about 6% of the moderate to severe population. So, I think that gradually, with more confidence, they're going to treat people who are on the more moderate side of things.  That said, I think the point that \u2013 the efficacy profile, but also the mechanism of action, the fact that you are probably in the long term may be benefiting the patient in terms of slowing or preventing the ultimate atopic marks that occurs in so many patients demands that we figure out a way to take this product to earlier patients. Those will, however, require additional studies. We're trying to figure out the best way to do it. But I for one do think that, for example, many more patients with much milder asthma or other milder forms of Type 2 disease that we know in many patients is just going to get worse over time. We owe these patients \u2013 we have to figure out through a clinical program, how to do the right studies, how to convince the FDA and how to move this treatment back towards these earlier patients.\nJustin Holko : Thanks everyone for joining the call. Thank you for hanging in there a little longer than normal. Bob Landry and the investor relations team will be around after the call. We hope you enjoy your weekend. Please stay safe. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

            "name": "Marion McCourt",
            "content": "Thank you, George. We ended 2020 with positive momentum across our commercial portfolio as our core products, EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo, delivered strong performance in the fourth quarter. Our 2020 results coupled with near-term launch opportunities position us for continued diversified growth in 2021.  Beginning with EYLEA, fourth quarter global net sales grew 10% year-over-year to $2.2 billion. As we reported last month, US EYLEA net sales grew 10% year-over-year to $1.34 billion, the highest reported net sales since EYLEA's launch. EYLEA again outperformed the category with share gains from both branded and unbranded competition. EYLEA share of the branded category approached 75% for the quarter and EYLEA remains the number one prescribed anti-VEGF therapy overall in wet AMD and diabetic eye disease.  While volume in the overall anti-VEGF category declined in 2020, EYLEA was the only product in the category to grow. Patient volumes are now normalizing. EYLEA sets a high bar on efficacy, safety, dosing inflexibility and real world experience for current and future competition.  The anti-VEGF category continues to be supported by the aging population and increasing prevalence of diabetes. Realizing the full potential in diabetic eye disease remains a key initiative, representing a significant growth opportunity for EYLEA and is largely unpenetrated. We intend to initiate a direct to consumer campaign to create awareness for patients on the importance of vision care as part of managing their diabetes.  In summary, EYLEA had an impressive quarter and we remain confident in its outlook.  Next, we recorded $146 million for our antibody cocktail, REGEN-COV, in the fourth quarter. Where appropriate, we are deploying commercial efforts under the EUA to improve availability for this important treatment against COVID-19 for at-risk patients. We are engaging with all stakeholders to reduce bottlenecks and drive utilization rates higher. Regeneron is working to educate stakeholders, including patients, on the urgency to treat at-risk non-hospitalized patients within 10 days of receiving a positive COVID-19 diagnosis.  Initiatives to reduce administrative burden and direct patients to treatment centers are beginning to yield encouraging results. Physicians using REGEN-COV are providing very positive feedback on treatment results.  Let me also briefly discuss another new medicine, evinacumab, brand name Evkeeza. We're prepared for the February 11 PDUFA date for Evkeeza for the treatment of HoFH, a rare disease that affects approximately 1,300 patients in the US. There's high unmet need for these patients with this rare genetic condition as they struggle to keep their LDL cholesterol levels under control.  These patients face an increased risk of premature heart disease as early as their teenage years. We are leveraging our cardio metabolic expertise and existing commercial platform to drive uptake in this rare disease category.  Turning now to Libtayo, for the fourth quarter, global net sales grew to $97 million. In the US, net sales were $74 million, driven by steady volume growth in advanced CSCC. We are nearing the potential approval of two additional indications for Libtayo in basal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer, both of which received priority reviews and have upcoming PDUFA dates. Our teams are eager and ready to launch once approved.  For basal cell carcinoma, there are no FDA approved treatment options once a patient progresses on or becomes intolerant to hedgehog inhibitors. Just as we did with CSCC, we will work to establish Libtayo as the standard of care in appropriate BCC patients.  We also look forward to competing in non-small cell lung cancer, where there's a large opportunity among patients with PD-L1 expressions at least 50%. Libtayo has a favorable product profile and a growing majority of treatment centers and oncologists have experience using Libtayo in their CSCC patients.  Physicians preferred choice and recent market research shows that nearly two-thirds of physicians are highly motivated to evaluate Libtayo for their lung cancer patients if approved. Additionally, we've built a highly experienced commercialization team with a significant launch experience with this class. If approved, we aim to rapidly increase market awareness of Libtayo as a compelling new anti-PD-1 monotherapy treatment option. Finally, moving to Dupixent, global net sales in the fourth quarter were $1.17 billion, representing 56% growth compared to the prior year. In the US, broad-based growth across all approved indications contributed to net sales of $926 million. We continue to see strong prescription trends across all approved indications. And weekly new patient shares have recently eclipsed pre-pandemic levels.  Atopic dermatitis, the largest indication, is a significant growth driver on Dupixent's rapid onset, proven efficacy and well established safety profile. Physicians continued to expand prescribing across both moderate and severe disease and in younger populations where safety is paramount.  Despite the impressive launch growth trajectory, there remains significant opportunity as only a small percentage of the over 2 million biologic eligible patients in the US have been unprescribed Dupixent.  Our initiatives aim to grow new patient starts as there is substantial opportunity for many more patients to benefit and support patients already on Dupixent to continue their treatment.  Moving to asthma, Dupixent is performing well in this competitive market based on its clinical efficacy and safety profile, which is compelling and differentiated to prescribers. Our market expansion efforts supporting HCPs and patients, including DTC, continue to have a meaningful impact on new initiations and launch preparations are underway in pediatric  pediatric asthma setting.  For chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, we see healthy demand and continued strong prescribing trends among ENTs and allergists. Dupixent is core to our diversified growth strategy where there remains substantial opportunity for future expansion.  In closing, we ended 2020 with momentum, delivering strong performance across our business. With several near-term launches ahead, we have important opportunities to strengthen our thriving commercial portfolio and capitalize on growth.  Now I'll turn the call to Bob. Chris, I would just add that, as Len pointed out, we continue to work with all of our stakeholders to improve in all dimensions, top level; and at the local level, it is not a traditional commercialization. Under the emergency use authorization, we're working very closely with the government in helping stakeholders with education. The efforts of our medical affairs team in the marketplace has been paramount, our trade and market access group, our policy and government teams. So, we have a lot of work to do. But we are making progress. And I do think that's very, very encouraging.  Most encouraging of all is when we talk to the physicians and KOLs that have used REGEN-COV, they report positive results. And some at this point, some facilities have used antibodies and our antibody cocktail to treat hundreds and thousands of patients. So, the best practices are growing, and we're trying to appropriately accelerate that learning. Let me take a stab, Cory, on that. I think that for patients with atopic dermatitis, there had been so little for so long that, over the course of several years now where Dupixent has been in the marketplace, the amazing efficacy, the safety profile, the convenience of use is something that has required a lot of market education and a lot of market understanding.  And across the approved indications that we have in the US today, there are about 2.2 million eligible patients and only about 6% are getting treatment today. So, while favorable results in the understanding of Dupixent with dermatologists, allergists, all of our prescribers and obviously, in asthma, now with pulmonologists and allergists, for nasal polyps with ENTs as well, this is a remarkable alternative across Type 2 disease for approved indications today. But there's a lot of unmet need, and obviously the future indications will take us into new populations and new prescribers. I'm happy to take it. I'll start with where you ended. I do think that the experience of the Novartis launch reset the table on the importance of safety. And frankly, never assuming safety or assuming efficacy for any category, let alone when you're injecting into someone's eye and seeking to save their vision.  We look at the competitive dynamic, as you know, very, very thoroughly. And I do think that EYLEA during this period of time, the last couple of years, but certainly during the pandemic, the characteristics of the breath of indications, experience, the ability to treat and extend, now in a prefilled syringe for efficiency and throughput in the offices, and this remarkable safety and efficacy profile make it an incredibly compelling choice for retinal specialists and injectors.  We, obviously, even within our own portfolio, look to improvements, like the EYLEA high dose for the future, the ability to treat and extend even further. But obviously, we've very deliberately with our scientific team set very, very high bar for competition. The profile today for Dupixent treatment is for patients with moderate to severe disease, both in atopic dermatitis and also for patients that require biologic asthma treatment. I'll let team members talk about additional clinical work to that component. But that is our focus of the population. As we discussed earlier, in the US alone, we probably have about 2.2 million eligible patients, just on the indications where we have approval today.

            "name": "Leonard Schleifer",
            "content": "Thank you, Justin, and thanks to everyone joining on today's call. 2020 was a devastating year for so many individuals and their families who succumbed to COVID-19. At Regeneron, we have done all we can to be part of the solution, and we'll spend quite a bit of time today trying to inform you of our efforts. Marion can give you more details. But the way we look at it, we need to do work at all parts of the funnel, the top end of the funnel being getting physicians to actually prescribe the product for the appropriate patients and as well as at the bottom end of the funnel which gets quite narrow in some places allowing people to easily get administered the product once the physician wants to treat the patient.  And there's been a lot of progress on both ends there. On the bottom end of the funnel, there have been best practices emerging where people have linked directly medical record algorithms to positive patients, asking their doctor if they want to get a consult to administer the cocktail, and they've administered lots and lots of doses of monoclonal antibodies and these best practices are emerging around the country.  On the top end, there is still some skepticism that the data is incomplete, that the data isn't robust enough. And we certainly would agree that we don't have the normal data standards that you might have for a full FDA approval, but we remind everybody that we are in the midst of a pandemic where hundreds of thousands of people are going to die and have died. And sometimes, one has to look at the totality of the evidence and make decisions in that regard. So, we continue on the top end education and the logistics on the bottom end.  Marion might want to add something. I want to just make one comment about that we're coming in late, and then say that we probably won't answer our lunch plans. We have to get our final label. And we certainly don't want to tip off any of our competitors of what we're up to. But we're spending a lot of time obviously thinking about that.  But let me just address one comment you made, which was that, you said coming in late. I remember, it may have been you, but it probably was somebody else who asked this question, why were we even bothering with Libtayo in non-small cell lung cancer because by the time you get it approved, there'll be 10 others that are there. And I remember George answering that question saying, well, he's not so sure that there'll be 10 others, all antibodies aren't created equal, plus it would be a foundation for the rest of our business. And that wisdom has really panned out because if you look almost every day, there's another failure of a PD-L1 or an inferior PD-1 that doesn't combine, right? All sorts of things. And there really is only one right now, one gold standard, which is Keytruda. And obviously, we don't have any head to head data.  But when you look at our data, it's really impressive data. And so, we think that we should remind everybody that the questions that we got 5 or 10 years ago, why bother have sort of panned out more the way George had anticipated, rather than maybe everybody else had.  As far as specific lunch plans, we'll ask you to stay tuned because we're working hard at preparing. I think George touched on it, but let me deal specifically as best we can for the product you referenced from Roche, which is a combination of anti-VEGF and anti-Ang2. I might start out by saying we have the greatest respect for Roche Genentech, the group, we partner with them in our COVID global efforts, and we watch them really establish the anti-VEGF class with Lucentis. So, we have tremendous respect for them.  But I think when it comes to Ang2, history has a very important lesson here, in that I was with George, I remember it, we were tracking \u2013 I was with George when one of his colleagues, they were working so hard to identify, purify and clone and sequence this really important molecule that was seemed to be a critical player in blood vessel formation and development, et cetera. And maybe the only real other critical factor other than VEGF. So, George and his group discovered this molecule, and nobody would like to see it bear fruit in terms of a treatment. But the data that we have just don't support that. Our data, we look very carefully, we could not find the benefit of adding Ang2 to the amazing effects that you get with a highly potent anti-VEGF compound, such as EYLEA.  So, when we look at the data you refer to, we haven't seen all their data and we'll look for it, but from what they've disclosed, some ways in the 40s-percent to be able to get to a 16-week regimen is what George referred to is exactly what EYLEA gets in the ALTAIR study.  So, we don't see so far any evidence \u2013 we'll look at the data \u2013 that there's anything more there than high dose anti-VEGF therapy, higher than Lucentis on a molar basis. And so, we'll have to wait and see. But one has to remember, though, so that safety, George mentioned, we have 30 million injections under our belt, that's a tremendous safety database. And you can see what happens that there's been a reminder out there just how important the safety side of this is.  So, we'll see. We have great respect for them. But we don't see any data right now to suggest Ang2 blockade is playing any differentiated role, if any role at all. I don't know, George, the discover of Ang2, you want to comment further."

            "name": "Robert Landry",
            "content": "Thanks, Marion. And good morning and good afternoon, everybody. My comments today on financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. For the fourth quarter of 2020, Regeneron delivered again double-digit broad-based top and bottom line growth. Our revenue streams continue to diversify with significant growth contributions from Dupixent and REGEN-COV, as we invest in our best in class pipeline for sustained future growth.  For the fourth quarter, total revenue grew 30% year-over-year to $2.4 billion, driven by growth in US EYLEA sales; higher collaboration revenues from our partners, Sanofi and Bayer; and sales of our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail. Diluted net income per share grew 27% year-over-year to $9.53 on net income of $1.1 billion. Since Marion discussed our US EYLEA results, I will start with our Bayer and Sanofi collaborations.  Starting with the Bayer collaboration. Ex-US EYLEA net product sales reported to us by Bayer were $859 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, representing growth of 10% on a reported basis compared to the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $361 million, of which we recorded $335 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the US.  Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $317 million in the fourth quarter. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of non-IO antibodies was $230 million, which compares favorably to profits of $104 million in the prior year. This growth was primarily driven by higher Dupixent profits.  Other revenue increased to $123 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $96 million in the prior year. The primary driver is the recognition of $42 million from the US government associated with reimbursements of REGEN-COV development.  As we said on the third quarter call, this line item continues to trend lower due to the wind down of development reimbursements from the US government. In 2021, we expect to record approximately half of the $557 million recorded in other revenue for full-year 2020.  Moving on to our operating expenses, and starting with R&D. R&D increased 50% year-over-year to $675 million, primarily due to continued clinical development costs for our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail and higher headcount to support our expanding pipeline.  Next, SG&A expense increased 22% year-over-year to $381 million. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by increased headcount launch preparations for Libtayo and continued investments for growth in EYLEA. Cost of goods sold increased 79% from the prior year from $93 million to $166 million due to sales of REGEN-COV and Praluent in the US. Cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing was $174 million compared to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to increased sales of Dupixent.  Additionally, in other operating income and expense, we recorded $145 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2020. This includes approximately $100 million of income related to higher recognition of upfront and milestone payments previously received from our collaborators with Sanofi, Teva and Mitsubishi Tanabe. Finally, in other income and expense, we recorded $2 million of expense compared to $25 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2019. This is driven by interest expense related to our $2 billion debt issuance in August 2020 and lower investment returns on our existing cash and marketable securities. Turning now to taxes. The effective tax rate was 7.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 10.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. For the full-year 2020, Regeneron generated $2 billion in free cash flow and ended the year with cash and marketable securities, less long term debt, of $4.7 billion. We also exhausted our inaugural $1 billion share repurchase program in the fourth quarter.  As a result of our strong balance sheet and confidence in the growth trajectory of our business, we are announcing a new board authorized share repurchase program of $1.5 billion. This program is consistent with our capital allocation priorities of funding our broad R&D pipeline, investing in enabling and synergizing R&D business development opportunities, and returning cash to our shareholders. With this new authorization, we will continue to be opportunistic buyers where we see dislocation between our stock price and our intrinsic valuation.  Having reviewed our fourth quarter performance, I'd like to take some time to discuss the 2021 financial outlook. Starting with R&D guidance. We forecast our 2021 R&D expense to be in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.85 billion. We are continuing to advance programs in our diverse R&D portfolio with up to 7 INDs to enter the clinic in 2021, of which six were discovered in-house. This is an addition to INDs that entered the clinic in 2020, which George mentioned.  Included in our R&D guidance and based on current plans, we expect to spend between $275 million and $350 million on the REGEN-COV development program. We expect most of this REGEN-COV spend to occur in the first half of the year.  Next, we forecast our 2021 SG&A expense to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.63 billion. We continue to invest in multiple launches in 2021, including two new indications for Libtayo and efforts for REGEN-COV. Also, as you heard from Marion, this increased spending will also be driven by a DTC campaign for EYLEA as we continue to see significant growth opportunity in diabetic eye disease.  Next, we expect our 2021 product gross margin on a percentage of net product sales that we record to be between 87% and 89%. We expect 2021 cost of collaboration manufacturing to be in the range of $670 million to $750 million, driven by continued growth in our Dupixent franchise.  We forecast 2021 operating income and expense to be income of $150 million to $175 million.  Finally, we expect our 2021 non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 12% to 14%, inclusive of REGEN-COV sales in the US, which are taxed at the US statutory rate.  I'd also like to review our current supply agreements with the US government for REGEN-COV. We expect to recognize the remainder of the $466 million initial US government contract in the first quarter of 2021. We also announced last month a new agreement with the US government for additional doses of REGEN-COV. Right now, we expect to deliver approximately 750,000 doses by the agreed delivery date of June 30 of this year at the contracted price of $2,100 per dose, with the vast majority of these deliveries occurring in the second quarter.  As George mentioned earlier, we are evaluating a lower 1.2 gram dose for REGEN-COV. Should this lower treatment dose receive emergency use authorization or approval from the FDA, we aim to deliver up to 1.25 million doses by June 30, which is the maximum quantity that is authorized for purchase by the US government under the supply agreement. Importantly, if the lower dose is approved, the pricing per dose does not change.  Our ability to fulfill these finished doses is predicated on continued success in the manufacture of bulk product and access to third-party finished capacity, which is under heavy demand from COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers.  In conclusion, we are well positioned for significant growth with durable core products, multiple near-term launches and specialized growth opportunities, while investing in our R&D engine to drive sustainable long-term growth.  With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Justin."

            "name": "George Yancopoulos",
            "content": "Thank you, Len. With the world still in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, I will start with our efforts on REGEN-COV, our antibody cocktail targeting the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  Over the last few months, we have achieved several important milestones. On November 21, our antibody cocktail received FDA emergency use authorization for recently diagnosed, mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in high-risk patients. The EUA was granted based on the initial results in patients from our large study in the non-hospitalized setting. I also think there's a lot of education that needs to be done, because obviously there's a long legacy in which people believe that drugs that you might take by mouth, things like JAK inhibitors or things like steroids are not as serious drugs as drugs that you take by an injection or biologicals.  And I think that most people \u2013 or most sophisticated people are beginning to realize now that it's the biologicals, particularly a drug like Dupixent which is more targeted, more natural, and less prone to an assortment of both on-target and off-target toxicities.  And so, people think, a pill, it's less serious. And I think we have to do a lot of education to explain that these biologicals are actually more targeted, more natural, they can be a lot safer. And though they're more powerful, you don't have to think of them as more serious in a negative way. So, I think there's a huge legacy of thinking of things like that, but the emerging data that's coming out now is going to help, I think, with these points that, if you're suffering from a disease like atopic dermatitis, you want to be on a natural approach, targeted biological, something that has an exquisite safety profile, like Dupixent. I can tell you when I say efficacy, it relates to both RECIST and CA-125 measures. I don't think that we have given any specifics on that, and we're waiting for an appropriate medical venue in which to present the data, but we are pretty excited about the preliminary evidence of activity. And as I said, we'll be giving all the details at an upcoming scientific meeting. I think that we're very excited about our entire allergy portfolio because we really think we have a collection of powerful, but also groundbreaking new approaches. So, as we all know, so many people, millions in the United States, are taking, for example, multiple shots weekly to try to get desensitized or undergo these very long prolonged oral approaches and so forth, often with unsatisfying results even after years of therapy. So, I think it's exciting as we announced that we were able to demonstrate a significant improvement in the amount of peanut tolerization that could occur in conjunction with a new oral desensitization approach.  And we think that this is going to prove to be generalizable across the board to many of these desensitization approaches where we hope that Dupixent will aid in making patients more desensitized, maybe able to tolerate these regimens better, as well as maybe improve more quickly.  And that's only one component of our allergy program. We're equally excited about a somewhat unrelated effort. We're the first people who are moving into the clinic antibodies that directly bind and neutralize allergens. I for one don't understand why this hasn't been done before. But our data, some of which we have, talked about publicly and even published, and some of it we will be presenting at upcoming meetings show that these are very powerful approaches. From the first injection, almost immediately, at the first time measures, we're getting the sorts of improvements that you see across studies resulting after years of desensitization therapy.  And we're talking about two of the most important allergies, which are both associated with asthma, in which settings because of safety concerns, desensitization approaches are not indicated. That is cat allergy and birch allergy. The results are really striking. We think this is an entirely new way to fight allergy, one in which you can almost see the benefit immediately. Once again, it's a very natural and biologic and targeted approach. There are millions of people who are affected by these, and I think many of them having \u2013 many of them in my family, I can tell you that they would \u2013 if we can really continue to show the sort of safety and efficacy that the initial studies are showing, I think a lot of people would welcome the opportunity to take a shot and have immediate benefit in terms of their serious allergies. And it's an entirely new approach.  And all of these things are synergistic, of course. We can imagine many ways in which we can be combining and mixing and matching various parts of our portfolio, including things like Dupixent and these anti-allergens, but with other approaches as well. So, we really think that we may be at the dawn of a whole new era of biologics approach to treating allergy, which I think can really change everything for so many people.  And we know that, according to the CDC, allergic diseases are now approaching and increasing in epidemic proportions. So, there's a real need out there. And there's a real need for totally new approaches. And so we're very excited about them. Just very quickly. As Len said, we discovered the entire family of the angiopoietins. And we obviously made the first and we think the best antibodies against these factors. We tried them in combination studies. I think there is no evidence at all from any of the faricimab data that there's any additional benefit vis-a\u0300-vis mechanism of action of the combined blockade of the angiopoietin.  Two, I think that it's sort of a regulatory trick to try to create a differentiated molecule, put both activities within one. We think it's a better, more convincing, frankly, safer approach to actually test both blocking agents separately, rather than combining them in one molecule when there's no benefit other than pure regulatory tricks for combining them into one molecule.  The way we think that the data looks right now, it looks as if this is merely high dose Lucentis. And the data that they've at least reported to date suggests similar data to what we see right now currently with EYLEA. As Len mentioned, we have studies that show that up to 40% of patients can achieve 16-week dosing. I think the important add-on to it is, of course \u2013 is that we have our upcoming studies with high dose EYLEA. So, basically, what people are doing are they're taking carbon molecules which didn't fare as well, and they're high dosing them. Okay? We're taking EYLEA and we're high dosing it. And it's already starting at a place where its duration and its efficacy and its safety seem to be leading with really no evidence that the competition has anything significantly different. But now, we're testing the higher dose to see whether we can make EYLEA even better while still delivering the same safety and efficacy.  So, we're pretty excited about that. And as we said, we see there's no evidence that any of the competitors are providing anything different at this point. I think that, basically, what we have to do is just continue to see the efficacy and build on the duration that we've seen, while continuing to also decrease on any of the safety concerns and so forth. But I think the data, as it stands right now, would be very supportive of an approval as long as we can confirm it in larger numbers. And importantly, build on the already very impressive duration with some responses exceeding the year timeframes. So, we're very excited about it. Obviously, there's always concerns and hurdles we have to get over. But assuming that we can get past them and we can resume enrollment and continue with the study, we hope that the data as it matures and accrues will continue to support that it's an important option that these patients could have. Just in terms of the costim, so as we've shown in some very high profile papers in Science and Science Translational, basically, nature uses to activate T cells to do their job, particularly, for example, to kill cells. They need signal 1 through the T cell receptor itself, which is a CD-3 is an important components of that. But they also need signal 2 which some people refer to as a costimulatory signal. And so, by combining bispecifics that involve CD-3 engagement and bispecifics that involve CD-28 or costimulatory engagement, you're simultaneously activating both signal 1 and signal 2.  And we have shown rather compellingly in preclinical models that this really accentuates and really dramatically increases the ability of T cells to kill the target itself. Let me also remind you that the PD-1 and other checkpoint inhibitors provide a break. So, you have signal 1 and signal 2, which are driving the cells to kill. And then, you can have a brake signal that acts through checkpoints, such as PD-1. So, combining all three or combining them in pairwise fashion, in animal models, shows that you can just increase the amount of tumor killing that you get as compared with having just one of the approaches.  So, we're just trying to understand what nature does and how nature optimizes the process and then mimic it with these natural approaches to biologics that can activate in a targeted fashion only on the tumor target cells, depending on how well the targeting is, signal 1, signal 2, while releasing the brake.  So, the preclinical data is pretty compelling. And we can only hope that we approach it with what we're going to see in the clinic. And we do think that, over the next year, it's going to be very interesting to see how these dose escalation trials play out. I think that vision is so important. We all know it, we all treasure it. Okay? And I think that there's, hopefully, a new \u2013 a realization once again about how important it is and how a catastrophic event that causes permanent loss of vision can be so catastrophic and so damning. And I think that when you have such a safe and effective agent, with such an experience, one really has to take into consideration the risks, the potential catastrophic risks of trying new approaches, unknown safety risks with the potential catastrophic risk. I think it's a great question and it reflects back on this issue about penetration and so forth. It didn't take much market research to know how Dupixent was initially being used or how most drugs are used. Though it was approved, for example, in the moderate to severe population in atopic dermatitis, all physicians initially started with their toughest, their hardest, their most serious patients before then gradually going backwards in the treatment paradigm. And that is one of the reasons why we're only penetrating about 6% of the moderate to severe population. So, I think that gradually, with more confidence, they're going to treat people who are on the more moderate side of things.  That said, I think the point that \u2013 the efficacy profile, but also the mechanism of action, the fact that you are probably in the long term may be benefiting the patient in terms of slowing or preventing the ultimate atopic marks that occurs in so many patients demands that we figure out a way to take this product to earlier patients. Those will, however, require additional studies. We're trying to figure out the best way to do it. But I for one do think that, for example, many more patients with much milder asthma or other milder forms of Type 2 disease that we know in many patients is just going to get worse over time. We owe these patients \u2013 we have to figure out through a clinical program, how to do the right studies, how to convince the FDA and how to move this treatment back towards these earlier patients."

With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Dr. Leonard Schleifer.\nDr. Leonard Schleifer: Thank you, Justin, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. In the third quarter, Regeneron delivered another strong financial performance of double-digit top and bottom line growth while achieving numerous milestones in our research and development pipeline and making remarkable progress against COVID-19 with our novel antibody cocktail. Importantly, our growth and financial strength is being fueled by an increasingly diversified set of revenue and earnings streams while we invest in R&D for the long term. Furthermore, our results show the importance of products that meaningfully address serious medical needs and have the power to transform lives even during a pandemic. EYLEA is a great example. EYLEA Global net sales were $2.1 billion in the quarter and grew 9% compared to the same period last year. In the U.S., sales rebounded from second quarter COVID lows to $1.3 billion and grew 11% versus prior year. The efficacy, safety and convenience that EYLEA offers in protecting eyesight had proven to be highly valued by treating physicians and their patients as the product again outperformed the anti-VEGF market for retinal diseases. Next, we continue to build momentum with Dupixent as we in Sanofi recorded our first ever quarter of more than $1 billion in sales. This milestone speaks to the power of Dupixent across a broad array of type 2 inflammatory diseases and to our team's ability to execute despite COVID-19. Adding to this momentum, we've recently announced results from another successful Phase III trial, this time in pediatric asthma. We are eager to submit these data for regulatory review and expect that Dupixent will remain a robust and durable growth driver for years to come. In oncology, we are solidifying our leadership position in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Additionally, the FDA has granted priority review for our regulatory filings in lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma as we prepare for potential launches in these indications early next year. Regeneron is also making critical advancements in the treatment of infectious diseases. Last month, the FDA approved Inmazeb, the first-ever treatment for Ebolba virus infection. Building upon our work in Ebola, our team and rapid response technologies have developed our novel REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail in the fight against COVID-19. Last week, we announced another major data set from our outpatient study that showed our antibody cocktail significantly reduced viral loads as well as medically attended visits, such as emergency room visits and hospitalizations. We have submitted these data to regulators and eagerly await guidance on next steps. In closing, we could not be prouder of our teams and everything they have been able to achieve across the organization in the third quarter and in 2020 to date. Our momentum is accelerating with an impressive growth profile. In 2021, we look forward to building upon that momentum with several important launches for Libtayo, Dupixent and other programs, further enhancing our diverse growth platform. We are excited by the progress we are making against COVID-19, and we are confident that our investments in R&D to broaden and advance our pipeline across all stages will position Regeneron well for sustained growth. Now I'll turn the call over to George.\nDr. George Yancopoulos: Thanks, Len. And as Len just pointed out, we are advancing programs across all stages of our diverse and growing portfolio. With the pandemic unfortunately still raging and even escalating, we know there's a lot of focus on COVID 19, and we will start with our REGN-COV2 program. From the beginning, there was a lot of attention to our efforts against the coronavirus because of our success using a similar approach with Ebola. As you just heard from Len, we received FDA approval for our Ebola cocktail that our team delivered, validating our approach for not only this, but other deadly infectious diseases and particularly COVID-19. We're investigating REGN-COV2, our antibody cocktail for COVID-19 in infected patients as well as for prevention in several ongoing clinical trials. Earlier this year, we released a descriptive analysis of the first 275 patients in the REGN-COV2 seamless Phase II/III trial in ambulatory patients. Importantly, we obtained insights into the natural history of COVID-19 from these early data. Large numbers of patients normally generate their own antibodies against the virus early on, and this robust endogenous immune response is associated with rapid clearance of the virus and decreased need for medical attention. That's why most patients do so well. However, some patients are slow to mount an immune response and are at higher risk for attended medical visits. In line with this observation, our initial analysis show that providing our exogenous antibody cocktail did not provide much benefit to the fast responders, but it benefit those who did not mount their own immune responses efficiently, allowing REGN-COV2 to clear virus more rapidly and decrease the need for future medical attention in these otherwise slow responders. Last week, we provided important updates from this ongoing study in ambulatory COVID-19 patients. In a formal statistical way, we presented prospective validation of our earlier observation in a confirmatory analysis involving more than 500 additional patients. Data showed significant viral load reductions in patients treated with REGN-COV2 compared to placebo. And consistent with earlier data, these results were driven by the patients who had not mounted their own effective immune response at the time of treatment or had high viral loads at baseline. Importantly, results in the combined analysis of the first 799 patients enrolled in the study demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in medically attended visits, including hospitalizations and emergency room visits. This effect was most prominent with patients with high risk factors, high viral loads and those who had not yet mounted their own immune response. We shared these data with the FDA as an update to our EUA submission and await regulatory feedback. We are investigating the potential benefit of this REGN-COV2 cocktail in different stages of disease in our other ongoing studies, our household contact study, which is testing the cocktail as a prophylactic treatment, and it has enrolled approximately 1,000 patients to date. In hospitalized patients, we have 2 ongoing studies, our study as well as the U.K. RECOVERY Protocol. All Regeneron-sponsored COVID-19 treatment trials are being supervised by the same independent data monitoring committee, which recently recommended that we pause enrollment in 2 cohorts representing the most severe hospitalized patients, while recommending that all our other studies continue as initially designed, including the 2 less severe patient cohorts in our hospitalized patient study. Since the lower of the 2 REGN-COV2 doses demonstrated the activity comparable to the higher dose, suggesting that both doses maximize the benefit of this approach, we intend to investigate even lower doses going forward. If effective, this could allow us to extend the benefit of our cocktail to even more patients. As we await next steps on the regulatory front, we continue to ramp up production for REGN-COV2. Under our U.S. government agreement, we now expect to have 2.4-gram treatment doses ready for approximately 80,000 patients by the end of this month, 200,000 total doses ready by the first week of January and approximately 300,000 total doses ready by the end of January. We continue to increase our in-house production capacity for further doses of REGN-COV2 and are thrilled to be partnering with Roche to substantially expand global capacity of REGN-COV2 as their production comes online early next year. Moving on to Dupixent. We recently announced positive Phase III data in asthma for children ages 6 to 11. In this study, Dupixent reduced severe asthma attacks by up to 65% versus placebo over one year, and Dupixent also rapidly and sustainably improve lung function in these children. We are planning to file these data with regulators early next year. Additionally, in Europe, we received a positive CHMP committee recommendation for Dupixent in atopic dermatitis in children ages 6 to 11. The Dupixent clinical program continues to progress and expand across a wide range of type 2 inflammatory conditions. In September, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for Dupixent in eosinophilic esophagitis based on early Phase III results, which were recently presented at medical meetings. Before the end of the year, we expect to report Phase II data of Dupixent in combination with oral immunotherapy for peanut allergy. Additionally, Phase III studies are ongoing in several additional dermatology and pulmonary indications with readouts expected in 2022 and 2023, and we expect to begin additional Phase III pivotal trials by the end of the year. Putting this all together, Dupixent will soon be pivotal trials for 8 type 2 diseases that are not currently in the label and could address disease in nearly 1 million additional patients in the United States alone. Dupixent is also an important part of our 2-pronged approach against chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, along with etokimab, our anti interleukin-33 antibody. Based on achieving a prespecified efficacy milestone in an interim analysis of our first Phase III study in type 2 COPD, we initiated a second Dupixent Phase III study. Data readouts are expected in 2023. We believe that our anti IL-33 antibody could help an additional group of COPD patients beyond those with type 2 disease. Based on a proof-of-concept data that has been submitted for publication, we believe that blocking IL-33 could be especially useful in the former smoker COPD patient subset. The pivotal etokimab program, consisting of 2 parallel Phase III studies, will initiate by year-end. We hope that Dupixent and etokimab can provide real benefit for the many desperate patients suffering from COPD. Moving on to oncology and first Libtayo. At the European Society for Clinical Oncology, the ESMO meeting in September, we shared results of our first pivotal -- of our pivotal first line non-small cell lung cancer study as well as our locally advanced basal cell carcinoma or BCC study. These data are now filed as supplemental label applications with the regulators with the FDA recently awarding priority review for approval of Libtayo as a monotherapy in a proposed lung cancer indication with an action date of February 28, 2021. We also announced that we completed enrollment in the Libtayo chemotherapy combination trial in first line lung cancer with first results from this study available as early as next year. Also, the BCC results presented at ESMO showed that Libtayo has the potential to be the first approved treatment with a clinical benefit in the advanced BCC setting following failure of a hedgehog inhibitor. The FDA granted a priority review for our BCC filing with an action date of March 3, 2021. We continue to make significant progress with Libtayo as a foundation to our oncology strategy. Moving on to our oncology bispecific efforts. We are in a pivotal program in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas for our CD20xCD3 bispecific [indiscernible] also known as REGN1979. We are working towards initiating a pivotal program for REGN5458, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. And in solid tumors, dose escalation for REGN4018, our MUC16xCD3 bispecific continues in the first-in-human study in ovarian cancer in which we are observing preliminary evidence of activity. We are excited about the encouraging data we are observing in the studies of our CD3 class of bispecifics. However, we believe that our key potential advantage over other approaches is our ability to mix and match these CD3 bispecifics with not only our anti-PD-1, but also with our next class of bispecifics, the novel CD28 or costimulatory bispecifics. Our CD3 bispecifics currently in the clinic are designed to be paired with matching costim bispecifics for targets on a variety of different cancers with the intent to synergistically unleash the power of immuno-oncology more broadly than currently approved treatments. Our first costim bispecific, PSMAxCD28, in combination with Libtayo for prostate cancer is progressing through dose escalation cohorts, and thus far, the therapy is well tolerated. We will soon start trials with 2 novel costims, MUC16xCD28 in combination with either our MUC16xCD3 bispecific or with Libtayo for ovarian cancer. And our EGFRxCD28 in combination with Libtayo for solid tumors, including in lung, head and neck and colorectal cancers. The first member of a third class of tumor-targeting bispecifics, our MET X MET bispecific, has recently completed dose escalation and is currently in the dose expansion phase of the first-in-human trial. Remember, this bispecific targets 2 distinct epitopes on the MET oncogene, causing rapid internalization of this receptor and ablation of its signaling. MET mutations are present in 3% to 4% in MET gene amplifications and about another 3% of non-small cell lung cancers. Across our pipeline, we are pleased with the progress we are making across all stages of our rich oncology portfolio to compete, enhance and extend the power of immuno-oncology to more patients suffering from a wide variety of cancers. Beyond oncology, our pipeline continues to expand. In our C5 program, we will shortly begin dosing healthy volunteers in combination with Alnylam's C5 RNAi inhibitor, cemdisiran. The goal of the combination approach is to achieve convenient self-administration with a subcutaneous dosage form in addition to the more complete and durable blockade of the complement activation in patients suffering from paroxysmal nocturnal hematuria and other complement-mediated diseases. This will be the first example of a combination of an antibody with an RNAi against the same target. And we believe that this could be the first in a series innovative antibody RNA combination that could change the treatment paradigm in multiple disease settings. We are also excited about additional collaborative programs with Alnylam, including utilization of their siRNA approach against targets that we have identified through our Regeneron Genetic Center. As Alnylam has just announced, we have initiated dosing in sRNA against one such target, HSD17B13, for the treatment of NASH. Additionally, I want to acknowledge an important milestone for another innovative collaboration we have with Intellia. In the very near term, the first patient should be dosed with the groundbreaking systemically delivered CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing therapy, a potential one-and-done treatment for transthyretin amyloidosis or ATTR. As the first systemically administered gene editing intervention, we hope that this will provide proof-of-concept for future systemic gene editing efforts. Alnylam and Intellia collaborations represent an important new strategy for Regeneron as we attempt to broaden our efforts in the future of genetic therapies where we combine our capabilities and expertise to help empower those of our partners and to help change the practice of medicine and make new forms of gene therapy a reality. By the end of this year, we and our collaborators will have introduced 8 new investigational therapies into the clinic, an accomplishment we are proud of in a challenging year. To conclude, we are looking forward to several catalysts over the next several months. We expect imminent updates and additional data readouts on our REGN-COV2 therapy, first regulatory approval for evinacumab by February of next year, approval for first line lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma indications for Libtayo, filing for Dupixent in pediatric asthma and many more to come. It is a very exciting time at Regeneron. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Marion.\nMarion McCourt: Thank you, George. Our third quarter commercial results reflect a solid execution across our core brands, EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo. We remain confident that the competitive strengths of our growing and diversified commercial portfolio will carry us through and beyond the COVID-19 environment. I'm going to begin with EYLEA, which grew 9% year-over-year to approximately $2.1 billion in global net sales. In the U.S., EYLEA grew 11% year-over-year with net sales of more than $1.3 billion as the anti-VEGF demand recovered. In the U.S., EYLEA outperformed the category with shared gains from both branded and unbranded competition. In fact, EYLEA's share of the branded U.S. category grew to more than 70% for the quarter based on volume, and EYLEA remains the #1 prescribed anti-VEGF therapy in wet AMD and diabetic eye disease. Patient volume increased as those who delayed treatment earlier this year have returned to retina offices. EYLEA's market-leading clinical profile offering dosing flexibility, real-world experience and established safety led to a quicker recovery and stronger growth across all indications than the competition. EYLEA's flexible 12-week dosing regimen in wet AMD and the newly launched prefilled syringe also support EYLEA's market-leading value proposition. We are monitoring the recent spike in coronavirus cases across the country. In some hotspots, retina offices are beginning to see some modest reductions in patient volume, which may impact future EYLEA demand. That said, retina offices have become highly effective in managing their patients in this environment compared to the early days of the pandemic. In summary, EYLEA had an impressive quarter. Turning next to Libtayo. Third quarter global net sales grew to $96 million. In the U.S., net sales were $72 million with consistent and steady volume growth aided by the gradual reopening of infusion centers and an increase in breadth of prescribing. Libtayo continues to drive overall market growth in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and remains the most prescribed systemic treatment for CSCC. EYLEA remains the anti-PD-1 of choice with nearly 90% market share of the class. The overall profile of high response rate with many complete and durable responses positions Libtayo for continued growth. To fuel additional growth, we anticipate 2 new potential indication launches in non-small cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma in the first quarter of 2021. For basal cell carcinoma, we aim to build upon our success in CSCC and establish Libtayo as the standard of care for non-melanoma skin cancers. We expect Libtayo to be first-in-class and will work to establish it as the standard of care in second line BCC. Non-small cell lung cancer is the largest opportunity within the PD-1 space with more than 200,000 new diagnosis of lung cancer in the U.S. each year. We plan to leverage our oncology presence as the majority of treatment centers and oncologists are familiar with Libtayo in CSCC. We believe that patients, providers and payers prefer choice in determining the most appropriate treatment. Libtayo demonstrated an overall survival benefit in a real world, higher-risk population of patients, including patients with stable brain metastases, infections and progressive disease. These data, along with an additional product attributes, support Libtayo as a potential new option for anti-PD-1 monotherapy in the treatment paradigm. Finally, moving to Dupixent. Global net sales in the second quarter were $1.1 billion, representing 69% growth compared to the prior year. In the U.S., broad-based growth across all indications contributed net sales of $851 million. Among all specialties, patient visits improved throughout the quarter as the health care field has adapted to treating patients in the COVID environment. Current weekly new patient starts have recovered and are nearing pre-pandemic levels. The 300-milligram pre-filled pen was launched this quarter, providing additional patient convenience and choice. Atopic dermatitis remains Dupixent's largest indication and is a significant growth driver based on its rapid onset, proven efficacy and well-established safety profile. We continue to expand prescribing across both moderate and severe disease. Despite the impressive growth trajectory since launch, a low percentage of biologic eligible patients have been treated, leaving substantial opportunity for more patients to benefit. Our ongoing launches for both adolescents and pediatric patients are progressing very well. Since the May launch of the pediatric indication, we are seeing encouraging trends, comparable to the adolescent launch where initiations grew rapidly and HCPs were quick to prescribe. Significant runway is evident with approximately 400,000 adolescents and 90,000 children in this country that could benefit from Dupixent therapy. Moving to asthma, Dupixent continues to perform well in the competitive asthma space based on its clinical efficacy and safety profile. Our national DTC campaign is well underway, and we are seeing an uptick in new initiations. We look forward to submitting our pediatric clinical data to regulators, which could lead to further label expansion and benefit as many as 75,000 eligible children. Additionally, we see strong uptick in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Since approval last year, patients have been initiated on Dupixent regardless of prior surgery, while the availability of elective surgeries has improved as healthcare facilities have reopened. Demand for Dupixent remained strong among ENTs and allergists. Dupixent is making an important contribution to our business, and we're excited about the significant opportunity for future growth from our in-line business and from new potential indications, age groups and geographies. In closing, our commercial teams delivered strong performance across our diversified portfolio. We have a set of meaningfully differentiated products that are growing despite COVID-19. Additionally, we will enter a new phase of launches in 2021, including evinacumab for HOFH, pediatric asthma for Dupixent and lung and BCC for Libtayo. These launches will add to our momentum and the significant growth of our business. These are very exciting times at Regeneron. I'll turn the call to Bob.\nBob Landry: Thank you, Marion. For the third quarter of 2020, Regeneron delivered strong based growth on both the top and bottom lines, resulting from continued execution across all aspects of our business. Improving Dupixent profitability and contributions from additional revenue sources highlight the continued diversification of our business. For the third quarter, total revenues grew 32% year-over-year to $2.29 billion, driven by strong U.S. EYLEA growth and higher Sanofi collaboration revenues as a result of increased Dupixent sales and achievement of a $50 million sales milestone. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share grew 25% year-over-year to $8.36 on non-GAAP net income of $961 million. Since Marion discussed our U.S. EYLEA results, I will start with our Bayer and Sanofi collaborations. Starting with the Bayer collaboration. Ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales reported to us by Bayer were $780 million, representing a growth of 7% on a reported basis, compared to the prior year and a 22% improvement from second quarter 2020 lows. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $300 million, of which we recorded $288 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $353 million in the third quarter. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of non-IO antibodies was $213 million. This compares favorably to profits of $94 million in the prior year, which was primarily driven by higher Dupixent profits. We also recognized a $50 million milestone payment from Sanofi as a result of Dupixent, Praluent and Kevzara ex U.S. sales achieving $1 billion in the trailing 12-month period. Next, we announced in July a $450 million supply agreement with the U.S. government for batches of REGN-COV2. We record sales as batches are supplied to the government. In the third quarter of 2020, under this agreement, we recorded an initial $40 million of sales for REGN-COV2. We expect that in the fourth quarter of 2020, we will record sales approximating half of the value of this agreement. Sales for the remaining batches are expected to be recorded in the first quarter of 2021. In other revenue, we recorded $159 million versus $37 million in the prior year. The primary driver of this increase is the recognition of $70 million from the U.S. government associated with reimbursements of our Ebola and REGN-COV2 development recognition of $28 million in connection with the Regeneron Genetic Center sequencing a certain number of exomes as well as a reimbursement for ex U.S. supply of Praluent to Sanofi. Looking ahead to fourth quarter in 2021, we expect the other revenue line to trend lower in the absence of an RGC milestone and reduced reimbursements from the U.S. government on Ebola. Moving to our expense base and starting with R&D. Non-GAAP R&D increased 35% year-over-year to $629 million, driven by significant clinical development costs for our REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail, higher headcount to support our expanding pipeline, increased clinical manufacturing activities and continued advancement of our partner programs with Alnylam, Intellia and other early-stage partners. Next, non-GAAP SG&A expense increased 10% year-over-year to $291 million. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by increased headcount as well as commercial costs for EYLEA and Praluent. Cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing was $143 million, compared to $110 million in the third quarter of 2019, primarily due to increased sales of Dupixent. Non-GAAP cost of goods increased 22% from the prior year related to higher sales of Libtayo and the inclusion of sales from Praluent and REGN-COV2. Turning now to taxes. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 16.3% in the third quarter of 2020, compared to 13.6% in the third quarter of 2019, primarily due to discrete items to the quarters. Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. Regeneron continues to maintain a strong balance sheet, ending the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $5.9 billion. Our third quarter free cash flow was negatively impacted by the extension of EYLEA payment terms to support physician offices during COVID. We expect this will reverse in 2021 as payment terms return to normal. Additionally, in the quarter, we issued $2 billion of long-term debt, leveraging historically low interest rates while decreasing our cost of capital. With the issuance of this debt, we expect to incur approximately $45 million of incremental interest expense on an annual basis. Finally, we repurchased $100 million of stock in the third quarter as part of our $1 billion Board-authorized share buyback program. Now I'd like to spend a few moments to provide updates to our full year 2020 guidance. We updated our guidance on several expense line items where, in many cases, we either lowered or narrowed guidance range. Please refer to our press release for our entire updated 2020 guidance. Specific to R&D. We are revising upward our forecasted 2020 non-GAAP R&D expense to be in the range of $2.42 billion to $2.47 billion. While we increased R&D guidance on our second call to reflect REGN-COV2 expenses, we have since substantially expanded the scope and enrollment targets across the REGN-COV2 clinical program, which will result in increased expenses in the fourth quarter and into first half 2021. Also, while we are not providing 2021 guidance today, we do expect that 2021 full year R&D expenses will increase to fund in advancing and expanding pipeline as well as early stage partnership assets. In conclusion, Regeneron's business remains healthy, and we continued to deliver strong year-over-year growth as we diversify our revenue and earnings and advance our robust pipeline. We remain well positioned for future growth with healthy core brands and multiple near-term launches while investing in our R&D engine to drive longer-term growth. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Justin.\nJustin Holko: Thank you, Bob. Deborah, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. We have more than 20 callers in the queue. So to ensure that we are able to address as many callers as possible, we will answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. Please go ahead, Deborah.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go with our first question. We've got Carter Gould with Barclays.\nCarter Gould: I guess for George and Len, clearly, a lot of enthusiasm around the potential for the costims as we look to some of those readouts. I guess when we look to 2021, are we going to have a clear signal if these are living up to their promise in 2021? I know moving through some of these dose escalations takes time, but do you guys have confidence we'll be in a position to have a clear read on if they're living up to their hype next year?\nDr. George Yancopoulos: Well, it all depends on, as you said, these dose escalation studies, how they progress and proceed, we certainly hope that we will be getting signals of efficacy sooner rather than later, but it all depends on the clinical development and how that all goes. But we remain incredibly enthusiastic and excited about this class, and we're investing enormously. As I said, we have pairs of CD3 and CD28 bispecifics for numerous different cancers, not only the ones that are already in the clinic, but ones that will be entering into the pipeline over the next year or 2 or 3. So we're very excited about this class and the potential of combining them with the 2 sets of bispecifics as well as with the PD-1.\nJustin Holko:\nOperator: And your next question comes from Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler.\nChris Raymond: Just on REGN-COV2. Just wondering if you could walk through the biology behind why there would be a safety signal in these vented or high-flow oxygenated patients. I mean, I guess, especially given how clean it looked in mild-to-moderate cases, is there some threshold of viral load? Or is it underlying overactivation of the immune system that's driving this problem? And can you maybe describe the ADEs, please?\nDr. George Yancopoulos: So first of all, we should point out that we remain blinded to what's going on in those 2 cohorts that were paused. They weren't halted, they were paused so that the IDMC could evaluate the ongoing patients and then decide what to do going forward. We do not know whether there really is any safety signal. And as you said, I think theoretically, there is not really a great deal of rationale why there might be a safety signal there. You could come up with all sorts of complicated scenarios to explain it. But until we're unblinded to the data, until we really get to look at it, at this point, it could simply be that there's lack of efficacy or maybe even early trends which will reverse. So as you said, theoretically, it does not make a great deal of sense. I think the whole concept of what they call ADE or antibody-dependent enhancement, is something that does not look like it's really playing a role in this disease. So we remain hopeful that there is not going to be a safety signal and eventually, at least in some subset of these patients, even the hospitalized patients that we may provide a benefit.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Evan Seigerman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nEvan Seigerman: I'll limit it to one. So in the 10-Q, you listed the EUA for the AB cocktail during this quarter. Is this official guidance from the FDA? And any idea as to what patient population that this EUA would be granted for?\nDr. Leonard Schleifer: So it's Len. We have said that we are focusing on the patient population where the data comes from, which is outpatients who have the best baseline characteristics, which would make us think that they would benefit the most, whether that's risk factors or high viral titer or eventually perhaps low antibodies. Those are the sorts of patients we are focused on as an outpatient. There is no PDUFA time line for the EUA. We expect action in the relative near future, but there's no guarantee that will come. The FDA is doing a very careful analysis. We can tell from the kinds of questions we're getting. And we hope that it will be -- reach a successful conclusion. But we don't know the time line because there are no specific time lines. We do know they're working just about as hard as we can imagine and have seen the FDA work. So we're hopeful soon, we'll get an answer.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Yatin Suneja with Guggenheim Partners.\nYatin Suneja: Question is on EYLEA. Obviously, a very solid quarter. Can you maybe just give us some sense on the relative contribution from AMD versus other indication? How the market share is evolving in DME? What level of penetration you have achieved? And then obviously, COVID is spiking in the Q4...\nDr. Leonard Schleifer: Well, you have to ask one question. So far you're up to 3. Marion can handle the first one.\nMarion McCourt: I'll do -- I will do my best. And first, let me comment that in the times of pandemic, there probably was more of an impact on patients with diabetic eye disease not either receiving a diagnosis or coming in for treatment, but were starting to see recovery in that. I'm pleased to report that on the split of use of EYLEA by indication, we are approaching 60% for wet AMD, which means over 40% of our business is coming from other indications inclusive of the diabetic eye disease. So on balance, we continue to see diabetic eye disease as our largest future opportunity going forward, but we are the market-leading anti-VEGF therapy across all indications.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Yaron Werber with Cowen.\nYaron Werber: Just a quick follow-up on the REGN-COV2. The ongoing studies, George, are still across all patients, not just seronegatives. You clearly saw activity in seronegatives. Lilly sort of, obviously, both with their single and combo, really didn't see the same data. So any explanation to that? And why are you still sort of doing studies across all patients?\nDr. George Yancopoulos: Yes. I'm not sure what you mean by Lilly didn't see the same thing. They didn't actually look for where their effect was. And right now, the way the program works is, we are not having any evidence of any untoward effect and maybe just a very small benefit in the seropositive patients who have their own antibodies. I think that if one could actually do point-of-care testing, which is unfortunately, at this moment, not immediately available in most cases. Once the drug might be available, let's say, under an EUA, you might want to limit it to patients based on those characteristics. However, because the benefit/risk does not have any evidence of negative untoward effects in those individuals, one could just treat the entire population, even though the benefit is mostly driven by those who, as we described, are seronegative, have higher viral loads and/or have high risk factors.\nDr. Leonard Schleifer: Yes. Just -- so just to amplifying on what George said, Yaron, and he said it, I just think it's worth repeating that we did see an effect in the overall population. It's just, as he said, that effect was driven by the people who needed the antibody and that they hadn't mounted their own immune response. That observation, which is something that the team predicted, which is that people who mounted their own immune response wouldn't benefit so much from giving them more of an antibody makes perfect sense. And those that hadn't mounted their own immune response would benefit much more also makes perfect sense, and that is exactly what they saw. And you even see it in the placebo-treated patients that if you don't have antibodies, you start with a very high viral load. If you do have antibodies, you're already 3 logs lower. So all of the biology that George and the team predicted and described was borne out in a very exciting way. So I think it's just a matter of where you see the effect being driven by, not whether or not you can treat an entire population.\nDr. George Yancopoulos: And I'm sure, by the way, if Lilly did the same detailed analysis, they would see that their benefit would also be driven by the same sets of patients. They just didn't do those analyses.\nJustin Holko: Next question please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink.\nGeoffrey Porges: Just a follow-up question on COV2. I'm just not sure how this is going to work. We can't even execute testing in this country reliably. So how are you going to screen the individuals who aren't mounting an immune response on an outpatient basis and then initiate treatment on an outpatient basis? It's just confusing. So help us understand that. And would it be sensible to treat everybody going to hospital for elective procedures of any kind or something else along those lines? It's just a little confusing how you're going to use this medicine.\nDr. George Yancopoulos: Right. I think what -- as we just said, and as Len amplified on, the effect is seen in the overall population. It's just driven by those individuals who have the characteristics that we described. The notion is that just as in the clinical studies, it could be given to all of the eligible outpatients because there is no risk to be -- to the individuals who won't benefit the most. So I think that -- the strategy, of course, I think, would be taken would be to limit the drug right now without doing any of the advanced screening and so forth. But to the people who are at the highest risk of progressing to needing medical attention, give it to those people, irregardless if you don't have the point-of-care testing, irregardless of their baseline viral load or their antibody status. In the future, if such testing became available, then you might not want to waste the drug on the people who might not benefit. But initially, I think it would be given to the people who are at the highest risk of developing complications with the goal of preventing those. As we showed in the study, you will reduce dramatically the need for further medical attention. If you give it to individuals and the higher risk the population that you give it to, the NMT goes down. But the only reason really to limit it at this point is because there's going to be limitations for the amount of doses available to treat.\nDr. Leonard Schleifer: Yes. Let me just also add to that, Geoff, 2 things. First of all, as -- I think George pointed out in his presentation when we first disclosed this data. There's a very high correlation between the baseline viral load and whether or not you have antibodies. It's -- on average, you're 3 logs higher if you don't have antibodies and viral load. So you could use viral load. And everybody who's going to get treated has a viral load test. They have a PCR test. It's reported as -- back as positive, but there's actual cycle time. So I think the testing of reporting -- a testing doesn't necessarily have to change, perhaps the reporting has to change in terms of what your cycle time is. A very low cycle time, meaning very high viral load predicts low or no antibodies. So that could be used, as George said, to screen patients. The second thing is our partner, Roche, is really one -- probably is the leading company for testing. They have a platform for antibodies that can test hundreds of millions of people per quarter, and it's deployed in, I think, like 70,000 different points of care. So we're working with them to see whether that test can be validated with our dataset or not. So I think there are lots of ways to get at this. You could use -- you can treat everybody, obviously, limiting to the people who have risk factors or you could start to narrow it down to people who have high viral load, low cycle time or eventually with our partners' capabilities, people who at point-of-care have no antibodies. So I think there's a lot of flexibility. It's just that we don't have all this buttoned down in this emergency situation. And it will probably evolve fairly quickly if we get an EUA.\nDr. George Yancopoulos: But just to simplify, initially, we believe it will be used in the overall population based on risk factors with that regard to serology or viral load. And as Len said, eventually, as these approaches evolve and change, it may allow targeting of the drug to those who might even benefit the most.\nJustin Holko : Next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan.\nCory Kasimov: I have plenty more on COV2, but given the number we've already had there, I'll change the subject. I want to ask Bob about the R&D spend and really thinking about trends going forward. So in terms of the investment you're making on the antibody cocktail, how long do you expect this to kind of persist for? And just kind of overall, wondering if you can give us any sneak peak into 2021?\nBob Landry: Sure. Thanks, Cory. Let me see if I can give you a little bit of color. So as I said in our prepared remarks, we're not going to provide 2021 R&D guidance today. We do expect that next year's R&D expenses will be higher to support pretty much everything that George said with regards to the expanding pipeline, early stage assets, the partnerships with Alnylam and Intellia, which are really starting to blossom and certainly our ongoing COVID-19 efforts. If you look at 2020, where we sit right now, we anticipate spend of approximately $400 million on our efforts against COVID-19 within the year of 2020. So if you back that spend out from our full year 2020 non-GAAP R&D guidance midpoint, our underlying growth rate in R&D spend, excluding the COVID program efforts, is trending about 15% higher than our 2019 as our -- as we move forward. So Cory, I would use that kind of as a stake in the ground in terms of where we're going to go. I mean, certainly, our COVID-19 spending is going to continue on. People can see on clinicaltrials.gov the extent of the programs that we have, trials that we have going, that will play a factor into 2021.\nJustin Holko: Next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist.\nRobyn Karnauskas: Another one on COV2. So just because it seems like this pandemic is just getting much worse in the United States and globally, can you talk about your efforts to expand manufacturing next year beyond the 300,000? And then I was just curious, given how profile it was that the President and others got a different combination therapies, can you biologically talk about your thoughts on should this drug be combined with Dex or other drugs immediately upfront biologically? And when would you just start like maybe a combo trial that would sort of evaluate that, sort of really make sure that this is a cure rather than just reducing the viral load and reducing time to recover in some patients?\nDr. Leonard Schleifer: Right. George can -- sorry, I was going to say, George can deal with that. I was going to just deal quickly with the manufacturing question, which is we are scaling up and we expect to be able to make substantially more next year than we were able to make this year. Obviously, we'll have a full year of manufacturing, which we didn't -- we did not have a full year of manufacturing to deliver the 300,000 doses. And we expect to have more facilities that are now operational and dedicated, plus we expect to multiply that with our partner, Roche, who really has been a terrific partner so far. And they, as you know -- because we see their might because we compete with them in many fronts, they're really sophisticated in the biologics space with their Genentech history and the manufacturing capacity. And they're working very hard to bring online very enhanced and large manufacturing capacity. I'll let George deal with the question about combination therapy.\nDr. George Yancopoulos: Yes. I think the most important thing to note is because the mechanism of action, our treatment is just an antibody that is essentially analogous to the endogenous antibodies that many of the individuals are making. As I described, we're just providing it to those people who are either slow or failing to make their own antibodies. There's no expectation and no mechanistic rationale for any safety interactions of concern. There should not be any reason why you couldn't mix this with essentially any drug that doesn't have untoward side effects because all we're doing is giving you more of the antibodies that your body normally makes. So that said, you could theoretically combine our treatment with any other treatment without any reason to believe that there would be negative interactions. I remind you that right now, where our data stands and where we are -- we have filed for the EUA is in the outpatient setting, where these other modalities are not being given at this point. So it's going to take future studies plus analyses in the hospitalized patients where you look at patients who had combination therapies to determine whether patients who have these combinations do better than patients who just receive one or the other therapy alone. But in the outpatient setting, right now with our data, it will be our antibody because those are not patients where remdesivir or dexamethasone is currently a standard of care.\nJustin Holko: Next question please. Next question.\nOperator: Alethia Young with Cantor.\nAlethia Young: I just want you guys to talk a little bit about the potential growth opportunity you see there. Obviously, you've had incredible launch so far, but you've gone deeper into commercial marketing and DTC. And I just kind of want to think about how do you drive deeper penetration into biologics, both -- biologic market, both in ADN and also -- sorry, asthma?\nMarion McCourt: Certainly, I'm happy to comment. And today, certainly, we reported, as did Sanofi, very strong results for Dupixent, both in the U.S. and ex U.S. markets. The really important thing to keep in mind is while we've made certainly inroads in helping atopic dermatitis patients and patients with respiratory conditions of asthma and nasal polyps, there is still are -- in all of those indications that are currently approved, not to mention the future indications, a lot of incremental unmet need. And then beyond that, to your point of strategies and promotional platform and activities to advance the market, Dupixent has been very responsive to promotion. We've been seeing certainly uptick in new initiations and also a remarkable consistency of patients staying on therapy because of the results that they're receiving either in their skin condition or their respiratory condition. So we'll continue to do that. We're looking at a lot of different mechanisms for advancing our promotional platform. We have highly effective field teams in the marketplace. We also benefit from very strong reimbursement across indications and across age groups and certainly, we'll continue to advance on all the in-line indications we currently have, and we'll be very, very well prepared for our future indications as well.\nJustin Holko: Thanks Marion. Next question please.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Ronny Gal with Bernstein.\nRonny Gal: Congratulations on the very nice quarter. My question is actually on the EYLEA, Lucentis dynamics. You've shown a 10% revenue growth. They've shown a 5% revenue decline year-over-year. So obviously, capturing share. But I was wondering about the new patient volume. If you can just share with us, if you could, kind of like where are we in terms of patient starts versus a year ago? And how far do we have to go before we come back to line? And anything you can share about pricing terms as it seemed to be -- you just commented this in the press release, if you can give us a bit more there?\nMarion McCourt: Ronny, in terms of performance of EYLEA in the anti-VEGF category, as I mentioned, we are seeing a rebound in terms of patient treatment coming back into offices. We see an advance in EYLEA's performance versus a year ago. And then coupled with that, we are seeing an increment in share gain from both branded and unbranded competitors. I also mentioned, if I just put it into volume terms for you in the branded marketplace that EYLEA now approaches just over, in fact, 70% of the branded market in the quarter by volume. So we're seeing robust performance and we would attribute that to EYLEA's overall value proposition for retina specialists in choosing anti-VEGF therapy, the -- certainly, the clinical profile, efficacy profile, flexibility of dosing. Now the prefilled syringe is incredibly timely is a convenience, but also in the current environment of office throughput in efficiency, and then beyond that, the established safety.\nJustin Holko: Operator, we have time for 2 very quick questions if we could try to squeeze them in.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Biren Amin with Jefferies.\nBiren Amin: Can you just talk about the competitive landscape in retina with your thoughts on faricimab, given we've -- they're going to have Phase III data relatively soon?\nMarion McCourt: Sure. So I think we all learned a lot about -- I'm sorry, Len, you go first. I'll come back if you'd like.\nDr. Leonard Schleifer: No, no. Go ahead, Marion.\nMarion McCourt: No. I was just going to comment that I think that the -- for a product entering the marketplace today, it's not assumed anymore that a safety profile will be there until the product has actual market experience. So I just would mention at the start, we always monitor competition very, very carefully, both in market currently and future competition. But certainly, EYLEA sets a very high bar in terms of the clinical profile, the safety profile and the level of experience. But Len, over to you.\nDr. Leonard Schleifer: No, I think you covered it. Let's go to the next question and the last question.\nOperator: And your final question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Dan on for Terence. Just for the Phase II trial of your BCMA bispecific antibody. Just wondering if you could share any more details on the trial and if you're working to develop a subcu formulation?\nDr. George Yancopoulos: Yes. I think that right now, we'll -- you'll get updates on the BCMA program at ASH. We have announced that we're going to be entering into a pivotal program very soon. And I guess it's fair to say that it makes sense that we would be developing, yes, a subcutaneous formulation.\nJustin Holko: Thanks to everyone for joining today's call. We appreciate you dialing in, knowing that many other companies are reporting today. So thank you for your attention and for your questions. Bob Landry and the IR team will be available for additional questions and calls as needed today. Thank you, everyone. Be safe.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Marion McCourt",
            "content": "Thank you, George. Our third quarter commercial results reflect a solid execution across our core brands, EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo. We remain confident that the competitive strengths of our growing and diversified commercial portfolio will carry us through and beyond the COVID-19 environment. I'm going to begin with EYLEA, which grew 9% year-over-year to approximately $2.1 billion in global net sales. In the U.S., EYLEA grew 11% year-over-year with net sales of more than $1.3 billion as the anti-VEGF demand recovered. In the U.S., EYLEA outperformed the category with shared gains from both branded and unbranded competition. In fact, EYLEA's share of the branded U.S. category grew to more than 70% for the quarter based on volume, and EYLEA remains the #1 prescribed anti-VEGF therapy in wet AMD and diabetic eye disease. Patient volume increased as those who delayed treatment earlier this year have returned to retina offices. EYLEA's market-leading clinical profile offering dosing flexibility, real-world experience and established safety led to a quicker recovery and stronger growth across all indications than the competition. EYLEA's flexible 12-week dosing regimen in wet AMD and the newly launched prefilled syringe also support EYLEA's market-leading value proposition. We are monitoring the recent spike in coronavirus cases across the country. In some hotspots, retina offices are beginning to see some modest reductions in patient volume, which may impact future EYLEA demand. That said, retina offices have become highly effective in managing their patients in this environment compared to the early days of the pandemic. In summary, EYLEA had an impressive quarter. Turning next to Libtayo. Third quarter global net sales grew to $96 million. In the U.S., net sales were $72 million with consistent and steady volume growth aided by the gradual reopening of infusion centers and an increase in breadth of prescribing. Libtayo continues to drive overall market growth in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and remains the most prescribed systemic treatment for CSCC. EYLEA remains the anti-PD-1 of choice with nearly 90% market share of the class. The overall profile of high response rate with many complete and durable responses positions Libtayo for continued growth. To fuel additional growth, we anticipate 2 new potential indication launches in non-small cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma in the first quarter of 2021. For basal cell carcinoma, we aim to build upon our success in CSCC and establish Libtayo as the standard of care for non-melanoma skin cancers. We expect Libtayo to be first-in-class and will work to establish it as the standard of care in second line BCC. Non-small cell lung cancer is the largest opportunity within the PD-1 space with more than 200,000 new diagnosis of lung cancer in the U.S. each year. We plan to leverage our oncology presence as the majority of treatment centers and oncologists are familiar with Libtayo in CSCC. We believe that patients, providers and payers prefer choice in determining the most appropriate treatment. Libtayo demonstrated an overall survival benefit in a real world, higher-risk population of patients, including patients with stable brain metastases, infections and progressive disease. These data, along with an additional product attributes, support Libtayo as a potential new option for anti-PD-1 monotherapy in the treatment paradigm. Finally, moving to Dupixent. Global net sales in the second quarter were $1.1 billion, representing 69% growth compared to the prior year. In the U.S., broad-based growth across all indications contributed net sales of $851 million. Among all specialties, patient visits improved throughout the quarter as the health care field has adapted to treating patients in the COVID environment. Current weekly new patient starts have recovered and are nearing pre-pandemic levels. The 300-milligram pre-filled pen was launched this quarter, providing additional patient convenience and choice. Atopic dermatitis remains Dupixent's largest indication and is a significant growth driver based on its rapid onset, proven efficacy and well-established safety profile. We continue to expand prescribing across both moderate and severe disease. Despite the impressive growth trajectory since launch, a low percentage of biologic eligible patients have been treated, leaving substantial opportunity for more patients to benefit. Our ongoing launches for both adolescents and pediatric patients are progressing very well. Since the May launch of the pediatric indication, we are seeing encouraging trends, comparable to the adolescent launch where initiations grew rapidly and HCPs were quick to prescribe. Significant runway is evident with approximately 400,000 adolescents and 90,000 children in this country that could benefit from Dupixent therapy. Moving to asthma, Dupixent continues to perform well in the competitive asthma space based on its clinical efficacy and safety profile. Our national DTC campaign is well underway, and we are seeing an uptick in new initiations. We look forward to submitting our pediatric clinical data to regulators, which could lead to further label expansion and benefit as many as 75,000 eligible children. Additionally, we see strong uptick in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Since approval last year, patients have been initiated on Dupixent regardless of prior surgery, while the availability of elective surgeries has improved as healthcare facilities have reopened. Demand for Dupixent remained strong among ENTs and allergists. Dupixent is making an important contribution to our business, and we're excited about the significant opportunity for future growth from our in-line business and from new potential indications, age groups and geographies. In closing, our commercial teams delivered strong performance across our diversified portfolio. We have a set of meaningfully differentiated products that are growing despite COVID-19. Additionally, we will enter a new phase of launches in 2021, including evinacumab for HOFH, pediatric asthma for Dupixent and lung and BCC for Libtayo. These launches will add to our momentum and the significant growth of our business. These are very exciting times at Regeneron. I'll turn the call to Bob. I'll do -- I will do my best. And first, let me comment that in the times of pandemic, there probably was more of an impact on patients with diabetic eye disease not either receiving a diagnosis or coming in for treatment, but were starting to see recovery in that. I'm pleased to report that on the split of use of EYLEA by indication, we are approaching 60% for wet AMD, which means over 40% of our business is coming from other indications inclusive of the diabetic eye disease. So on balance, we continue to see diabetic eye disease as our largest future opportunity going forward, but we are the market-leading anti-VEGF therapy across all indications. Certainly, I'm happy to comment. And today, certainly, we reported, as did Sanofi, very strong results for Dupixent, both in the U.S. and ex U.S. markets. The really important thing to keep in mind is while we've made certainly inroads in helping atopic dermatitis patients and patients with respiratory conditions of asthma and nasal polyps, there is still are -- in all of those indications that are currently approved, not to mention the future indications, a lot of incremental unmet need. And then beyond that, to your point of strategies and promotional platform and activities to advance the market, Dupixent has been very responsive to promotion. We've been seeing certainly uptick in new initiations and also a remarkable consistency of patients staying on therapy because of the results that they're receiving either in their skin condition or their respiratory condition. So we'll continue to do that. We're looking at a lot of different mechanisms for advancing our promotional platform. We have highly effective field teams in the marketplace. We also benefit from very strong reimbursement across indications and across age groups and certainly, we'll continue to advance on all the in-line indications we currently have, and we'll be very, very well prepared for our future indications as well. Ronny, in terms of performance of EYLEA in the anti-VEGF category, as I mentioned, we are seeing a rebound in terms of patient treatment coming back into offices. We see an advance in EYLEA's performance versus a year ago. And then coupled with that, we are seeing an increment in share gain from both branded and unbranded competitors. I also mentioned, if I just put it into volume terms for you in the branded marketplace that EYLEA now approaches just over, in fact, 70% of the branded market in the quarter by volume. So we're seeing robust performance and we would attribute that to EYLEA's overall value proposition for retina specialists in choosing anti-VEGF therapy, the -- certainly, the clinical profile, efficacy profile, flexibility of dosing. Now the prefilled syringe is incredibly timely is a convenience, but also in the current environment of office throughput in efficiency, and then beyond that, the established safety. Sure. So I think we all learned a lot about -- I'm sorry, Len, you go first. I'll come back if you'd like. No. I was just going to comment that I think that the -- for a product entering the marketplace today, it's not assumed anymore that a safety profile will be there until the product has actual market experience. So I just would mention at the start, we always monitor competition very, very carefully, both in market currently and future competition. But certainly, EYLEA sets a very high bar in terms of the clinical profile, the safety profile and the level of experience. But Len, over to you."

            "name": "Dr. George Yancopoulos",
            "content": "Thanks, Len. And as Len just pointed out, we are advancing programs across all stages of our diverse and growing portfolio. With the pandemic unfortunately still raging and even escalating, we know there's a lot of focus on COVID 19, and we will start with our REGN-COV2 program. From the beginning, there was a lot of attention to our efforts against the coronavirus because of our success using a similar approach with Ebola. As you just heard from Len, we received FDA approval for our Ebola cocktail that our team delivered, validating our approach for not only this, but other deadly infectious diseases and particularly COVID-19. We're investigating REGN-COV2, our antibody cocktail for COVID-19 in infected patients as well as for prevention in several ongoing clinical trials. Earlier this year, we released a descriptive analysis of the first 275 patients in the REGN-COV2 seamless Phase II/III trial in ambulatory patients. Importantly, we obtained insights into the natural history of COVID-19 from these early data. Large numbers of patients normally generate their own antibodies against the virus early on, and this robust endogenous immune response is associated with rapid clearance of the virus and decreased need for medical attention. That's why most patients do so well. However, some patients are slow to mount an immune response and are at higher risk for attended medical visits. In line with this observation, our initial analysis show that providing our exogenous antibody cocktail did not provide much benefit to the fast responders, but it benefit those who did not mount their own immune responses efficiently, allowing REGN-COV2 to clear virus more rapidly and decrease the need for future medical attention in these otherwise slow responders. Last week, we provided important updates from this ongoing study in ambulatory COVID-19 patients. In a formal statistical way, we presented prospective validation of our earlier observation in a confirmatory analysis involving more than 500 additional patients. Data showed significant viral load reductions in patients treated with REGN-COV2 compared to placebo. And consistent with earlier data, these results were driven by the patients who had not mounted their own effective immune response at the time of treatment or had high viral loads at baseline. Importantly, results in the combined analysis of the first 799 patients enrolled in the study demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in medically attended visits, including hospitalizations and emergency room visits. This effect was most prominent with patients with high risk factors, high viral loads and those who had not yet mounted their own immune response. We shared these data with the FDA as an update to our EUA submission and await regulatory feedback. We are investigating the potential benefit of this REGN-COV2 cocktail in different stages of disease in our other ongoing studies, our household contact study, which is testing the cocktail as a prophylactic treatment, and it has enrolled approximately 1,000 patients to date. In hospitalized patients, we have 2 ongoing studies, our study as well as the U.K. RECOVERY Protocol. All Regeneron-sponsored COVID-19 treatment trials are being supervised by the same independent data monitoring committee, which recently recommended that we pause enrollment in 2 cohorts representing the most severe hospitalized patients, while recommending that all our other studies continue as initially designed, including the 2 less severe patient cohorts in our hospitalized patient study. Since the lower of the 2 REGN-COV2 doses demonstrated the activity comparable to the higher dose, suggesting that both doses maximize the benefit of this approach, we intend to investigate even lower doses going forward. If effective, this could allow us to extend the benefit of our cocktail to even more patients. As we await next steps on the regulatory front, we continue to ramp up production for REGN-COV2. Under our U.S. government agreement, we now expect to have 2.4-gram treatment doses ready for approximately 80,000 patients by the end of this month, 200,000 total doses ready by the first week of January and approximately 300,000 total doses ready by the end of January. We continue to increase our in-house production capacity for further doses of REGN-COV2 and are thrilled to be partnering with Roche to substantially expand global capacity of REGN-COV2 as their production comes online early next year. Moving on to Dupixent. We recently announced positive Phase III data in asthma for children ages 6 to 11. In this study, Dupixent reduced severe asthma attacks by up to 65% versus placebo over one year, and Dupixent also rapidly and sustainably improve lung function in these children. We are planning to file these data with regulators early next year. Additionally, in Europe, we received a positive CHMP committee recommendation for Dupixent in atopic dermatitis in children ages 6 to 11. The Dupixent clinical program continues to progress and expand across a wide range of type 2 inflammatory conditions. In September, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for Dupixent in eosinophilic esophagitis based on early Phase III results, which were recently presented at medical meetings. Before the end of the year, we expect to report Phase II data of Dupixent in combination with oral immunotherapy for peanut allergy. Additionally, Phase III studies are ongoing in several additional dermatology and pulmonary indications with readouts expected in 2022 and 2023, and we expect to begin additional Phase III pivotal trials by the end of the year. Putting this all together, Dupixent will soon be pivotal trials for 8 type 2 diseases that are not currently in the label and could address disease in nearly 1 million additional patients in the United States alone. Dupixent is also an important part of our 2-pronged approach against chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, along with etokimab, our anti interleukin-33 antibody. Based on achieving a prespecified efficacy milestone in an interim analysis of our first Phase III study in type 2 COPD, we initiated a second Dupixent Phase III study. Data readouts are expected in 2023. We believe that our anti IL-33 antibody could help an additional group of COPD patients beyond those with type 2 disease. Based on a proof-of-concept data that has been submitted for publication, we believe that blocking IL-33 could be especially useful in the former smoker COPD patient subset. The pivotal etokimab program, consisting of 2 parallel Phase III studies, will initiate by year-end. We hope that Dupixent and etokimab can provide real benefit for the many desperate patients suffering from COPD. Moving on to oncology and first Libtayo. At the European Society for Clinical Oncology, the ESMO meeting in September, we shared results of our first pivotal -- of our pivotal first line non-small cell lung cancer study as well as our locally advanced basal cell carcinoma or BCC study. These data are now filed as supplemental label applications with the regulators with the FDA recently awarding priority review for approval of Libtayo as a monotherapy in a proposed lung cancer indication with an action date of February 28, 2021. We also announced that we completed enrollment in the Libtayo chemotherapy combination trial in first line lung cancer with first results from this study available as early as next year. Also, the BCC results presented at ESMO showed that Libtayo has the potential to be the first approved treatment with a clinical benefit in the advanced BCC setting following failure of a hedgehog inhibitor. The FDA granted a priority review for our BCC filing with an action date of March 3, 2021. We continue to make significant progress with Libtayo as a foundation to our oncology strategy. Moving on to our oncology bispecific efforts. We are in a pivotal program in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas for our CD20xCD3 bispecific [indiscernible] also known as REGN1979. We are working towards initiating a pivotal program for REGN5458, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. And in solid tumors, dose escalation for REGN4018, our MUC16xCD3 bispecific continues in the first-in-human study in ovarian cancer in which we are observing preliminary evidence of activity. We are excited about the encouraging data we are observing in the studies of our CD3 class of bispecifics. However, we believe that our key potential advantage over other approaches is our ability to mix and match these CD3 bispecifics with not only our anti-PD-1, but also with our next class of bispecifics, the novel CD28 or costimulatory bispecifics. Our CD3 bispecifics currently in the clinic are designed to be paired with matching costim bispecifics for targets on a variety of different cancers with the intent to synergistically unleash the power of immuno-oncology more broadly than currently approved treatments. Our first costim bispecific, PSMAxCD28, in combination with Libtayo for prostate cancer is progressing through dose escalation cohorts, and thus far, the therapy is well tolerated. We will soon start trials with 2 novel costims, MUC16xCD28 in combination with either our MUC16xCD3 bispecific or with Libtayo for ovarian cancer. And our EGFRxCD28 in combination with Libtayo for solid tumors, including in lung, head and neck and colorectal cancers. The first member of a third class of tumor-targeting bispecifics, our MET X MET bispecific, has recently completed dose escalation and is currently in the dose expansion phase of the first-in-human trial. Remember, this bispecific targets 2 distinct epitopes on the MET oncogene, causing rapid internalization of this receptor and ablation of its signaling. MET mutations are present in 3% to 4% in MET gene amplifications and about another 3% of non-small cell lung cancers. Across our pipeline, we are pleased with the progress we are making across all stages of our rich oncology portfolio to compete, enhance and extend the power of immuno-oncology to more patients suffering from a wide variety of cancers. Beyond oncology, our pipeline continues to expand. In our C5 program, we will shortly begin dosing healthy volunteers in combination with Alnylam's C5 RNAi inhibitor, cemdisiran. The goal of the combination approach is to achieve convenient self-administration with a subcutaneous dosage form in addition to the more complete and durable blockade of the complement activation in patients suffering from paroxysmal nocturnal hematuria and other complement-mediated diseases. This will be the first example of a combination of an antibody with an RNAi against the same target. And we believe that this could be the first in a series innovative antibody RNA combination that could change the treatment paradigm in multiple disease settings. We are also excited about additional collaborative programs with Alnylam, including utilization of their siRNA approach against targets that we have identified through our Regeneron Genetic Center. As Alnylam has just announced, we have initiated dosing in sRNA against one such target, HSD17B13, for the treatment of NASH. Additionally, I want to acknowledge an important milestone for another innovative collaboration we have with Intellia. In the very near term, the first patient should be dosed with the groundbreaking systemically delivered CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing therapy, a potential one-and-done treatment for transthyretin amyloidosis or ATTR. As the first systemically administered gene editing intervention, we hope that this will provide proof-of-concept for future systemic gene editing efforts. Alnylam and Intellia collaborations represent an important new strategy for Regeneron as we attempt to broaden our efforts in the future of genetic therapies where we combine our capabilities and expertise to help empower those of our partners and to help change the practice of medicine and make new forms of gene therapy a reality. By the end of this year, we and our collaborators will have introduced 8 new investigational therapies into the clinic, an accomplishment we are proud of in a challenging year. To conclude, we are looking forward to several catalysts over the next several months. We expect imminent updates and additional data readouts on our REGN-COV2 therapy, first regulatory approval for evinacumab by February of next year, approval for first line lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma indications for Libtayo, filing for Dupixent in pediatric asthma and many more to come. It is a very exciting time at Regeneron. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Marion. Well, it all depends on, as you said, these dose escalation studies, how they progress and proceed, we certainly hope that we will be getting signals of efficacy sooner rather than later, but it all depends on the clinical development and how that all goes. But we remain incredibly enthusiastic and excited about this class, and we're investing enormously. As I said, we have pairs of CD3 and CD28 bispecifics for numerous different cancers, not only the ones that are already in the clinic, but ones that will be entering into the pipeline over the next year or 2 or 3. So we're very excited about this class and the potential of combining them with the 2 sets of bispecifics as well as with the PD-1. So first of all, we should point out that we remain blinded to what's going on in those 2 cohorts that were paused. They weren't halted, they were paused so that the IDMC could evaluate the ongoing patients and then decide what to do going forward. We do not know whether there really is any safety signal. And as you said, I think theoretically, there is not really a great deal of rationale why there might be a safety signal there. You could come up with all sorts of complicated scenarios to explain it. But until we're unblinded to the data, until we really get to look at it, at this point, it could simply be that there's lack of efficacy or maybe even early trends which will reverse. So as you said, theoretically, it does not make a great deal of sense. I think the whole concept of what they call ADE or antibody-dependent enhancement, is something that does not look like it's really playing a role in this disease. So we remain hopeful that there is not going to be a safety signal and eventually, at least in some subset of these patients, even the hospitalized patients that we may provide a benefit. Yes. I'm not sure what you mean by Lilly didn't see the same thing. They didn't actually look for where their effect was. And right now, the way the program works is, we are not having any evidence of any untoward effect and maybe just a very small benefit in the seropositive patients who have their own antibodies. I think that if one could actually do point-of-care testing, which is unfortunately, at this moment, not immediately available in most cases. Once the drug might be available, let's say, under an EUA, you might want to limit it to patients based on those characteristics. However, because the benefit/risk does not have any evidence of negative untoward effects in those individuals, one could just treat the entire population, even though the benefit is mostly driven by those who, as we described, are seronegative, have higher viral loads and/or have high risk factors. And I'm sure, by the way, if Lilly did the same detailed analysis, they would see that their benefit would also be driven by the same sets of patients. They just didn't do those analyses. Right. I think what -- as we just said, and as Len amplified on, the effect is seen in the overall population. It's just driven by those individuals who have the characteristics that we described. The notion is that just as in the clinical studies, it could be given to all of the eligible outpatients because there is no risk to be -- to the individuals who won't benefit the most. So I think that -- the strategy, of course, I think, would be taken would be to limit the drug right now without doing any of the advanced screening and so forth. But to the people who are at the highest risk of progressing to needing medical attention, give it to those people, irregardless if you don't have the point-of-care testing, irregardless of their baseline viral load or their antibody status. In the future, if such testing became available, then you might not want to waste the drug on the people who might not benefit. But initially, I think it would be given to the people who are at the highest risk of developing complications with the goal of preventing those. As we showed in the study, you will reduce dramatically the need for further medical attention. If you give it to individuals and the higher risk the population that you give it to, the NMT goes down. But the only reason really to limit it at this point is because there's going to be limitations for the amount of doses available to treat. But just to simplify, initially, we believe it will be used in the overall population based on risk factors with that regard to serology or viral load. And as Len said, eventually, as these approaches evolve and change, it may allow targeting of the drug to those who might even benefit the most. Yes. I think the most important thing to note is because the mechanism of action, our treatment is just an antibody that is essentially analogous to the endogenous antibodies that many of the individuals are making. As I described, we're just providing it to those people who are either slow or failing to make their own antibodies. There's no expectation and no mechanistic rationale for any safety interactions of concern. There should not be any reason why you couldn't mix this with essentially any drug that doesn't have untoward side effects because all we're doing is giving you more of the antibodies that your body normally makes. So that said, you could theoretically combine our treatment with any other treatment without any reason to believe that there would be negative interactions. I remind you that right now, where our data stands and where we are -- we have filed for the EUA is in the outpatient setting, where these other modalities are not being given at this point. So it's going to take future studies plus analyses in the hospitalized patients where you look at patients who had combination therapies to determine whether patients who have these combinations do better than patients who just receive one or the other therapy alone. But in the outpatient setting, right now with our data, it will be our antibody because those are not patients where remdesivir or dexamethasone is currently a standard of care. Yes. I think that right now, we'll -- you'll get updates on the BCMA program at ASH. We have announced that we're going to be entering into a pivotal program very soon. And I guess it's fair to say that it makes sense that we would be developing, yes, a subcutaneous formulation."

            "content": "Thank you, Justin, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. In the third quarter, Regeneron delivered another strong financial performance of double-digit top and bottom line growth while achieving numerous milestones in our research and development pipeline and making remarkable progress against COVID-19 with our novel antibody cocktail. Importantly, our growth and financial strength is being fueled by an increasingly diversified set of revenue and earnings streams while we invest in R&D for the long term. Furthermore, our results show the importance of products that meaningfully address serious medical needs and have the power to transform lives even during a pandemic. EYLEA is a great example. EYLEA Global net sales were $2.1 billion in the quarter and grew 9% compared to the same period last year. In the U.S., sales rebounded from second quarter COVID lows to $1.3 billion and grew 11% versus prior year. The efficacy, safety and convenience that EYLEA offers in protecting eyesight had proven to be highly valued by treating physicians and their patients as the product again outperformed the anti-VEGF market for retinal diseases. Next, we continue to build momentum with Dupixent as we in Sanofi recorded our first ever quarter of more than $1 billion in sales. This milestone speaks to the power of Dupixent across a broad array of type 2 inflammatory diseases and to our team's ability to execute despite COVID-19. Adding to this momentum, we've recently announced results from another successful Phase III trial, this time in pediatric asthma. We are eager to submit these data for regulatory review and expect that Dupixent will remain a robust and durable growth driver for years to come. In oncology, we are solidifying our leadership position in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Additionally, the FDA has granted priority review for our regulatory filings in lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma as we prepare for potential launches in these indications early next year. Regeneron is also making critical advancements in the treatment of infectious diseases. Last month, the FDA approved Inmazeb, the first-ever treatment for Ebolba virus infection. Building upon our work in Ebola, our team and rapid response technologies have developed our novel REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail in the fight against COVID-19. Last week, we announced another major data set from our outpatient study that showed our antibody cocktail significantly reduced viral loads as well as medically attended visits, such as emergency room visits and hospitalizations. We have submitted these data to regulators and eagerly await guidance on next steps. In closing, we could not be prouder of our teams and everything they have been able to achieve across the organization in the third quarter and in 2020 to date. Our momentum is accelerating with an impressive growth profile. In 2021, we look forward to building upon that momentum with several important launches for Libtayo, Dupixent and other programs, further enhancing our diverse growth platform. We are excited by the progress we are making against COVID-19, and we are confident that our investments in R&D to broaden and advance our pipeline across all stages will position Regeneron well for sustained growth. Now I'll turn the call over to George. So it's Len. We have said that we are focusing on the patient population where the data comes from, which is outpatients who have the best baseline characteristics, which would make us think that they would benefit the most, whether that's risk factors or high viral titer or eventually perhaps low antibodies. Those are the sorts of patients we are focused on as an outpatient. There is no PDUFA time line for the EUA. We expect action in the relative near future, but there's no guarantee that will come. The FDA is doing a very careful analysis. We can tell from the kinds of questions we're getting. And we hope that it will be -- reach a successful conclusion. But we don't know the time line because there are no specific time lines. We do know they're working just about as hard as we can imagine and have seen the FDA work. So we're hopeful soon, we'll get an answer. Well, you have to ask one question. So far you're up to 3. Marion can handle the first one. Yes. Just -- so just to amplifying on what George said, Yaron, and he said it, I just think it's worth repeating that we did see an effect in the overall population. It's just, as he said, that effect was driven by the people who needed the antibody and that they hadn't mounted their own immune response. That observation, which is something that the team predicted, which is that people who mounted their own immune response wouldn't benefit so much from giving them more of an antibody makes perfect sense. And those that hadn't mounted their own immune response would benefit much more also makes perfect sense, and that is exactly what they saw. And you even see it in the placebo-treated patients that if you don't have antibodies, you start with a very high viral load. If you do have antibodies, you're already 3 logs lower. So all of the biology that George and the team predicted and described was borne out in a very exciting way. So I think it's just a matter of where you see the effect being driven by, not whether or not you can treat an entire population. Yes. Let me just also add to that, Geoff, 2 things. First of all, as -- I think George pointed out in his presentation when we first disclosed this data. There's a very high correlation between the baseline viral load and whether or not you have antibodies. It's -- on average, you're 3 logs higher if you don't have antibodies and viral load. So you could use viral load. And everybody who's going to get treated has a viral load test. They have a PCR test. It's reported as -- back as positive, but there's actual cycle time. So I think the testing of reporting -- a testing doesn't necessarily have to change, perhaps the reporting has to change in terms of what your cycle time is. A very low cycle time, meaning very high viral load predicts low or no antibodies. So that could be used, as George said, to screen patients. The second thing is our partner, Roche, is really one -- probably is the leading company for testing. They have a platform for antibodies that can test hundreds of millions of people per quarter, and it's deployed in, I think, like 70,000 different points of care. So we're working with them to see whether that test can be validated with our dataset or not. So I think there are lots of ways to get at this. You could use -- you can treat everybody, obviously, limiting to the people who have risk factors or you could start to narrow it down to people who have high viral load, low cycle time or eventually with our partners' capabilities, people who at point-of-care have no antibodies. So I think there's a lot of flexibility. It's just that we don't have all this buttoned down in this emergency situation. And it will probably evolve fairly quickly if we get an EUA. Right. George can -- sorry, I was going to say, George can deal with that. I was going to just deal quickly with the manufacturing question, which is we are scaling up and we expect to be able to make substantially more next year than we were able to make this year. Obviously, we'll have a full year of manufacturing, which we didn't -- we did not have a full year of manufacturing to deliver the 300,000 doses. And we expect to have more facilities that are now operational and dedicated, plus we expect to multiply that with our partner, Roche, who really has been a terrific partner so far. And they, as you know -- because we see their might because we compete with them in many fronts, they're really sophisticated in the biologics space with their Genentech history and the manufacturing capacity. And they're working very hard to bring online very enhanced and large manufacturing capacity. I'll let George deal with the question about combination therapy. No, no. Go ahead, Marion. No, I think you covered it. Let's go to the next question and the last question."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Bob Landry",
            "content": "Thank you, Marion. For the third quarter of 2020, Regeneron delivered strong based growth on both the top and bottom lines, resulting from continued execution across all aspects of our business. Improving Dupixent profitability and contributions from additional revenue sources highlight the continued diversification of our business. For the third quarter, total revenues grew 32% year-over-year to $2.29 billion, driven by strong U.S. EYLEA growth and higher Sanofi collaboration revenues as a result of increased Dupixent sales and achievement of a $50 million sales milestone. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share grew 25% year-over-year to $8.36 on non-GAAP net income of $961 million. Since Marion discussed our U.S. EYLEA results, I will start with our Bayer and Sanofi collaborations. Starting with the Bayer collaboration. Ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales reported to us by Bayer were $780 million, representing a growth of 7% on a reported basis, compared to the prior year and a 22% improvement from second quarter 2020 lows. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $300 million, of which we recorded $288 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $353 million in the third quarter. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of non-IO antibodies was $213 million. This compares favorably to profits of $94 million in the prior year, which was primarily driven by higher Dupixent profits. We also recognized a $50 million milestone payment from Sanofi as a result of Dupixent, Praluent and Kevzara ex U.S. sales achieving $1 billion in the trailing 12-month period. Next, we announced in July a $450 million supply agreement with the U.S. government for batches of REGN-COV2. We record sales as batches are supplied to the government. In the third quarter of 2020, under this agreement, we recorded an initial $40 million of sales for REGN-COV2. We expect that in the fourth quarter of 2020, we will record sales approximating half of the value of this agreement. Sales for the remaining batches are expected to be recorded in the first quarter of 2021. In other revenue, we recorded $159 million versus $37 million in the prior year. The primary driver of this increase is the recognition of $70 million from the U.S. government associated with reimbursements of our Ebola and REGN-COV2 development recognition of $28 million in connection with the Regeneron Genetic Center sequencing a certain number of exomes as well as a reimbursement for ex U.S. supply of Praluent to Sanofi. Looking ahead to fourth quarter in 2021, we expect the other revenue line to trend lower in the absence of an RGC milestone and reduced reimbursements from the U.S. government on Ebola. Moving to our expense base and starting with R&D. Non-GAAP R&D increased 35% year-over-year to $629 million, driven by significant clinical development costs for our REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail, higher headcount to support our expanding pipeline, increased clinical manufacturing activities and continued advancement of our partner programs with Alnylam, Intellia and other early-stage partners. Next, non-GAAP SG&A expense increased 10% year-over-year to $291 million. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by increased headcount as well as commercial costs for EYLEA and Praluent. Cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing was $143 million, compared to $110 million in the third quarter of 2019, primarily due to increased sales of Dupixent. Non-GAAP cost of goods increased 22% from the prior year related to higher sales of Libtayo and the inclusion of sales from Praluent and REGN-COV2. Turning now to taxes. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 16.3% in the third quarter of 2020, compared to 13.6% in the third quarter of 2019, primarily due to discrete items to the quarters. Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. Regeneron continues to maintain a strong balance sheet, ending the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $5.9 billion. Our third quarter free cash flow was negatively impacted by the extension of EYLEA payment terms to support physician offices during COVID. We expect this will reverse in 2021 as payment terms return to normal. Additionally, in the quarter, we issued $2 billion of long-term debt, leveraging historically low interest rates while decreasing our cost of capital. With the issuance of this debt, we expect to incur approximately $45 million of incremental interest expense on an annual basis. Finally, we repurchased $100 million of stock in the third quarter as part of our $1 billion Board-authorized share buyback program. Now I'd like to spend a few moments to provide updates to our full year 2020 guidance. We updated our guidance on several expense line items where, in many cases, we either lowered or narrowed guidance range. Please refer to our press release for our entire updated 2020 guidance. Specific to R&D. We are revising upward our forecasted 2020 non-GAAP R&D expense to be in the range of $2.42 billion to $2.47 billion. While we increased R&D guidance on our second call to reflect REGN-COV2 expenses, we have since substantially expanded the scope and enrollment targets across the REGN-COV2 clinical program, which will result in increased expenses in the fourth quarter and into first half 2021. Also, while we are not providing 2021 guidance today, we do expect that 2021 full year R&D expenses will increase to fund in advancing and expanding pipeline as well as early stage partnership assets. In conclusion, Regeneron's business remains healthy, and we continued to deliver strong year-over-year growth as we diversify our revenue and earnings and advance our robust pipeline. We remain well positioned for future growth with healthy core brands and multiple near-term launches while investing in our R&D engine to drive longer-term growth. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Justin. Sure. Thanks, Cory. Let me see if I can give you a little bit of color. So as I said in our prepared remarks, we're not going to provide 2021 R&D guidance today. We do expect that next year's R&D expenses will be higher to support pretty much everything that George said with regards to the expanding pipeline, early stage assets, the partnerships with Alnylam and Intellia, which are really starting to blossom and certainly our ongoing COVID-19 efforts. If you look at 2020, where we sit right now, we anticipate spend of approximately $400 million on our efforts against COVID-19 within the year of 2020. So if you back that spend out from our full year 2020 non-GAAP R&D guidance midpoint, our underlying growth rate in R&D spend, excluding the COVID program efforts, is trending about 15% higher than our 2019 as our -- as we move forward. So Cory, I would use that kind of as a stake in the ground in terms of where we're going to go. I mean, certainly, our COVID-19 spending is going to continue on. People can see on clinicaltrials.gov the extent of the programs that we have, trials that we have going, that will play a factor into 2021."

Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer. Len?\nLeonard Schleifer: Thank you, Justin and thanks to everyone for joining the call. I hope all of you are staying safe and well. We very much appreciate your efforts to join given the pandemic conditions and even on top of that northeast some power disruption from the storm, but business continues. We had an eventful and productive second quarter in terms of financial results, business development and corporate accomplishments. In the second quarter, our results demonstrated resilience and strength despite the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to driving double-digit top and bottom line growth, we continue to deliver meaningful advances in our broad and innovative pipeline as well as in our fight against COVID-19 with our novel antibody cocktail. Regeneron continues to execute well in this unprecedented time for our company and our nation in the world. Starting with our products, EYLEA global net product sales were $1.75 billion in the second quarter, a modest decline of 6% compared to the prior year. In the U.S., we generated sales of $1.11 billion, with a pronounced and sustained rebound in demand in May and June, following the decline in sales we experienced in early April. This rebound has continued into July and demand is now approaching pre-COVID levels. The efficacy, safety and convenience of EYLEA have proven to be even more viable in the world of COVID-19. As you will hear for Marion, EYLEA outperformed the broader anti-VEGF class this quarter. Demand for DUPIXENT also proved to be robust in the second quarter, with global sales growth of 70% compared to last year. Sales were nearly $1 billion on continued market penetration in atopic dermatitis, asthma and new launches. Adding to the DUPIXENT momentum, the FDA approved a new indication for atopic dermatitis in children aged 6 to 11. Furthermore, we demonstrated dramatic results in eosinophilic esophagitis, where patients reported a nearly 70% reduction in symptoms further exemplifying the potential of DUPIXENT to bend the arc of certain Type 2 inflammatory diseases. We look forward to additional DUPIXENT milestones, including an upcoming Phase 3 readout in pediatric asthma and enrollment of a second Phase 3 study in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We and our patients and customers have a tremendous amount of enthusiasm for this product and we are still in the early days of unlocking its full potential with our partner, Sanofi. In oncology, Libtayo is the leading systemic treatment for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. We are seeking approvals in basal cell carcinoma and non-small-cell lung cancer with regulatory filings to be submitted imminently. With our chemotherapy combination study in non-small-cell lung cancer nearing full enrollment, our excitement for Libtayo continues to grow. Beyond Libtayo, we are broadening and advancing our biospecifics portfolio, generating further momentum for our ontology strategy. Turning to our efforts to fight COVID-19, we are advancing the development of a novel antibody cocktail known as REGN-COV2 that may both treat and prevent infection from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We are now in Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials and hope to generate initial data by the end of September as George will discuss in further detail. We also signed two major agreements in recent weeks. We announced a $450 million agreement with BARDA and the U.S. Department of Defense to manufacture REGN-COV2. We also signed a 6-year $345 million agreement with BARDA for our novel Ebola antibody cocktail, further demonstrating the potential of our end-to-end technologies to deliver shareholder value in addressing infectious disease threats. Finally, on the corporate front, we contemplate \u2013 excuse me, we completed a large secondary offering of more than 13 million shares of our common stock held by Sanofi. Using our strong balance sheet, we also repurchased $5 billion or 9.8 million shares from Sanofi, effectively eliminating their ownership position in our company and demonstrating our confidence in the trajectory of our business. For Regeneron shareholders, this transaction provided immediate accretion and removed a significant overhang related to the exploration of Sanofi\u2019s lockup period at the end of this year. Regeneron is a business that is indeed firing on all cylinders. We thank all of our colleagues across the company who have been working with resolve and resilience in these extraordinary times of the pandemic. Our strong business performance, cash flow, balance sheet and advancement of the next generation of innovations for important medical needs, has us positioned to weather COVID-19 and emerge from the pandemic to drive continued long-term growth. Now, I will turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len. And with all of us still in the throes of the COVID-19 epidemic, I will start with an update on our antiviral antibody cocktail that has the potential to both possibly protect against infection and also treat those already infected. Based on our Ebola program, our new non-human primary data for our COVID-19 cocktail as well as our understanding of immune response, we believe that our COVID-19 treatment is well positioned to help patients prior to and early in infection. We initiated our clinical program in June, barely 5 months after we started this treatment, developing this treatment. Our rapid timeline was possible due to our VelociSuite technologies, which were developed in-house over decades to allow for specific turnkey disease interventions and were recently applied to develop a similar approach against Ebola, which we hope will prove to be the first treatment approved for this disease with a PDUFA date in October. We are conducting 4 trials of Regeneron COV2, our antibody cocktail: one in hospitalized COVID-19 patients; a second, ambulatory study in outpatients who are diagnosed with COVID-19; a third, preventative study in household contacts with COVID-19 patients being carried out in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease; and a fourth, multi-dose, healthy volunteer study. Our studies are adaptive in nature as we learn more about the virus and our antibody cocktail and other studies are being planned as well. All of these studies have passed several safety assessments with no safety concerns observed to-date. Despite the challenging environment, in which these studies are being conducted, we are targeting to report initial virology and biomarker data from the treatment studies by the end of September with clinical outcome data to follow as enrollment progresses. In June, we have published two important papers in science on our antibody cocktail, in which we described the details of how the two antibodies in our cocktail block the coronavirus spike protein, and importantly, highlighted the significance of using the antibody cocktail versus single antibody approach. We showed that the cocktail approach avoided viral escape due to viral mutation, which rapidly occur when using single antibody approaches. In addition, we have recently generated important data in non-human primates, which has been both posted on bio-archives. These studies showed that in this setting, our antibody cocktail can not only effectively prevent infection primates matching or exceeding recently published prevention data achieved with vaccine approaches, but also that our cocktail can treat those already infected by accelerating viral elimination. I next want to highlight the outside support we have received for our strategy in addition to conducting our Phase 3 prevention study in collaboration with the NIAID, which substantively expands our reach to investigate our cocktail in the preventative setting. We recently signed a manufacturing contract with BARDA as part of Operation Warp Speed to make initial lives of our cocktail at risk so that the drug could be available as soon as possible, if proven efficacious and approved by the FDA. While we are all hoping that vaccines prove successful and we ourselves are partnering on some novel second generation vaccine approaches, we believe that our neutralizing antibody cocktail could play an important role as a rapid first line in defense, in those for whom the vaccine is not available and in the long-term could also provide protection for those least likely to respond well to a vaccine, such as the elderly and immunocompromised. Moreover, unlike the vaccine and as supported by our initial primate studies, our cocktail may not only prevent infection, but could also have the potential to treat those already infected. Moving on to our efforts outside of COVID-19 and starting with DUPIXENT, the demonstrated safety and efficacy of DUPIXENT are further bolstered by the recent FDA approval in children with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, children as young as 6 years old. We are not stopping there as we are conducting a study in even younger atopic dermatitis patients. And for children with asthma, we plan to submit a BLA supplement for approval in pediatric asthma by the end of the year, pending upcoming Phase 3 data. We are also enhancing convenience for all patients with the recent FDA approval of our 300 milligram auto-injector. Outside of the United States, DUPIXENT was approved in China recently, which represents a major milestone as we work to ensure patients everywhere have access to this life changing medicine. Our DUPIXENT clinical program continues to deliver positive results in additional Type 2 inflammatory indications. In May, we announced that we met the primary and key secondary endpoints in Part A as our pivotal trial in the eosinophilic esophagitis. Patients treated with DUPIXENT demonstrated significant clinical and anatomic improvements, with almost a 70% reduction in disease symptoms compared to an approximately 30% reduction for patients on placebo as demonstrated by the Dysphasia Symptom Questionnaire. We are currently enrolling Part B of this trial and communicating with regulators about filing requirements for this indication. In addition, the first pivotal DUPIXENT trial in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease typified by Type 2 inflammation or Type 2 COPD completed a pre-specified analysis by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee requiring a certain threshold reduction in exacerbations, which was met and thus triggered opening a second pivotal trial for this potential indication. Approval in Type 2 COPD would unlock another important opportunity for depiction to help patients with Type 2 inflammatory disease, who currently have limited options. Moving on to our oncology portfolio and starting with our PD-1 antibody, Libtayo. At the virtual ASCO meeting, we presented a clinically meaningful cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma data follow-up, followed by a label update as well. As reported at ASCO, was up to 3 years of follow-up, while the overall response rates remain stable approaching 50%, the complete response rates have climbed to 20% in metastatic CSCC increasing from the 7% rate reported in the initial preliminary analysis, providing one of the most dramatic examples of ongoing and prolonged benefit from an immunotherapy treatment. Moreover, this data firmly established Libtayo as first-in-class for this dermato-oncology cancer setting with compelling long-term clinical data. In addition last quarter, we announced positive first-in-class data for a second dermato-oncology indication that is basal cell carcinoma, which we will be submitting for regulatory review. Finally, we are excited about the opportunity for Libtayo in non-small cell lung cancer based on our recent positive Phase 3 trial with Libtayo as monotherapy in PD-L1 high patients, which we will also be submitting for regulatory view. And we have completed screening patients for enrollment in our follow-on chemo combination study in lung cancer. Libtayo is foundational to our oncology strategy and we are making significant progress with Libtayo in skin cancers, lung cancers and our numerous combination and collaborative studies. Our CD-3 bispecific clinical program is moving forward despite operational challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Regeneron 1979, our CD20xCD3 bispecifics has shown robust efficacy in both follicular lymphoma and more aggressive disease, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Our potentially pivotal Phase 2 study continues to enroll globally and we are having productive discussions with regulators to expand the registrational program with combinations and in earlier lines of treatment. We are preparing to explore novel combinations, including a combination from novel class of costimulatory bispecifics, that is one targeting B-cell specifically. We recently published a second major paper featured on the cover of Science Translational Medicine in June describing how these co-stimulatory bispecifics can synergize, not only with CD3 bispecifics, but also with PD-1 blockers. By the way, we are actively working on subcutaneous delivery of this potentially important drug candidate. Our BCMA by CD3 bispecific is moving forward and we are planning to initiate potentially pivotal studies in various multiple myeloma settings. Moreover, we intend to explore standard novel combinations, including with a co-stimulatory bispecific targeting plasma cells. We expect to provide updates for both our CD20 and BCMA programs at ASH later this year. I would like to expand a bit on our co-stimulatory bispecific effort as it represents an important example of the ongoing innovation in oncology for Regeneron. As I said, we are planning on combining such costims with both our CD20 and BCMA bi-spec programs for lymphoma and myeloma. But our first co-stimulatory bispecific is already in clinical development. This first-in-humans co-stim PSMAxCD28 is in combination with Libtayo for prostate cancer and is continuing to enroll in the dose escalation stage of clinical investigation. We are also excited about two additional co-stim bispecifics scheduled to enter the clinic this year. These new co-stim trials include EGFRxCD28 in combination with Libtayo, which will be explored in several solid tumors, including lung cancer and head and neck cancer as well as MUC16xCD28, which will be tested for patients with ovarian cancer as well as in other settings. Our MUC16 co-stim will be studied in combination with either Libtayo or MUC16xCD3 bispecific, which is already in clinic. The span of our toolkit enables us to explore these and many new combinations that based on preclinical evidence could provide meaningful advances for a wide variety of cancer patients. Moving on from oncology, I would like to provide an update on our fasinumab program. We have previously announced positive top line efficacy data in a fasinumab Phase 3 FACT long-term safety study, or FACT LTS substudy. And today we are announcing that two additional Phase 3 studies in patients with osteoarthritis pain, FACT OA1 and FACT OA2 met the co-primary efficacy endpoints for the fasinumab 1 milligram monthly dose versus placebo. The fasinumab 1 milligram monthly dose also showed nominally significant benefits in physical functions in both trials and pain in one of the two trials when compared to the maximum FDA approved doses of NSAIDs for osteoarthritis. The less frequent dose of fasinumab 1 milligram every 2 months used in an arm of the FACT OA1 trial showed numerical benefit over placebo, but did not achieve statistical significance. In the initial safety analysis from the Phase 3 trials, there is an increase in arthropathies reported with fasinumab. In the FACT LTS substudy, there was increase in joint replacements with fasinumab 1 milligram monthly treatment, during the off-drug follow-up period. Although this increase was not seen in the other trials to-date, additional longer term safety data from the ongoing trials is being collected and is expected to be reported early next year. Finally, I would like to briefly address other exciting developments in our pipeline. We are planning to publish evinacumab results in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia shortly and we have submitted our applications to the FDA and to EMA. Regarding our garetosmab program for fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP, we are planning to submit data to regulatory authorities in the first quarter of next year pending results from the crossover arm of our trial, where placebo patients are now receiving active drug. Our hope is to replicate the dramatic 90% reduction in new lesion formation that we saw in the first part of the trial. At the European Hematology Association Meeting in June, we presented promising pozelimab monotherapy interim results in paroxysmal, nocturnal, hematoglobinuria patients. We are hoping to start to start testing a combination with Alnylam's RNAi treatment, cemdisiran, by year end. And last but certainly not least, we are starting to enrol our Phase 3 study of the high dose EYLEA in DME and wet AMD. High-dose EYLEA has the potential to reduce dosing frequency, while maintaining the efficacy and safety of our medicine that is trusted by doctors and patients worldwide. To conclude, our broad and diverse pipelines is growing and progressing even in this COVID 19 environment, I could not be prouder that even in these extraordinary and challenging times, our people are continuing to push on every front in our efforts to bring important new treatments to the patients who need them. I now turn over the call to Marion.\nMarion McCourt: Thank you, George Our second quarter business performance reflects the resilience and competitive strength of our core brands: EYLEA, DUPIXENT and Libtayo. We remain confident in our ability to navigate through COVID-19 and position our portfolio for future growth as demand recovers. I am going to begin with EYLEA, which had $1.75 billion in global net sales. In the U.S., EYLEA net sales were $1.11 billion, which is just 4% lower than the same quarter last year despite the impact of COVID-19. EYLEA outperformed the overall anti-VEGF market in the U.S. with continued share gains from both branded and unbranded competition. In fact, EYLEA\u2019s share of the branded U.S. market reached 73% of net sales for the quarter solidifying our leadership position in the anti-VEGF market. The impact of COVID-19 on U.S. sales was sold predominantly in April after the sales improved throughout May and into June as retina specialists reopened the offices and patient volume increased. The combination of three EYLEA attributes differentiated efficacy, safety and dosing flexibility are highly valuable in easing physician and patient burdens caused by the pandemic. Physicians may treat with extended dosing of up to 12 weeks in appropriate patients and the recently launched pre-filled syringe offers additional efficiencies for patient care. EYLEA demand continues to show steady improvement and the volume of new patients in the market is approaching pre-pandemic levels. We are closely monitoring the recent resurgence of COVID-19. Under all scenarios, we remain highly committed to supporting the retina community through virtual and in-person platforms to ensure the continuity of patient care. In summary, we are encouraged by the rebound in EYLEA demand in recent months and we will continue to advance efforts to support our customers and their patients during these unprecedented times. Turning next to Libtayo, second quarter global net sales grew to $80 million, with the U.S. contributing $63 million. In April, patient office visits declined and some infusion centers temporarily closed. This briefly impacted Libtayo demand, which rebounded during May and June. In the U.S., Libtayo advanced its leadership as the number one systemic treatment for advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC. Libtayo has experienced rapid growth in advanced CSCC, with 70% of patients now treated with anti-PD1 therapy. We expect future growth as Libtayo as new Libtayo competitive profile strengthens with new long-term data demonstrating longer durability, higher overall responses and nearly 3x the rate of complete responses based on additional years of follow-up. Looking ahead, we are preparing for potential future launches with our collaborator Sanofi in both non-small-cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma. Both represent meaningful growth opportunities for Libtayo. The anti-PD1 and PDL-1 market continues to grow at a significant pace with current annual med sales of nearly $25 billion. Non-small cell lung cancer is the largest opportunity within this market, with more than 200,000 new diagnoses of lung cancer in the U.S. each year. Patients, payers and physicians\u2019 preferred choice in determining the most appropriate treatment and should Libtayo be approved, it has demonstrated very competitive clinical results to-date in the advanced PD-1 positive patient population studied. Finally, moving to DUPIXENT, global net sales in the second quarter were $945 million, representing 70% growth compared to the prior year. In the U.S. broad-based growth across all approved indications contributed net sales of $770 million. Following an initial dip in mid-May, new patient starts have increased as physician offices reopened. Current weekly new patient starts have recovered to approximately 87% of pre-pandemic levels, a sign of robust demand for DUPIXENT. DUPIXENT\u2019s compelling clinical profile enables the product to thrive even in the current environment. DUPIXENT is administered at home and does not require laboratory testing or monitoring to initiate most new patients. Importantly, DUPIXENT is not an immunosuppressant and we expect the U.S. launch of the 300-milligram pre-filled pen in the third quarter, providing additional patient convenience and choice. Atopic dermatitis is DUPIXENT\u2019s largest indication and remains a significant growth driver. We continue to expand physician prescribing across both moderate and severe disease. To-date, only a small percentage of biologic eligible patients, have been treated, leaving substantial opportunity for more patients to benefit. Additionally, new long-term data demonstrate sustained efficacy over a 3-year period along with confirmed safety. We also continue to expand into younger populations. The U.S. FDA recently approved DUPIXENT to treat children aged 6 to 11 used with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, which impacts approximately 90,000 children in this country. DUPIXENT is the only biologic medicine approved for this population and leading launch indicators are very encouraging. Many children suffering with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis are being treated by the same physicians who have extensive clinical experience with their adolescent and adult patients and have great confidence in the DUPIXENT safety profile. DUPIXENT also continues to outperform in asthma as measured by more new patient initiations over the last year compared to other biologic competitors. We see further opportunities to expand patient awareness of DUPIXENT and our national DTC campaign, which is underway. Among those already on treatment COVID-19 has limited impact as patients adhere to their therapies to maintain and improve respiratory function. Finally, we see strong uptake in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Since approval last year, patients have been initiated on DUPIXENT regardless of prior surgery. Demand has increased among ENTs and allergists with the limited availability of elective surgeries in the last quarter. Overall, we see great opportunity for DUPIXENT which is positioned for significant growth through expanded indications, age groups and geographies. In closing, our teams and business remain resilient as we execute on our strategy to deliver value for customers and stakeholders. Now, I will turn the call to Bob.\nBob Landry: Thank you, Marion. For the second quarter of 2020, Regeneron delivered strong results on both the top and bottom line. Our continued ability to generate this year-over-year growth is an encouraging signal of our diversified growth potential now and beyond COVID-19. For the second quarter, total revenues grew 24% year-over-year to $1.95 billion driven by higher Sanofi collaboration revenues as a result of increasing for DUPIXENT sales. Additionally, we recorded significant revenues associated with our infectious disease efforts against both Ebola and COVID-19. These revenues are recorded in our other revenue line. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share grew 19% year-over-year to $7.16 on non-GAAP net income of $854 million. Since Marion discussed our U.S. EYLEA results, I will start with our Bayer and Sanofi collaborations. Starting with the Bayer collaboration, ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales, which are reported to us by Bayer were $641 million, representing a decline of 10% on a reported basis compared to the prior year due to the COVID-19 impact. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $244 million, of which we recorded $231 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $269 million in the second quarter. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of non-IO antibodies was $172 million. This compares favorably to profits of $39 million in the prior year period, which was driven by higher DUPIXENT profits. Before moving to expenses, I will discuss our second quarter 2020 other revenue line item, in which we recorded $212 million, up sharply from the $20 million in the prior year period. The primary driver of the year-over-year increase is the recognition of $126 million associated with BARDA for our research and manufacturing efforts for both Ebola and COVID-19. We record R&D reimbursements from BARDA in other revenues. Moving to our expense base and starting with R&D, non GAAP R&D increased 36% year-over-year to $580 million driven by significant development costs for both our antibody cocktail and KEVZARA clinical trials for COVID-19, in addition to higher headcount and increased clinical manufacturing activities, a portion of which were reimbursed by BARDA. Next, non-GAAP SG&A expense increased 19% year-over-year to $301 million. The year-over-year increase was driven by the inclusion of PRALUENT commercialization costs in the U.S., higher contributions to non-profit patient assistance organizations and higher headcount related costs. Non-GAAP cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing was $173 million compared to $79 million in the second quarter of 2019. The year-over-year increase is due to manufacturing cost associated with higher DUPIXENT volumes sold by Sanofi, Ebola production and PRALUENT supply for Sanofi\u2019s ex-U.S. markets. Turning now to taxes, the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 0.9% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to 19.1% in the second quarter of 2019. The lower tax rate versus last year was primarily due to increased tax benefits associated with stock option exercises in the realization of those benefits earlier in the calendar year compared to prior years. Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. Year-to-date, Regeneron generated $1.34 billion in free cash flow. In the quarter, we spent $5 billion to repurchase approximately 9.8 million shares of our common stock as part of Sanofi\u2019s sale of substantially all of their equity stake in Regeneron. As Len mentioned, the secondary offering in repurchase were strategic transactions that provided Regeneron\u2019s shareholders immediate accretion, removed uncertainty regarding Sanofi\u2019s equity position and is a testament to our confidence in the strength of our business now and in the future. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $5.7 billion and $1.5 billion in debt financing under a bridge loan related to the Sanofi stake repurchase. Now, I would like to spend a few moments to discuss the financial outlook for the remainder of the year. We maintained or lowered the midpoint of our guidance on several expense items. Please refer to our press release and financial disclosures for entire updated 2020 guidance. Here I will discuss the guidance items related to our increased efforts in the fight against COVID-19 as we leverage our end-to-end capabilities of drug discovery development and manufacturing. We are updating our forecasted 2020 non-GAAP R&D expenses to be in the range of $2.27 billion to $2.37 billion. For COGS, we are raising our forecast for 2020 non-GAAP expenses to be in the range of $435 million to $485 million. The increase in both R&D and cost of goods sold guidance are related primarily to our efforts against COVID-19. For R&D, we anticipate that more than half of the increase to our 2020 R&D guidance will be reimbursed for COVID-19 efforts. Those reimbursements will continue to be recorded in other revenue. We are also providing updated guidance for our tax rate. We anticipate our updated 2020 non-GAAP effective tax guidance to be in the range of 10% to 12%. In conclusion, Regeneron\u2019s business remains healthy and we continue to deliver strong year-over-year growth despite the global impact of COVID-19. Our strong balance sheet, improved competitive outlook, increasingly diversified commercial portfolio and robust pipeline positioned Regeneron very well for sustained long-term growth. Now with that, I would like to turn the call back to Justin.\nJustin Holko: Thank you, Bob. Stephanie, that concludes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the call for Q&A. We have several callers in the queue and to ensure that we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will address one question from each caller before moving to the next. Please go ahead, Stephanie.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.\nTerence Flynn: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question and thanks for all your efforts on the COVID front. I just had one on the manufacturing side, I was wondering if you can give us anymore detail about your manufacturing costs for the antibodies or if you could at least confirm that these are well below $100 per gram. And if you won\u2019t answer that question, I was just wondering Marion, if any perspective you can share on the opportunity for DUPIXENT in China and specifically what you guys think NRDL reimbursement? Thank you.\nLeonard Schleifer: Terence, hi, it\u2019s Len. I don\u2019t think we can comment on our COGS, but Marion can certainly comment on China.\nMarion McCourt: Sure, very happy to. Terence, thank you for the question. We are really excited about the opportunity in China and I will also remind that Sanofi has the responsibility for China. I am very encouraged by the progress to-date. And as it relates to specifics on reimbursement, I would guide asking our Sanofi colleagues to describe that in more detail, but as you know, tremendous market opportunity, incredible unmet need and a remarkable clinical profile and we are really excited about the opportunity.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink.\nGeoffrey Porges: Good morning and thank you very much for taking the questions. Congratulations on the results and all the progress in the quarter. Perhaps a few questions on the COVID program, George, you referred to the animal data and the high dose used 50 milligrams per kilogram is quite a lot of antibody. Could you give us a sense of first, is that the dentist that you expect to take forward in the pivotal trials for treatment and how much lower could it be for prophylaxis? And secondly, if that indeed turns out to be the dose, could you give us some indication of the number of courses that you could envisage having supply for this year and next year, given the available capacity now?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. We have modeled the doses in the blood levels from the primate studies in order to design our human studies. And so we are hoping and targeting to achieve similar blood levels in the humans as we are achieving to achieve the relative efficacies in the primate studies. At those levels, we are at the production level that we could be delivering hundreds of thousands of doses per month for the prophylactic dose level and tens of thousands of doses per month for the treatment levels assuming that in that those sorts of ranges that we are predicting right now but of course all that is all pending the trials and seeing what doses really work hopefully some of the doses work and so forth. So there's still a lot to figure out that those are the levels that we are targeting and those are the numbers of doses that we are anticipating that we could deliver depending on how all the clinical trials work out.\nJustin Holko: Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Yaron Werber with Cowen.\nLeo Ai: Hi, good morning. This is Leo Ai for Yaron Werber. Thanks for taking our questions and Congrats on the side of the quarter and the good progress I just had two questions regarding your COVID-19 program. The first question is regarding the durability and safety of your neutralizing antibodies, it seems that some other antibody developers are kind of modifying the actually, demand of their antibody candidates to either extend the half-life or minimize the efficacy dose-limiting toxicities. Can you kind of discuss if you made any modifications to your candidates? And my second question is regarding the prevention study it seems to me that the ongoing Phase III study is looking at the preventing infections in household contacts of infected individual I am just wondering because the trial design looks more like postexposure prophylaxis. I'm just wondering you can provide any features regarding your plans on the prevention Trials are we looking at like the pre-exposure prophylaxis in other high-risk populations\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Well there is a lot of questions sort of in there so one in terms of engineering our antibodies, historically, we've had very good success with achieving very good half lives and duration and durability without making modifications which as always come with certain risks so at least for our first generation antibodies based on the historical success were going with unmodified antibodies in terms of the concerns for antibody dependant enhancement we have done extensive studies and efforts on that including with antibodies that we have or have not modified effector function. And based on all of our data and all of our results we are going forward with antibodies once again that are not modified based on the confidence in the data that we have generated with our preclinical experience and finally what was the last question.\nJustin Holko: The prevention study?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: The prevention study, yes, so some of those patients who have only been exposed that there will be ongoing exposure as well. So it is going to be both a pre and a post exposure prophylaxis effort and we will be characterising whether the patient in the household that we are treating have already been exposed in terms of whether already infected or not in our analysis.\nJustin Holko: Next question, Stephanie.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler.\nChris Raymond: Thanks. So just on the EYLEA high dose program I know from just looking at it from trials.gov website, it looks like your larger DME and AMD trials aren't projected to read out until 2022 but there may be a smaller trial I think, CANDELA, reading out in 2021 So I guess some and the question here is I know you guys have not really guided to data yet but will we get a sense of the feasibility at its approach next year especially given if it is a higher dose and you got to be mindful of information etcetera but also may be remind us why are you guys never went the route of using a half life extension like a biopolymer? Thanks.\nLeonard Schleifer: So, I will take the first part but George you can take the latter in terms of the data we really have not guided it depends on we are sort of trying to do things in parallel get some Phase 2 data while we are enrolling the Phase 3. So we will just have to see how that comes how that comes along George can comment on the difficulties of biopolymer work.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Right. So we have been investing enormously in efforts with biopolymer extension and so forth. And as we all know and as has been demonstrated recently with the problems of a major competitor, EYLEA sets a very high bar for safety and for efficacy and particularly from a safety point of view. And in all of our efforts, we have not been satisfied with our biopolymer efforts that those modifications meet that high bar, particularly for safety. And so we have been hesitant to move those programs further into the clinic, because of the concerns that we found with those approaches when we compare them and test them in our preclinical settings. In terms of the high dose EYLEA, we are hoping that we will be able to maintain that safety \u2013 the high safety bar with a high dose area, but to extend the dosing as you know, right now, studies show that depending on the patients, about 50% of the patients can go to T-12 dosing using the current dose of EYLEA. And what we are hoping is that we maybe able to increase the percentage of those patients who can go to longer term dosing using this higher dose, but to achieve that in as safe manner as we have historically with EYLEA to-date. So that\u2019s the basis of our strategy.\nLeonard Schleifer: Yes. I just might add that we are not sure there is any evidence that there is a dose dependent effect on inflammation at least with the high-quality EYLEA that we make. So I am not sure that\u2019s necessarily going to be the case.\nJustin Holko: Next question, Stephanie?\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Truist.\nRobyn Karnauskas: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Good morning. So, question on fasinumab since you announced your top line data this morning. Can you just give us some sense in the hip and the knee? You just talk more broadly about the market, but the hip and the knee, what a monthly dose, what the opportunity might be given that, that would be profile and your strategy for going after now that you know what that profile is going after your other joints? Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Well, I think the biggest concern is obviously having to do with the benefit risk and the safety profile. Obviously, there is enormous need for alternatives in the pain field and there are so many tens of millions of people who are living with osteoarthritis pain with limited options and concerns about all the available medications, with all the concerns and problems with opioids in particular, but also with NSAIDs and so forth. All of these patients are potential candidates for the NGF inhibitors. So, we are still awaiting and needing to readout additional safety data from our program. And I think it\u2019s going to still be determined in terms of the relative benefit risk as to how important a drug this can be for the so many patients who are in need here.\nLeonard Schleifer: Yes, Robyn, I just wanted to mention, glad to see you have got a new name there, Truist, sounds good. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the truest, we like to think Regeneron is the truest. But in anyway, the notion of whether the risk benefit is going to work, as George pointed out, I mean, to some extent, we are sort of behind the alliance of Lilly and Pfizer in this class and they have announced I think that their action date is December, they have recently said there is not going to be an advisory panel. So, we will get to see as we are preparing our file in collecting that\u2019s why they will get to see how the FDA views all of this and what constraints or restraints they might put or if they will or they won\u2019t approve it. So you will get a little bit of an insight into the class, because it does appear that we see the same kinds of adverse events in general, in terms of arthropathies and these increased joint replacements that we saw off drug that has been seen with the members of the class.\nJustin Holko: Great. Thanks for the question. Stephanie, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.\nGeoff Meacham: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I had one on Libtayo, obviously, you guys have basal cell and monotherapy in lung as label expansion opportunities. I just wanted to characterize your \u2013 the trends in 2Q today and maybe your market share is. Do you feel like you're at saturation today or is there still an opportunity in your co-indication today? Thank you.\nMarion McCourt: Sure. So this is still relatively early in the launch for Libtayo. The team has done a great job of establishing Libtayo for these patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease with the alternative of Libtayo. But certainly there is significant opportunity to expand our utilization. And, obviously, as you mentioned, as we potentially get into future indications even more volatile\nLeonard Schleifer: Yes, obviously, the big indication where most of the sales in this space are is lung cancer, non small cell lung cancer and so our exciting data, which will be basis of a filing a monotherapy, and we are moving rapidly towards closing out the final patients enrolled in the chemo combination study. So lung cancer is really the bigger future opportunity if we can successfully complete that.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: And of course, ultimately as we tried to highlight it is a little disappointing, how the PD1 class has not had as dramatic efficacy as one would have wanted in so many other cancer settings. And that\u2019s why we have our very exciting and innovative collection of by specifics and other combination opportunities. But now that we have our own PD1 as a foundational component, we can now be trying to increase and add efficacy in all these other cancer settings where right now the PD1 class is not really shown as much benefit as one would want, but maybe we can now really create enormous benefit in the sales by making the right combinations, particularly with our bispecifics, but with other combination opportunities as well.\nJustin Holko: Thanks, Jeff. Next question, Stephanie.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein.\nRonny Gal: Good morning. Thank you for taking our questions and congratulations on a nice progress. Back to the COVID-19 cost sales one question I have is about the hospitalization patient trial. Which is how do you monitor against patients mounting the autoimmune response and kind of confounding did it that way? And related the release of the biomarker data late summer, does that tell us something about the completion of the efficacy readouts, or is there some relationship there we can follow? Are they going to press release the completion of the enrollment just to give us an idea how do we know that antibody efficacy data is coming?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: These are all the great questions, and in fact we are analyze our own data exactly with regards to some of the points and concerns that you have we are measuring among the biomarkers, we're measuring patients' endogenous response to their antibody titers, and we are comparing and dividing the patients based on their baseline levels of antibody titers to see whether the patients who respond the best are the people who are now mounting are too early in the course of their disease. And we have this adaptive design, we are going to continue to generate data and evaluate data. We will hopefully be reporting some of that data publicly, but then using that data to make decisions in terms of the adaptive future portions of our design.\nRonny Gal: Thanks.\nJustin Holko: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.\nTim Anderson: Thank you. I have a question on DUPIXENT and COPD, COPD remains the Holy Grail for asthma biologics and there have been earlier preliminary COPD, COPD data sets with other products that looked good, only to fail in Phase 3. So I\u2019m wondering if you can put into context the results from the interim look at your COPD trial that you referenced or at least whether those go no go criteria were the same that other biologics have relied on, or was that interim efficacy bar set higher with DUPIXENT than with competitor biologics at the same stage of development?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes, I am not sure that the earlier biologics, that you are referring to demonstrated much different data in your Phase 2 and Phase 3 programs and the problems were was that at best they were demonstrating somewhere around a 15% reduction in their exacerbations and depending on the Phase 3 studies Those were on the border of achieving clinical significance. And that\u2019s why those programs didn\u2019t move forward. So, we did not release the details of the bar that we set. But we did say that the bar that we set had to do with exacerbations and we have to achieve a minimum threshold reduction in exacerbations in order to trigger going forward and triggering the initiation of an additional phase III. So obviously, the fact that we met a threshold bar for reduction in exacerbations, I think creates some excitement, that assuming that we can continue to achieve these sorts of reductions in exacerbations that this could be an important drug for COPD.\nTim Anderson: Right.\nLeonard Schleifer: Yes. I just want to echo what George said, because this is a little different than most other sort of, futility analyses where you say, well, even if you have a slim chance you sometimes you will let the trial go forward, as George said, and then just trying to put a exclamation. It was a stringent that means it, it was hard to pass that bar, because obviously Sanofi and Regeneron, we didn't want to take on another whole Phase 3 program, which is obviously takes a lot of time, money and effort. Unless we were told and we didn\u2019t see the data, we just know that we passed this stringent bar if you will.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: And the bar was for reduction in exacerbations.\nTim Anderson: Right.\nJustin Holko: Next question please.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Yatin Suneja of Guggenheim Partners.\nYatin Suneja: Hey guys. Congrats on all the progress. A question on the commercial front with regard to the cocktail approach that you have, can you can you comment on how do you see the adoption in light of the recent data that we are seeing with vaccine given that they provide a little bit longer protection is that the antibody approach has a lower potential to fail versus a vaccine or and hence you are almost guaranteed protection may be perhaps if you can talk about how the market plays out once you have vaccine available? Thank you.\nLeonard Schleifer: I wasn\u2019t sure whether there was two parts of that question whether there\u2019s some insight on the technical aspect. If George understood that he can certainly answer that but from the commercial side I think it\u2019s what\u2019s been said for a long time this passive immunization with an antibody cocktail provides immediate immunity. So in the setting of until there\u2019s a vaccine, if this comes first that would be great. But even after this vaccine, there will be many people who are not vaccinated or whose vaccination effects wore off and they got ill or even if they were vaccinated, they didn\u2019t get enough of a response. So we think there is lot of places for this passive immunization with an antibody cocktail. George, I am not sure did you follow that at that point?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: I think that you got it.\nJustin Holko: Thanks. Next question please.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Alethia Young with Cantor.\nAlethia Young: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. I am just kind of curious about what is going on with evinacumab for the ANGPTL3 program. I know that you\u2019re following, but I thought it was a relatively kind of small market opportunity, but just wanted to kind of think about that and what are the potential expansion opportunities from there?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: This is ANGPTL3 you said evinacumab was a little hard to hear.\nAlethia Young: Yes. Oh, sorry.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. But, I think I got it.\nAlethia Young: What are the commercial potential and life beyond that indication as well?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: This is a very important proof of concept setting these are if we get approved as you say it\u2019s for homozygous FH, it\u2019s for a very rare genetic population. And particularly, what we showed was efficacy in patients who have no LDL receptor function. So that means that this drug in this pathway work totally different than all other drugs at lower lipids and cholesterol and it may have important growth opportunities after this in the sense that since it is lowering lipids, not only cholesterol but triglycerides, by these independent mechanisms, it is entirely possible and we are thinking about it about where there is a broader opportunity eventually, for this class of drugs. But we are also very excited about the near term opportunity that we hope we are going to get agreement from the FDA shortly in the homozygous FH population, particularly those who don\u2019t respond to any of the existing drugs.\nMarion McCourt: And I\u2019ll add just you mentioned size of the population, the \u2013 this is a rare condition and in the U.S., there is a population of patients about 1,300 who would be eligible candidates, but we feel we would have an opportunity to help very significantly with this rare and challenging disease, ex-U.S. it\u2019s about 1,700.\nJustin Holko: I think we have time for one more question, Stephanie.\nOperator: Thank you. Your final question will come from the line of Evan Seigerman with Credit Suisse.\nEvan Seigerman: Thanks for squeezing me in at the end. Looking at that antibody data in September would that be assuming it\u2019s positive, is that enough to get an EUA from the FDA and if not, what else you need to generate and when could we see that data? Thank you.\nLeonard Schleifer: Well, it will all depend on the data and how good it looks. So, there is so many variables that I think it\u2019s really impossible to give a fair answer to that question.\nEvan Seigerman: Okay. Thanks.\nJustin Holko: Thanks, Evan. Thanks for everybody dialing in. This concludes our call. Bob Landry and the IR team will be available after the call to answer further questions. Stay well and safe everyone. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Marion McCourt",
            "content": "Thank you, George Our second quarter business performance reflects the resilience and competitive strength of our core brands: EYLEA, DUPIXENT and Libtayo. We remain confident in our ability to navigate through COVID-19 and position our portfolio for future growth as demand recovers. I am going to begin with EYLEA, which had $1.75 billion in global net sales. In the U.S., EYLEA net sales were $1.11 billion, which is just 4% lower than the same quarter last year despite the impact of COVID-19. EYLEA outperformed the overall anti-VEGF market in the U.S. with continued share gains from both branded and unbranded competition. In fact, EYLEA's share of the branded U.S. market reached 73% of net sales for the quarter solidifying our leadership position in the anti-VEGF market. The impact of COVID-19 on U.S. sales was sold predominantly in April after the sales improved throughout May and into June as retina specialists reopened the offices and patient volume increased. The combination of three EYLEA attributes differentiated efficacy, safety and dosing flexibility are highly valuable in easing physician and patient burdens caused by the pandemic. Physicians may treat with extended dosing of up to 12 weeks in appropriate patients and the recently launched pre-filled syringe offers additional efficiencies for patient care. EYLEA demand continues to show steady improvement and the volume of new patients in the market is approaching pre-pandemic levels. We are closely monitoring the recent resurgence of COVID-19. Under all scenarios, we remain highly committed to supporting the retina community through virtual and in-person platforms to ensure the continuity of patient care. In summary, we are encouraged by the rebound in EYLEA demand in recent months and we will continue to advance efforts to support our customers and their patients during these unprecedented times. Turning next to Libtayo, second quarter global net sales grew to $80 million, with the U.S. contributing $63 million. In April, patient office visits declined and some infusion centers temporarily closed. This briefly impacted Libtayo demand, which rebounded during May and June. In the U.S., Libtayo advanced its leadership as the number one systemic treatment for advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC. Libtayo has experienced rapid growth in advanced CSCC, with 70% of patients now treated with anti-PD1 therapy. We expect future growth as Libtayo as new Libtayo competitive profile strengthens with new long-term data demonstrating longer durability, higher overall responses and nearly 3x the rate of complete responses based on additional years of follow-up. Looking ahead, we are preparing for potential future launches with our collaborator Sanofi in both non-small-cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma. Both represent meaningful growth opportunities for Libtayo. The anti-PD1 and PDL-1 market continues to grow at a significant pace with current annual med sales of nearly $25 billion. Non-small cell lung cancer is the largest opportunity within this market, with more than 200,000 new diagnoses of lung cancer in the U.S. each year. Patients, payers and physicians' preferred choice in determining the most appropriate treatment and should Libtayo be approved, it has demonstrated very competitive clinical results to-date in the advanced PD-1 positive patient population studied. Finally, moving to DUPIXENT, global net sales in the second quarter were $945 million, representing 70% growth compared to the prior year. In the U.S. broad-based growth across all approved indications contributed net sales of $770 million. Following an initial dip in mid-May, new patient starts have increased as physician offices reopened. Current weekly new patient starts have recovered to approximately 87% of pre-pandemic levels, a sign of robust demand for DUPIXENT. DUPIXENT's compelling clinical profile enables the product to thrive even in the current environment. DUPIXENT is administered at home and does not require laboratory testing or monitoring to initiate most new patients. Importantly, DUPIXENT is not an immunosuppressant and we expect the U.S. launch of the 300-milligram pre-filled pen in the third quarter, providing additional patient convenience and choice. Atopic dermatitis is DUPIXENT's largest indication and remains a significant growth driver. We continue to expand physician prescribing across both moderate and severe disease. To-date, only a small percentage of biologic eligible patients, have been treated, leaving substantial opportunity for more patients to benefit. Additionally, new long-term data demonstrate sustained efficacy over a 3-year period along with confirmed safety. We also continue to expand into younger populations. The U.S. FDA recently approved DUPIXENT to treat children aged 6 to 11 used with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, which impacts approximately 90,000 children in this country. DUPIXENT is the only biologic medicine approved for this population and leading launch indicators are very encouraging. Many children suffering with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis are being treated by the same physicians who have extensive clinical experience with their adolescent and adult patients and have great confidence in the DUPIXENT safety profile. DUPIXENT also continues to outperform in asthma as measured by more new patient initiations over the last year compared to other biologic competitors. We see further opportunities to expand patient awareness of DUPIXENT and our national DTC campaign, which is underway. Among those already on treatment COVID-19 has limited impact as patients adhere to their therapies to maintain and improve respiratory function. Finally, we see strong uptake in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Since approval last year, patients have been initiated on DUPIXENT regardless of prior surgery. Demand has increased among ENTs and allergists with the limited availability of elective surgeries in the last quarter. Overall, we see great opportunity for DUPIXENT which is positioned for significant growth through expanded indications, age groups and geographies. In closing, our teams and business remain resilient as we execute on our strategy to deliver value for customers and stakeholders. Now, I will turn the call to Bob. Sure, very happy to. Terence, thank you for the question. We are really excited about the opportunity in China and I will also remind that Sanofi has the responsibility for China. I am very encouraged by the progress to-date. And as it relates to specifics on reimbursement, I would guide asking our Sanofi colleagues to describe that in more detail, but as you know, tremendous market opportunity, incredible unmet need and a remarkable clinical profile and we are really excited about the opportunity. Sure. So this is still relatively early in the launch for Libtayo. The team has done a great job of establishing Libtayo for these patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease with the alternative of Libtayo. But certainly there is significant opportunity to expand our utilization. And, obviously, as you mentioned, as we potentially get into future indications even more volatile And I'll add just you mentioned size of the population, the \u2013 this is a rare condition and in the U.S., there is a population of patients about 1,300 who would be eligible candidates, but we feel we would have an opportunity to help very significantly with this rare and challenging disease, ex-U.S. it's about 1,700."

            "content": "Thank you, Justin and thanks to everyone for joining the call. I hope all of you are staying safe and well. We very much appreciate your efforts to join given the pandemic conditions and even on top of that northeast some power disruption from the storm, but business continues. We had an eventful and productive second quarter in terms of financial results, business development and corporate accomplishments. In the second quarter, our results demonstrated resilience and strength despite the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to driving double-digit top and bottom line growth, we continue to deliver meaningful advances in our broad and innovative pipeline as well as in our fight against COVID-19 with our novel antibody cocktail. Regeneron continues to execute well in this unprecedented time for our company and our nation in the world. Starting with our products, EYLEA global net product sales were $1.75 billion in the second quarter, a modest decline of 6% compared to the prior year. In the U.S., we generated sales of $1.11 billion, with a pronounced and sustained rebound in demand in May and June, following the decline in sales we experienced in early April. This rebound has continued into July and demand is now approaching pre-COVID levels. The efficacy, safety and convenience of EYLEA have proven to be even more viable in the world of COVID-19. As you will hear for Marion, EYLEA outperformed the broader anti-VEGF class this quarter. Demand for DUPIXENT also proved to be robust in the second quarter, with global sales growth of 70% compared to last year. Sales were nearly $1 billion on continued market penetration in atopic dermatitis, asthma and new launches. Adding to the DUPIXENT momentum, the FDA approved a new indication for atopic dermatitis in children aged 6 to 11. Furthermore, we demonstrated dramatic results in eosinophilic esophagitis, where patients reported a nearly 70% reduction in symptoms further exemplifying the potential of DUPIXENT to bend the arc of certain Type 2 inflammatory diseases. We look forward to additional DUPIXENT milestones, including an upcoming Phase 3 readout in pediatric asthma and enrollment of a second Phase 3 study in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We and our patients and customers have a tremendous amount of enthusiasm for this product and we are still in the early days of unlocking its full potential with our partner, Sanofi. In oncology, Libtayo is the leading systemic treatment for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. We are seeking approvals in basal cell carcinoma and non-small-cell lung cancer with regulatory filings to be submitted imminently. With our chemotherapy combination study in non-small-cell lung cancer nearing full enrollment, our excitement for Libtayo continues to grow. Beyond Libtayo, we are broadening and advancing our biospecifics portfolio, generating further momentum for our ontology strategy. Turning to our efforts to fight COVID-19, we are advancing the development of a novel antibody cocktail known as REGN-COV2 that may both treat and prevent infection from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We are now in Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials and hope to generate initial data by the end of September as George will discuss in further detail. We also signed two major agreements in recent weeks. We announced a $450 million agreement with BARDA and the U.S. Department of Defense to manufacture REGN-COV2. We also signed a 6-year $345 million agreement with BARDA for our novel Ebola antibody cocktail, further demonstrating the potential of our end-to-end technologies to deliver shareholder value in addressing infectious disease threats. Finally, on the corporate front, we contemplate \u2013 excuse me, we completed a large secondary offering of more than 13 million shares of our common stock held by Sanofi. Using our strong balance sheet, we also repurchased $5 billion or 9.8 million shares from Sanofi, effectively eliminating their ownership position in our company and demonstrating our confidence in the trajectory of our business. For Regeneron shareholders, this transaction provided immediate accretion and removed a significant overhang related to the exploration of Sanofi's lockup period at the end of this year. Regeneron is a business that is indeed firing on all cylinders. We thank all of our colleagues across the company who have been working with resolve and resilience in these extraordinary times of the pandemic. Our strong business performance, cash flow, balance sheet and advancement of the next generation of innovations for important medical needs, has us positioned to weather COVID-19 and emerge from the pandemic to drive continued long-term growth. Now, I will turn the call over to George. Terence, hi, it's Len. I don't think we can comment on our COGS, but Marion can certainly comment on China. So, I will take the first part but George you can take the latter in terms of the data we really have not guided it depends on we are sort of trying to do things in parallel get some Phase 2 data while we are enrolling the Phase 3. So we will just have to see how that comes how that comes along George can comment on the difficulties of biopolymer work. Yes. I just might add that we are not sure there is any evidence that there is a dose dependent effect on inflammation at least with the high-quality EYLEA that we make. So I am not sure that's necessarily going to be the case. Yes, Robyn, I just wanted to mention, glad to see you have got a new name there, Truist, sounds good. I don't know if it's the truest, we like to think Regeneron is the truest. But in anyway, the notion of whether the risk benefit is going to work, as George pointed out, I mean, to some extent, we are sort of behind the alliance of Lilly and Pfizer in this class and they have announced I think that their action date is December, they have recently said there is not going to be an advisory panel. So, we will get to see as we are preparing our file in collecting that's why they will get to see how the FDA views all of this and what constraints or restraints they might put or if they will or they won't approve it.

            "content": "Thank you, Marion. For the second quarter of 2020, Regeneron delivered strong results on both the top and bottom line. Our continued ability to generate this year-over-year growth is an encouraging signal of our diversified growth potential now and beyond COVID-19. For the second quarter, total revenues grew 24% year-over-year to $1.95 billion driven by higher Sanofi collaboration revenues as a result of increasing for DUPIXENT sales. Additionally, we recorded significant revenues associated with our infectious disease efforts against both Ebola and COVID-19. These revenues are recorded in our other revenue line. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share grew 19% year-over-year to $7.16 on non-GAAP net income of $854 million. Since Marion discussed our U.S. EYLEA results, I will start with our Bayer and Sanofi collaborations. Starting with the Bayer collaboration, ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales, which are reported to us by Bayer were $641 million, representing a decline of 10% on a reported basis compared to the prior year due to the COVID-19 impact. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $244 million, of which we recorded $231 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $269 million in the second quarter. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of non-IO antibodies was $172 million. This compares favorably to profits of $39 million in the prior year period, which was driven by higher DUPIXENT profits. Before moving to expenses, I will discuss our second quarter 2020 other revenue line item, in which we recorded $212 million, up sharply from the $20 million in the prior year period. The primary driver of the year-over-year increase is the recognition of $126 million associated with BARDA for our research and manufacturing efforts for both Ebola and COVID-19. We record R&D reimbursements from BARDA in other revenues. Moving to our expense base and starting with R&D, non GAAP R&D increased 36% year-over-year to $580 million driven by significant development costs for both our antibody cocktail and KEVZARA clinical trials for COVID-19, in addition to higher headcount and increased clinical manufacturing activities, a portion of which were reimbursed by BARDA. Next, non-GAAP SG&A expense increased 19% year-over-year to $301 million. The year-over-year increase was driven by the inclusion of PRALUENT commercialization costs in the U.S., higher contributions to non-profit patient assistance organizations and higher headcount related costs. Non-GAAP cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing was $173 million compared to $79 million in the second quarter of 2019. The year-over-year increase is due to manufacturing cost associated with higher DUPIXENT volumes sold by Sanofi, Ebola production and PRALUENT supply for Sanofi's ex-U.S. markets. Turning now to taxes, the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 0.9% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to 19.1% in the second quarter of 2019. The lower tax rate versus last year was primarily due to increased tax benefits associated with stock option exercises in the realization of those benefits earlier in the calendar year compared to prior years. Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. Year-to-date, Regeneron generated $1.34 billion in free cash flow. In the quarter, we spent $5 billion to repurchase approximately 9.8 million shares of our common stock as part of Sanofi's sale of substantially all of their equity stake in Regeneron. As Len mentioned, the secondary offering in repurchase were strategic transactions that provided Regeneron's shareholders immediate accretion, removed uncertainty regarding Sanofi's equity position and is a testament to our confidence in the strength of our business now and in the future. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $5.7 billion and $1.5 billion in debt financing under a bridge loan related to the Sanofi stake repurchase. Now, I would like to spend a few moments to discuss the financial outlook for the remainder of the year. We maintained or lowered the midpoint of our guidance on several expense items. Please refer to our press release and financial disclosures for entire updated 2020 guidance. Here I will discuss the guidance items related to our increased efforts in the fight against COVID-19 as we leverage our end-to-end capabilities of drug discovery development and manufacturing. We are updating our forecasted 2020 non-GAAP R&D expenses to be in the range of $2.27 billion to $2.37 billion. For COGS, we are raising our forecast for 2020 non-GAAP expenses to be in the range of $435 million to $485 million. The increase in both R&D and cost of goods sold guidance are related primarily to our efforts against COVID-19. For R&D, we anticipate that more than half of the increase to our 2020 R&D guidance will be reimbursed for COVID-19 efforts. Those reimbursements will continue to be recorded in other revenue. We are also providing updated guidance for our tax rate. We anticipate our updated 2020 non-GAAP effective tax guidance to be in the range of 10% to 12%. In conclusion, Regeneron's business remains healthy and we continue to deliver strong year-over-year growth despite the global impact of COVID-19. Our strong balance sheet, improved competitive outlook, increasingly diversified commercial portfolio and robust pipeline positioned Regeneron very well for sustained long-term growth. Now with that, I would like to turn the call back to Justin."

            "name": "George Yancopoulos",
            "content": "Thank you, Len. And with all of us still in the throes of the COVID-19 epidemic, I will start with an update on our antiviral antibody cocktail that has the potential to both possibly protect against infection and also treat those already infected. Based on our Ebola program, our new non-human primary data for our COVID-19 cocktail as well as our understanding of immune response, we believe that our COVID-19 treatment is well positioned to help patients prior to and early in infection. We initiated our clinical program in June, barely 5 months after we started this treatment, developing this treatment. Our rapid timeline was possible due to our VelociSuite technologies, which were developed in-house over decades to allow for specific turnkey disease interventions and were recently applied to develop a similar approach against Ebola, which we hope will prove to be the first treatment approved for this disease with a PDUFA date in October. We are conducting 4 trials of Regeneron COV2, our antibody cocktail: one in hospitalized COVID-19 patients; a second, ambulatory study in outpatients who are diagnosed with COVID-19; a third, preventative study in household contacts with COVID-19 patients being carried out in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease; and a fourth, multi-dose, healthy volunteer study. Our studies are adaptive in nature as we learn more about the virus and our antibody cocktail and other studies are being planned as well. All of these studies have passed several safety assessments with no safety concerns observed to-date. Despite the challenging environment, in which these studies are being conducted, we are targeting to report initial virology and biomarker data from the treatment studies by the end of September with clinical outcome data to follow as enrollment progresses. In June, we have published two important papers in science on our antibody cocktail, in which we described the details of how the two antibodies in our cocktail block the coronavirus spike protein, and importantly, highlighted the significance of using the antibody cocktail versus single antibody approach. We showed that the cocktail approach avoided viral escape due to viral mutation, which rapidly occur when using single antibody approaches. In addition, we have recently generated important data in non-human primates, which has been both posted on bio-archives. These studies showed that in this setting, our antibody cocktail can not only effectively prevent infection primates matching or exceeding recently published prevention data achieved with vaccine approaches, but also that our cocktail can treat those already infected by accelerating viral elimination. I next want to highlight the outside support we have received for our strategy in addition to conducting our Phase 3 prevention study in collaboration with the NIAID, which substantively expands our reach to investigate our cocktail in the preventative setting. We recently signed a manufacturing contract with BARDA as part of Operation Warp Speed to make initial lives of our cocktail at risk so that the drug could be available as soon as possible, if proven efficacious and approved by the FDA. While we are all hoping that vaccines prove successful and we ourselves are partnering on some novel second generation vaccine approaches, we believe that our neutralizing antibody cocktail could play an important role as a rapid first line in defense, in those for whom the vaccine is not available and in the long-term could also provide protection for those least likely to respond well to a vaccine, such as the elderly and immunocompromised. Moreover, unlike the vaccine and as supported by our initial primate studies, our cocktail may not only prevent infection, but could also have the potential to treat those already infected. Moving on to our efforts outside of COVID-19 and starting with DUPIXENT, the demonstrated safety and efficacy of DUPIXENT are further bolstered by the recent FDA approval in children with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, children as young as 6 years old. We are not stopping there as we are conducting a study in even younger atopic dermatitis patients. And for children with asthma, we plan to submit a BLA supplement for approval in pediatric asthma by the end of the year, pending upcoming Phase 3 data. We are also enhancing convenience for all patients with the recent FDA approval of our 300 milligram auto-injector. Outside of the United States, DUPIXENT was approved in China recently, which represents a major milestone as we work to ensure patients everywhere have access to this life changing medicine. Our DUPIXENT clinical program continues to deliver positive results in additional Type 2 inflammatory indications. In May, we announced that we met the primary and key secondary endpoints in Part A as our pivotal trial in the eosinophilic esophagitis. Patients treated with DUPIXENT demonstrated significant clinical and anatomic improvements, with almost a 70% reduction in disease symptoms compared to an approximately 30% reduction for patients on placebo as demonstrated by the Dysphasia Symptom Questionnaire. We are currently enrolling Part B of this trial and communicating with regulators about filing requirements for this indication. In addition, the first pivotal DUPIXENT trial in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease typified by Type 2 inflammation or Type 2 COPD completed a pre-specified analysis by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee requiring a certain threshold reduction in exacerbations, which was met and thus triggered opening a second pivotal trial for this potential indication. Approval in Type 2 COPD would unlock another important opportunity for depiction to help patients with Type 2 inflammatory disease, who currently have limited options. Moving on to our oncology portfolio and starting with our PD-1 antibody, Libtayo. At the virtual ASCO meeting, we presented a clinically meaningful cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma data follow-up, followed by a label update as well. As reported at ASCO, was up to 3 years of follow-up, while the overall response rates remain stable approaching 50%, the complete response rates have climbed to 20% in metastatic CSCC increasing from the 7% rate reported in the initial preliminary analysis, providing one of the most dramatic examples of ongoing and prolonged benefit from an immunotherapy treatment. Moreover, this data firmly established Libtayo as first-in-class for this dermato-oncology cancer setting with compelling long-term clinical data. In addition last quarter, we announced positive first-in-class data for a second dermato-oncology indication that is basal cell carcinoma, which we will be submitting for regulatory review. Finally, we are excited about the opportunity for Libtayo in non-small cell lung cancer based on our recent positive Phase 3 trial with Libtayo as monotherapy in PD-L1 high patients, which we will also be submitting for regulatory view. And we have completed screening patients for enrollment in our follow-on chemo combination study in lung cancer. Libtayo is foundational to our oncology strategy and we are making significant progress with Libtayo in skin cancers, lung cancers and our numerous combination and collaborative studies. Our CD-3 bispecific clinical program is moving forward despite operational challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Regeneron 1979, our CD20xCD3 bispecifics has shown robust efficacy in both follicular lymphoma and more aggressive disease, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Our potentially pivotal Phase 2 study continues to enroll globally and we are having productive discussions with regulators to expand the registrational program with combinations and in earlier lines of treatment. We are preparing to explore novel combinations, including a combination from novel class of costimulatory bispecifics, that is one targeting B-cell specifically. We recently published a second major paper featured on the cover of Science Translational Medicine in June describing how these co-stimulatory bispecifics can synergize, not only with CD3 bispecifics, but also with PD-1 blockers. By the way, we are actively working on subcutaneous delivery of this potentially important drug candidate. Our BCMA by CD3 bispecific is moving forward and we are planning to initiate potentially pivotal studies in various multiple myeloma settings. Moreover, we intend to explore standard novel combinations, including with a co-stimulatory bispecific targeting plasma cells. We expect to provide updates for both our CD20 and BCMA programs at ASH later this year. I would like to expand a bit on our co-stimulatory bispecific effort as it represents an important example of the ongoing innovation in oncology for Regeneron. As I said, we are planning on combining such costims with both our CD20 and BCMA bi-spec programs for lymphoma and myeloma. But our first co-stimulatory bispecific is already in clinical development. This first-in-humans co-stim PSMAxCD28 is in combination with Libtayo for prostate cancer and is continuing to enroll in the dose escalation stage of clinical investigation. We are also excited about two additional co-stim bispecifics scheduled to enter the clinic this year. These new co-stim trials include EGFRxCD28 in combination with Libtayo, which will be explored in several solid tumors, including lung cancer and head and neck cancer as well as MUC16xCD28, which will be tested for patients with ovarian cancer as well as in other settings. Our MUC16 co-stim will be studied in combination with either Libtayo or MUC16xCD3 bispecific, which is already in clinic. The span of our toolkit enables us to explore these and many new combinations that based on preclinical evidence could provide meaningful advances for a wide variety of cancer patients. Moving on from oncology, I would like to provide an update on our fasinumab program. We have previously announced positive top line efficacy data in a fasinumab Phase 3 FACT long-term safety study, or FACT LTS substudy. And today we are announcing that two additional Phase 3 studies in patients with osteoarthritis pain, FACT OA1 and FACT OA2 met the co-primary efficacy endpoints for the fasinumab 1 milligram monthly dose versus placebo. The fasinumab 1 milligram monthly dose also showed nominally significant benefits in physical functions in both trials and pain in one of the two trials when compared to the maximum FDA approved doses of NSAIDs for osteoarthritis. The less frequent dose of fasinumab 1 milligram every 2 months used in an arm of the FACT OA1 trial showed numerical benefit over placebo, but did not achieve statistical significance. In the initial safety analysis from the Phase 3 trials, there is an increase in arthropathies reported with fasinumab. In the FACT LTS substudy, there was increase in joint replacements with fasinumab 1 milligram monthly treatment, during the off-drug follow-up period. Although this increase was not seen in the other trials to-date, additional longer term safety data from the ongoing trials is being collected and is expected to be reported early next year. Finally, I would like to briefly address other exciting developments in our pipeline. We are planning to publish evinacumab results in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia shortly and we have submitted our applications to the FDA and to EMA. Regarding our garetosmab program for fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP, we are planning to submit data to regulatory authorities in the first quarter of next year pending results from the crossover arm of our trial, where placebo patients are now receiving active drug. Our hope is to replicate the dramatic 90% reduction in new lesion formation that we saw in the first part of the trial. At the European Hematology Association Meeting in June, we presented promising pozelimab monotherapy interim results in paroxysmal, nocturnal, hematoglobinuria patients. We are hoping to start to start testing a combination with Alnylam's RNAi treatment, cemdisiran, by year end. And last but certainly not least, we are starting to enrol our Phase 3 study of the high dose EYLEA in DME and wet AMD. High-dose EYLEA has the potential to reduce dosing frequency, while maintaining the efficacy and safety of our medicine that is trusted by doctors and patients worldwide. To conclude, our broad and diverse pipelines is growing and progressing even in this COVID 19 environment, I could not be prouder that even in these extraordinary and challenging times, our people are continuing to push on every front in our efforts to bring important new treatments to the patients who need them. I now turn over the call to Marion. Yes. We have modeled the doses in the blood levels from the primate studies in order to design our human studies. And so we are hoping and targeting to achieve similar blood levels in the humans as we are achieving to achieve the relative efficacies in the primate studies. At those levels, we are at the production level that we could be delivering hundreds of thousands of doses per month for the prophylactic dose level and tens of thousands of doses per month for the treatment levels assuming that in that those sorts of ranges that we are predicting right now but of course all that is all pending the trials and seeing what doses really work hopefully some of the doses work and so forth. So there's still a lot to figure out that those are the levels that we are targeting and those are the numbers of doses that we are anticipating that we could deliver depending on how all the clinical trials work out. Well there is a lot of questions sort of in there so one in terms of engineering our antibodies, historically, we've had very good success with achieving very good half lives and duration and durability without making modifications which as always come with certain risks so at least for our first generation antibodies based on the historical success were going with unmodified antibodies in terms of the concerns for antibody dependant enhancement we have done extensive studies and efforts on that including with antibodies that we have or have not modified effector function. And based on all of our data and all of our results we are going forward with antibodies once again that are not modified based on the confidence in the data that we have generated with our preclinical experience and finally what was the last question. The prevention study, yes, so some of those patients who have only been exposed that there will be ongoing exposure as well. So it is going to be both a pre and a post exposure prophylaxis effort and we will be characterising whether the patient in the household that we are treating have already been exposed in terms of whether already infected or not in our analysis. Right. So we have been investing enormously in efforts with biopolymer extension and so forth. And as we all know and as has been demonstrated recently with the problems of a major competitor, EYLEA sets a very high bar for safety and for efficacy and particularly from a safety point of view. And in all of our efforts, we have not been satisfied with our biopolymer efforts that those modifications meet that high bar, particularly for safety. And so we have been hesitant to move those programs further into the clinic, because of the concerns that we found with those approaches when we compare them and test them in our preclinical settings. In terms of the high dose EYLEA, we are hoping that we will be able to maintain that safety \u2013 the high safety bar with a high dose area, but to extend the dosing as you know, right now, studies show that depending on the patients, about 50% of the patients can go to T-12 dosing using the current dose of EYLEA. And what we are hoping is that we maybe able to increase the percentage of those patients who can go to longer term dosing using this higher dose, but to achieve that in as safe manner as we have historically with EYLEA to-date. So that's the basis of our strategy. Well, I think the biggest concern is obviously having to do with the benefit risk and the safety profile. Obviously, there is enormous need for alternatives in the pain field and there are so many tens of millions of people who are living with osteoarthritis pain with limited options and concerns about all the available medications, with all the concerns and problems with opioids in particular, but also with NSAIDs and so forth. All of these patients are potential candidates for the NGF inhibitors. So, we are still awaiting and needing to readout additional safety data from our program. And I think it's going to still be determined in terms of the relative benefit risk as to how important a drug this can be for the so many patients who are in need here. And of course, ultimately as we tried to highlight it is a little disappointing, how the PD1 class has not had as dramatic efficacy as one would have wanted in so many other cancer settings. And that's why we have our very exciting and innovative collection of by specifics and other combination opportunities. But now that we have our own PD1 as a foundational component, we can now be trying to increase and add efficacy in all these other cancer settings where right now the PD1 class is not really shown as much benefit as one would want, but maybe we can now really create enormous benefit in the sales by making the right combinations, particularly with our bispecifics, but with other combination opportunities as well. These are all the great questions, and in fact we are analyze our own data exactly with regards to some of the points and concerns that you have we are measuring among the biomarkers, we're measuring patients' endogenous response to their antibody titers, and we are comparing and dividing the patients based on their baseline levels of antibody titers to see whether the patients who respond the best are the people who are now mounting are too early in the course of their disease. And we have this adaptive design, we are going to continue to generate data and evaluate data. We will hopefully be reporting some of that data publicly, but then using that data to make decisions in terms of the adaptive future portions of our design. Yes, I am not sure that the earlier biologics, that you are referring to demonstrated much different data in your Phase 2 and Phase 3 programs and the problems were was that at best they were demonstrating somewhere around a 15% reduction in their exacerbations and depending on the Phase 3 studies Those were on the border of achieving clinical significance. And that's why those programs didn't move forward. So, we did not release the details of the bar that we set. But we did say that the bar that we set had to do with exacerbations and we have to achieve a minimum threshold reduction in exacerbations in order to trigger going forward and triggering the initiation of an additional phase III. So obviously, the fact that we met a threshold bar for reduction in exacerbations, I think creates some excitement, that assuming that we can continue to achieve these sorts of reductions in exacerbations that this could be an important drug for COPD. And the bar was for reduction in exacerbations. I think that you got it. This is ANGPTL3 you said evinacumab was a little hard to hear. Yes. But, I think I got it. This is a very important proof of concept setting these are if we get approved as you say it's for homozygous FH, it's for a very rare genetic population. And particularly, what we showed was efficacy in patients who have no LDL receptor function. So that means that this drug in this pathway work totally different than all other drugs at lower lipids and cholesterol and it may have important growth opportunities after this in the sense that since it is lowering lipids, not only cholesterol but triglycerides, by these independent mechanisms, it is entirely possible and we are thinking about it about where there is a broader opportunity eventually, for this class of drugs. But we are also very excited about the near term opportunity that we hope we are going to get agreement from the FDA shortly in the homozygous FH population, particularly those who don't respond to any of the existing drugs."

Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions.With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer Dr. Len Schleifer. Len?\nLeonard Schleifer: Thank you, Justin. And thank you to everyone for joining the call. I hope all of you are staying safe and well during this difficult time. We're living in a new reality, the reality of COVID-19. I am incredibly proud of the leadership role Regeneron is taking in the fight against COVID-19.Clearly, this pandemic is unprecedented in our lifetime, for our company, our country and the world and the world economies. Regeneron has spent decades and billions of dollars developing proprietary technologies that have created medical breakthroughs, such as Dupixent and our novel antibody cocktail for Ebola, which is now under FDA review.These same technologies are now well purposed for finding a treatment against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We are making rapid progress and scaling up supply of our novel antibody cocktail, which we expect to be in clinical trials this June. We are optimistic about this approach, which George will describe in greater detail.Also we are working swiftly with our collaborator Sanofi to find a definitive answer on whether there is a role for Kevzara in helping to alleviate the devastating inflammation that affects patients who are critically afflicted with this virus. We are grateful for the tremendous partnership across industries, governments and agencies such as the FDA and BARDA, as we unite in the common cause to eradicate this disease.Beyond our therapeutic efforts we continue to respond to other urgent COVID-related needs. We recently produced and donated viral transport media to New York State for use in 500,000 test kits and have provided financial support to non-profits at the heart of the pandemic response, in New York and beyond.Furthermore, we are sensitive to the rapidly evolving marketplace and working with customers to ensure that patients are able to receive the treatments they need to preserve vision, as well as to treat inflammatory conditions, cancer and other ailments that persist despite the realities of social distancing.Turning to some brief commentary on the first quarter, where we delivered another strong performance. In the quarter, negative impacts from COVID-19 were minimal. Our core brands EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo drove significant top and bottom line growth, based on demand, while we invested in and advanced our innovative pipeline.In this quarter EYLEA global net product sales grew 6% to $1.85 billion, including U.S. EYLEA net sales growth of 9% to $1.17 billion. In the last two weeks of March and early April, overall demand and new patient starts were softer due to COVID-19. However, we are encouraged by the rebound in demand in the most recent weeks. Marion will give you more color on this.First quarter Dupixent sales more than doubled compared to last year and are now annualizing at more than $3.4 billion on continued market penetration and new launches in multiple disease settings. While there are early signs of impacts on new patient starts, we expect continued resilience for Dupixent during this COVID-19 period, given the profound efficacy and safety profile.With an anticipated regulatory action in pediatric atopic dermatitis later this month and other data readouts in 2020 and initiation of new Phase III trials assessing Dupixent in several other type two inflammatory diseases, this exceptional medicine continues to be positioned for long-term growth. Importantly Dupixent is driving continued diversification of our earnings base and enhancing our strong current and long-term financial position.We also announced recently that we have completed the restructuring of our agreement with Sanofi on Praluent which will lead to immediate accretion and further strengthen our overall portfolio.2020 has brought urgent new priorities. Even though, we are experiencing impacts to trial enrollment and new study starts we remain on track for several significant clinical milestones particularly in oncology. Recently, we announced that our first-line clinical trial in lung cancer assessing Libtayo was stopped early on an interim analysis due to superior overall survival versus chemotherapy. We will look to submit these data to regulators as soon as possible. We also intend to submit data for the Type one basal cell carcinoma and expect new data from our bispecifics program later this year. Additionally, the long-awaited Phase3 readout from fasinumab our anti nerve growth factor program for osteoarthritis pain will occur in the coming months.Before handing the call over to George, I want to share the immense pride and gratitude we have for our people working hard at Regeneron during this time. Even in the current environment our entire business is operating as our people drive important work forward that is essential to our mission to patients and to near and long-term value creation for shareholders.Our ability to do this rests on the talent and strength of our workforce, which in spite of COVID-related disruption maintains incredible commitment focus and effort to advance the breadth of Regeneron's work. They are the foundations for moving forward, our mission in normal times and especially now. We are optimistic that Regeneron and our society will prevail through these unprecedented times and we will work tirelessly to that end.Now, I'll turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len. And since the devastating COVID-19 crisis is foremost on everyone's mind I will first discuss our efforts in this area. As you all know, our state of the art and proprietary VelociSuite technologies, which we have built over the last few decades. It can be very powerful for responding to new targets and pathogens, as we recently proved by rapidly creating an antiviral antibody cocktail as an effective treatment for Ebola.Recall, the FDA recently granted priority review to this treatment for Ebola with the target action date of October 25, 2020 based on the results of the Phase 3 PALM clinical trial conducted in the Congo, which was stopped early because of our Regeneron EB3 antibody cocktail proving superior and preventing death compared to the previous standard of care the so-called ZMapp antibody as well as to Remdesivir.In terms of COVID-19, while society is awaiting an effective vaccine that could still be a year or two away, we are employing a two-pronged approach that could serve as a useful bridge and/or as an alternative to a vaccine. First and most importantly, we are developing a novel antiviral antibody cocktail just as we did for Ebola. We have already announced that we have utilized our VelociSuite technologies to rapidly generate and select thousands of potent antiviral fully human antibodies from both our genetically humanized Velocimmune mice as well as from convalescencing human volunteers, creating what we believe is the largest and deepest collection of potent antiviral antibodies to choose from.We have selected two distinct antibody cocktails from this collection, our initial cocktail as well as the backup. And we have already begun large-scale manufacturing and anticipate initiating clinical trials with elite cocktail in June. With Ebola, we set the record of nine months from initiating the project to starting human trials. Now, we hope to break that record with five months from project initiation to the clinic. Based on our experience with the Ebola and other viruses, we hope that this specifically designed antiviral approach has a significant chance for success in providing both a prophylactic treatment to prevent infection in those at risk as well as for treating those already infected and symptomatic.Our second major COVID-19 approach involves repurposing KEVZARA our anti IL-6 receptor antibody approved in rheumatoid arthritis. Based on a small uncontrolled case series from China, there was reason to believe that blocking the IL-6 pathway might address the underlying inflammation leading to acute respiratory distress in so-called severe COVID-19 patients meaning hospitalized patients needing oxygen support, but not on ventilators as opposed to so-called critical patients, who largely require ventilators.We initiated an adaptive Phase 2/3 trial to explore KEVZARA in both the severe and critical patient populations. Our initial data from both the Phase 2 and Phase 3 portion of the trial indicated that KEVZARA at least at the doses tested which paralleled those used in the China reports did not provide a major benefit for severe patients.On the other hand the Phase 2 portion of the trial suggested a potential benefit in critical patients. And the Phase 3 trial in this group is ongoing. Additional efforts, both in our program and by our Sanofi partners in Europe, and the rest of the world are further testing both of these populations, including at higher doses. Our results and efforts with KEVZARA highlight the challenges with using repurposed drugs, the inability to rely on uncontrolled and even small controlled trials and thus the importance of running large well controlled Phase 3 studies to obtain real answers as to whether a drug has benefit and the quantitative extent of that benefit even in a pandemic setting.It is important to point out that our efforts with COVID-19 are being developed under an ongoing collaboration with BARDA, a division within the U. S. Department of Health and Human services and also involve incredibly collaborative relationships with so many critical partners from the FDA to the leadership of New York State to the many hospitals and physicians at the front lines, who make the effort to engage in these trials and the many stricken patients who volunteer to participate.I also want to thank all the individuals at Regeneron who have continued to work tirelessly on these programs despite all the logistical and operational and health challenges created by the COVID-19 crisis.Moving on from COVID-19, I first want to touch upon our EYLEA programs. Physicians consider safety to be essential in selecting anti-VEGF treatment. Over the last several months, another recently approved anti-VEGF product was recently associated with the serious new vision-threatening safety concern involving occlusive retinal vasculitis in the context of intraocular inflammation.In light of the frequency and serious nature of the safety concern, Regeneron and our partner Bayer conducted a broad review of our clinical trial database as well as our post-marketing global safety database to identify any similar safety events with EYLEA.In the critical trial database from eight Phase III trials involving tens of thousands of injections, there was no reports consistent with the safety concern. Moreover in the extensive post-marketing experience involving more than 32 million doses of EYLEA sold in more than 100 countries worldwide since its approval more than eight years ago, the rate of any possibly related safety event was less than one out of every 6 million EYLEA doses sold.And such cases were always associated with presumed infectious Endophthalmitis. Thus based on our reviews of the EYLEA clinical trial database and post-marketing surveillance occlusive retinal vasculitis in the context of intraocular inflammation does not appear to be a safety concern with the use of EYLEA.Next, I want to discuss DUPIXENT. Later this month, we anticipate an FDA decision extending DUPIXENT approval to six to 11-year old children suffering from atopic dermatitis. DUPIXENT would be the first biological indicator for this pediatric population.We hope this potential approval will continue to reflect the remarkable safety profile of DUPIXENT as evidenced by the absence of a black box warning or any associated serious infection risks which are often seen with immunomodulatory biologics and with JAK inhibitors.We also expect FDA action on our 300-milligram auto-injector which would allow for an additional dimension of convenience to an already strong profile for the medicine. Additionally, later this year, we anticipate data from our Phase III pediatric asthma trial the Phase II portion of our eosinophilic esophagitis program and we remind you that we have pivotal studies in chronic spontaneous urticarial, prurigo nodularis, and bullous pemphigoid, as well as studies in oral immunotherapy with our collaborator Aimmune.We continue to build on DUPIXENT's story which has already changed the lives of so many people suffering from type 2 inflammatory diseases such as asthma atopic dermatitis and chronic rhinositis with nasal polyps with more than 150,000 patients treated globally since launch.Next, I'm excited to share important updates on our immuno-oncology efforts. As you know most cancer patients are still not successfully addressed with immune therapies leaving us with a major challenge of enhancing responsiveness in tumor settings where immune therapies already have some efficacy such as lung and melanoma, while also trying to extend the benefit to patients with tumors that are currently not highly responsive such as prostate, pancreas, and colon.Having our own effective anti PD-1 antibody is foundational for our efforts to enhance and extend the benefits of immunotherapy as we had hoped such an antibody could play an important role both as a monotherapy but also in combination with other antibodies and bispecifics derived from our own homegrown pipeline as well as in combination with a number of collaborative agents and vaccines.Defying early optimism, developing effective anti PD-1 antibodies has proven to be very challenging. It is remarkable that in the decade since the first approval of an immuno-oncology agent, only one PD-1 antibody has been approved as monotherapy in first line non-small cell lung cancer.Although that therapy has on its own completely changed the paradigm of how lung cancer is treated. At the end of last year we announced interim results from our first line non-small cell lung cancer study in so-called PD-L1 high patients. Revealing that our PD-1 antibody Libtayo as monotherapy had objective response rates of 42% compared to 22% for chemotherapy indicating profound clinical activity.Just last week, we announced that the independent data monitoring committee recommendation led to an early termination of this Libtayo monotherapy trial due to a highly significant improvement in overall survival with Libtayo decreasing the risk of debt by 32.4% compared to the platinum doublet chemotherapy.This result was obtained early despite a third of the patients entering the trial within the past six months and chemotherapies -- chemotherapy patients being able to cross over to Libtayo upon disease progression. No new Libtayo safety signal was identified. We are planning to present detailed trial data at a future medical meeting and will complete regulatory submissions in the next few months.And just this morning, we announced that we had identified yet another first-in-class cancer setting where Libtayo as monotherapy exhibited profound and clinically meaningful activity just as we had previously done for squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or CSCC where Libtayo is rapidly becoming standard of care.Our potentially pivotal study in second-line advanced basal cell carcinoma of the skin or BCC demonstrated clinically meaningful response rates of nearly 30% in locally advanced patients who had progressed on prior Hedgehog inhibitor treatment.Impressively, more than 85% of the patients who responded to treatment have experienced durable responses of more than 12 months. We intend to submit dated to regulatory authorities in the coming months. Basal cell carcinoma presents another promising opportunity to extend our dermato-oncology portfolio beyond the current squamous cell carcinoma indication.BCC is the most common cancer in the world, while only a very small percentage of cases require systemic therapy, the extremely large incidence of this cancer means that there are still thousands of people with advanced basal cell carcinoma in need of treatment.I'd like to frame the significance of these milestones for cancer patients and for Regeneron. In aggregate, our studies have now demonstrated that Libtayo is a potent and effective PD-1 monotherapy treatment, where we now have the potential subject to regulatory approval to offer patients with lung cancer, a competitive alternative.In addition and very unexpectedly to some, we have now been able to identify two new cancer settings where PD-1 monotherapy demonstrates profound clinical activity based on our studies. First, advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and now advanced basal cell carcinoma of the skin.Moreover as Libtayo is establishing itself as a leading PD-1 antibody for monotherapy and allows us to pursue our strategy of using it in combinations to enhance and extend benefit. For example, we are investigating Libtayo in combination studies with our two classes of bispecifics, our CD3 class as well as our custom class. That is we have already initiated a trial combining Libtayo with our PSMA costim bispecific to try to endow responsiveness in prostate cancer.We have also initiated a trial combining Libtayo with our MUC16 by CD3 bispecific to enhance responsiveness in ovarian cancer. We're also starting trials combining Libtayo with our other checkpoint inhibitors and with other collaborative assets. For example, we have initiated a trial combining Libtayo with our LAG3 antibody to try to enhance responsiveness of first line melanoma where we are also combining Libtayo with various collaboration assets and vaccines.I should note that, although all our programs are being impacted by the COVID-19 crisis and additional future impacts are difficult to predict, our bispecific programs which have been particularly affected are ones that we are working very hard on to try to continue to enroll. Our potential in pivotal programs for our CD20 by C3 bispecific are enrolling in relapse refractory follicular lymphoma in relapsed refractory diffuse large b-cell lymphoma and in this setting following CAR-T cell therapy failure.We anticipate full enrollment over the next year. And I remind you that we have demonstrated very promising initial efficacy and durability in all of these settings. Similarly, our BCMA by CD3 bispecific for myeloma is continuing to enroll in its proof-of-concept study where it continues to deliver promising activity as is our MUC16 by CD3 bispecific for ovarian carcinoma.All together, these are very exciting times for immuno-oncology here at Regeneron, as we believe we have therapies that are showing important promise as monotherapies as well as the opportunity to combine and match these therapies as is appropriate to enhance and extend the benefit for additional cancer patients in need.Before handing the call over to Marion, let me conclude with a couple of brief updates on other areas of the pipeline. We are on track to complete our regulatory submissions for evinacumab, our ANGPTL3 antibody for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patients later this year. Recall, in our Phase III trial, evinacumab reduced LDL or bad cholesterol by an impressive 49% in patients not well controlled with other lipid-lowering treatments including anti PCSK9.We're also planning an FDA submission of the data package for GARETOSMAB, our Activin A Antibody for fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva in the second half of 2020, following dramatic results showing 90% reduction in new bone lesion formation and pending confirmation of these data from the second half of the study. We continue to explore the process of our C5 antibody and the potentially game-changing nature of the combination of this antibody with the siRNA program, which we are performing in combination with Alnylam. We continue to move forward with intent on initiating registration studies over the next 12 months.Finally, the opioid crisis continues and the need for alternative chronic pain solutions remain. We are making progress with fasinumab, our nerve growth factor antibody for osteoarthritis pain. We completed enrollment in our Phase III studies last year and we are expecting to see data midyear.With that I will turn the call over to Marion.\nMarion McCourt: Thank you, George. Our business performance in the first quarter reflects continued healthy demand driven growth of our core brands, EYLEA, Libtayo and DUPIXENT. While COVID-19 began to impact our business in the latter half of March, our first quarter results were strong.I'm going to begin with EYLEA performance. EYLEA had an impressive start to the quarter with continued share gains. Global net sales grew 6% year-over-year to more than $1.85 billion and U.S. net sales grew 9% to $1.17 billion versus the prior year. COVID-19 began to negatively impact EYLEA sales with a greater impact from the pandemic on patients with diabetic eye disease than on patients with wet AMD. There was a sharp decline in overall demand in the last two weeks of March and first two weeks of April, followed by a sharp rebound in the most recent two weeks.Overall, in the month of April, demand was approximately 15% lower than the same time last year. We're encouraged by the recent rebound, although it is difficult to predict future COVID-19 impact. Despite these circumstances, we've been extremely impressed with retina specialists' efforts to ensure continuity of patient care. Physicians use EYLEA to preserve the patient's vision because of its breadth of indications, dosing flexibility, convenience and safety. EYLEA dosing can be extended up to 12 weeks in appropriate patients and the recently launched Pre-filled Syringe offers additional efficiency of care.Additionally, we've evolved our efforts to support the retinal community through virtual engagement, as well as providing patient ads to self-monitor vision. We have plans in place to support customers and meeting anticipated higher demand for EYLEA once social distancing measures are relaxed. In summary we're confident that EYLEA can navigate through and grow beyond COVID-19.Turning to Libtayo. First quarter global net sales were $75 million. In the U.S. sales reached $62 million and we continue to extend Libtayo leadership as the number one systemic treatment for advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or CSCC. We continue to grow Libtayo in CSCC with nearly 65% of CSCC patients who receive systemic therapy already being treated with an anti-PD-1.And in addition to growing the market we're also capturing more of the therapeutic class demonstrated by nearly 90% of new PD one patients with CSCC receiving Libtayo. We're also closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on Libtayo, while office visits and chemotherapy administration have declined in general Libtayo used remains steady and treatment decisions for eligible patients are being made on a case-by-case basis.Overall we're proud of our progress with Libtayo. In addition our team is busy preparing for potential future launches with our collaborator Sanofi in lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma. In 2019, the worldwide anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 market was just over $21 billion.In the U.S. alone the 2019 market in non-small cell lung cancer was $13 billion. $8 billion of which was first-line with the vast majority of sales still coming from KEYTRUDA with more than 200,000 new diagnoses of lung cancer in the U.S. each year oncologists prefer having a choice in determining the most appropriate treatment for patients.Finally moving to DUPIXENT. Global net sales in the first quarter were $855 million. In the U.S. net sales reached $679 million, representing 124% growth compared to the prior year. We continue to grow prescribing across all indications including new-to-brand patients.In the first quarter we did not see a material impact of COVID-19 on DUPIXENT sales. In the month of April, the rate of new patient starts on DUPIXENT was impacted due to COVID-19. DUPIXENT has several unique competitive advantages that assist physicians in today's challenging environment.It can be administered at home. It does not require laboratory analysis to initiate most new patients and DUPIXENT is not an immunosuppressant. Expected approval of the auto-injector in June will provide additional convenience for product administration.Atopic dermatitis remains a significant growth driver for DUPIXENT. We've expanded prescribing across both moderate and severe disease and the eligible treatment population continues to grow.In the first quarter of 2019, DUPIXENT was approved in adolescents and we look forward to the PDUFA decision for 6 to 11-year olds targeted towards the end of May. We have seen rapid uptake of DUPIXENT and adolescents since its approval. Largely due to physician experience in older populations which provides comfort in its efficacy and safety in these younger patients.In asthma, DUPIXENT continues to outperform other recent biologic launches. We've seen limited volume impact from COVID-19 particularly since medications such as DUPIXENT are viable for patients to maintain respiratory function. While in early days the asthma DTC campaign is already generating significant patient interest.Finally our commercial efforts in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps continue to contribute meaningfully to the brand. Patients have been initiated on DUPIXENT regardless of prior surgery since approval. And during the COVID-19 pandemic there is an even greater need for DUPIXENT in these patients due to the limited availability of elective nasal polyp surgery.Taken together we remain committed to realizing the tremendous growth potential of DUPIXENT through expanded indications, age groups and geographies. In closing despite the current circumstances, our brands remain resilient. We continue to execute on our strategy and are working diligently to meet the evolving needs of our customers and patients.I'll turn the call over now to Bob.\nBob Landry: Thanks Marion. For the first quarter of 2020, Regeneron delivered solid results on both the top and bottom line, despite COVID-19 beginning to impact our business operations in the latter half of March.Today, I will first briefly discuss the first quarter results and then conclude with our 2020 guidance, effective January 1, 2020 we implemented changes to our accounting presentation related to certain reimbursements and other payments from collaborators. As such our first quarter 2020 and comparable 2019 financial statements have been prepared under the new accounting presentation.We made these changes to better reflect the nature of the company's revenues earned and costs incurred pursuant to arrangements with collaborators. Importantly, these changes provide a simplified presentation of our financial results. They do not impact income from operations, income taxes, net income or net income per share. For more information regarding these changes please refer to the slide presentation in FAQ on the Regeneron Investor Relations website.Turning now to the results. First quarter 2020 revenues grew 33% year-over-year to $1.83 billion driven by continued growth of both EYLEA and Libtayo, as well as higher Sanofi collaboration revenues as a result of strong performance from our DUPIXENT franchise. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share grew 48% year-over-year to $6.60 on non-GAAP net income of $771 million.Since Marion discussed our U.S. EYLEA results, I will start with our Bayer and Sanofi collaborations. Starting with the Bayer collaboration. Ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales which are reported to us by Bayer were $682 million representing growth of 2% on a reported basis compared to the prior year.Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $281 million, an increase of 7%. We recorded $254 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S.. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue which under the new accounting presentation consists of our share of antibody profits and reimbursements for the manufacturing of commercial supplies was $247 million in the first quarter. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of non-IO antibodies was $171 million compared to a loss of $28 million in the prior period driven by higher DUPIXENT profits.Effective April 1, 2020, we finalized the planned PRALUENT restructuring with Sanofi. In the U.S., Regeneron will have sole responsibility for PRALUENT and we have begun recording net product sales as of April 1. Outside the U.S. Sanofi will have sole responsibility for PRALUENT and will pay Regeneron a 5% royalty on such net product sales, which we will record in other revenue. As for Kevzara, Regeneron and Sanofi continue to assess potential terms of this restructuring following the recently launched clinical program evaluating KEVZARA in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.Moving to our expense basis starting with R&D. Non-GAAP R&D increased 23% year-over-year to $527 million driven by advancements in our earlier stage pipeline, higher headcount and an increase in clinical manufacturing activities.Next first quarter 2020 non-GAAP SG&A expense increased 27% year-over-year to $307 million. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher headcount and commercial investments to support the continued growth of our business. First quarter 2020 non-GAAP cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing was $139 million compared to $101 million in the first quarter of 2019. The year-over-year increase in COCM was primarily due to manufacturing costs associated with higher global sales of DUPIXENT and manufacturing costs in connection with our BARDA Ebola agreement.Finally, we introduced a new line item called other operating income and expense this quarter. This line item is located within expenses and primarily consists of the recognition of upfront payments and development milestones that were initially deferred and are recognized over time from our collaborators Sanofi, Teva and Mitsubishi Tanabe. For the first quarter of 2020, we recorded other operating income of $40 million compared to income of $57 million recorded in the first quarter of 2019.Turning now to taxes. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 9.5% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 16% in the first quarter of 2019. The year-over-year decline in the non-GAAP effective tax rate was due to increased tax benefits associated with stock option exercises in the first quarter of 2020.Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. For the first quarter of 2020, Regeneron generated $528 million in free cash flow. In the quarter, we repurchased $273 million worth of shares in open market transactions. The pace of share repurchases slowed considerably towards the end of the first quarter of 2020 given the recent share price appreciation. Our fully diluted share count that we report for a given quarter is highly sensitive to the average stock price. If the average stock price for the second quarter is similar to the current stock price levels, we would estimate that our weighted average share count used for calculating non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter will be in the range of 121 million to 123 million shares. And finally to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $7.2 billion in minimal debt.Now I'd like to spend a few moments to discuss the financial outlook for the remainder of the year. We assume that the COVID-19 impact on our business will peak in the second quarter 2020. We anticipate a recovery as the year progresses, as economies gradually reopen, social distancing guidelines are relaxed and doctor and hospital visits return to prior levels. From a supply chain and manufacturing perspective, Regeneron has historically maintained high levels of inventory in the event of a prolonged impact to our manufacturing and production capabilities.Currently, we see minimal disruptions to our supply chain and our manufacturing activities and we have adequate supply of commercial product on hand to meet demand. Our 2020 annual financial guidance reflects our latest assessment of our business in this current environment with limited precision. Certain elements of our spend will be dictated by the continued severity and length of the COVID-19 impact in our efforts associated with KEVZARA and our SARS-CoV-2 antibody cocktail. These factors may materially impact our guidance. We will assess carefully whether further updates to our guidance may be warranted.Now moving to our 2020 financial guidance. And starting with R&D, we forecast our 2020 non-GAAP R&D expenses to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.04 billion. We are continuing to invest in our pipeline and research capabilities which remain critical to the long-term growth of the business. Our oncology pipeline continues to grow. And as conditions allow, we intend to advance programs through development.Additionally, we are funding external partnership obligations, as jointly developed molecules are rapidly advancing. Our R&D guidance also includes the portion related to our COVID-19 activities where we will be reimbursed at least in part by BARDA. Unlike R&D reimbursements from collaborations which are netted in the R&D expense line item under the new accounting presentation, these reimbursements from BARDA will continue to be recorded in other revenue.Next to SG&A. We forecast our 2020 non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.29 billion. We are continuing to invest for product growth now and once the COVID-19 impact abates. For EYLEA, we are continuing to make investments in diabetic eye diseases. For Libtayo, launch preparations are underway for anticipated launches in basal cell and non-small cell lung cancer.Starting this year, we are providing guidance for COGS and COCM. For COGS, we forecast 2020 non-GAAP expenses to be in the range of $295 million to $355 million, primarily comprised of U.S. EYLEA, U.S. Libtayo and U.S. PRALUENT manufacturing costs in the payment of Sanofi for 50% of the gross margin associated with U.S. Libtayo.For COCM, we forecast 2020 non-GAAP expenses to be in the range of $600 million to $700 million, primarily comprised of global DUPIXENT, global KEVZARA, x U.S. EYLEA, x U.S. PRALUENT and Regeneron EB3 manufacturing costs. As a reminder, we are reimbursed for COCM costs, reimbursements are recognized within the Sanofi and Bayer collaboration revenue lines and other revenues. Reimbursements should closely approximate COCM expenses for quarterly reporting periods subject to timing and other considerations.For the new line item of operating income and expense, we expect this to be in the range of $175 million to $205 million of income this year. And finally the tax, we anticipate our 2020 non-GAAP effective tax guidance to be in the range of 12% to 14%.In conclusion, we had a solid start to the year despite initial impacts from COVID-19. Our balance sheet increasingly diversified commercial portfolio and robust pipeline enabled Regeneron to withstand the impacts of COVID-19, while making prudent investments in executing on meaningful near-term opportunities to position Regeneron for sustained long-term growth.With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Justin.\nJustin Holko: Thank you Bob. Crystal that concludes our prepared remarks, we'd now like to open the call for Q&A. Just a word that, we have more than 20 callers in the queue, so to ensure that we are able to address as many as possible, we will answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. Please go ahead, Crystal.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman from Credit Suisse.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi, all. Thank you for taking my question, and congrats on the progress this quarter. Thank you also for your efforts in combating the pandemic. So with data from both the frontline lung trial last week and basal cell carcinoma today, can you expand as to what's next for your oncology franchise? How do you plan on competing with the standard of care in the front line lung setting and more broadly across tumor types amenable to IO therapy?\nLeonard Schleifer: So, George?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: And I guess that most importantly, as we noted, the lung field is dominated by leading antibody that has produced the most impressive data. We are very excited that our monotherapy trial has delivered data that looks very impressive in terms of the overall survival endpoint. And we have an ongoing combination trial with chemotherapy as well that we're excited about having it read out over the coming year or so.And so I think that this is going to position us well in such a large opportunity, where physicians and patients are looking for alternatives to have an agent that has such profound activity as a monotherapy. But in addition, we have all these combination programs that I was referring to. We have we believe one of the most exciting homegrown pipelines of additional agents that we could combine to not only enhance the activity in these settings where the PD-1 monotherapies are already active, but also to extend to new settings and new indications, such as I mentioned, whether it be prostate cancer or ovarian cancer or others where right now the activity is not what we would want.So I think that we've put ourselves into a pretty exciting position, where we have some of the most exciting agents with identified profound clinical activity as monotherapies, but we now have the opportunity to mix and match these as is appropriate to enhance and extend the activity. So we're very excited about the oncology situation.\nLeonard Schleifer: Yes. And just to add on the commercial side, it's Len and maybe Marion can chime in. You know obviously we collaborate with Sanofi where we take the lead in the United States. They take the lead outside the United States, but we work together with them. And this disease is dominated by lung cancer, maybe Marion a little bit about the numbers the incidence prevalence what kind of marketplace we're going into?\nMarion McCourt: Yes. So lung cancer is a disease with a very large incident population of more than 200,000 newly diagnosed patients each year. So, we do think that there's tremendous opportunity and know that oncologists prefer having a choice in determining treatment for their patients.So we're excited about the data and we'll work carefully with Sanofi on launch preparedness, and certainly have built a commercial team that has extensive experience in competitive launches. We look forward to this opportunity if in fact we have an approval for lung and for basal cell.\nJustin Holko: Thanks, Evan. Next question?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink.\nGeoffrey Porges: Thank you very much and congratulations on both the surprisingly strong quarter, but also all the progress on the pipeline. George, we haven't had a lot of access to talk to you about the COVID programs. But could you just expand a little bit on the backup program what its nature is? And the related question of what do you view as the risk of both ADE and also of the antibodies in some way contributing adversely to the inflammatory syndrome in the tail end of this disease?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. Those are great questions. So what we were able to generate, because we have these very robust platforms both the ability to get fully human antibodies from our genetically humanized mouse model, as well as from recovering humans. We generated a collection of thousands and thousands of antibodies.Getting many antibodies that really were at the top end historically at the best level of binders and blockers and antiviral neutralizers that you've ever seen based on the literature and the history. And so what we did was, we simply selected several cocktails of the best antibodies where we put them together, and we created our initial cocktail and a backup cocktail just in case for some reason something goes wrong with the initial cocktail. So they're actually quite similar. It's just a different collection of antibodies for the backup as well as for the primary.Now we think that based on the history of treating infectious disease and viral diseases with highly potent neutralizing antibodies, the risks of things such as antibody-dependent enhancement and so forth are actually quite limited. You actually see these, for example, in certain classes of viruses, the Flaviviruses, the dengue type viruses and so forth in particular, but that's because of the biology of the viruses there.With most other viruses when you have highly potent neutralizing antibodies these risks are mitigated. We do have -- in addition to our backup collection of antibodies, we do also have our antibody cocktails made with what we call Uber-stealth constant [ph] regions, which would completely mitigate against that possibility. But for the current approaches that we're taking, we're going to be going forward with the fully armed antibodies, because we think the risks of ADE with very potent neutralizing antibodies is actually quite low.So I think that the history of antiviral antibodies, our experience the way they work our own antibodies and other programs most notably in Ebola, we think that there's a very significant chance that these specifically designed, very potent neutralizing antibodies will have a significant impact on the disease. We think that there's a great chance that they can be very powerful prophylactic and preventive agents. But we also think that they can treat patients who are already symptomatic with disease.And we don't think that right now there's any evidence that suggests that the antibody response is what's contributing to the inflammatory responses in the lung. And as, of course, as has already been seen and described in the disease, the majority of patients do recover and their recovery is coincident with their producing viral responses.So altogether I think there's a lot of reason to have a lot of hope that this approach really has a chance to make a difference as we said both in prophylactic treatment, but also in treating symptomatic patients.\nJustin Holko: Thanks, Geoff.\nGeoffrey Porges: Thanks for taking my question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.\nCory Kasimov: Hey, good morning, Leonard. Thanks for taking the questions. Just to follow-up on Geoff's question on the COVID-19 front. George, how you're thinking about the clinical trial designs for your antibody cocktail both from a prophylactic standpoint, as well as a therapeutic? And on the latter, do you plan to either go head-to-head or on top of remdesivir if you run initial studies in a hospital setting? Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Well, we're planning on doing three sets of trials in the prophylactic or prevention setting in people who are at high-risk in early treatment that is patients who are not at the level that they would be normally hospitalized. But patients who are identified they're symptomatic. If they do go to an ER, they are sent home, but they don't need oxygen support.However, significant number of them do develop more serious disease and then have to return to the hospital. So the idea would be to stop the disease in those individuals and stop the progression and the need from them going back to the hospital. And then we're also going to go to the hospitalized setting very similar to what we're doing with KEVZARA and where the Remdesivir data has read out.So certainly, the only setting where it would be on top of an existing standard-of-care potentially would be in the late treatment setting, we would certainly be going on top of standard- f care there whether it be Remdesivir or maybe we'll see whether there's data from other agents by that time as well.In the prophylactic setting, there is no need and there's also no other standard of care and in the same thing in the early treatment. And I would remind you once again that based as I said on our experience in other programs and most notably a good example is the Ebola program, the earlier that one treats, the better one does.I remind you early in the disease for Ebola, which is obviously a much more lethal disease with much higher levels of severe disease and death we were able to save more than 90% of the patients when we went with early treatment. So I think that there's a lot of reason to think that in this setting these sorts of antibodies both in the prophylactic setting and in the early treatment setting can have really profound benefits on their own.\nJustin Holko: Thank you for the question, Cory. Next.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.\nTim Anderson: Thank you very much. On your antibody cocktail. I'm wondering, if you think Gilead's actions with Remdesivir essentially set the bar for other companies in terms of what they may be expected to do specifically in terms of giving away some portion of initial therapy free at the outset? Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Len, you want to take that? Len?\nLeonard Schleifer: Yes, hi. Sorry. It's Len. We've spent all of our energy right now focused on getting the technical success that George described and that we hope to see. And in parallel, we have been working to clear manufacturing capacity in our New York plant so that we can make it at large scale. We hope to be able to have a couple hundred thousand doses by the end of the summer and then continue to manufacture from there. In terms of pricing, donations, and fair values and all that sort of stuff that's just got to come down the road a little bit.\nTim Anderson: Thank you.\nJustin Holko: Next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein.\nRonny Gal: Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. I want to go back to Libtayo non-small cell lung cancer. I hear you about physicians wanting to have a choice in monotherapy between KEYTRUDA and a second product. The question is why should they choose Libtayo, the KEYTRUDA? I think you've got a product here, which is just to make the point a few years is the standard of care used extensively.Can you just share with us in your data, is there other elements of the data you're seeing from the trial would suggest that there is any group of patients where physicians should prefer Libtayo over KEYTRUDA what is your marketing argument here? And before I stopped there, I just want to thank you for all the efforts you're making against COVID-19 just adding to my peers here.\nLeonard Schleifer: Thanks, Ronny. It's Len. It's way too early for us to be making any comparative statements. We literally, just recently got the, good news from the data monitoring committee that we met with highly statistical significance, as George described survival.We've got a lot more data to go. We've got a lot more studies to look at. It's not just one study. It's not just the cross-study comparison. There's going to be a lot more that goes into this. And we'll just have to see how this evolves.But the history of the industry typically is that, if there's just a couple of competitors, you have to remember that the size of this market. Last year it was about $22 billion of which about 70% or 75% was lung cancer. And that was largely driven by Keytruda sales. So there's a pretty big opportunity to have some important alternatives. And you just have to wait, I'm sorry Ronny to see how this all evolves when we roll this out.\nJustin Holko: Sure. Thanks, Ronny. Next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler.\nChris Raymond: Yeah. Thanks. Just back to the antibody cocktail, I guess. So George, a lot of folks, I guess close to the FDA and maybe some with a fairly loud voice on these COVID matters, just keep talking about at least one of the therapies one of the antibody therapies, that's in development being available, as early as this fall.So I guess, maybe just talk about how is that possible, from a clinical development standpoint? And especially in light of the program you just described, George with the three different settings. Obviously, when there's something that's even under an emergency use authorization available, how do you conduct that? Thanks.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Well, yeah. I think that, these are all great questions. We're in unprecedented times. I think that, the urgency and the collaborative spirit between regulators, between medical institutions, between companies, it has never been seen before. And also our commitment to this is something we've sort of done it before. But now we're trying to take it to the next level.So we are planning, as we said in June to simultaneously initiate trials, in the three settings that we're actually talking about. We are thinking of ways to synergize between the three classes of trials that we're talking about. And we are hoping -- I mean this is going to depend on a lot of factors. And there's obviously a lot of risk and concerns, whether this can be done, since it hasn't ever been done before.But we are really hoping that, we'll be able to not only initiate these studies, but able within a month or two to perhaps if these agents are working as well as we might hope they would work, as well as for example some of the precedents set by Ebola suggest that they might work, that we might within that month or two be getting data.If we were to get data, within those sort of timeframes as Len describes we have already committed at risk to manufacturing the drug supply this could be providing by the end of the summer, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of doses, of these antibodies. So, you're right. It's never been done before.On the other hand, I don't think we ever had quite a pandemic like this before. And I think that, some companies like ours have really put themselves in a position with the technologies, the commitments, the investments that we've made to put ourselves in a position, to maybe help out and make a difference here.And regulators like the FDA, BARDA everybody is coming together to try to help us in this situation to meet the urgency and meet the dire need that we might have here. And so the hope is yes, it might be possible by the end of the summer or the fall that, our antibody treatment could be available. A lot of risks, a lot of concerns, but we are working as hard as we can with so many collaborators to try to turn that into a reality.\nJustin Holko: So we still have several callers \u2013 sorry, we have several callers still in the queue. So we'll extend for a few more minutes, if we can.\nLeonard Schleifer: Let me just put a finer point on that. But just in a second. I completely agree with what George said. And I think if you listen carefully to what he was saying is that, because we're doing three different types of studies, the timing on the different studies might be quite different.If you're dealing with people, who already have the disease, then you're not waiting for that long period to occur, when you're trying to prevent the disease. And people who already have the disease, the cause of the disease sort of declares itself, over a several week to month period.And so you could imagine, depending upon what's going on. How many people are actually showing up at the hospital? How many people are hospitalized, in the ICU that that part could go a lot faster? But of course, you can imagine that George and the team have got a lot of great strategies, for the early part, to try and find people at high enough risk, which is the hard part in a preventative setting. Sorry next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.\nTerence Flynn: Hi. Thanks as well from me for your efforts on the COVID front. Maybe another one for George on, bispecifics, I was just wondering if you've already generated data from your PSMA bispecific antibody as monotherapy. And if that's what led to your decision to initiate a combo trial with Libtayo?And then the second part of the question relates to your comment George about, seeing continuing promising activity. I was wondering if that was only on the BCMA bispecific, or has that also covered the MUC16 bispecific? Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes, great questions. I guess, first of all, basically, we think that, the bispecific costims. We've described these in the literature. We have a lot of data on them. On their own they are designed to essentially have very little or no activity. And only when combined with either a CD3 bispecific or with a PD-1 agent do they then essentially synergize and amplify the benefit or activate the benefit of the other agent.And we've done a lot of work on that. Quite a bit of published work has already been shown on that. And the early data in the clinic are supporting that in that the monotherapy costim was not intended and did not show single-agent activity. We are now in the combination program, where we are hoping to now activate activity by adding the costim to the PD-1.That's how they were designed, that's what we're hoping to see and that is what we are hoping to be able to generate data that we will be giving you information on in the future. In terms of the promising activity, I think that yes, we have seen robust activity with the BCMA. We have not really reported anything on the MUC16. I can say that we are seeing evidence of activity and we'll give you more details on that in future times.\nJustin Holko: Thank you, Terence. Next question?\nLeonard Schleifer: One second, Terence if I may. We appreciate all the comments from the analyst community thanking us for what we're doing. We just want to say. we find your notes very useful and very helpful. The coverage of this pandemic, the useful information that all of you provide and what's going on and what the rates are of this and that and what to be expected we really appreciate that as well.\nJustin Holko: Next question?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer from Evercore ISI.\nJosh Schimmer: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Another one COVID-19. How do you determine the optimal dose for passive immunization, especially if you have to adjust for different levels of exposure? How long do you think a single dose will confer protection? And then what are realistic goal in terms of the number of people you can support beyond August with prophylactic use considering potential supply constraints? Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Okay. Well, basically we have accumulated over many years now, a lot of understanding about the doses that one needs to block viral infection particularly of respiratory and other diseases. So we actually know both in animal models and in humans the blood levels to block respiratory infection. And so we are targeting to be significantly above those blood levels for a minimum of at least a month for the prophylactic setting.So there's no guarantees. Once again these are all predictions based on experience in other programs with other viruses but including for example, the MERS coronavirus. And so we believe we have a good target blood level that we need to meet and achieve and stay above on for at least a month for the prophylaxis setting.And so the prophylaxis dosing is intended to last for at least a month. For example in our RSV program \u2013 for one of our programs there, we were able to have protection for several months. So minimum of a month is our current target based on maintaining blood levels that we believe you have to maintain above for preventing infection by respiratory viruses. What was the rest of the question?\nLeonard Schleifer: In terms of supply \u2013 yes I'll take that George. Thanks. In terms of supply, we've going as fast as we can. We have an amazing capability in technology that allows us to get high producing cell lines very rapidly. We know how to make antibodies. We are one of the companies that can do this from end-to-end seamlessly. And so I'm optimistic that we can expand from the initial numbers we talked about and continue to manufacture.We have had inquiries from multiple other companies about perhaps wanting to manufacture a cocktail when we have good data and we suspect maybe the government may want that to happen as well, where we can expand through collaborative efforts and sort of take the unprecedented step of letting some of our technology outside the company for this purpose as well, because that's what probably will need to be done.\nJustin Holko: Thanks, John. Next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber from Cowen.\nYaron Werber: Hey, good morning. Thanks for asking quick question. I'm going to shift a little bit George and maybe fasinumab, just so we don't lose track of that program. It sounds like that data is coming up pretty soon the Phase III osteoarthritis data. Any thoughts? And any thoughts on Pfizer-filed fasinumab for approval? So this is totally overlooked but I want to know what's kind of coming down as you can share? Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. Our viewpoint with fasinumab is that for a long time now as obviously, I think most people appreciate is that in many ways, this is a very risky program in that. There are \u2013 there is a now well-defined adverse event that we are trying to tighter around with the dose. And I think the major question for this program is whether we have been able to find a dose that threads the needle between the safety concern and between providing sufficient benefit to patients.I think if you see other competitors' data here, it's been a little difficult for others to thread the needle. So this is what we're going to see, especially when we see the data that comes out from our ongoing program that we'll be getting by the middle of this year, how well we've done to actually find a magic spot on the dose response curve, where we have sufficient safety but sufficient benefit and how that might compare to what others have achieved.So we are as anxious and excited as you are to see whether we may have threaded this needle in a way that really provides an important alternative for patients as we know there is a crying, literally a crying need here for new pain medications and particularly for the osteoarthritis population and we are hoping that we may have threaded that needle.\nJustin Holko: Thanks, Yaron. We're going to try to cut the call about quarter to the hour that leaves us with time for one to two more questions. Next question, Crystal.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carter Gould from Barclays.\nCarter Gould: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I pass on my congrats on the Libtayo data sets and thank you for all the COVID efforts. Maybe just focusing back on Libtayo for a second. It sounds like most of the commentary is, sort of, reaffirmation of the development strategy here and, sort of, validation of the efforts to-date. I guess -- but with this data in hand particularly the lung data does this, sort of, either accelerate your focus on broad -- further broadening out of the novel-novel combinations or potentially a shift to bringing in outside agents maybe a shift in, sort of, that partnership strategy? Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Right. I think that this is really a landmark for the field, but also for us. Keytruda has stood really unchallenged now particularly in lung cancer, which is driving most of the sales for this entire field. Because others haven't actually been able to show that they've had a Keytruda-like agent. I think that I understand the concerns about people talking about how are you going to compete?But having something that's already showing this profound clinical activity that we're now seeing as a monotherapy with also, having also identified this is another thing that people have to appreciate new first-in-class indications that have been missed by the rest of the field. First with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma now with basal cell, I think are establishing Libtayo as a legitimate monotherapy alternative.And as Len said, when you have opportunities such as $8 billion opportunities in first line history shows that bona fide competitors with profound clinical activity they are going to get significant shares. But I think, it's exactly as you said, we believe we are now in a position where we can compete in these monotherapy situations, but it only amplifies our excitement and our commitment to the combination approach. And of course, as you say we are working hard to find the right outside collaborators. And I think we've already announced quite a few of them that we're very excited about, that we're already starting combination studies on and so forth, but we are just as excited about our internal homegrown pipeline.We have been preparing, a series of combination assets just for this moment now where we will have this potent powerful PD-1 antibody of our own. Our entire strategy depended on it and now that the molecule has come through and proved that it really is a bona fide monotherapy competitor out there we are now just doubly motivated and compelled to now build upon that with all these combination opportunities that have been coming out of our labs for the last few years. So we could not be more excited that we will now have the ability to not only compete as a monotherapy, but now to add with all these combinations, all these bispecifics, the costim bispecifics and so forth as well as these collaboration assets. And we think this is a really exciting time not only for us, but for the field because I hope you all realize how the immuno-oncology field despite all the initial excitement has not moved forth as much as I think we all would have wanted it to have moved forward.We haven't seen the magic combinations. We haven't seen the dramatic increases in to new cancers. We think we have the opportunity to take that field to the next level and having the foundational PD-1 antibody of our own really gives us that opportunity. So these are really exciting times for us, but I think for the field that -- for the first time in a decade maybe substantial new advances, a new age of immuno-oncology may be coming now.\nJustin Holko: Crystal, we have time for two, three quick questions.\nLeonard Schleifer: You can be sure we're getting together with our collaborator Sanofi on this and going to look carefully about how to move this forward and how to compete well with the data, we have and other data we want to get.\nJustin Holko: Crystal, this is time for two more quick ones.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.\nGeoff Meacham: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question and for squeezing me in. I want to ask another one on COVID cocktail. Just to follow-up George on some of your earlier comments about rolling out efficacy studies next month. I'm assuming that or can I infer that you're bypassing traditional Phase I safety studies and healthies and then when you think about manufacturing scale up what's the opportunity to outsource or to partner should you have much higher demand and success obviously in the pivotal study? Thank you very much.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. I think that we have been already in active conversation with regulators exactly on the points that you talk about. And I think these are unprecedented times and I think also when you have the history with these types of agents, it does allow you and it does allow the comfort of the regulators that one could be moving forward very quickly. And so as you might imagine along the lines of the things that you proposed these are exactly the sorts of things that we're talking about with regulators. And we're trying to employ into our designs.In terms of your second part of your question, I think, Len already started talking about this point, which is we have made a huge commitment to enable our entire upstate New York manufacturing facility to be devoted to this effort, which on its own could supply hundreds of thousands if not over the course of time maybe even on the order of a million or so doses per month. However, even that might not be sufficient depending on the demand, depending on whether there's a second wave, depending on what happens with vaccines and so forth. So we are actively talking about collaborations with others who are very interested in bringing their resources to the table here too.As we said, there's enormous collaborative spirit that I think we haven't seen before between companies to come together, to help each other out, to really make a difference here in this pandemic. And so that opportunity is really out there. We're actively talking with people. And of course it all depends on whether these antibodies deliver. But if they deliver and depending on the state of the pandemic if there's more need I am sure that there will be ways that either we on our own or with major collaborations will be able to supply more to more patients.\nJustin Holko: Okay. Crystal, last question. Unfortunately, we have a lot of people still in the queue but this will be our last question\nOperator: And your question comes from the line of Yatin Suneja with Guggenheim.\nYatin Suneja: Good morning, everyone. And I also appreciate all the effort on the COVID front. I also would like to complement Bob for simplifying the accounting, really appreciating a much cleaner guidance that you provided today. So the question is on the EYLEA front. I think Marion, pre-COVID you were anticipating total market supply for prefilled syringe by March. Could you comment where you are in terms of the supply of PFS? And any impact you saw of PFS an idea performance in 1Q? And also, I'm not sure if there was any inventory dynamic that you commented on earlier today. Thanks.\nMarion McCourt: Okay. So sure. Let me take those. I'll start with your last. So in terms of inventory, we have stayed at normal levels. So we're not seeing anything unusual in terms of inventory. Your next question on prefilled syringe, we do think prefilled syringe is a very attractive alternative in the marketplace. And the use of the prefilled syringe has gone up to about 75% of total use of EYLEA. We have, as you know, introduced prefilled syringe in a staggered way starting towards the end of last year. But it's been very well received and we do intend to have not only prefilled syringe, which of course is growing in popularity, but we'll also maintain vials in the marketplace.And then I believe the other item that you were commenting on was in terms of the COVID impact, and as I shared certainly in the first quarter we had very robust performance with EYLEA, and saw our sales grow in the U.S. marketplace 9% in net sales over the prior year. We did see, as I mentioned, a decline in overall demand in the last two weeks of March and that continued into the first two weeks of April, then we saw a sharp rebound in the most -- meaning a positive trend in the last two weeks. So that when you put all that together and all those factors together, demand in the month of April was approximately 15% lower than in the same period last year.But I go on to say, it's hard to predict what will happen with the COVID impact going forward. But we remain very confident in EYLEA's profile, our commitment to the retinal specialist community, and the -- obviously, the very attractive profile we have, both clinically and from a safety standpoint with EYLEA. We're supporting our offices through appropriate promotion and support so that when patients flow -- returns in a more robust fashion, we certainly look forward to the opportunity to help those patients with EYLEA and support our prescribers.\nJustin Holko: Thank you everyone. That's going to conclude our call. We appreciate everybody hanging on a little longer today, given all the things that we had to speak to and all the great questions that came in. Bob Landry and the IR team will be available following the call to answer further questions. Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Stay safe.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

            "name": "Marion McCourt",
            "content": "Thank you, George. Our business performance in the first quarter reflects continued healthy demand driven growth of our core brands, EYLEA, Libtayo and DUPIXENT. While COVID-19 began to impact our business in the latter half of March, our first quarter results were strong.I'm going to begin with EYLEA performance. EYLEA had an impressive start to the quarter with continued share gains. Global net sales grew 6% year-over-year to more than $1.85 billion and U.S. net sales grew 9% to $1.17 billion versus the prior year. COVID-19 began to negatively impact EYLEA sales with a greater impact from the pandemic on patients with diabetic eye disease than on patients with wet AMD. There was a sharp decline in overall demand in the last two weeks of March and first two weeks of April, followed by a sharp rebound in the most recent two weeks.Overall, in the month of April, demand was approximately 15% lower than the same time last year. We're encouraged by the recent rebound, although it is difficult to predict future COVID-19 impact. Despite these circumstances, we've been extremely impressed with retina specialists' efforts to ensure continuity of patient care. Physicians use EYLEA to preserve the patient's vision because of its breadth of indications, dosing flexibility, convenience and safety. EYLEA dosing can be extended up to 12 weeks in appropriate patients and the recently launched Pre-filled Syringe offers additional efficiency of care.Additionally, we've evolved our efforts to support the retinal community through virtual engagement, as well as providing patient ads to self-monitor vision. We have plans in place to support customers and meeting anticipated higher demand for EYLEA once social distancing measures are relaxed. In summary we're confident that EYLEA can navigate through and grow beyond COVID-19.Turning to Libtayo. First quarter global net sales were $75 million. In the U.S. sales reached $62 million and we continue to extend Libtayo leadership as the number one systemic treatment for advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or CSCC. We continue to grow Libtayo in CSCC with nearly 65% of CSCC patients who receive systemic therapy already being treated with an anti-PD-1.And in addition to growing the market we're also capturing more of the therapeutic class demonstrated by nearly 90% of new PD one patients with CSCC receiving Libtayo. We're also closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on Libtayo, while office visits and chemotherapy administration have declined in general Libtayo used remains steady and treatment decisions for eligible patients are being made on a case-by-case basis.Overall we're proud of our progress with Libtayo. In addition our team is busy preparing for potential future launches with our collaborator Sanofi in lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma. In 2019, the worldwide anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 market was just over $21 billion.In the U.S. alone the 2019 market in non-small cell lung cancer was $13 billion. $8 billion of which was first-line with the vast majority of sales still coming from KEYTRUDA with more than 200,000 new diagnoses of lung cancer in the U.S. each year oncologists prefer having a choice in determining the most appropriate treatment for patients.Finally moving to DUPIXENT. Global net sales in the first quarter were $855 million. In the U.S. net sales reached $679 million, representing 124% growth compared to the prior year. We continue to grow prescribing across all indications including new-to-brand patients.In the first quarter we did not see a material impact of COVID-19 on DUPIXENT sales. In the month of April, the rate of new patient starts on DUPIXENT was impacted due to COVID-19. DUPIXENT has several unique competitive advantages that assist physicians in today's challenging environment.It can be administered at home. It does not require laboratory analysis to initiate most new patients and DUPIXENT is not an immunosuppressant. Expected approval of the auto-injector in June will provide additional convenience for product administration.Atopic dermatitis remains a significant growth driver for DUPIXENT. We've expanded prescribing across both moderate and severe disease and the eligible treatment population continues to grow.In the first quarter of 2019, DUPIXENT was approved in adolescents and we look forward to the PDUFA decision for 6 to 11-year olds targeted towards the end of May. We have seen rapid uptake of DUPIXENT and adolescents since its approval. Largely due to physician experience in older populations which provides comfort in its efficacy and safety in these younger patients.In asthma, DUPIXENT continues to outperform other recent biologic launches. We've seen limited volume impact from COVID-19 particularly since medications such as DUPIXENT are viable for patients to maintain respiratory function. While in early days the asthma DTC campaign is already generating significant patient interest.Finally our commercial efforts in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps continue to contribute meaningfully to the brand. Patients have been initiated on DUPIXENT regardless of prior surgery since approval. And during the COVID-19 pandemic there is an even greater need for DUPIXENT in these patients due to the limited availability of elective nasal polyp surgery.Taken together we remain committed to realizing the tremendous growth potential of DUPIXENT through expanded indications, age groups and geographies. In closing despite the current circumstances, our brands remain resilient. We continue to execute on our strategy and are working diligently to meet the evolving needs of our customers and patients.I'll turn the call over now to Bob. Yes. So lung cancer is a disease with a very large incident population of more than 200,000 newly diagnosed patients each year. So, we do think that there's tremendous opportunity and know that oncologists prefer having a choice in determining treatment for their patients.So we're excited about the data and we'll work carefully with Sanofi on launch preparedness, and certainly have built a commercial team that has extensive experience in competitive launches. We look forward to this opportunity if in fact we have an approval for lung and for basal cell. Okay. So sure. Let me take those. I'll start with your last. So in terms of inventory, we have stayed at normal levels. So we're not seeing anything unusual in terms of inventory. Your next question on prefilled syringe, we do think prefilled syringe is a very attractive alternative in the marketplace. And the use of the prefilled syringe has gone up to about 75% of total use of EYLEA. We have, as you know, introduced prefilled syringe in a staggered way starting towards the end of last year. But it's been very well received and we do intend to have not only prefilled syringe, which of course is growing in popularity, but we'll also maintain vials in the marketplace.And then I believe the other item that you were commenting on was in terms of the COVID impact, and as I shared certainly in the first quarter we had very robust performance with EYLEA, and saw our sales grow in the U.S. marketplace 9% in net sales over the prior year.

            "name": "Leonard Schleifer",
            "content": "Thank you, Justin. And thank you to everyone for joining the call. I hope all of you are staying safe and well during this difficult time. We're living in a new reality, the reality of COVID-19. I am incredibly proud of the leadership role Regeneron is taking in the fight against COVID-19.Clearly, this pandemic is unprecedented in our lifetime, for our company, our country and the world and the world economies. Regeneron has spent decades and billions of dollars developing proprietary technologies that have created medical breakthroughs, such as Dupixent and our novel antibody cocktail for Ebola, which is now under FDA review.These same technologies are now well purposed for finding a treatment against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We are making rapid progress and scaling up supply of our novel antibody cocktail, which we expect to be in clinical trials this June. We are optimistic about this approach, which George will describe in greater detail.Also we are working swiftly with our collaborator Sanofi to find a definitive answer on whether there is a role for Kevzara in helping to alleviate the devastating inflammation that affects patients who are critically afflicted with this virus. We are grateful for the tremendous partnership across industries, governments and agencies such as the FDA and BARDA, as we unite in the common cause to eradicate this disease.Beyond our therapeutic efforts we continue to respond to other urgent COVID-related needs. We recently produced and donated viral transport media to New York State for use in 500,000 test kits and have provided financial support to non-profits at the heart of the pandemic response, in New York and beyond.Furthermore, we are sensitive to the rapidly evolving marketplace and working with customers to ensure that patients are able to receive the treatments they need to preserve vision, as well as to treat inflammatory conditions, cancer and other ailments that persist despite the realities of social distancing.Turning to some brief commentary on the first quarter, where we delivered another strong performance. In the quarter, negative impacts from COVID-19 were minimal. Our core brands EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo drove significant top and bottom line growth, based on demand, while we invested in and advanced our innovative pipeline.In this quarter EYLEA global net product sales grew 6% to $1.85 billion, including U.S. EYLEA net sales growth of 9% to $1.17 billion. In the last two weeks of March and early April, overall demand and new patient starts were softer due to COVID-19. However, we are encouraged by the rebound in demand in the most recent weeks. Marion will give you more color on this.First quarter Dupixent sales more than doubled compared to last year and are now annualizing at more than $3.4 billion on continued market penetration and new launches in multiple disease settings. While there are early signs of impacts on new patient starts, we expect continued resilience for Dupixent during this COVID-19 period, given the profound efficacy and safety profile.With an anticipated regulatory action in pediatric atopic dermatitis later this month and other data readouts in 2020 and initiation of new Phase III trials assessing Dupixent in several other type two inflammatory diseases, this exceptional medicine continues to be positioned for long-term growth. Importantly Dupixent is driving continued diversification of our earnings base and enhancing our strong current and long-term financial position.We also announced recently that we have completed the restructuring of our agreement with Sanofi on Praluent which will lead to immediate accretion and further strengthen our overall portfolio.2020 has brought urgent new priorities. Even though, we are experiencing impacts to trial enrollment and new study starts we remain on track for several significant clinical milestones particularly in oncology. Recently, we announced that our first-line clinical trial in lung cancer assessing Libtayo was stopped early on an interim analysis due to superior overall survival versus chemotherapy. We will look to submit these data to regulators as soon as possible. We also intend to submit data for the Type one basal cell carcinoma and expect new data from our bispecifics program later this year. Additionally, the long-awaited Phase3 readout from fasinumab our anti nerve growth factor program for osteoarthritis pain will occur in the coming months.Before handing the call over to George, I want to share the immense pride and gratitude we have for our people working hard at Regeneron during this time. Even in the current environment our entire business is operating as our people drive important work forward that is essential to our mission to patients and to near and long-term value creation for shareholders.Our ability to do this rests on the talent and strength of our workforce, which in spite of COVID-related disruption maintains incredible commitment focus and effort to advance the breadth of Regeneron's work. They are the foundations for moving forward, our mission in normal times and especially now. We are optimistic that Regeneron and our society will prevail through these unprecedented times and we will work tirelessly to that end.Now, I'll turn the call over to George. So, George? Yes. And just to add on the commercial side, it's Len and maybe Marion can chime in. You know obviously we collaborate with Sanofi where we take the lead in the United States. They take the lead outside the United States, but we work together with them. And this disease is dominated by lung cancer, maybe Marion a little bit about the numbers the incidence prevalence what kind of marketplace we're going into? Yes, hi. Sorry. It's Len. We've spent all of our energy right now focused on getting the technical success that George described and that we hope to see. And in parallel, we have been working to clear manufacturing capacity in our New York plant so that we can make it at large scale. We hope to be able to have a couple hundred thousand doses by the end of the summer and then continue to manufacture from there. In terms of pricing, donations, and fair values and all that sort of stuff that's just got to come down the road a little bit. Thanks, Ronny. It's Len. It's way too early for us to be making any comparative statements. We literally, just recently got the, good news from the data monitoring committee that we met with highly statistical significance, as George described survival.We've got a lot more data to go. We've got a lot more studies to look at. It's not just one study. It's not just the cross-study comparison. There's going to be a lot more that goes into this. And we'll just have to see how this evolves.But the history of the industry typically is that, if there's just a couple of competitors, you have to remember that the size of this market. Last year it was about $22 billion of which about 70% or 75% was lung cancer. And that was largely driven by Keytruda sales. So there's a pretty big opportunity to have some important alternatives. And you just have to wait, I'm sorry Ronny to see how this all evolves when we roll this out. Let me just put a finer point on that. But just in a second. I completely agree with what George said. And I think if you listen carefully to what he was saying is that, because we're doing three different types of studies, the timing on the different studies might be quite different.If you're dealing with people, who already have the disease, then you're not waiting for that long period to occur, when you're trying to prevent the disease. And people who already have the disease, the cause of the disease sort of declares itself, over a several week to month period.And so you could imagine, depending upon what's going on. How many people are actually showing up at the hospital? How many people are hospitalized, in the ICU that that part could go a lot faster? But of course, you can imagine that George and the team have got a lot of great strategies, for the early part, to try and find people at high enough risk, which is the hard part in a preventative setting. Sorry next question. One second, Terence if I may. We appreciate all the comments from the analyst community thanking us for what we're doing. We just want to say. we find your notes very useful and very helpful. The coverage of this pandemic, the useful information that all of you provide and what's going on and what the rates are of this and that and what to be expected we really appreciate that as well. In terms of supply \u2013 yes I'll take that George. Thanks. In terms of supply, we've going as fast as we can. We have an amazing capability in technology that allows us to get high producing cell lines very rapidly. We know how to make antibodies. We are one of the companies that can do this from end-to-end seamlessly. And so I'm optimistic that we can expand from the initial numbers we talked about and continue to manufacture.We have had inquiries from multiple other companies about perhaps wanting to manufacture a cocktail when we have good data and we suspect maybe the government may want that to happen as well, where we can expand through collaborative efforts and sort of take the unprecedented step of letting some of our technology outside the company for this purpose as well, because that's what probably will need to be done. You can be sure we're getting together with our collaborator Sanofi on this and going to look carefully about how to move this forward and how to compete well with the data, we have and other data we want to get."

            "content": "Thanks Marion. For the first quarter of 2020, Regeneron delivered solid results on both the top and bottom line, despite COVID-19 beginning to impact our business operations in the latter half of March.Today, I will first briefly discuss the first quarter results and then conclude with our 2020 guidance, effective January 1, 2020 we implemented changes to our accounting presentation related to certain reimbursements and other payments from collaborators. As such our first quarter 2020 and comparable 2019 financial statements have been prepared under the new accounting presentation.We made these changes to better reflect the nature of the company's revenues earned and costs incurred pursuant to arrangements with collaborators. Importantly, these changes provide a simplified presentation of our financial results. They do not impact income from operations, income taxes, net income or net income per share. For more information regarding these changes please refer to the slide presentation in FAQ on the Regeneron Investor Relations website.Turning now to the results. First quarter 2020 revenues grew 33% year-over-year to $1.83 billion driven by continued growth of both EYLEA and Libtayo, as well as higher Sanofi collaboration revenues as a result of strong performance from our DUPIXENT franchise. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share grew 48% year-over-year to $6.60 on non-GAAP net income of $771 million.Since Marion discussed our U.S. EYLEA results, I will start with our Bayer and Sanofi collaborations. Starting with the Bayer collaboration. Ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales which are reported to us by Bayer were $682 million representing growth of 2% on a reported basis compared to the prior year.Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $281 million, an increase of 7%. We recorded $254 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S.. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue which under the new accounting presentation consists of our share of antibody profits and reimbursements for the manufacturing of commercial supplies was $247 million in the first quarter. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of non-IO antibodies was $171 million compared to a loss of $28 million in the prior period driven by higher DUPIXENT profits.Effective April 1, 2020, we finalized the planned PRALUENT restructuring with Sanofi. In the U.S., Regeneron will have sole responsibility for PRALUENT and we have begun recording net product sales as of April 1. Outside the U.S. Sanofi will have sole responsibility for PRALUENT and will pay Regeneron a 5% royalty on such net product sales, which we will record in other revenue. As for Kevzara, Regeneron and Sanofi continue to assess potential terms of this restructuring following the recently launched clinical program evaluating KEVZARA in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.Moving to our expense basis starting with R&D. Non-GAAP R&D increased 23% year-over-year to $527 million driven by advancements in our earlier stage pipeline, higher headcount and an increase in clinical manufacturing activities.Next first quarter 2020 non-GAAP SG&A expense increased 27% year-over-year to $307 million. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher headcount and commercial investments to support the continued growth of our business. First quarter 2020 non-GAAP cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing was $139 million compared to $101 million in the first quarter of 2019. The year-over-year increase in COCM was primarily due to manufacturing costs associated with higher global sales of DUPIXENT and manufacturing costs in connection with our BARDA Ebola agreement.Finally, we introduced a new line item called other operating income and expense this quarter. This line item is located within expenses and primarily consists of the recognition of upfront payments and development milestones that were initially deferred and are recognized over time from our collaborators Sanofi, Teva and Mitsubishi Tanabe. For the first quarter of 2020, we recorded other operating income of $40 million compared to income of $57 million recorded in the first quarter of 2019.Turning now to taxes. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 9.5% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 16% in the first quarter of 2019. The year-over-year decline in the non-GAAP effective tax rate was due to increased tax benefits associated with stock option exercises in the first quarter of 2020.Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. For the first quarter of 2020, Regeneron generated $528 million in free cash flow. In the quarter, we repurchased $273 million worth of shares in open market transactions. The pace of share repurchases slowed considerably towards the end of the first quarter of 2020 given the recent share price appreciation. Our fully diluted share count that we report for a given quarter is highly sensitive to the average stock price. If the average stock price for the second quarter is similar to the current stock price levels, we would estimate that our weighted average share count used for calculating non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter will be in the range of 121 million to 123 million shares. And finally to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $7.2 billion in minimal debt.Now I'd like to spend a few moments to discuss the financial outlook for the remainder of the year. We assume that the COVID-19 impact on our business will peak in the second quarter 2020. We anticipate a recovery as the year progresses, as economies gradually reopen, social distancing guidelines are relaxed and doctor and hospital visits return to prior levels. From a supply chain and manufacturing perspective, Regeneron has historically maintained high levels of inventory in the event of a prolonged impact to our manufacturing and production capabilities.Currently, we see minimal disruptions to our supply chain and our manufacturing activities and we have adequate supply of commercial product on hand to meet demand. Our 2020 annual financial guidance reflects our latest assessment of our business in this current environment with limited precision. Certain elements of our spend will be dictated by the continued severity and length of the COVID-19 impact in our efforts associated with KEVZARA and our SARS-CoV-2 antibody cocktail. These factors may materially impact our guidance. We will assess carefully whether further updates to our guidance may be warranted.Now moving to our 2020 financial guidance. And starting with R&D, we forecast our 2020 non-GAAP R&D expenses to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.04 billion. We are continuing to invest in our pipeline and research capabilities which remain critical to the long-term growth of the business. Our oncology pipeline continues to grow. And as conditions allow, we intend to advance programs through development.Additionally, we are funding external partnership obligations, as jointly developed molecules are rapidly advancing. Our R&D guidance also includes the portion related to our COVID-19 activities where we will be reimbursed at least in part by BARDA. Unlike R&D reimbursements from collaborations which are netted in the R&D expense line item under the new accounting presentation, these reimbursements from BARDA will continue to be recorded in other revenue.Next to SG&A. We forecast our 2020 non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.29 billion. We are continuing to invest for product growth now and once the COVID-19 impact abates. For EYLEA, we are continuing to make investments in diabetic eye diseases. For Libtayo, launch preparations are underway for anticipated launches in basal cell and non-small cell lung cancer.Starting this year, we are providing guidance for COGS and COCM. For COGS, we forecast 2020 non-GAAP expenses to be in the range of $295 million to $355 million, primarily comprised of U.S. EYLEA, U.S. Libtayo and U.S. PRALUENT manufacturing costs in the payment of Sanofi for 50% of the gross margin associated with U.S. Libtayo.For COCM, we forecast 2020 non-GAAP expenses to be in the range of $600 million to $700 million, primarily comprised of global DUPIXENT, global KEVZARA, x U.S. EYLEA, x U.S. PRALUENT and Regeneron EB3 manufacturing costs. As a reminder, we are reimbursed for COCM costs, reimbursements are recognized within the Sanofi and Bayer collaboration revenue lines and other revenues. Reimbursements should closely approximate COCM expenses for quarterly reporting periods subject to timing and other considerations.For the new line item of operating income and expense, we expect this to be in the range of $175 million to $205 million of income this year. And finally the tax, we anticipate our 2020 non-GAAP effective tax guidance to be in the range of 12% to 14%.In conclusion, we had a solid start to the year despite initial impacts from COVID-19. Our balance sheet increasingly diversified commercial portfolio and robust pipeline enabled Regeneron to withstand the impacts of COVID-19, while making prudent investments in executing on meaningful near-term opportunities to position Regeneron for sustained long-term growth.With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Justin."

            "name": "George Yancopoulos",
            "content": "Thank you, Len. And since the devastating COVID-19 crisis is foremost on everyone's mind I will first discuss our efforts in this area. As you all know, our state of the art and proprietary VelociSuite technologies, which we have built over the last few decades. It can be very powerful for responding to new targets and pathogens, as we recently proved by rapidly creating an antiviral antibody cocktail as an effective treatment for Ebola.Recall, the FDA recently granted priority review to this treatment for Ebola with the target action date of October 25, 2020 based on the results of the Phase 3 PALM clinical trial conducted in the Congo, which was stopped early because of our Regeneron EB3 antibody cocktail proving superior and preventing death compared to the previous standard of care the so-called ZMapp antibody as well as to Remdesivir.In terms of COVID-19, while society is awaiting an effective vaccine that could still be a year or two away, we are employing a two-pronged approach that could serve as a useful bridge and/or as an alternative to a vaccine. First and most importantly, we are developing a novel antiviral antibody cocktail just as we did for Ebola. We have already announced that we have utilized our VelociSuite technologies to rapidly generate and select thousands of potent antiviral fully human antibodies from both our genetically humanized Velocimmune mice as well as from convalescencing human volunteers, creating what we believe is the largest and deepest collection of potent antiviral antibodies to choose from.We have selected two distinct antibody cocktails from this collection, our initial cocktail as well as the backup. And we have already begun large-scale manufacturing and anticipate initiating clinical trials with elite cocktail in June. With Ebola, we set the record of nine months from initiating the project to starting human trials. Now, we hope to break that record with five months from project initiation to the clinic. Based on our experience with the Ebola and other viruses, we hope that this specifically designed antiviral approach has a significant chance for success in providing both a prophylactic treatment to prevent infection in those at risk as well as for treating those already infected and symptomatic.Our second major COVID-19 approach involves repurposing KEVZARA our anti IL-6 receptor antibody approved in rheumatoid arthritis. Based on a small uncontrolled case series from China, there was reason to believe that blocking the IL-6 pathway might address the underlying inflammation leading to acute respiratory distress in so-called severe COVID-19 patients meaning hospitalized patients needing oxygen support, but not on ventilators as opposed to so-called critical patients, who largely require ventilators.We initiated an adaptive Phase 2/3 trial to explore KEVZARA in both the severe and critical patient populations. Our initial data from both the Phase 2 and Phase 3 portion of the trial indicated that KEVZARA at least at the doses tested which paralleled those used in the China reports did not provide a major benefit for severe patients.On the other hand the Phase 2 portion of the trial suggested a potential benefit in critical patients. And the Phase 3 trial in this group is ongoing. Additional efforts, both in our program and by our Sanofi partners in Europe, and the rest of the world are further testing both of these populations, including at higher doses. Our results and efforts with KEVZARA highlight the challenges with using repurposed drugs, the inability to rely on uncontrolled and even small controlled trials and thus the importance of running large well controlled Phase 3 studies to obtain real answers as to whether a drug has benefit and the quantitative extent of that benefit even in a pandemic setting.It is important to point out that our efforts with COVID-19 are being developed under an ongoing collaboration with BARDA, a division within the U. S. Department of Health and Human services and also involve incredibly collaborative relationships with so many critical partners from the FDA to the leadership of New York State to the many hospitals and physicians at the front lines, who make the effort to engage in these trials and the many stricken patients who volunteer to participate.I also want to thank all the individuals at Regeneron who have continued to work tirelessly on these programs despite all the logistical and operational and health challenges created by the COVID-19 crisis.Moving on from COVID-19, I first want to touch upon our EYLEA programs. Physicians consider safety to be essential in selecting anti-VEGF treatment. Over the last several months, another recently approved anti-VEGF product was recently associated with the serious new vision-threatening safety concern involving occlusive retinal vasculitis in the context of intraocular inflammation.In light of the frequency and serious nature of the safety concern, Regeneron and our partner Bayer conducted a broad review of our clinical trial database as well as our post-marketing global safety database to identify any similar safety events with EYLEA.In the critical trial database from eight Phase III trials involving tens of thousands of injections, there was no reports consistent with the safety concern. Moreover in the extensive post-marketing experience involving more than 32 million doses of EYLEA sold in more than 100 countries worldwide since its approval more than eight years ago, the rate of any possibly related safety event was less than one out of every 6 million EYLEA doses sold.And such cases were always associated with presumed infectious Endophthalmitis. Thus based on our reviews of the EYLEA clinical trial database and post-marketing surveillance occlusive retinal vasculitis in the context of intraocular inflammation does not appear to be a safety concern with the use of EYLEA.Next, I want to discuss DUPIXENT. Later this month, we anticipate an FDA decision extending DUPIXENT approval to six to 11-year old children suffering from atopic dermatitis. DUPIXENT would be the first biological indicator for this pediatric population.We hope this potential approval will continue to reflect the remarkable safety profile of DUPIXENT as evidenced by the absence of a black box warning or any associated serious infection risks which are often seen with immunomodulatory biologics and with JAK inhibitors.We also expect FDA action on our 300-milligram auto-injector which would allow for an additional dimension of convenience to an already strong profile for the medicine. Additionally, later this year, we anticipate data from our Phase III pediatric asthma trial the Phase II portion of our eosinophilic esophagitis program and we remind you that we have pivotal studies in chronic spontaneous urticarial, prurigo nodularis, and bullous pemphigoid, as well as studies in oral immunotherapy with our collaborator Aimmune.We continue to build on DUPIXENT's story which has already changed the lives of so many people suffering from type 2 inflammatory diseases such as asthma atopic dermatitis and chronic rhinositis with nasal polyps with more than 150,000 patients treated globally since launch.Next, I'm excited to share important updates on our immuno-oncology efforts. As you know most cancer patients are still not successfully addressed with immune therapies leaving us with a major challenge of enhancing responsiveness in tumor settings where immune therapies already have some efficacy such as lung and melanoma, while also trying to extend the benefit to patients with tumors that are currently not highly responsive such as prostate, pancreas, and colon.Having our own effective anti PD-1 antibody is foundational for our efforts to enhance and extend the benefits of immunotherapy as we had hoped such an antibody could play an important role both as a monotherapy but also in combination with other antibodies and bispecifics derived from our own homegrown pipeline as well as in combination with a number of collaborative agents and vaccines.Defying early optimism, developing effective anti PD-1 antibodies has proven to be very challenging. It is remarkable that in the decade since the first approval of an immuno-oncology agent, only one PD-1 antibody has been approved as monotherapy in first line non-small cell lung cancer.Although that therapy has on its own completely changed the paradigm of how lung cancer is treated. At the end of last year we announced interim results from our first line non-small cell lung cancer study in so-called PD-L1 high patients. Revealing that our PD-1 antibody Libtayo as monotherapy had objective response rates of 42% compared to 22% for chemotherapy indicating profound clinical activity.Just last week, we announced that the independent data monitoring committee recommendation led to an early termination of this Libtayo monotherapy trial due to a highly significant improvement in overall survival with Libtayo decreasing the risk of debt by 32.4% compared to the platinum doublet chemotherapy.This result was obtained early despite a third of the patients entering the trial within the past six months and chemotherapies -- chemotherapy patients being able to cross over to Libtayo upon disease progression. No new Libtayo safety signal was identified. We are planning to present detailed trial data at a future medical meeting and will complete regulatory submissions in the next few months.And just this morning, we announced that we had identified yet another first-in-class cancer setting where Libtayo as monotherapy exhibited profound and clinically meaningful activity just as we had previously done for squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or CSCC where Libtayo is rapidly becoming standard of care.Our potentially pivotal study in second-line advanced basal cell carcinoma of the skin or BCC demonstrated clinically meaningful response rates of nearly 30% in locally advanced patients who had progressed on prior Hedgehog inhibitor treatment.Impressively, more than 85% of the patients who responded to treatment have experienced durable responses of more than 12 months. We intend to submit dated to regulatory authorities in the coming months. Basal cell carcinoma presents another promising opportunity to extend our dermato-oncology portfolio beyond the current squamous cell carcinoma indication.BCC is the most common cancer in the world, while only a very small percentage of cases require systemic therapy, the extremely large incidence of this cancer means that there are still thousands of people with advanced basal cell carcinoma in need of treatment.I'd like to frame the significance of these milestones for cancer patients and for Regeneron. In aggregate, our studies have now demonstrated that Libtayo is a potent and effective PD-1 monotherapy treatment, where we now have the potential subject to regulatory approval to offer patients with lung cancer, a competitive alternative.In addition and very unexpectedly to some, we have now been able to identify two new cancer settings where PD-1 monotherapy demonstrates profound clinical activity based on our studies. First, advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and now advanced basal cell carcinoma of the skin.Moreover as Libtayo is establishing itself as a leading PD-1 antibody for monotherapy and allows us to pursue our strategy of using it in combinations to enhance and extend benefit. For example, we are investigating Libtayo in combination studies with our two classes of bispecifics, our CD3 class as well as our custom class. That is we have already initiated a trial combining Libtayo with our PSMA costim bispecific to try to endow responsiveness in prostate cancer.We have also initiated a trial combining Libtayo with our MUC16 by CD3 bispecific to enhance responsiveness in ovarian cancer. We're also starting trials combining Libtayo with our other checkpoint inhibitors and with other collaborative assets. For example, we have initiated a trial combining Libtayo with our LAG3 antibody to try to enhance responsiveness of first line melanoma where we are also combining Libtayo with various collaboration assets and vaccines.I should note that, although all our programs are being impacted by the COVID-19 crisis and additional future impacts are difficult to predict, our bispecific programs which have been particularly affected are ones that we are working very hard on to try to continue to enroll. Our potential in pivotal programs for our CD20 by C3 bispecific are enrolling in relapse refractory follicular lymphoma in relapsed refractory diffuse large b-cell lymphoma and in this setting following CAR-T cell therapy failure.We anticipate full enrollment over the next year. And I remind you that we have demonstrated very promising initial efficacy and durability in all of these settings. Similarly, our BCMA by CD3 bispecific for myeloma is continuing to enroll in its proof-of-concept study where it continues to deliver promising activity as is our MUC16 by CD3 bispecific for ovarian carcinoma.All together, these are very exciting times for immuno-oncology here at Regeneron, as we believe we have therapies that are showing important promise as monotherapies as well as the opportunity to combine and match these therapies as is appropriate to enhance and extend the benefit for additional cancer patients in need.Before handing the call over to Marion, let me conclude with a couple of brief updates on other areas of the pipeline. We are on track to complete our regulatory submissions for evinacumab, our ANGPTL3 antibody for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patients later this year. Recall, in our Phase III trial, evinacumab reduced LDL or bad cholesterol by an impressive 49% in patients not well controlled with other lipid-lowering treatments including anti PCSK9.We're also planning an FDA submission of the data package for GARETOSMAB, our Activin A Antibody for fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva in the second half of 2020, following dramatic results showing 90% reduction in new bone lesion formation and pending confirmation of these data from the second half of the study. We continue to explore the process of our C5 antibody and the potentially game-changing nature of the combination of this antibody with the siRNA program, which we are performing in combination with Alnylam. We continue to move forward with intent on initiating registration studies over the next 12 months.Finally, the opioid crisis continues and the need for alternative chronic pain solutions remain. We are making progress with fasinumab, our nerve growth factor antibody for osteoarthritis pain. We completed enrollment in our Phase III studies last year and we are expecting to see data midyear.With that I will turn the call over to Marion. And I guess that most importantly, as we noted, the lung field is dominated by leading antibody that has produced the most impressive data. We are very excited that our monotherapy trial has delivered data that looks very impressive in terms of the overall survival endpoint. And we have an ongoing combination trial with chemotherapy as well that we're excited about having it read out over the coming year or so.And so I think that this is going to position us well in such a large opportunity, where physicians and patients are looking for alternatives to have an agent that has such profound activity as a monotherapy. But in addition, we have all these combination programs that I was referring to. We have we believe one of the most exciting homegrown pipelines of additional agents that we could combine to not only enhance the activity in these settings where the PD-1 monotherapies are already active, but also to extend to new settings and new indications, such as I mentioned, whether it be prostate cancer or ovarian cancer or others where right now the activity is not what we would want.So I think that we've put ourselves into a pretty exciting position, where we have some of the most exciting agents with identified profound clinical activity as monotherapies, but we now have the opportunity to mix and match these as is appropriate to enhance and extend the activity. So we're very excited about the oncology situation. Yes. Those are great questions. So what we were able to generate, because we have these very robust platforms both the ability to get fully human antibodies from our genetically humanized mouse model, as well as from recovering humans. We generated a collection of thousands and thousands of antibodies.Getting many antibodies that really were at the top end historically at the best level of binders and blockers and antiviral neutralizers that you've ever seen based on the literature and the history. And so what we did was, we simply selected several cocktails of the best antibodies where we put them together, and we created our initial cocktail and a backup cocktail just in case for some reason something goes wrong with the initial cocktail. So they're actually quite similar. It's just a different collection of antibodies for the backup as well as for the primary.Now we think that based on the history of treating infectious disease and viral diseases with highly potent neutralizing antibodies, the risks of things such as antibody-dependent enhancement and so forth are actually quite limited. You actually see these, for example, in certain classes of viruses, the Flaviviruses, the dengue type viruses and so forth in particular, but that's because of the biology of the viruses there.With most other viruses when you have highly potent neutralizing antibodies these risks are mitigated. We do have -- in addition to our backup collection of antibodies, we do also have our antibody cocktails made with what we call Uber-stealth constant [ph] regions, which would completely mitigate against that possibility. But for the current approaches that we're taking, we're going to be going forward with the fully armed antibodies, because we think the risks of ADE with very potent neutralizing antibodies is actually quite low.So I think that the history of antiviral antibodies, our experience the way they work our own antibodies and other programs most notably in Ebola, we think that there's a very significant chance that these specifically designed, very potent neutralizing antibodies will have a significant impact on the disease. We think that there's a great chance that they can be very powerful prophylactic and preventive agents. But we also think that they can treat patients who are already symptomatic with disease.And we don't think that right now there's any evidence that suggests that the antibody response is what's contributing to the inflammatory responses in the lung. And as, of course, as has already been seen and described in the disease, the majority of patients do recover and their recovery is coincident with their producing viral responses.So altogether I think there's a lot of reason to have a lot of hope that this approach really has a chance to make a difference as we said both in prophylactic treatment, but also in treating symptomatic patients. Well, we're planning on doing three sets of trials in the prophylactic or prevention setting in people who are at high-risk in early treatment that is patients who are not at the level that they would be normally hospitalized. But patients who are identified they're symptomatic. If they do go to an ER, they are sent home, but they don't need oxygen support.However, significant number of them do develop more serious disease and then have to return to the hospital. So the idea would be to stop the disease in those individuals and stop the progression and the need from them going back to the hospital. And then we're also going to go to the hospitalized setting very similar to what we're doing with KEVZARA and where the Remdesivir data has read out.So certainly, the only setting where it would be on top of an existing standard-of-care potentially would be in the late treatment setting, we would certainly be going on top of standard- f care there whether it be Remdesivir or maybe we'll see whether there's data from other agents by that time as well.In the prophylactic setting, there is no need and there's also no other standard of care and in the same thing in the early treatment. And I would remind you once again that based as I said on our experience in other programs and most notably a good example is the Ebola program, the earlier that one treats, the better one does.I remind you early in the disease for Ebola, which is obviously a much more lethal disease with much higher levels of severe disease and death we were able to save more than 90% of the patients when we went with early treatment. So I think that there's a lot of reason to think that in this setting these sorts of antibodies both in the prophylactic setting and in the early treatment setting can have really profound benefits on their own. Len, you want to take that? Len? Well, yeah. I think that, these are all great questions. We're in unprecedented times. I think that, the urgency and the collaborative spirit between regulators, between medical institutions, between companies, it has never been seen before. And also our commitment to this is something we've sort of done it before. But now we're trying to take it to the next level.So we are planning, as we said in June to simultaneously initiate trials, in the three settings that we're actually talking about. We are thinking of ways to synergize between the three classes of trials that we're talking about. And we are hoping -- I mean this is going to depend on a lot of factors. And there's obviously a lot of risk and concerns, whether this can be done, since it hasn't ever been done before.But we are really hoping that, we'll be able to not only initiate these studies, but able within a month or two to perhaps if these agents are working as well as we might hope they would work, as well as for example some of the precedents set by Ebola suggest that they might work, that we might within that month or two be getting data.If we were to get data, within those sort of timeframes as Len describes we have already committed at risk to manufacturing the drug supply this could be providing by the end of the summer, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of doses, of these antibodies. So, you're right. It's never been done before.On the other hand, I don't think we ever had quite a pandemic like this before. And I think that, some companies like ours have really put themselves in a position with the technologies, the commitments, the investments that we've made to put ourselves in a position, to maybe help out and make a difference here.And regulators like the FDA, BARDA everybody is coming together to try to help us in this situation to meet the urgency and meet the dire need that we might have here. And so the hope is yes, it might be possible by the end of the summer or the fall that, our antibody treatment could be available. A lot of risks, a lot of concerns, but we are working as hard as we can with so many collaborators to try to turn that into a reality. Yes, great questions. I guess, first of all, basically, we think that, the bispecific costims. We've described these in the literature. We have a lot of data on them. On their own they are designed to essentially have very little or no activity. And only when combined with either a CD3 bispecific or with a PD-1 agent do they then essentially synergize and amplify the benefit or activate the benefit of the other agent.And we've done a lot of work on that. Quite a bit of published work has already been shown on that. And the early data in the clinic are supporting that in that the monotherapy costim was not intended and did not show single-agent activity. We are now in the combination program, where we are hoping to now activate activity by adding the costim to the PD-1.That's how they were designed, that's what we're hoping to see and that is what we are hoping to be able to generate data that we will be giving you information on in the future. In terms of the promising activity, I think that yes, we have seen robust activity with the BCMA. We have not really reported anything on the MUC16. I can say that we are seeing evidence of activity and we'll give you more details on that in future times. Okay. Well, basically we have accumulated over many years now, a lot of understanding about the doses that one needs to block viral infection particularly of respiratory and other diseases. So we actually know both in animal models and in humans the blood levels to block respiratory infection. And so we are targeting to be significantly above those blood levels for a minimum of at least a month for the prophylactic setting.So there's no guarantees. Once again these are all predictions based on experience in other programs with other viruses but including for example, the MERS coronavirus. And so we believe we have a good target blood level that we need to meet and achieve and stay above on for at least a month for the prophylaxis setting.And so the prophylaxis dosing is intended to last for at least a month. For example in our RSV program \u2013 for one of our programs there, we were able to have protection for several months. So minimum of a month is our current target based on maintaining blood levels that we believe you have to maintain above for preventing infection by respiratory viruses. What was the rest of the question? Yes. Our viewpoint with fasinumab is that for a long time now as obviously, I think most people appreciate is that in many ways, this is a very risky program in that. There are \u2013 there is a now well-defined adverse event that we are trying to tighter around with the dose. And I think the major question for this program is whether we have been able to find a dose that threads the needle between the safety concern and between providing sufficient benefit to patients.I think if you see other competitors' data here, it's been a little difficult for others to thread the needle. So this is what we're going to see, especially when we see the data that comes out from our ongoing program that we'll be getting by the middle of this year, how well we've done to actually find a magic spot on the dose response curve, where we have sufficient safety but sufficient benefit and how that might compare to what others have achieved.So we are as anxious and excited as you are to see whether we may have threaded this needle in a way that really provides an important alternative for patients as we know there is a crying, literally a crying need here for new pain medications and particularly for the osteoarthritis population and we are hoping that we may have threaded that needle. Right. I think that this is really a landmark for the field, but also for us. Keytruda has stood really unchallenged now particularly in lung cancer, which is driving most of the sales for this entire field. Because others haven't actually been able to show that they've had a Keytruda-like agent. I think that I understand the concerns about people talking about how are you going to compete?But having something that's already showing this profound clinical activity that we're now seeing as a monotherapy with also, having also identified this is another thing that people have to appreciate new first-in-class indications that have been missed by the rest of the field. First with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma now with basal cell, I think are establishing Libtayo as a legitimate monotherapy alternative.And as Len said, when you have opportunities such as $8 billion opportunities in first line history shows that bona fide competitors with profound clinical activity they are going to get significant shares. But I think, it's exactly as you said, we believe we are now in a position where we can compete in these monotherapy situations, but it only amplifies our excitement and our commitment to the combination approach. And of course, as you say we are working hard to find the right outside collaborators. And I think we've already announced quite a few of them that we're very excited about, that we're already starting combination studies on and so forth, but we are just as excited about our internal homegrown pipeline.We have been preparing, a series of combination assets just for this moment now where we will have this potent powerful PD-1 antibody of our own. Our entire strategy depended on it and now that the molecule has come through and proved that it really is a bona fide monotherapy competitor out there we are now just doubly motivated and compelled to now build upon that with all these combination opportunities that have been coming out of our labs for the last few years. So we could not be more excited that we will now have the ability to not only compete as a monotherapy, but now to add with all these combinations, all these bispecifics, the costim bispecifics and so forth as well as these collaboration assets. And we think this is a really exciting time not only for us, but for the field because I hope you all realize how the immuno-oncology field despite all the initial excitement has not moved forth as much as I think we all would have wanted it to have moved forward.We haven't seen the magic combinations. We haven't seen the dramatic increases in to new cancers. We think we have the opportunity to take that field to the next level and having the foundational PD-1 antibody of our own really gives us that opportunity. So these are really exciting times for us, but I think for the field that -- for the first time in a decade maybe substantial new advances, a new age of immuno-oncology may be coming now. Yes. I think that we have been already in active conversation with regulators exactly on the points that you talk about. And I think these are unprecedented times and I think also when you have the history with these types of agents, it does allow you and it does allow the comfort of the regulators that one could be moving forward very quickly. And so as you might imagine along the lines of the things that you proposed these are exactly the sorts of things that we're talking about with regulators. And we're trying to employ into our designs.In terms of your second part of your question, I think, Len already started talking about this point, which is we have made a huge commitment to enable our entire upstate New York manufacturing facility to be devoted to this effort, which on its own could supply hundreds of thousands if not over the course of time maybe even on the order of a million or so doses per month. However, even that might not be sufficient depending on the demand, depending on whether there's a second wave, depending on what happens with vaccines and so forth. So we are actively talking about collaborations with others who are very interested in bringing their resources to the table here too.As we said, there's enormous collaborative spirit that I think we haven't seen before between companies to come together, to help each other out, to really make a difference here in this pandemic. And so that opportunity is really out there. We're actively talking with people. And of course it all depends on whether these antibodies deliver. But if they deliver and depending on the state of the pandemic if there's more need I am sure that there will be ways that either we on our own or with major collaborations will be able to supply more to more patients. Stay safe."

With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.\nDr. Len Schleifer: Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. The fourth quarter of 2021 capped off a terrific year for Regeneron. Our performance was driven by strong execution across the organization, despite the ongoing challenges posed by COVID-19. We're all proud of the incredible work and dedication of our employees who continuously deliver on our mission to bring important medicines and novel medical breakthroughs to patients in need. Throughout 2021, we delivered strong top and bottom line growth. Revenues, excluding our COVID antibody cocktail, grew 19%, a testament of our diversified and strengthening core business. Our innovative and world-class pipeline advanced across a wide variety of diseases. We also unveiled initial clinical data and pipeline advancements from our Regeneron Genetics medicines portfolio, which has the potential to unlock significant long-term value. Additionally, we returned substantial cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks. In '21, we spent approximately $1.7 billion repurchasing over 3 million shares. For EYLEA, 2021 global sales grew 19% to $9.4 billion. Even after 10 years on the market and millions of injections later, we continue to view EYLEA as an enduring product, with significant future opportunity, despite new market entries. In the second half of the year, we look forward to the results from our Phase III aflibercept 8-milligram high-dose program. If those data continue to support that aflibercept 8 milligrams provides extended dosing duration without compromising on safety and efficacy, aflibercept 8 milligrams has the potential to complement and enhance our retinal franchise. With Dupixent, we are delivering on a goal of transforming the treatment of type 2 inflammatory diseases. 2021 global sales of Dupixent were $6.2 billion, representing 53% growth for the year. Looking ahead, Dupixent's outlook is bright. There are significant opportunities to increase market penetration rates in approved indications, and we are in the midst of a wave of new data submissions and launches in potential new indications, further fueling Dupixent's growth. In oncology, Libtayo continues to thrive in the approved non-melanoma skin cancers. We look forward to potential Libtayo plus chemotherapy approval later this year in the broader population of non-small cell lung cancer patients. Our oncology footprint continues to expand. We have advanced many candidates and combinations into the clinic with a range of antibodies, bispecifics and co-stimulatory bispecifics across many cancer settings. This year, we look forward to sharing what we hope will be groundbreaking data in difficult-to-treat solid tumors, such as prostate cancers and ovarian cancers, both of which are conditions with historically low response rates to immunotherapy. We also remain encouraged in the progress of our maturing CD3 bispecifics. We are confident in the overall safety and efficacy profile for odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific. We are forging ahead with REGN5458, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific, which we believe will play an active role in the treatment of multiple myeloma given its competitive profile. Last but not least, we are immensely proud of our rapid response efforts against COVID-19. In 2021, REGEN-COV, our antibody cocktail, was administered to millions of people globally, making a major impact during the darkest days of the pandemic. Based on preclinical data, we recently announced that REGEN-COV is highly unlikely to be active against the Omicron variant. Appropriately, the FDA amended the emergency use authorization for REGEN-COV, limiting its use in the U.S. in light of the Omicron variant being dominant. Regeneron remains committed to helping fight the COVID-19 pandemic. We are progressing next-generation antibodies that are active against Omicron, Delta and other variants of concern. We are scaling up manufacturing efforts and completing the necessary requirements to begin clinical trials for next-generation candidate in the coming months. Concurrently, we are working closely and collaboratively with the FDA and other global regulatory authorities to establish and define clinical pathways to bring additional safe and effective monoclonal antibody treatment options to patients as quickly as possible. As one of the leaders in the fight against COVID-19, our VelociSuite platform of technologies makes us uniquely positioned to promptly develop and deliver potentially life-saving medicines. As the COVID-19 story transforms from pandemic to endemic, we believe there will remain a significant opportunity to use our next-generation monoclonals as a prevention for those immunocompromised individuals who do not respond adequately to COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, monoclonal antibody therapy is likely to play an ongoing role in treatment for infected individuals. In conclusion, 2021 was another high-performance year for Regeneron. With strong commercial results from our in-line marketed products, 30-plus pipeline candidates progressing through clinical trials, our discovery efforts firing on all cylinders, a growing portfolio of highly productive external collaborations and our strong financial position with over $12 billion in cash and marketable securities, Regeneron is extremely well positioned for the future. Now I will turn the call over to George.\nDr. George Yancopoulos: Thanks, Len. I'll start by briefly addressing our novel monoclonal antibodies for COVID-19. As Len mentioned, we are rapidly developing next-generation antibodies that retain potency against Omicron and other variants of concern. Early in 2019, we anticipated that the virus would mutate and, thus, began generating large pools of virus-neutralizing antibody candidates from both human survivors and our VelocImmune mice. We have continually evaluated and refreshed this pool and now have next-generation candidates that, based on preclinical studies, effectively neutralize Omicron and other variants of concern. We're on track to initiate clinical trials with the first of these in the coming months. In addition, we are in discussions with the FDA regarding how to streamline the development program for monoclonal antibodies, considering the unwavering unmet need and demand for these medicines, especially with potential future virus variants in mind. As Len already highlighted, since we believe that monoclonal antibodies will continue to play an especially important role in the treatment of future protection of the several million immunocompromised people in the United States alone, we are committed to undertaking a development pathway that will make this possible in the near future. Moving on to ophthalmology. At the upcoming Angiogenesis meeting, we will present the final Phase II data from the aflibercept 8-milligram CANDELA study in patients with wet AMD. In this study, aflibercept 8 milligram, given at the same protocol-specified dosing schedule, as currently approved EYLEA 2-milligram met its primary safety endpoint, with measures of drawing numerically favoring the 8-milligram dose over the 2-milligram dose. These two -- these Phase II results give us more confidence that the upcoming Phase III readouts has a potential to show that the higher 8-milligram aflibercept dose can at least match the efficacy and safety of EYLEA, but with more convenient dosing. Moving on to Dupixent. Building on the outstanding clinical success Dupixent has shown so far across a wide spectrum of allergic or type 2 inflammatory diseases, the second Phase III study in prurigo nodularis recently met primary and key secondary endpoints, making Dupixent the first and only systemic medicine to demonstrate such success in this indication. These data confirm the results from the first Phase III trial, where 60% of Dupixent patients met the primary endpoint of its reduction compared to 18% of placebo patients at 24 weeks. Nearly 3x many Dupixent patients experienced reduced skin lesions compared to placebo as well. Prurigo nodularis marks the sixth disease for which Dupixent has demonstrated profound benefit for patients, providing convincing evidence that the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways inhibited by Dupixent are the key drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying all of these diseases. We have to appreciate how remarkable the Dupixent story is in terms of the important benefit it provides for the many patients across this diverse set of clinical conditions, together with its well-established safety profile, and highlights how Dupixent is delivering on its promise of providing a pipeline in a product. At the upcoming AAAAI meeting, in addition to the other important Dupixent updates, we will present pivotal results for the recent top line studies in eosinophilic esophagitis, or EOE, and for the first chronic spontaneous urticaria, or CSU study. EOE is a complex disease, and we are excited to share these data with the scientific community and patients. Our first regulatory submission for EOE in adolescents and adults is underway, with regulatory submissions for prurigo nodularis also starting in the first half of this year. Anticipated flow of Dupixent-related clinical data update continues. We are planning on reporting results in an additional Phase III study in CSU this time in omalizumab experienced patients and also for the chronic cold-induced urticaria indication in the second half of this year. These represents more difficult-to-treat patients or condition and present a higher bar for Dupixent. We're looking forward to results of these pivotal studies. Moving on to oncology and first Libtayo. Progress in our oncology portfolio includes pivotal readouts and regulatory filings for Libtayo presented an anticipated data readouts for our bispecifics as well as multiple upcoming milestones with novel diversified pipeline entrants. As Len mentioned, the Libtayo chemotherapy combination for patients with non-small cell lung cancer is under review at the FDA with a PDUFA date of September 19, 2022, which could address a larger portion of the patients with lung cancer. In hematology, at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting, we presented encouraging data for REGN5458, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific, investigated for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, with safety data that has shown no grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome to date and strong efficacy data. We believe our investigational agent is promising and has the potential to be competitive in this indication. We are planning on investigating this product for earlier lines of myeloma therapy, in combination with standard of care, and are excited about the combination with an appropriate co-stimulatory bispecific, which could further enhance responses. Odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific, has the potential for a best-in-class efficacy profile in both follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and our updated step-up dosing protocol may mitigate safety concerns and decrease the need for hospitalizations to manage cytokine release syndrome. In terms of progress of our bispecifics for solid tumors, as previously disclosed, we are observing early signs of activity for our MUC16xCD3 bispecific monotherapy developed for late-stage ovarian cancer, and we are excited to be sharing these early data later this year. In addition to monotherapy, the MUC16xCD3 bispecific is being investigated in combination with Libtayo and in a first of its kind in a combination trial with a MUC16xCD28 bispecific. These combinations are in early stages that are advancing through dose escalations. Later this year, we are hoping to share initial results for a unique biparatopic METXMET antibody studied in advanced non-small cell cancer patients with MET protein alterations. Early signs of clinical activity we have observed so far with the naked METXMET bispecific antibody, especially in patients with MET overexpression, bode well for our follow-on agents, the METXMET bispecific antibody drug conjugate, which is now enrolling patients in a Phase I study. We are also excited about our early-stage EGFRxCD28 co-stimulatory bispecific program for lung and other cancers. For prostate cancer, we are expecting initial readouts from our first co-stimulatory bispecific PSMAxCD28 later this year as well. PSMAxCD28 is progressing through dose escalation in combination with Libtayo. We are excited about the potential of our broad oncology portfolio, which includes multiple Phase I, II and III assets, as many are beginning to believe the future is going to involve the right combination of targeted immunotherapy agents. Concluding with our Regeneron Genetic medicines efforts, we and our collaborators have made significant strides in expanding the capabilities and scale of our groundbreaking work in genetics medicines. In terms of our siRNA collaboration with Alnylam, ALN-HSD is progressing through healthy volunteers, and initial data in NASH patients are anticipated by the middle of this year. With the C5 siRNA and the antibody combination, another first of its kind, healthy volunteer data were presented at ASH, demonstrating PK and PD results supportive of the monthly subcutaneous dosing regimen selected for pivotal studies. Phase III studies of the combination for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH, were also initiated. Recall, in PNH, we are planning to test our combination in both naive and switch patients tested against standard of care therapies, including ravulizumab and eculizumab. Also Alnylam has recently announced submission of the CTA application for ALN-APP, the industry's first-ever investigational RNAi therapeutic for CNS diseases. This agent will be evaluated in both the relatively rare disease driven by amyloid precursor protein, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or CAA, as well as in early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Finally, later this quarter, we and Intellia will provide our -- an update on our joint TTR CRISPR-based knockout program for transthyretin amyloidosis. This will include additional ascending dose interim clinical data from the polyneuropathy arm of the ongoing Intellia 2001 Phase I study. We have also expanded the study to include patients with transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, which we believe will address an even broader patient population. We are very excited by our large and diverse pipeline of siRNA candidates that we are advancing with Alnylam, ranging from targeting the liver, the brain and the eye, as well as our CRISPR-based approaches in collaboration with Intellia and our viral-targeted gene delivery programs, such as with Decibel. While still early, we think these groundbreaking approaches have the potential to change the practice of medicine. And with that, I will turn the call over to Marion.\nMarion McCourt: Thank you, George. Our fourth quarter business performance demonstrated the strength and resilience of our in-line brands and creates a foundation for commercial success as we prepare for future launches. Starting with EYLEA. We recently announced fourth quarter U.S. net sales of $1.55 billion and $5.79 billion in 2021. This represented 17% year-over-year U.S. growth for the full year, which is noteworthy for a brand 10 years post launch. EYLEA reached record share across all approved indications and is the recognized leader in a category that continues to grow due to favorable demographic trends. EYLEA remains physicians' top choice for patients with indicated retinal diseases due to its demonstrated efficacy, safety, dosing flexibility and unsurpassed real-world experience, with more than 40 million administered injections worldwide. We are also excited about ongoing strategic initiatives that position our retinal franchise for future growth, such as our educational efforts in place across existing indications where many patients don't receive the treatment they need. Beyond EYLEA, we are encouraged by promising early results for high-dose aflibercept 8 milligram, which, if supported by Phase III clinical results, potentially represents next-generation treatment for a range of eye diseases. Turning to Libtayo, where global net sales in the fourth quarter were $121 million, in the U.S., net sales reached $81 million. In advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, which currently drives majority of performance, Libtayo is the #1 systemic treatment, and we saw steady growth as the market continued its post-COVID recovery. In advanced basal cell carcinoma, Libtayo is also rapidly being established as standard of care in patients who have progressed or are inappropriate for hedgehog inhibitors, building on our strength in non-melanoma skin cancers. In advanced non-small cell lung cancer, we are making progress in the launch of our monotherapy indication with a steadily growing prescriber base. There is also significant opportunity in the chemotherapy combination setting. And if proved, Libtayo would be available for a much broader range of first-line lung cancer patients than for monotherapy alone. Our experience is that medical oncologists consider combination treatment first and reserve monotherapy for a much smaller group of patients, which, in part, has limited Libtayo uptake in lung cancer to date. Briefly turning to our cardiovascular franchise. Evkeeza, our treatment for patients with HoFH, was successfully launched in 2021 and is already the standard of care. We continue to see initiations in both switch and category naive patients. In 2021, we are focused on employing innovative efforts to identify patients not currently diagnosed with HoFH. On to Dupixent, which grew 51% in global net sales in the fourth quarter year-over-year to $1.77 billion, in the U.S., net sales grew 46% to $1.35 billion. Dupixent is well positioned for ongoing rapid growth based on significant unmet need in existing and potential new disease areas, with anticipated expansion into even younger age groups and new geographies worldwide. In atopic dermatitis, prescribing trends are strong across the spectrum of moderate to severe disease. Dupixent is health care specialists' first-line systemic treatment of choice due to several highly differentiating product characteristics, including its dual anti-IL-4 and IL-13 mechanism of action, compelling efficacy and rapid symptom relief, well-established safety profile, with no risk of serious infections due to immunosuppression and clinical data in children as young as six months. If approved, we look forward to expanding Dupixent's skin indications to include babies and young children with atopic dermatitis as well as two new dermatologic indications. There are no currently approved biologic medicines for prurigo nodularis, where we estimate approximately 75,000 patients may benefit from Dupixent in the U.S. alone. We're also progressing an important opportunity to help chronic spontaneous urticaria patients. Dupixent is also steadily growing in the highly competitive asthma space. We see ongoing potential to differentiate Dupixent in moderate to severe disease through its competitive profile, including a broad label that allows use in uncontrolled steroid-dependent patients, regardless of their eosinophil levels, as well as use in patients as young as six years of age. Dupixent is also the preferred treatment of ENTs and allergists in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, regardless of prior surgery and contributes meaningfully to our business. We are also progressing our launch plans for eosinophilic esophagitis, a gastrointestinal disease with substantial unmet need. We estimate at least 50,000 patients in the U.S. could benefit from Dupixent if approved. We've received positive feedback from key opinion leaders on the strength of our data and lack of suitable treatment alternatives for this serious disease. In summary, in 2021, our commercial team delivered strong growth across the portfolio. Our momentum and new launch opportunities position us well for the future growth. Now I'll turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Landry: Thanks, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. Regeneron's fourth quarter capped off a strong year. In the quarter, we delivered top and bottom line growth driven by strong execution within our core business. Fourth quarter total revenue grew 104% year-over-year to $5 billion. Excluding revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, total fourth quarter revenue grew 17% year-over-year to $2.7 billion, demonstrating continuing strength of our core business. Fourth quarter total diluted net income per share was $23.72 on net income of $2.7 billion. Starting with REGEN-COV. In the fourth quarter, we delivered the remaining 1.1 million doses from our September 2021 U.S. government supply agreement and recognized $2.3 billion of U.S. net sales. In accordance with our global collaboration with Roche, the amount of manufactured products supplied by each party to the global market resulted in the recognition of a true-up payment related to Roche's share of profits. As a result, in the fourth quarter, we recognized a $260 million charge in cost of goods sold and recorded no Roche collaboration revenue. As mentioned, we completed all deliveries under the September 2021 U.S. government supply contract in the fourth quarter. With the FDA's recent amendment to REGEN-COV's emergency use authorization, we do not expect to record any U.S. REGEN-COV sales in the first half of 2022. I will now move to our collaborations, starting with Bayer. Fourth quarter 2021 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales as reported to us by Bayer were $934 million, growing 9% on a reported basis and 12% on a constant currency basis. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $372 million, of which we recorded $354 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $518 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Despite seasonally higher fourth quarter operating expenses, our share of the profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and Kevzara was $388 million, which compares favorably to our share of profits of $230 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Moving now to fourth quarter 2021 operating expenses. R&D decreased slightly to $639 million primarily due to lower spending on REGEN-COV development as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. SG&A expense increased 30% year-over-year to $495 million primarily due to cost related to growth initiatives for EYLEA and higher head count-related costs. Cost of goods sold were $559 million primarily related to REGEN-COV manufacturing costs and, as I mentioned earlier, the recognition of the $260 million true-up payment to Roche for their share of profits related to the COVID antibody cocktail. Finally, the fourth quarter 2021 effective tax rate was 12.7%. Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. For the year, Regeneron generated $6.5 billion in free cash flow and ended the year with cash and marketable securities less debt of $9.8 billion. In the fourth quarter 2021, we exhausted the remaining balance on our $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization. And in November, we announced a new $3 billion share repurchase authorization. Across both, we've repurchased approximately 850 million of shares in the fourth quarter of 2021. We continue to be opportunistic buyers where we see dislocation between our stock price and our intrinsic valuation. Now let me conclude with our initial 2022 outlook and guidance. As I mentioned earlier, we do not expect to record any U.S. REGEN-COV sales in the first half of 2022. For U.S. Praluent throughout 2021, we observed significant category and competitive pressures. We expect these pressures to accelerate throughout 2022. And now for our 2022 expense guidance. For R&D, we forecast our 2022 R&D expense to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. As we highlighted throughout 2021, critically important development programs are advancing in 2022, including the late-stage randomized studies versus branded comparators for the LAG3 Libtayo combination, BCMAxCD3 and C5 programs in development expenses to advance next-generation antibodies against COVID-19. For SG&A, we forecast our 2022 SG&A expense to be in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.77 billion. Based on our initial plan, we expect SG&A expenses to be spread evenly across the quarters in 2022. For COGS, we forecast 2022 product gross margin on our percentage of net product sales to be between 90% and 92%. We expect cost of collaboration manufacturing to be in the range of $750 million to $830 million driven by continued growth in our Dupixent franchise. And finally, we anticipate our 2022 effective tax rate to be in the range of 13% to 15%. A complete summary of our full year guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. In conclusion, our core business continues to advance and strengthen. With growth continuing across our existing portfolio and investments in our R&D engine supported by our strong balance sheet, we remain well positioned for sustainable long-term growth.\nMark Hudson: Thanks, Bob. Michelle, that concludes our prepared remarks. We now like to open up the call for Q&A.  Please go ahead, Michelle.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO. Your line is open.\nEvan Seigerman: You touched on your solid tumor oncology franchise, specifically the METXMET in MUC16xCD3 bispecifics that we're supposed to get this year. Can you elaborate a little as to kind of what we should be expecting with these data readouts and how that could inform potentially pivotal trials or a registration path?\nDr. George Yancopoulos: Yes. These are both being evaluated in late-stage patients who have essentially failed all existing therapies. And obviously, the excitement would be if one saw evidence of convincing objective responses that were durable in these settings, then those would certainly inform how would we move forward on these. And we've already announced that we've been observing encouraging early signs of efficacy, and we will be elaborating on these and giving the details in these future presentations.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is open.\nCarter Gould: Maybe I'll just take on the elephant in the room. For Len and Marion, would love to get your thoughts on -- as you think about the EYLEA franchise in the context of what looks like a very accommodating label on faricimab and their pricing, as we think about the implications for your high-dose label and commercial positioning.\nDr. Len Schleifer: Yes. I'll let Marion get into the details. But we don't see faricimab as a transformative therapy of any kind, notwithstanding any label. It's very hard to see when you look at it dispassionately any scientific evidence for the contribution of Ang2 blockade. People forget, nobody has a greater interest and would love to see Ang2 blockade being a value given that George and his colleagues were the ones who discovered and cloned Ang2, the first in the world on that. But there's really no evidence that we can see where you've separated that out. So what we're seeing here is a higher dose of faricimab relative to Lucentis and possibly on a moral basis relative to EYLEA. We remind everybody that there are a lot of lessons learned here. One of the biggest lessons is efficacy is super important, but well beyond that is safety. And nothing right now contract the, I don't know, almost 50 million injections that have been given worldwide with EYLEA. So we feel pretty good. The competition is always good. Obviously, competition is going to eat into a product. We suspect that faricimab may take a lot of the -- of its share initially from Lucentis, but we'll see. Marion might want to elaborate.\nMarion McCourt: Yes. Thank you, Len. Certainly, to give some very early market feedback, the comment that we're getting from key opinion leaders is that they don't see first met via product that potentially is a game changer and that the dosing is complex. And there are remaining questions on the clinical trial design and, of course, as Len mentioned, safety. More importantly, I'll go back over to EYLEA, where we certainly are establishing the product as standard of care and more across indications with great flexibility of dosing, indications, experience, real-world evidence, prefilled syringe and busy times. So we look forward to strong performance going forward on EYLEA, and we're very optimistic about what could be a next-generation product with our own aflibercept 8-milligram high-dose product if the Phase III data works out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tyler Van Buren with Cowen. Your line is open.\nTyler Martin Van: So for your next-generation COVID antibody cocktail, looks like it's -- you said it's entering the clinic in the coming months. So was there a slight delay versus the prior Q1 guidance? And you referred to FDA streamlining development of monoclonal antibodies. So can you give us your latest thoughts on how long it might take to get to market? I noticed Bob mentioned that there won't be sales in the first half, so just curious if we could see something in the second half.\nDr. Len Schleifer: Yes. George can comment on what he thinks is necessary, but I just want to be clear. I don't think there's any delay, whether we come in just at the end of this quarter or early in the next quarter or thereabouts. It's tough to exactly estimate when we'll start. But we're scaling up, and we're rolling forward. George can comment on some of the global and U.S. regulatory considerations and guidances that we know about thus far.\nDr. George Yancopoulos: Yes. There's not much to add. I mean, we're continuing to discuss with regulators what the program is and what are the abilities as was done with vaccines to expedite the development programs compared to what was necessary for the first-generation agents developed using the same platform. So we will update that as we learn more.\nDr. Len Schleifer: George, there's some confusion, just so you could clarify it. Our next-generation antibody work on just -- Omicron on is a work on all of them. Yes, George, go ahead.\nDr. George Yancopoulos: As I mentioned in my script, so obviously, we have one of the largest collections of antibodies to choose from. And what we do as a variant emerges is we select new candidate antibodies that will work against the new variant, but will also retain their activity against the previous variants of concern. And that's exactly the candidates that we're advancing right now. They work against Omicron, but they work against Delta. They work against all the other variants before. .\nDr. Len Schleifer: And anything -- any comment on stealth Omicron, do you think it will work there, too?\nDr. George Yancopoulos: Well, yes. Obviously, we take all these things into consideration. And so when a new variant that looks like it could be coming along that might be important, we certainly have made sure that the candidates that we're advancing now are going to be active against all of those as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nSalveen Richter: Could you just speak to the RNAi programs? I think we're going to get first data this year from ALN-APP from that program. And how do you think about the optimization of delivery to the brain here and what we might see and how the C5 program could be differentiated?\nDr. George Yancopoulos: Okay. So you're asking about the brain and CNS and the APP program, but you're always asking about C5. Okay. So yes, with the brain, obviously, as we all know, there have been disappointing results with antibodies that have been delivered to try to decrease APP levels. They work in a fundamentally different way. One of the problems that they cause, they cause the famous inflammatory syndrome that may complicate activity. So obviously, the hope of siRNA programs is they work by a completely different mechanism. They will actually decrease the production of APP and allowed to be cleared by normal mechanisms as opposed to letting it be made continuously at the normal rate and then trying to remove it by artificial mechanisms that they themselves may be toxic, i.e., the antibody efforts. So that's why they may be fundamentally different. Importantly, we're exploring this not only in Alzheimer's disease, as we all know. It's not as if the early results in Alzheimer's disease are going to really address the important endpoints, that is cognition and efficacy in slowing down cognitive decline and so forth. They're going to be looking at levels of biomarkers and so forth. That's why we're also excited that we are developing the same exact agent, in some ways, a much more rapidly progressing, though albeit much rare disease known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or CAA, because there, the ability to both look at the biomarkers, but also, more importantly, look at important efficacy parameters is going to allow us to proceed much faster and much smaller numbers of patients. And therein, we may be, over the next couple of years, able to establish both definitive efficacy, but maybe even get authorization approved in those indications, and that will certainly be quite in advance for the entire field of these types of diseases, and particularly for the first siRNA that's going into these diseases. So we are very excited about these programs, and we have a very large pipeline of other CNS diseases and targets that we are going forward in addressing with Alnylam. So it's a very important part of our collaborative efforts with them, which also include a large number of targets in terms of genetic targets, genetically validated targets,and diseases in the eye, let alone outside of the eye such as, for example, in the liver, and that brings us to the C5 that you asked about. So as we all know, people are taking single types of approaches to target C5. Some people might have an antibody. There's now some other types of approaches and so forth. What we realized is that if we could combine an siRNA with an antibody, we might have really not only combine the unique advantages of both, but incredible synergies. And what do we mean? Antibodies have the highest effectiveness because, essentially, they can bring down activity levels almost to zero. But because of the high target load, you have to give these antibodies, and these are all the existing approved antibodies and those that are under investigation by other sponsors, you have to give them a relatively large amount of them and relatively frequently. So antibodies are great. But by themselves, you need to give a lot of antibodies to deal with a high target load. siRNAs are great at reducing the target load, but they don't get you to really almost zero activity, and that creates problems. We already know that. By putting the two together, you now get the best of both. You reduce the target load, and you allow now a much smaller amount of antibody to control activity hopefully completely. So there really is tremendous synergy with this. This is the first of its kind that is combining siRNA with antibodies. We think there's very exciting potential for this to deliver best-in-class, both efficacy but also convenience and dosing regimen. We're going for convenient subcutaneous self-administration once a month, which would really, I think, be game changing for the field and for these patients. But we're also moving these programs also to other related indications as well. So we're very excited about this combination approach for C5 and for these types of indications. But once again, just like what we're doing in CNS, just like what we're doing with eye, these are really franchise and portfolio opportunities. I mean, you can just imagine, if combining -- and there are so many other settings where this could be very useful, combining the benefits of siRNA and antibodies and bringing them together could really begin changing not only in this area, but in many, many other areas. And who better to do this than bringing together the leading siRNA company and the leading antibody and biologics company, Alnylam and Regeneron. So we are very excited about the individual programs with some of these siRNA, but also these incredible combination opportunities, bringing these two incredible technologies together, taking the advantages of both.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ronny Gal with AllianceBernstein. Your line is open.\nRonny Sanford: One is for Marion. Can you talk a little bit about the VEGF market? It seems that we've been coming close to a year for a better than 10% growth. And I was wondering how much of this is catch-up versus how much of this is just higher natural market growth rate versus what we're expecting. And then can you talk a little bit about the dynamics of what it takes to compete in this market, kind of like how long to get a J code, how long to have contract with different practices? Essentially, when will -- how long will take a competitor coming online, whether innovative or biosimilar, to really be able to effectively compete in that market?\nMarion McCourt: Sure. Ronny, happy to take it, and I'm going to take the end of your question first. And I first would say that a competitor or a new entrant to the market's ability to compete is really going to be based on the differentiation of their product profile, the quality of their studies and the confidence and enthusiasm that the key opinion leaders have on the product as it comes in. So I do think differentiation matters quite a lot. In the case of EYLEA, certainly, our growth in the past year has been quite pronounced. We've captured not only the market growth, but we've also captured competitive share gain more than any other products, so that our market share today for EYLEA is approaching 50% of the overall category and 75% of the branded category. And we picked up several share points in the last year in this very large category. Let me go back now to new entrants. You're asking about timing of J codes, and that is important. Quality of product, as I mentioned, reflects confidence in how well it performs, but it is a six-month period before a new product receives a permanent J code. So in that window of time, especially in a product which is buy and bill, there's always the concern on reimbursement. There's not experience, not with the product, but there's also not experience with applying for reimbursement under the J-code. That period of time is six months. And to my earlier comment, product confidence will vary based on profile. I hope I've covered, Ronny, most of what you had in that. The only thing I think I probably missed is anti-VEGF category growth going forward. That is a little bit complicated because we're comparing to recovery in the market opposite the COVID period to some extent. However, there is growth of the category because of patient demographics and because of education. I'll give you an example of patients who are diagnosed with DME, only about 47%, 48% of those patients are treated. And those are -- and of those that are diagnosed, there's only -- if you took all DME patients that exist, only about 25% of those patients are treated. So there still is tremendous unmet need in the marketplace, and we certainly will work hard through educational initiatives to make sure that we perform very well as we have been on an ongoing basis on all of our indications. I hope that helps, Ronny.\nDr. Len Schleifer: Can I just add one thing, Ronny, on that? It's just that it seems like it's been every single year for the last decade there has been a threat to EYLEA that a variety of number of people have predicted would be the next thing to displace EYLEA. And along the way, the barriers have changed. And the most important barrier that I think now exists is safety, and that safety, even for a biosimilar, the same product safety for a new product with purported differences, people have learned that the eye is a very sensitive place. And having given scores of millions of injections of EYLEA, there's a great deal of confidence out there. I think it's going to take a matter of time beyond J codes and meeting with practices before that level of confidence is significantly displaced.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist. Your line is open.\nNicole Germino: This is Nicole on for Robyn. Just a really quick question on yesterday's report, the Adicet Bio disclosing their general exercising option to license an allo CAR-T. Can you just comment on the move towards allo CAR-T and why this particular happened?\nDr. Len Schleifer: Could you repeat the end of the question? It was a little hard to hear the question.\nDr. George Yancopoulos: The Adicet?\nDr. Len Schleifer: Yes. But what was the question? Can you repeat it?\nDr. George Yancopoulos: Why does that matter? What's the importance of it?\nDr. Len Schleifer: So well, as you already referred to it, I mean, this is an advance in the CAR-T space because, obviously, so far, the approved approach and upcoming approaches are all dependent on giving customized individualized autologous CAR-T cells. And the results coming from this relatively novel gamma delta approach is the first gamma delta data in the world show that you could give allogeneic cells and get very remarkable -- in very small numbers, a very remarkable response rate. And so this would take the customization autologous approach and take it to the autologous to the non-autologous allogeneic way, which will really could potentially revolutionize the treatment paradigm here. And so we've been long-term collaborators with Adicet, and we're pretty excited about this allogeneic approach. And so we're investing in it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMatthew Harrison: I was hoping for one on co-stim. I know we're supposed to get some data this year. Can you just maybe help us think about dosing levels, how you're thinking about safety currently? And just in terms of initial data, what should we expect to see, whether it's just about safety or we should really start to have some idea on efficacy as well?\nDr. George Yancopoulos: Yes. That's a great question. And as we all know, this pathway was explored many years ago now and led to, unfortunately, very dramatic safety concerns to patients, and that sort of killed the field. And so because of those concerns and that we were reexploring utilization of this very, very powerful co-stimulatory pathway to add to -- in combination with other immunotherapies, the FDA appropriately asked us to move very, very slowly. So the first endpoint of most concern was the safety endpoint, of course, first do no harm. And I think that what we've announced is that in our ongoing dose escalation study, it's only been recently that we have achieved what we think are therapeutic dose potential levels. And now -- and we have -- I think the thing that we have said publicly is we successfully crossed in terms of getting to these dose levels, this very concerning and potentially game stopping safety hurdles. And so now that we're at the potentially therapeutic dose levels, we are now hoping to focus on efficacy. And remember, in several of these programs, for example, our prostate program, we're going in a setting where, at least if properly identified, there are essentially no or very rare responses to PD-1 in these types of very carefully characterized prostate patients. I mean, there has been very little hope, except for rare subsets of characterized patients that have mutations and so forth, for the PD-1 immunotherapy class. So if we can show essentially almost any responses in these types of very recalcitrant and hard-to-treat patients with PD-1 alone in our combinations with our co-stim for prostate cancer, I think there's real reason to believe that our scientists have successfully figured out a completely novel way of taking advantage of this long known, very exciting and powerful, but dangerous pathway that we may have figured out a way to take advantage of it and done it in a safe manner. So this is what we're hoping to see this year that now that we are at these levels, we've gotten there without activating these huge safety concerns that were previously seeing. Essentially seeing any objective responses in this setting would really be potentially game changing. And so we're looking forward to being able to tell you about this possibility later this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nCory Kasimov: Wondering if you could frame expectations for the pending update on your program with Intellia that we're getting here near term. What new might we see relative to last summer's preliminary data disclosure?\nDr. Len Schleifer: Yes. We don't want to get too far in front of our partner. George's remarks already indicated the kind of things we'll see, but we should leave it up to Intellia to comment beyond what George said about looking at the dose escalation and including the safety and knockdown of the TTR. But Intellia should have the benefit of making some comments.\nDr. George Yancopoulos: But maybe just a couple of obvious points that's not stealing anybody's thunder. But obviously, the initial results were incredibly exciting and revolutionary. Obviously, the first systemic case CRISPR therapy, I mean, all this excitement for almost 20 years, Nobel prizes and all this, I mean, it is incredible that, together with our Intellia colleagues, I mean, this represents the first-ever systemic use of CRISPR to actually modify human genetic gene. But obviously, one of the most important things that one will see is the whole promise of this approach is duration, that is you are modifying the gene. And hopefully, you will never have to treat that patient again, okay? And that's part of the dream and the hope with these genetic cures. And so this is, of course, one important thing that we hope that we'll be seeing from the follow-up data, the duration, which is what is really game changing. You can permanently cure these patients. That's the theory here by permanently changing their genes. And so the longer you follow them up, the more you can validate the duration with, of course, the appropriate safety and continue to keep the dream alive that this whole new approach could really be game-changing for important and appropriate clinical indications.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMohit Bansal: And congrats on the progress. Maybe another one on faricimab. And given that your competitor also has Lucentis, which is facing biosimilar this year, are you seeing any rumblings of potential bundling or attractive pricing for those both products combined, that could be played as a strategy to take on EYLEA? And how much does payer versus provider matter in this market?\nMarion McCourt: Sure. So at a high level, I'll share just and talk about our own business is, certainly, we have strong market understanding and work closely with all of our customers across the market segments. When it comes to how another company might be looking at their pricing or strategy, it's probably best I let them comment. But I appreciate the interest in the category and the question.\nMark Hudson: Thanks, everyone. That concludes today's conference call, and thanks for your interest in Regeneron. The IR team and Bob Landry is here to take any questions that you may have. Everyone, have a nice day.\nOperator: This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dr. Len Schleifer",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. The fourth quarter of 2021 capped off a terrific year for Regeneron. Our performance was driven by strong execution across the organization, despite the ongoing challenges posed by COVID-19. We're all proud of the incredible work and dedication of our employees who continuously deliver on our mission to bring important medicines and novel medical breakthroughs to patients in need. Throughout 2021, we delivered strong top and bottom line growth. Revenues, excluding our COVID antibody cocktail, grew 19%, a testament of our diversified and strengthening core business. Our innovative and world-class pipeline advanced across a wide variety of diseases. We also unveiled initial clinical data and pipeline advancements from our Regeneron Genetics medicines portfolio, which has the potential to unlock significant long-term value. Additionally, we returned substantial cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks. In '21, we spent approximately $1.7 billion repurchasing over 3 million shares. For EYLEA, 2021 global sales grew 19% to $9.4 billion. Even after 10 years on the market and millions of injections later, we continue to view EYLEA as an enduring product, with significant future opportunity, despite new market entries. In the second half of the year, we look forward to the results from our Phase III aflibercept 8-milligram high-dose program. If those data continue to support that aflibercept 8 milligrams provides extended dosing duration without compromising on safety and efficacy, aflibercept 8 milligrams has the potential to complement and enhance our retinal franchise. With Dupixent, we are delivering on a goal of transforming the treatment of type 2 inflammatory diseases. 2021 global sales of Dupixent were $6.2 billion, representing 53% growth for the year. Looking ahead, Dupixent's outlook is bright. There are significant opportunities to increase market penetration rates in approved indications, and we are in the midst of a wave of new data submissions and launches in potential new indications, further fueling Dupixent's growth. In oncology, Libtayo continues to thrive in the approved non-melanoma skin cancers. We look forward to potential Libtayo plus chemotherapy approval later this year in the broader population of non-small cell lung cancer patients. Our oncology footprint continues to expand. We have advanced many candidates and combinations into the clinic with a range of antibodies, bispecifics and co-stimulatory bispecifics across many cancer settings. This year, we look forward to sharing what we hope will be groundbreaking data in difficult-to-treat solid tumors, such as prostate cancers and ovarian cancers, both of which are conditions with historically low response rates to immunotherapy. We also remain encouraged in the progress of our maturing CD3 bispecifics. We are confident in the overall safety and efficacy profile for odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific. We are forging ahead with REGN5458, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific, which we believe will play an active role in the treatment of multiple myeloma given its competitive profile. Last but not least, we are immensely proud of our rapid response efforts against COVID-19. In 2021, REGEN-COV, our antibody cocktail, was administered to millions of people globally, making a major impact during the darkest days of the pandemic. Based on preclinical data, we recently announced that REGEN-COV is highly unlikely to be active against the Omicron variant. Appropriately, the FDA amended the emergency use authorization for REGEN-COV, limiting its use in the U.S. in light of the Omicron variant being dominant. Regeneron remains committed to helping fight the COVID-19 pandemic. We are progressing next-generation antibodies that are active against Omicron, Delta and other variants of concern. We are scaling up manufacturing efforts and completing the necessary requirements to begin clinical trials for next-generation candidate in the coming months. Concurrently, we are working closely and collaboratively with the FDA and other global regulatory authorities to establish and define clinical pathways to bring additional safe and effective monoclonal antibody treatment options to patients as quickly as possible. As one of the leaders in the fight against COVID-19, our VelociSuite platform of technologies makes us uniquely positioned to promptly develop and deliver potentially life-saving medicines. As the COVID-19 story transforms from pandemic to endemic, we believe there will remain a significant opportunity to use our next-generation monoclonals as a prevention for those immunocompromised individuals who do not respond adequately to COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, monoclonal antibody therapy is likely to play an ongoing role in treatment for infected individuals. In conclusion, 2021 was another high-performance year for Regeneron. With strong commercial results from our in-line marketed products, 30-plus pipeline candidates progressing through clinical trials, our discovery efforts firing on all cylinders, a growing portfolio of highly productive external collaborations and our strong financial position with over $12 billion in cash and marketable securities, Regeneron is extremely well positioned for the future. Now I will turn the call over to George. Yes. I'll let Marion get into the details. But we don't see faricimab as a transformative therapy of any kind, notwithstanding any label. It's very hard to see when you look at it dispassionately any scientific evidence for the contribution of Ang2 blockade.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Dr. George Yancopoulos",
            "content": "Thanks, Len. I'll start by briefly addressing our novel monoclonal antibodies for COVID-19. As Len mentioned, we are rapidly developing next-generation antibodies that retain potency against Omicron and other variants of concern. Early in 2019, we anticipated that the virus would mutate and, thus, began generating large pools of virus-neutralizing antibody candidates from both human survivors and our VelocImmune mice. We have continually evaluated and refreshed this pool and now have next-generation candidates that, based on preclinical studies, effectively neutralize Omicron and other variants of concern. We're on track to initiate clinical trials with the first of these in the coming months. In addition, we are in discussions with the FDA regarding how to streamline the development program for monoclonal antibodies, considering the unwavering unmet need and demand for these medicines, especially with potential future virus variants in mind. As Len already highlighted, since we believe that monoclonal antibodies will continue to play an especially important role in the treatment of future protection of the several million immunocompromised people in the United States alone, we are committed to undertaking a development pathway that will make this possible in the near future. Moving on to ophthalmology. At the upcoming Angiogenesis meeting, we will present the final Phase II data from the aflibercept 8-milligram CANDELA study in patients with wet AMD. In this study, aflibercept 8 milligram, given at the same protocol-specified dosing schedule, as currently approved EYLEA 2-milligram met its primary safety endpoint, with measures of drawing numerically favoring the 8-milligram dose over the 2-milligram dose. These two -- these Phase II results give us more confidence that the upcoming Phase III readouts has a potential to show that the higher 8-milligram aflibercept dose can at least match the efficacy and safety of EYLEA, but with more convenient dosing. Moving on to Dupixent. Building on the outstanding clinical success Dupixent has shown so far across a wide spectrum of allergic or type 2 inflammatory diseases, the second Phase III study in prurigo nodularis recently met primary and key secondary endpoints, making Dupixent the first and only systemic medicine to demonstrate such success in this indication. These data confirm the results from the first Phase III trial, where 60% of Dupixent patients met the primary endpoint of its reduction compared to 18% of placebo patients at 24 weeks. Nearly 3x many Dupixent patients experienced reduced skin lesions compared to placebo as well. Prurigo nodularis marks the sixth disease for which Dupixent has demonstrated profound benefit for patients, providing convincing evidence that the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways inhibited by Dupixent are the key drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying all of these diseases. We have to appreciate how remarkable the Dupixent story is in terms of the important benefit it provides for the many patients across this diverse set of clinical conditions, together with its well-established safety profile, and highlights how Dupixent is delivering on its promise of providing a pipeline in a product. At the upcoming AAAAI meeting, in addition to the other important Dupixent updates, we will present pivotal results for the recent top line studies in eosinophilic esophagitis, or EOE, and for the first chronic spontaneous urticaria, or CSU study. EOE is a complex disease, and we are excited to share these data with the scientific community and patients. Our first regulatory submission for EOE in adolescents and adults is underway, with regulatory submissions for prurigo nodularis also starting in the first half of this year. Anticipated flow of Dupixent-related clinical data update continues. We are planning on reporting results in an additional Phase III study in CSU this time in omalizumab experienced patients and also for the chronic cold-induced urticaria indication in the second half of this year. These represents more difficult-to-treat patients or condition and present a higher bar for Dupixent. We're looking forward to results of these pivotal studies. Moving on to oncology and first Libtayo. Progress in our oncology portfolio includes pivotal readouts and regulatory filings for Libtayo presented an anticipated data readouts for our bispecifics as well as multiple upcoming milestones with novel diversified pipeline entrants. As Len mentioned, the Libtayo chemotherapy combination for patients with non-small cell lung cancer is under review at the FDA with a PDUFA date of September 19, 2022, which could address a larger portion of the patients with lung cancer. In hematology, at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting, we presented encouraging data for REGN5458, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific, investigated for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, with safety data that has shown no grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome to date and strong efficacy data. We believe our investigational agent is promising and has the potential to be competitive in this indication. We are planning on investigating this product for earlier lines of myeloma therapy, in combination with standard of care, and are excited about the combination with an appropriate co-stimulatory bispecific, which could further enhance responses. Odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific, has the potential for a best-in-class efficacy profile in both follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and our updated step-up dosing protocol may mitigate safety concerns and decrease the need for hospitalizations to manage cytokine release syndrome. In terms of progress of our bispecifics for solid tumors, as previously disclosed, we are observing early signs of activity for our MUC16xCD3 bispecific monotherapy developed for late-stage ovarian cancer, and we are excited to be sharing these early data later this year. In addition to monotherapy, the MUC16xCD3 bispecific is being investigated in combination with Libtayo and in a first of its kind in a combination trial with a MUC16xCD28 bispecific. These combinations are in early stages that are advancing through dose escalations. Later this year, we are hoping to share initial results for a unique biparatopic METXMET antibody studied in advanced non-small cell cancer patients with MET protein alterations. Early signs of clinical activity we have observed so far with the naked METXMET bispecific antibody, especially in patients with MET overexpression, bode well for our follow-on agents, the METXMET bispecific antibody drug conjugate, which is now enrolling patients in a Phase I study. We are also excited about our early-stage EGFRxCD28 co-stimulatory bispecific program for lung and other cancers. For prostate cancer, we are expecting initial readouts from our first co-stimulatory bispecific PSMAxCD28 later this year as well. PSMAxCD28 is progressing through dose escalation in combination with Libtayo. We are excited about the potential of our broad oncology portfolio, which includes multiple Phase I, II and III assets, as many are beginning to believe the future is going to involve the right combination of targeted immunotherapy agents. Concluding with our Regeneron Genetic medicines efforts, we and our collaborators have made significant strides in expanding the capabilities and scale of our groundbreaking work in genetics medicines. In terms of our siRNA collaboration with Alnylam, ALN-HSD is progressing through healthy volunteers, and initial data in NASH patients are anticipated by the middle of this year. With the C5 siRNA and the antibody combination, another first of its kind, healthy volunteer data were presented at ASH, demonstrating PK and PD results supportive of the monthly subcutaneous dosing regimen selected for pivotal studies. Phase III studies of the combination for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH, were also initiated. Recall, in PNH, we are planning to test our combination in both naive and switch patients tested against standard of care therapies, including ravulizumab and eculizumab. Also Alnylam has recently announced submission of the CTA application for ALN-APP, the industry's first-ever investigational RNAi therapeutic for CNS diseases. This agent will be evaluated in both the relatively rare disease driven by amyloid precursor protein, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or CAA, as well as in early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Finally, later this quarter, we and Intellia will provide our -- an update on our joint TTR CRISPR-based knockout program for transthyretin amyloidosis. This will include additional ascending dose interim clinical data from the polyneuropathy arm of the ongoing Intellia 2001 Phase I study. We have also expanded the study to include patients with transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, which we believe will address an even broader patient population. We are very excited by our large and diverse pipeline of siRNA candidates that we are advancing with Alnylam, ranging from targeting the liver, the brain and the eye, as well as our CRISPR-based approaches in collaboration with Intellia and our viral-targeted gene delivery programs, such as with Decibel. While still early, we think these groundbreaking approaches have the potential to change the practice of medicine. And with that, I will turn the call over to Marion. Yes. These are both being evaluated in late-stage patients who have essentially failed all existing therapies. And obviously, the excitement would be if one saw evidence of convincing objective responses that were durable in these settings, then those would certainly inform how would we move forward on these. And we've already announced that we've been observing encouraging early signs of efficacy, and we will be elaborating on these and giving the details in these future presentations. Yes. There's not much to add. I mean, we're continuing to discuss with regulators what the program is and what are the abilities as was done with vaccines to expedite the development programs compared to what was necessary for the first-generation agents developed using the same platform. So we will update that as we learn more. As I mentioned in my script, so obviously, we have one of the largest collections of antibodies to choose from. And what we do as a variant emerges is we select new candidate antibodies that will work against the new variant, but will also retain their activity against the previous variants of concern. And that's exactly the candidates that we're advancing right now. They work against Omicron, but they work against Delta. They work against all the other variants before. . Well, yes. Obviously, we take all these things into consideration. And so when a new variant that looks like it could be coming along that might be important, we certainly have made sure that the candidates that we're advancing now are going to be active against all of those as well. Okay. So you're asking about the brain and CNS and the APP program, but you're always asking about C5. Okay. So yes, with the brain, obviously, as we all know, there have been disappointing results with antibodies that have been delivered to try to decrease APP levels. They work in a fundamentally different way. One of the problems that they cause, they cause the famous inflammatory syndrome that may complicate activity. So obviously, the hope of siRNA programs is they work by a completely different mechanism. They will actually decrease the production of APP and allowed to be cleared by normal mechanisms as opposed to letting it be made continuously at the normal rate and then trying to remove it by artificial mechanisms that they themselves may be toxic, i.e., the antibody efforts. So that's why they may be fundamentally different. Importantly, we're exploring this not only in Alzheimer's disease, as we all know. It's not as if the early results in Alzheimer's disease are going to really address the important endpoints, that is cognition and efficacy in slowing down cognitive decline and so forth. They're going to be looking at levels of biomarkers and so forth. That's why we're also excited that we are developing the same exact agent, in some ways, a much more rapidly progressing, though albeit much rare disease known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or CAA, because there, the ability to both look at the biomarkers, but also, more importantly, look at important efficacy parameters is going to allow us to proceed much faster and much smaller numbers of patients. And therein, we may be, over the next couple of years, able to establish both definitive efficacy, but maybe even get authorization approved in those indications, and that will certainly be quite in advance for the entire field of these types of diseases, and particularly for the first siRNA that's going into these diseases. So we are very excited about these programs, and we have a very large pipeline of other CNS diseases and targets that we are going forward in addressing with Alnylam. So it's a very important part of our collaborative efforts with them, which also include a large number of targets in terms of genetic targets, genetically validated targets,and diseases in the eye, let alone outside of the eye such as, for example, in the liver, and that brings us to the C5 that you asked about. So as we all know, people are taking single types of approaches to target C5. Some people might have an antibody. There's now some other types of approaches and so forth. What we realized is that if we could combine an siRNA with an antibody, we might have really not only combine the unique advantages of both, but incredible synergies. And what do we mean? Antibodies have the highest effectiveness because, essentially, they can bring down activity levels almost to zero. But because of the high target load, you have to give these antibodies, and these are all the existing approved antibodies and those that are under investigation by other sponsors, you have to give them a relatively large amount of them and relatively frequently. So antibodies are great. But by themselves, you need to give a lot of antibodies to deal with a high target load. siRNAs are great at reducing the target load, but they don't get you to really almost zero activity, and that creates problems. We already know that. By putting the two together, you now get the best of both. You reduce the target load, and you allow now a much smaller amount of antibody to control activity hopefully completely. So there really is tremendous synergy with this. This is the first of its kind that is combining siRNA with antibodies. We think there's very exciting potential for this to deliver best-in-class, both efficacy but also convenience and dosing regimen. We're going for convenient subcutaneous self-administration once a month, which would really, I think, be game changing for the field and for these patients. But we're also moving these programs also to other related indications as well. So we're very excited about this combination approach for C5 and for these types of indications. But once again, just like what we're doing in CNS, just like what we're doing with eye, these are really franchise and portfolio opportunities. I mean, you can just imagine, if combining -- and there are so many other settings where this could be very useful, combining the benefits of siRNA and antibodies and bringing them together could really begin changing not only in this area, but in many, many other areas. And who better to do this than bringing together the leading siRNA company and the leading antibody and biologics company, Alnylam and Regeneron. So we are very excited about the individual programs with some of these siRNA, but also these incredible combination opportunities, bringing these two incredible technologies together, taking the advantages of both. The Adicet? Why does that matter? What's the importance of it? Yes. That's a great question. And as we all know, this pathway was explored many years ago now and led to, unfortunately, very dramatic safety concerns to patients, and that sort of killed the field. And so because of those concerns and that we were reexploring utilization of this very, very powerful co-stimulatory pathway to add to -- in combination with other immunotherapies, the FDA appropriately asked us to move very, very slowly. So the first endpoint of most concern was the safety endpoint, of course, first do no harm. And I think that what we've announced is that in our ongoing dose escalation study, it's only been recently that we have achieved what we think are therapeutic dose potential levels. And now -- and we have -- I think the thing that we have said publicly is we successfully crossed in terms of getting to these dose levels, this very concerning and potentially game stopping safety hurdles. And so now that we're at the potentially therapeutic dose levels, we are now hoping to focus on efficacy. And remember, in several of these programs, for example, our prostate program, we're going in a setting where, at least if properly identified, there are essentially no or very rare responses to PD-1 in these types of very carefully characterized prostate patients. I mean, there has been very little hope, except for rare subsets of characterized patients that have mutations and so forth, for the PD-1 immunotherapy class. So if we can show essentially almost any responses in these types of very recalcitrant and hard-to-treat patients with PD-1 alone in our combinations with our co-stim for prostate cancer, I think there's real reason to believe that our scientists have successfully figured out a completely novel way of taking advantage of this long known, very exciting and powerful, but dangerous pathway that we may have figured out a way to take advantage of it and done it in a safe manner. So this is what we're hoping to see this year that now that we are at these levels, we've gotten there without activating these huge safety concerns that were previously seeing. Essentially seeing any objective responses in this setting would really be potentially game changing. And so we're looking forward to being able to tell you about this possibility later this year. But maybe just a couple of obvious points that's not stealing anybody's thunder. But obviously, the initial results were incredibly exciting and revolutionary. Obviously, the first systemic case CRISPR therapy, I mean, all this excitement for almost 20 years, Nobel prizes and all this, I mean, it is incredible that, together with our Intellia colleagues, I mean, this represents the first-ever systemic use of CRISPR to actually modify human genetic gene. But obviously, one of the most important things that one will see is the whole promise of this approach is duration, that is you are modifying the gene. And hopefully, you will never have to treat that patient again, okay? And that's part of the dream and the hope with these genetic cures. And so this is, of course, one important thing that we hope that we'll be seeing from the follow-up data, the duration, which is what is really game changing. You can permanently cure these patients. That's the theory here by permanently changing their genes. And so the longer you follow them up, the more you can validate the duration with, of course, the appropriate safety and continue to keep the dream alive that this whole new approach could really be game-changing for important and appropriate clinical indications."

            "content": "Thanks, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. Regeneron's fourth quarter capped off a strong year. In the quarter, we delivered top and bottom line growth driven by strong execution within our core business. Fourth quarter total revenue grew 104% year-over-year to $5 billion. Excluding revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, total fourth quarter revenue grew 17% year-over-year to $2.7 billion, demonstrating continuing strength of our core business. Fourth quarter total diluted net income per share was $23.72 on net income of $2.7 billion. Starting with REGEN-COV. In the fourth quarter, we delivered the remaining 1.1 million doses from our September 2021 U.S. government supply agreement and recognized $2.3 billion of U.S. net sales. In accordance with our global collaboration with Roche, the amount of manufactured products supplied by each party to the global market resulted in the recognition of a true-up payment related to Roche's share of profits. As a result, in the fourth quarter, we recognized a $260 million charge in cost of goods sold and recorded no Roche collaboration revenue. As mentioned, we completed all deliveries under the September 2021 U.S. government supply contract in the fourth quarter. With the FDA's recent amendment to REGEN-COV's emergency use authorization, we do not expect to record any U.S. REGEN-COV sales in the first half of 2022. I will now move to our collaborations, starting with Bayer. Fourth quarter 2021 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales as reported to us by Bayer were $934 million, growing 9% on a reported basis and 12% on a constant currency basis. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $372 million, of which we recorded $354 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $518 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Despite seasonally higher fourth quarter operating expenses, our share of the profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and Kevzara was $388 million, which compares favorably to our share of profits of $230 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Moving now to fourth quarter 2021 operating expenses. R&D decreased slightly to $639 million primarily due to lower spending on REGEN-COV development as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. SG&A expense increased 30% year-over-year to $495 million primarily due to cost related to growth initiatives for EYLEA and higher head count-related costs. Cost of goods sold were $559 million primarily related to REGEN-COV manufacturing costs and, as I mentioned earlier, the recognition of the $260 million true-up payment to Roche for their share of profits related to the COVID antibody cocktail. Finally, the fourth quarter 2021 effective tax rate was 12.7%. Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. For the year, Regeneron generated $6.5 billion in free cash flow and ended the year with cash and marketable securities less debt of $9.8 billion. In the fourth quarter 2021, we exhausted the remaining balance on our $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization. And in November, we announced a new $3 billion share repurchase authorization. Across both, we've repurchased approximately 850 million of shares in the fourth quarter of 2021. We continue to be opportunistic buyers where we see dislocation between our stock price and our intrinsic valuation. Now let me conclude with our initial 2022 outlook and guidance. As I mentioned earlier, we do not expect to record any U.S. REGEN-COV sales in the first half of 2022. For U.S. Praluent throughout 2021, we observed significant category and competitive pressures. We expect these pressures to accelerate throughout 2022. And now for our 2022 expense guidance. For R&D, we forecast our 2022 R&D expense to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. As we highlighted throughout 2021, critically important development programs are advancing in 2022, including the late-stage randomized studies versus branded comparators for the LAG3 Libtayo combination, BCMAxCD3 and C5 programs in development expenses to advance next-generation antibodies against COVID-19. For SG&A, we forecast our 2022 SG&A expense to be in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.77 billion. Based on our initial plan, we expect SG&A expenses to be spread evenly across the quarters in 2022. For COGS, we forecast 2022 product gross margin on our percentage of net product sales to be between 90% and 92%. We expect cost of collaboration manufacturing to be in the range of $750 million to $830 million driven by continued growth in our Dupixent franchise. And finally, we anticipate our 2022 effective tax rate to be in the range of 13% to 15%. A complete summary of our full year guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. In conclusion, our core business continues to advance and strengthen. With growth continuing across our existing portfolio and investments in our R&D engine supported by our strong balance sheet, we remain well positioned for sustainable long-term growth."

            "name": "Marion McCourt",
            "content": "Thank you, George. Our fourth quarter business performance demonstrated the strength and resilience of our in-line brands and creates a foundation for commercial success as we prepare for future launches. Starting with EYLEA. We recently announced fourth quarter U.S. net sales of $1.55 billion and $5.79 billion in 2021. This represented 17% year-over-year U.S. growth for the full year, which is noteworthy for a brand 10 years post launch. EYLEA reached record share across all approved indications and is the recognized leader in a category that continues to grow due to favorable demographic trends. EYLEA remains physicians' top choice for patients with indicated retinal diseases due to its demonstrated efficacy, safety, dosing flexibility and unsurpassed real-world experience, with more than 40 million administered injections worldwide. We are also excited about ongoing strategic initiatives that position our retinal franchise for future growth, such as our educational efforts in place across existing indications where many patients don't receive the treatment they need. Beyond EYLEA, we are encouraged by promising early results for high-dose aflibercept 8 milligram, which, if supported by Phase III clinical results, potentially represents next-generation treatment for a range of eye diseases. Turning to Libtayo, where global net sales in the fourth quarter were $121 million, in the U.S., net sales reached $81 million. In advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, which currently drives majority of performance, Libtayo is the #1 systemic treatment, and we saw steady growth as the market continued its post-COVID recovery. In advanced basal cell carcinoma, Libtayo is also rapidly being established as standard of care in patients who have progressed or are inappropriate for hedgehog inhibitors, building on our strength in non-melanoma skin cancers. In advanced non-small cell lung cancer, we are making progress in the launch of our monotherapy indication with a steadily growing prescriber base. There is also significant opportunity in the chemotherapy combination setting. And if proved, Libtayo would be available for a much broader range of first-line lung cancer patients than for monotherapy alone. Our experience is that medical oncologists consider combination treatment first and reserve monotherapy for a much smaller group of patients, which, in part, has limited Libtayo uptake in lung cancer to date. Briefly turning to our cardiovascular franchise. Evkeeza, our treatment for patients with HoFH, was successfully launched in 2021 and is already the standard of care. We continue to see initiations in both switch and category naive patients. In 2021, we are focused on employing innovative efforts to identify patients not currently diagnosed with HoFH. On to Dupixent, which grew 51% in global net sales in the fourth quarter year-over-year to $1.77 billion, in the U.S., net sales grew 46% to $1.35 billion. Dupixent is well positioned for ongoing rapid growth based on significant unmet need in existing and potential new disease areas, with anticipated expansion into even younger age groups and new geographies worldwide. In atopic dermatitis, prescribing trends are strong across the spectrum of moderate to severe disease. Dupixent is health care specialists' first-line systemic treatment of choice due to several highly differentiating product characteristics, including its dual anti-IL-4 and IL-13 mechanism of action, compelling efficacy and rapid symptom relief, well-established safety profile, with no risk of serious infections due to immunosuppression and clinical data in children as young as six months. If approved, we look forward to expanding Dupixent's skin indications to include babies and young children with atopic dermatitis as well as two new dermatologic indications. There are no currently approved biologic medicines for prurigo nodularis, where we estimate approximately 75,000 patients may benefit from Dupixent in the U.S. alone. We're also progressing an important opportunity to help chronic spontaneous urticaria patients. Dupixent is also steadily growing in the highly competitive asthma space. We see ongoing potential to differentiate Dupixent in moderate to severe disease through its competitive profile, including a broad label that allows use in uncontrolled steroid-dependent patients, regardless of their eosinophil levels, as well as use in patients as young as six years of age. Dupixent is also the preferred treatment of ENTs and allergists in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, regardless of prior surgery and contributes meaningfully to our business. We are also progressing our launch plans for eosinophilic esophagitis, a gastrointestinal disease with substantial unmet need. We estimate at least 50,000 patients in the U.S. could benefit from Dupixent if approved. We've received positive feedback from key opinion leaders on the strength of our data and lack of suitable treatment alternatives for this serious disease. In summary, in 2021, our commercial team delivered strong growth across the portfolio. Our momentum and new launch opportunities position us well for the future growth. Now I'll turn the call over to Bob. Yes. Thank you, Len. Certainly, to give some very early market feedback, the comment that we're getting from key opinion leaders is that they don't see first met via product that potentially is a game changer and that the dosing is complex. And there are remaining questions on the clinical trial design and, of course, as Len mentioned, safety. More importantly, I'll go back over to EYLEA, where we certainly are establishing the product as standard of care and more across indications with great flexibility of dosing, indications, experience, real-world evidence, prefilled syringe and busy times. So we look forward to strong performance going forward on EYLEA, and we're very optimistic about what could be a next-generation product with our own aflibercept 8-milligram high-dose product if the Phase III data works out. Sure. Ronny, happy to take it, and I'm going to take the end of your question first. And I first would say that a competitor or a new entrant to the market's ability to compete is really going to be based on the differentiation of their product profile, the quality of their studies and the confidence and enthusiasm that the key opinion leaders have on the product as it comes in. So I do think differentiation matters quite a lot. In the case of EYLEA, certainly, our growth in the past year has been quite pronounced. We've captured not only the market growth, but we've also captured competitive share gain more than any other products, so that our market share today for EYLEA is approaching 50% of the overall category and 75% of the branded category. And we picked up several share points in the last year in this very large category. Let me go back now to new entrants. You're asking about timing of J codes, and that is important. Quality of product, as I mentioned, reflects confidence in how well it performs, but it is a six-month period before a new product receives a permanent J code. So in that window of time, especially in a product which is buy and bill, there's always the concern on reimbursement. There's not experience, not with the product, but there's also not experience with applying for reimbursement under the J-code. That period of time is six months. And to my earlier comment, product confidence will vary based on profile. I hope I've covered, Ronny, most of what you had in that. The only thing I think I probably missed is anti-VEGF category growth going forward. That is a little bit complicated because we're comparing to recovery in the market opposite the COVID period to some extent. However, there is growth of the category because of patient demographics and because of education. I'll give you an example of patients who are diagnosed with DME, only about 47%, 48% of those patients are treated. And those are -- and of those that are diagnosed, there's only -- if you took all DME patients that exist, only about 25% of those patients are treated. So there still is tremendous unmet need in the marketplace, and we certainly will work hard through educational initiatives to make sure that we perform very well as we have been on an ongoing basis on all of our indications. I hope that helps, Ronny. Sure. So at a high level, I'll share just and talk about our own business is, certainly, we have strong market understanding and work closely with all of our customers across the market segments. When it comes to how another company might be looking at their pricing or strategy, it's probably best I let them comment. But I appreciate the interest in the category and the question."

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Justin Holko, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJustin Holko: Thank you, Didi. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening to everyone listening around the globe. Thank you for your interest in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2021 Conference Call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website. Joining me today on the call are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. George Yancopoulos, Co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer; Marion McCourt, Executive Vice President and Head of Commercial; and Bob Landry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A.  I would also like to remind you that remarks made on today's call include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, those related to Regeneron and its products and business, financial forecast and guidance, development programs and related anticipated milestones, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, payer coverage and reimbursement issues, intellectual property, pending litigation and other proceedings and competition. Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected in that statement. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission including its Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2021, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  In addition, please note that GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed in today's call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP is available in our financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website. Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions.  With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.\nLeonard Schleifer: Thank you, Justin. And before I begin my remarks, let me just note that this may be Justin's last call, it may not be, at least in the position of IR. He is making a transition. He has decided he wants to make the news, not just report and explain the news and he is moving over to our commercial organization. So we're very excited, but we're not letting him go until his replacement is fully in place. So you may hear more from Justin in this role what you may not. He -- Justin has done a remarkable job. He is quick to point out to me that when he joined the company, the stock was only around $300. And now he says it's significantly higher. Justin, we thank you for your great service.  Turning to our business, we turned in another strong performance in the third quarter, which was marked by significant double-digit top and bottom line growth and continued operating leverage. This was more possible as a result of the truly exceptional execution by our colleagues across the entire company from R&D to production, commercial and support teams despite the challenges that we all faced imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Our core business of EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo, all contributed solid underlying growth. Additionally, we secured a third supply agreement with the United States government for REGEN-COV, our investigational antibody cocktail for treating and preventing COVID-19 in certain populations with initial deliveries fueling additional growth momentum in the quarter.  In R&D, our broad and growing pipeline, which now includes more than 30 clinical stage candidates with many more expected to enter the clinic in short order continues to advance new innovations to secure our long-term growth potential. Importantly, our pipeline continues to be largely composed and comprised of internal innovation. But increasingly, it is supplemented by external relationships that bring in novel modalities, including CRISPR and siRNA, creating unique treatment options and combination approaches as George will outline momentarily.  In the third quarter, beginning with EYLEA, global net sales of EYLEA were $2.4 billion, growing 15% compared to the prior year. U.S. EYLEA sales grew 12%, reflecting recovery of the anti-VEGF category and share gains as the leading anti-VEGF treatment for retinal diseases. We see the strength of EYLEA an opportunity for steady growth continuing despite potential upcoming competition from which we currently do not see any disruptive or game-changing new engines to the anti-VEGF space for treating retinal diseases.  Dupixent continues to be remarkable in delivering commercially and clinically across a wide spectrum of type 2 inflammatory diseases. In the third quarter, global net sales grew 55% to $1.7 billion. Growth contributions from inside and outside of the United States continued to improve operating leverage in our alliance with Sanofi.  Moreover, we announced positive results from 4 Phase III registrational studies in recent months, 1 in very young children with atopic dermatitis, and 3 in the potential new indications of eosinophilic esophagitis, prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria.  In October, the FDA expanded our asthma label to include children aged 6 to 11, a testament to not only the efficacy, but also the safety of Dupixent in the chronic treatment of type 2 inflammatory diseases. With several other disease opportunities in clinical development, such as COPD, the expansion possibilities are significant for this remarkable medicine that is already changing the lives of hundreds of thousands of patients.  In Oncology, Libtayo global net sales were $120 million and grew 24%. Despite the challenges imposed on the Oncology market by COVID-19, we're working hard as the leader in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and progressing in our basal cell carcinoma and lung cancer launches. We are also preparing for a potential launch in 2022 in the much larger opportunity of Libtayo combined with chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer.  REGEN-COV continues to grow in importance with increased utilization in the treatment of COVID-19. The FDA has accepted under priority review our biologic license application for the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19 in certain patients. We are also on review to expand the emergency use authorization for REGEN-COV in certain hospitalized patients and for pre-exposure prophylaxis.  Outside of the United States, our antibody cocktail has received a full approval in Japan, is conditionally approved in Australia and the U.K., and has emergency or temporary pandemic authorizations currently in place in more than 40 other countries.  REGEN-COV has the potential for a broad range of prevention and treatment applications from preexposure prophylaxis to treatment of infected hospitalized patients. Given the anticipation of new COVID infections over time, increased utilization of REGEN-COV in appropriate cases and the need for prophylaxis in immunocompromised individuals, we anticipate an ongoing role for REGEN-COV. If global demand warrants, we have the capacity to produce between 4 million to 5 million 1.2 gram doses in 2022, excluding any further supply contributions from Roche.  To conclude, as we close out 2021, our growth momentum is strong and our outlook for continued growth fueled by the breadth and depth of our pipeline is bright. Now I will turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len. I'll pick up where you left me with the REGEN-COV story. As Len mentioned, our robust COVID-19 development program involving more than 25,000 people to date has provided compelling evidence that REGEN-COV has the potential to be used for various prevention and treatment applications from pre-exposure prophylaxis to treating hospitalized patients. In the United States, REGEN-COV is currently authorized under an EUA and also being reviewed for full FDA approval for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 in certain patients with an action date of April 13, 2022. At Regeneron, we all appreciate that widespread vaccination is the best way to broadly protect as many people as possible from COVID-19. But recent research also reveals some important gaps in coverage provided by the vaccines, leaving some individuals uniquely vulnerable, particularly the several million immunocompromised people in the United States alone who remain prisoners of the pandemic.  First, many of the immunocompromised population respond sub-optimally or not at all to vaccination, even after booster shots. Second, breakthrough infections in the general population still occur after vaccination, meaning that immunocompromised people will continue to be at risk of encountering infected individuals even within a highly vaccinated population. Therefore, we believe that REGEN-COV could be of particular importance for these immunocompromised individuals who remain unprotected and also are at highest risk for developing the most severe COVID-19 disease. This includes people with certain hematologic cancers, for example, lymphomas, leukemias and myeloma and people who take certain immunosuppressive medicines for diseases such as multiple sclerosis, in rheumatoid arthritis, for organ transplant recipients and for those with primary immunodeficiencies.  In the United States, Regeneron submitted data and a request to the FDA to expand the existing emergency use authorization of REGEN-COV to include chronic prevention back in April. Further reflecting Regeneron's commitment to the immunocompromised, we recently began a big trial to optimize REGEN-COV prophylaxis in this population, including evaluation of extended dose.  Our current REGEN-COV cocktail retains potent activity against all known variants of interest, including the Delta variant. However, the virus continues to mutate and evolve. And thus, as we have previously discussed, we are advancing a novel anti-spike protein antibody cocktail into clinical development. We have done so proactively in the case of a novel innovative antibody cocktail that retains potency against new potential variants as required in the future.  Moving to Ophthalmology. We reported encouraging top line data of high-dose aflibercept in the Phase II CANDELA study in wet AMD. The small proof-of-concept study met its primary efficacy endpoint, a higher proportion of patients in the 8-milligram aflibercept group had no retinal fluid compared to patients treated with the currently approved 2-milligram EYLEA dose at week 16.  There were no safety signals observed in the comparison to the currently approved EYLEA 2-milligram dose, 2 large Phase III trials in wet AMD and DME, evaluating the high dose of aflibercept in dosing intervals of every 12 weeks and every 16 weeks are fully enrolled and are expected to report results in the second half of 2022. These Phase III data will be crucial to understanding overall efficacy, safety and convenience of high dose aflibercept.  Moving on to Dupixent. The remarkable clinical success of Dupixent across so many different allergic or type 2 inflammatory diseases, validates our early and long-standing hypothesis that these conditions are all driven by overactivation of the same fundamental immunologic pathway that is the interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 pathway, which is effectively blocked by Dupixent whether the disease manifests as asthma or chronic rhinositis with nasal polyps in the airways as atopic dermatitis or prurigo nodularis in the skin, as the eosinophilic esophagitis in the GI tract. Our clinical data have demonstrated an important impact of Dupixent on these many conditions that initially did not seem related. In only the past few months, Dupixent demonstrated positive results in 4 separate pivotal studies. This is a tremendous accomplishment stemming from the vision and dedication of our team and it's great news for patients suffering from these type 2 inflammatory diseases.  In a recent Phase III trial in atopic dermatitis in infants and children as young as 6 months of age, Dupixent met all primary and secondary endpoints as well as a lower observed rate of skin infections in the Dupixent group compared to placebo.  Detailed results from this trial will be presented at a future medical meeting, and data will be submitted to the FDA by the end of this year. These data reinforce the well-established efficacy and safety profile of Dupixent with over 0.5 million patients treated to date. We also reported recent Phase III data with Dupixent in eosinophilic esophagitis or EoE, a progressive disease that damages the esophagus and impairs the ability to swallow. More than 1/3 of the patients in our trial had manifestations of this disease so severe that they previously had to undergo endoscopic dilation of the esophagus for symptomatic relief. In our study, patients taking weekly Dupixent had an approximate 24-point improvement on the 0 to 84 dysphagia symptom questionnaire, representing a 64% improvement compared to a 14-point improvement for placebo.  This update reinforced previously reported Phase III results for which the 52-week follow-up results were recently presented at the United European Gastroenterology Week Virtual 2021 Congress. Completion of our regulatory filing for EoE in adolescents and adults is planned for early 2022. We also recently reported positive results for Dupixent from our Phase III trial in yet another inflammatory skin condition known as prurigo nodularis, an underdiagnosed disease characterized by extreme itch and skin nodules. The trial met its primary and all key secondary endpoints in comparison to placebo, including reduction in itch from baseline at 12 and 24 weeks, achieving clear skin and improvement in quality of life. A second trial in prurigo nodularis is fully enrolled and is expected to read out in the first half of '22 with regulatory submissions planned for the same year.  If all these exciting Phase III data lead to regulatory approvals, Dupixent would be approved for 6 different allergic or type 2 inflammatory disease indications, including patients as young as 6 months.  Moving to Libtayo in Oncology. Positive Phase III data of Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy in first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer were presented at the ESMO 2021 meeting. These data mark Libtayo as 1 of only 2 PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors to demonstrate positive Phase III results in first line non-small cell lung cancer, irrespective of histology, both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy. These Libtayo studies were conducted in a patient population that included difficult-to-treat disease characteristics that reflects everyday clinical practice. We are rapidly progressing towards regulatory submission for the Libtayo chemotherapy combination across histologies and PD-L1 expression levels, which could unlock an opportunity to help a larger population of lung cancer patients.  Turning to Hematology. At the upcoming American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting for ASH, we will provide updates to our developing Hematology portfolio. The nodal presentation we will provide a data update for our potentially registrational first-in-human trial of REGN5458. Our BCMA by CD3 bispecific antibody tested in patients with heavily pretreated multiple myeloma. REGN5458 to be a major advance in treatment of patients who have failed several prior lines of therapy, but the potential utility of our BCMA-targeted bispecific is not limited to this patient population. We will discuss our data and further development plans at our virtual ASH Investor event scheduled for Monday, December 13 regarding odronextamab or CD20 by CD3 bispecific. We are pleased with our -- with recruitment in our potentially pivotal trial since the partial clinical hall was lifted earlier this year. Exploration of subcutaneous formulation of odronextamab is on track to start by the end of this year. We are planning to initiate broader Phase III programs in 2022.  Our bispecific development program for solid tumors is progressing with our unique approaches, including the MUC16xCD3 bispecific as monotherapy in ovarian cancer as well as in combination with Libtayo or with our MUC16xCD28 costim. In addition, we expect to have initial data with our PSMAxCD28 costim in patients with prostate cancer in '22.  We are also excited about our EGFRxCD28 costim clinical program across multiple EGF high cancer settings, including lung cancer as well as our clinical stage METxMET bispecific and our METxMET antibody drug conjugate, presenting a new  for Regeneron into the realm of drug conjugates linked to our potentially best in class bispecific antibodies.  In conclusion for Oncology, we are approaching an important new phase for Regeneron. We have several novel Phase I/II programs in clinical development with more expected in the coming months. We also have large Phase III studies planned such as our LAG-3 Libtayo for first-line advanced melanoma against the pembrolizumab monotherapy comparator as well as large registrational programs for our Hematology/Oncology bispecifics. We're excited about the potential that these important investments in our portfolio may bring to patients.  I would like to conclude with our Regeneron genetics medicines in our collaboration updates. We are uniquely positioned to combine products of our established biologics portfolio and emerging findings from our genetics medicine efforts. As part of our collaboration with Alnylam, we are looking forward to multiple updates on our C5 program. As we already mentioned ASH meeting, we will show first-in-human data for our C5 antibody, pozelimab in combination with the C5 inhibiting siRNA, cemdisiran. We will present initial results in healthy volunteers, which supports development of this first-of-its-kind combination of an antibody and an siRNA therapeutic. Early data on siRNA monotherapy mediated C5  did not achieve complete terminal complement blockade, which is necessary for adequate disease control in PNH or paroxysmal nocturnal hematuria. Adding the antibody specific for the same target protein could provide patients with a lower dose therapy and a more convenient extended dosing regimen while providing more complete C5 inhibition, resulting in better efficacy and less breakthrough hemolysis.  We have also recently initiated a Phase III study testing the C5 antibody and siRNA combination in myasthenia gravis. For PNH, starting next year, we are planning to test our combo in both naive and switch patients tested against standard of care therapies, including ravulizumab and eculizumab. This study has the potential to show a true benefit of the combination approach for the treatment of this disease.  Also in collaboration with Alnylam, some of our initial genetic target discoveries are reaching the stage of clinical readouts for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH, a disease where finding compelling treatment options has been difficult. We're using the siRNA approach to silence the gene we identified as a potential target. Recall, we discovered that people with a protective HSD17B13 gene variant have a 30% to 70% lower odds of chronic liver disease. Our collaborator, Alnylam, will show initial healthy volunteer safety data for the Alnylam HSD, the HSD17B13 targeting siRNA at their upcoming R&D Day later this month.  Finally, in October, the Regeneron Genetics Center published a manuscript in nature, which highlighted achievement of the milestone of sequencing almost 0.5 million exomes from the U.K. Biobank database. This nature paper for the first time describes rare variants of genes that could be potential drug targets for diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, asthma and others.  And with that, I will turn the call over to Marion.\nMarion McCourt: Thank you, George. Our third quarter business performance demonstrates the strength of our commercial portfolio. We are executing well on our in-line brands and are maximizing opportunities for diversified and sustainable growth through ongoing launches.  First, I will highlight recent achievements with REGEN-COV, our COVID-19 antibody cocktail, which is available in the U.S. under emergency use authorization by the FDA. In the third quarter, U.S. net sales were $677 million, primarily based on the initial deliveries of our third government agreement, which was announced in mid-September. Demand for REGEN-COV accelerated sharply over the third quarter as this promising treatment option continues to help fight the surge in COVID-19 cases. REGEN-COV is increasingly seen as standard of care for outpatient treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis in appropriate patients. Our field educators continue to support key stakeholders in health care systems at administration sites.  While COVID-19 cases have thankfully decreased over the last several weeks, demand for REGEN-COV remains high with many patients receiving treatment. REGEN-COV has broad therapeutic application in current and potential future integrations across the spectrum of disease from pre-exposure prevention to hospitalization. We look forward to the FDA's decision on our application for a full approval expected in April of 2022.  Beyond REGEN-COV, we delivered strong growth from our core business in the third quarter. Starting with EYLEA, third quarter global net sales grew 15% year-over-year to more than $2.4 billion. In the U.S., net sales grew 12% year-over-year to nearly $1.5 billion based on category recovery and EYLEA's competitor share gains. EYLEA secured nearly 50% of the overall category and over 75% of the branded category based on our overall platform of efficacy, safety and convenience.  There are positive early indicators from our unbranded direct-to-consumer campaign that educates patients with diabetic eye disease on the importance of vision care. Retina specialists have applauded our efforts encouraging diabetic patients to seek treatment to prevent irreversible vision loss.  EYLEA's competitive profile, coupled with favorable underlying demographic trends give us confidence in Regeneron's ongoing leadership position in retinal diseases.  Turning to Libtayo. Global net sales were $120 million. In the U.S., net sales reached $78 million despite continued COVID impacts on new patient starts. With new indication launches at early stages, the vast majority of sales came from advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or CSCC, where Libtayo is the #1 systemic treatment. Building on our success in CSCC, we are quickly establishing Libtayo as standard of care in advanced basal cell carcinoma for patients in the second-line setting or where a Hedgehog inhibitor is not appropriate. In lung cancer, we are working to secure a physician experience with Libtayo as a competitive monotherapy treatment option. We look forward to the potential chemotherapy combination approval, which would unlock the much larger group of first-line patients eligible for anti-PD-1.  Briefly turning to Evkeeza, which is now being used to treat more patients than the prior standard of care, we continue to see initiations in both switch and new-to-category patients, illustrating how our innovative patient identification efforts can be used to support those with HoFH and in the future, other rare diseases.  And finally, to Dupixent, in the third quarter, global net sales grew 55% year-over-year to $1.7 billion and U.S. net sales grew 48% to $1.3 billion. This growth was driven across all approved indications, with new patient starts above pre-COVID levels. In atopic dermatitis, prescribing trends are strong across the spectrum of moderate-to-severe disease, including adolescent and pediatric patients. Dupixent continues to capture market growth based on well-established efficacy and safety, breadth of current indications and unmatched physician and patient experience. There continues to be substantial potential growth in atopic dermatitis, including in children as young as 6 months in age and more broadly in Dermatology with new potential indications of chronic spontaneous urticaria and prurigo nodularis.  In respiratory disease, Dupixent continues to surpass recent competitive biologic launches. In asthma, we see ongoing potential to differentiate Dupixent through its competitive profile and label expansion as the market recovers from COVID, when asthma-related emergency room visits were down nearly 50%. Our launch in pediatric asthma is underway, extending this treatment option to 75,000 children in the U.S. who suffer from this often debilitating disease.  Dupixent's label was also recently updated to include an additional marker of type 2 inflammation called pheno, which extends the eligible population beyond those with high eosinophilic levels. In addition, Dupixent can be prescribed for steroid-dependent asthma regardless of eosinophilic levels.  In nasal polyps, we continue to see growth with Dupixent leading the market despite new competition. Dupixent continues to be the preferred choice of ENTs and allergists regardless of prior surgery.  In summary, our commercial team continues to deliver strong growth across the portfolio with differentiated brands, ongoing and potential future launches, we remain on track for long-term growth. Now, I'll turn the call over to Bob.\nRobert Landry: Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. In the third quarter, Regeneron once again delivered strong top and bottom line growth on increasingly diversified revenue streams with contributions from REGEN-COV in our robust core business. For the third quarter, total revenues grew 51% year-over-year to $3.5 billion. Total diluted net income per share grew 84% year-over-year to $15.37 on net income of $1.8 billion. Excluding revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, total revenues grew 18% versus the prior year. Starting with REGEN-COV. In the third quarter, we recognized $677 million of U.S. net sales, which consist largely of the initial deliveries of approximately 300,000 doses to the U.S. government under the new 1.4 million dose contract as announced in September. Our collaborator, Roche, record sales of the COVID-19 antibody cocktail known as Ronapreve outside the U.S. In accordance with our Roche agreement, as a true-up payment for global profits, we recorded an additional $127 million as Roche collaboration revenue. In the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver approximately 800,000 doses of REGEN-COV in the U.S. out of which, Roche will supply approximately half of these doses. We will record all REGEN-COV U.S. net product sales. Given the mix of manufactured product supply to the market by Roche and Regeneron, the true-up payment for global profits is expected to result in 0 Roche collaboration revenues in the fourth quarter. The remaining doses from the U.S. government contract are expected to be delivered in the first quarter of 2022. I will now move to our Bayer collaboration. Ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales reported to us by Bayer worth $931 million for the third quarter of 2021, representing growth of 19% on a reported basis and 18% on a constant currency basis. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $365 million, of which we recorded $351 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $582 million in the third quarter of 2021. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and Kevzara was $387 million, which compares favorably to our share of profits of $213 million in the prior year. We also recognized a $50 million sales milestone payment related to achievement of $1.5 billion of ex-U.S. sales for the collaboration on a rolling 12-month basis. Moving on to operating expenses. R&D decreased slightly to $592 million, primarily due to lower spending of REGEN-COV development as compared to the third quarter of 2020. Next, SG&A expense increased 34% year-over-year to $391 million, primarily due to costs related to growth initiatives for EYLEA and higher headcount. Cost to goods sold increased versus the prior year from $122 million to $224 million, primarily due to REGEN-COV manufacturing costs. Cost of collaboration manufacturing increased 50% year-over-year to $214 million, driven by higher production to support the growing Dupixent sales. Finally, the effective tax rate was 10.8% in the third quarter of 2021. Shifting to cash flow on the balance sheet. Year-to-date, Regeneron has generated $4.3 billion in free cash flow and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of $8.7 billion. We continued to utilize our strong balance sheet in accordance with our capital allocation priorities of investing in internal R&D, funding strategic external R&D partnerships and returning cash to shareholders. Accordingly, in the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $191 million of our shares. To conclude, I'd like to provide select updates to our 2021 guidance. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release published earlier this morning. With our -- we are updating our 2021 gross margin guidance to be approximately 88%. This estimate is inclusive of an expected payment to Roche as a true-up of global profits for the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, which will be reported as cost of goods sold. As a result, we expect our gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter to be the lowest of the year. We are also updating our 2021 R&D guidance to be in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion. The change to the guidance range is related to updated phasing of expenses and lower spend on REGEN-COV. Looking ahead, we will continue to make investments into both our commercial business and our broad pipeline for long-term growth. In particular, we expect to advance critically important development programs in 2022, including the late-stage studies for the LAG-3 Libtayo combo, BCMA by CD3 and C5 along with branded comparators, as George mentioned earlier, in advancing programs with our collaborators. In conclusion, we're pleased with the third quarter as we invest in our robust pipeline to drive sustained long-term growth. I will now turn the call back to Justin.\nJustin Holko: Thank you, Bob. Didi, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. . Please go ahead, Didi.\nOperator: . Our first question comes from Geoff Porges of SVB Leerink.\nGeoffrey Porges: Congratulations on the really remarkable results and the outlook. George, perhaps I could ask you about the costims. We've been wondering when we're going to see the first data for the CD28 costims. Could you clarify exactly what we should expect to see next year? And from which combinations? And then just related to that, just these coming up, and there's a lot of discussion about 4-1BB. Could you clarify why you chose to pursue CD28 for your costims rather than 4-1BB?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. As we indicated, we'll be hopefully providing data in the coming year, and it all depends on how the trials progress. Obviously, one has to deal with combination trials where one is dose escalating. And so those are what are limiting getting to effective doses and so forth. In terms of the choices, it all dependent on the science. Our various studies preclinically and in humanized animal models, which show that it was, in our minds, it made most sense to initiate our efforts with the CD28 costim approach.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Raymond of Piper Sandler.\nChristopher Raymond: I guess maybe more of a macro question. I know the ink is hardly even dry, I guess, on some of the prescription drug pricing framework negotiations and the write-up that's a company that from Congress. But this is something I'm sure you guys are watching closely. And obviously, any changes to Medicare Part B is potentially impactful to your business. Just any thoughts here on the impact to EYLEA, especially when considering the cap on out-of-pocket spending that's been proposed and discussed?\nLeonard Schleifer: So Chris, you're right. The ink isn't dry. Some of the bill has been written in disappearing ink and some is in changing ink, but -- so it's hard to get a fix on it. I would say -- as I understand the bill and based on the most recent update, the cap on expenditures is limited to Part D, as in David, drugs. So it would not affect Part B, as in boy. I think I've got that right as I said -- as you said, the ink is really not dry. I will say that, generally speaking, it is quite remarkable just from my personal perspective, that the industry that is most responsible for getting the country in the world out of the pandemic in as best shape as we can is the source of such great attack. But fortunately, I think that some rational heads have prevailed and the most draconian ideas have been written in that disappearing ink.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Yaron Werber of Cowen and Company.\nYaron Werber: Congrats on the team on a great quarter. Really just a quick one actually on the pozelimab and cemdisiran combo. I'd already mentioned some potential combo treatment studies, PNH and MG. Again, some of the other C5s, really kind of wanted to ask a little bit about how you're thinking about real-world use of this one. I know there's a lot of movement in -- especially the MG space. Is this something that we should expect to compete maybe more with Soliris? Or are you thinking a little bit further up the line against IVIG or some of the FcRns? Just kind of want to get your thoughts there.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. I mean we are hoping that this is going to turn out to be the best-in-class in terms of efficacy and also in terms of convenience for these disease categories. So yes, we're thinking about and depending on how the landscape evolves, that, that could be the opportunity that we would be going after.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Schimmer of Evercore ISI.\nJoshua Schimmer: For the high-dose aflibercept Phase III studies, what signals are you looking for a potential filing as OCD sickness benefit alone insufficient to move forward. Is that going to be under a new BLA or an SBLA? And as such, how do you think that would fall under proposed drug pricing legislation and whether it would reset the clock for that product?\nLeonard Schleifer: Yes. I'll comment on the regulatory assets and George can comment maybe on the design aspects. But at the moment, we don't think this would be a new BLA, and this would be part of the -- this would likely be an SBLA, George?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. Basically, we are, as you said, we're looking, of course, to look at differences in terms of anatomic improvements, but the trial is a noninferiority study. Where we're going to be testing is whether patients that are being treated at a dramatically increased interval do as well as regular dose EYLEA had an 8-week interval. So it's going to depend on hopefully seeing that substantially higher numbers of patients are going to be able to be treated at extended dose intervals compared to the 2-milligram dose while achieving similar visual acuity effects.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carter Gould of Barclays.\nCarter Gould: Excellent results, guys. I wanted to ask on REGN14256, I guess, the new running partner for imdevimab. And if development was really in response to a specific shift you're seeing in the variants or lower efficacy? Or if you were looking to optimize on other domains? And I guess, in responding to that, could you also address kind of your expectations for running studies, conducting studies with a, I guess, a lower background rate of hospitalization?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes, all good and somewhat complicated questions. Right now, obviously, as we've said, our cocktail remains active against all the known variants of concern that have emerged and created issues for other antibodies and so forth. However, we want to be prepared. So we're creating a complementary cocktail that if ever variants would arise that would raise problems for our current cocktail, we would have a complementary cocktail that the way we designed it would hopefully be unaffected by the same types of mutations. So it's to be prepared for that possibility that as the virus continues to evolve, we might need a cocktail that might not be sensitive to the same mutations as the first cocktail. But the current cocktail is still active against the variants of concern. Yes. There's a lot of questions in terms of how to design the study, where to do it, depending on rates of hospitalization and rates of infection. So these are the complications that we've had to navigate throughout this pandemic, as you might remember. And throughout this pandemic, we have managed to carry out the largest COVID-19 program for treatment and for prevention using antibodies. And we hope that, that all the knowledge that we gained from learning how to navigate changing, fluctuating infection rates and hospitalization rates and so forth, we can continue to take advantage of that and continue to carry out our program efficiently and as quickly as possible.\nLeonard Schleifer: Yes. Let me just add to that and emphasize what George has said in his earlier remarks, which is that a lot of what we see as the big future need is in the pre-exposure prophylaxis. And that pre-exposure prophylaxis is likely not to go away because of the ongoing infections, the breakthrough infections that still occur in fully vaccinated people. Mind you, with the orals coming, we'll see whether they actually get to the United States. They do have some safety and efficacy issues as a class so far. They have not demonstrated the comparable core study comparisons, notwithstanding the kind of efficacy that monoclonals have delivered nor have they satisfied so many people's satisfaction, the safety concerns around using ImmunoGen perhaps okay for short term. But when you're getting into longer-term prophylaxis of the immunocompromised, which is where George mentioned, we have a lot of work ongoing. It's really important to remember that we expect to have -- our molecules should be able to be given quite less frequently, I think, one might expect because you're looking at a prophylaxis mode. And we think that they should, based on the evidence we have, delivered really rather remarkable efficacy in that setting as they already have in the non-immunocompromised. So as the market transitions to a prophylaxis mode, we see an ongoing demand and need, which we're preparing to meet for monoclonal cocktail therapy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kennen MacKay of RBC Capital Markets.\nKennen MacKay: First, let me say to Len that I got your commentary towards political or rather governmental purchases of the REGEN-COV antibody cocktail. Thank you for being the voice of science and reason here. Maybe for my question, I have actually really admired your BD strategy, which shows a lot of awareness recognizing areas of expertise, but also limitations and looking to be in partnerships and licensing to outsource the latter. I was wondering what you're really interested now on the BD front, if there are any technologies that are jumping out as additional areas of opportunity for the company? And then sort of partial to that, whether you are at all interested in this newly emerging field of protein degradation and protein degraders, as Oncology targets?\nLeonard Schleifer: George should take this. He's been the architect of the scientific underpinnings of our BD strategy and having a remarkable vision to be able to integrate that with our core expertise, George?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Well, yes, I think if we were looking to get into new technologies and have new relationships, I don't think we would be telling you about them at this time.\nKennen MacKay: Wait, George. Could you comment on your prior strategy on how siRNA and ?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Well, I think, yes, what Len referring to is I think that the whole team, the whole company at many levels from the business development group through -- the science research folks through our premanufacturing group has done a spectacular job of pivoting us from a solely biologics company to a genetic medicines company. What we've managed to do is starting with our Regeneron Genetics Center is create what we believe is perhaps the world's most powerful technology to identify new genetic targets based on our sequencing of almost 2 million individuals, all linked to electronic digital records.  That allows us to understand, we think, more powerfully than anybody else, the role of genetic variation, both in disease protection and causation, which have led to a whole series of new disease targets for both protection and causation. And for those, some of those are addressable by biologics and they're part of our existing approaches with biologics, but we had to use new approaches. And for those purposes, we started creating some of these important outside alliances and collaborations with companies like Alnylam for the siRNA approaches, we talked a little bit about and with Intellia with CRISPR-based approaches. Many of these, we've been able to build and create and take them to another level based on our very productive collaborations with these 2 great companies that we're now collaborating with. And we also invested enormously internally in terms of building our own gene therapy approaches. So we believe that we're positioning ourselves to become leaders for the foreseeable future over the next decade or so in the genetic medicine space. It's becoming an increasingly important and larger part of our portfolio. It's almost a whole separate company, we believe, in terms of the opportunities and the value that it generates. While we're maintaining our leadership position with biologics, not only with classical antibodies but also with bispecifics and all sorts of engineered formats of biologics. So I think it's been a tremendous job by our entire team and organization to essentially create this entirely new capability.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ronny Gal of Alliance Bernstein.\nAaron Gal: So following on the last question, can you comment a little bit about when we can see your first kind of CRISPR-based technology in a trial that you run coming into the clinic? Will it be in 2022 or 2023? And then with this full additional company, should we expect the R&D cost to continue to rise roughly at the rate they've historically been?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Okay. I'll remind you that I believe we announced last quarter, our first CRISPR results which were the first obtained by anybody in history in terms of using a systemic CRISPR-based therapy to actually modify genes within human beings. It was an incredibly successful study that we did in collaboration with Intellia. It was the first-ever systemic investigational CRISPR-based gene knockout approach. And in the first set of patients that we treated, we show that a single dose of this CRISPR-based therapy led to very dramatic and dose-dependent reductions in the target protein coming from the target gene. I think that the world viewed this as incredibly exciting data. I believe we announced it in June of '21. And I think it's just the beginning of a very large program. We have about 20 preclinical programs now under evaluation that will be rolling out in terms of going into the clinic and producing clinical results over the next couple of years.\nRobert Landry: And Ronny, let me punctuate, right? So we'll give kind of guidance in our fourth quarter earnings in early February. I will tell you, if you look at our kind of run rate this year, R&D relative to 2020, we're coming out at roughly a 7% increase if you take the midpoint of my guidance. And I guess my word of caution is a lot of that's heavy REGEN-COV in 2020. So we're going up against the big REGEN-COV number in 2020 as compared to what we incurred in 2021. So that 7% is, I'd say, artificially light compared to where we're going to eventually end up and we do give that guidance. So I just want to make sure people are not kind of doing same year run rates as they're seeing in 2021.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Charlie  on for Matthew. Can you please comment on the Libtayo activities and the commercial dynamics, given the relatively modest kind of quarter-to-quarter growth?\nMarion McCourt: Sure, Charlie. This is Marion. Let me take that. First off, we have great ambition, of course, for Libtayo. As I mentioned, the bulk of our sales today are from our launch of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Understandably, our more recent launches have brought us again into derm with basal cell carcinoma, where Libtayo is very quickly becoming the standard of care for appropriate patients based on its clinical profile and based on, obviously, patients unfortunately fail with hedgehog inhibitors, which also can be really difficult to tolerate. So we're very pleased with how that launch is going early days. Most important, however, is our lung launch. The initial launch we had in monotherapy is understandably for a smaller target group of patients. We do believe, however, though, the experience that physicians are gaining with Libtayo in first-line monotherapy treatment is very, very important and bodes well for when we hopefully have the larger indication approved for chemo combo. And that as many of you are aware is a much larger population of patients, perhaps 4- to 5-fold more patients, and we certainly look forward to potentially being able to launch that larger indication in lung.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Truist.\nRobyn Karnauskas: I was wondering if you can satisfy a little bit of my curiosity about the news flow coming out of your Intellia partnership. I guess the first question I'd ask is in the event that they'll be hosting next year, in the first quarter, how much durability data might we get for TTR? And then, George, you mentioned the additional indication over the next few years that you'll be going into. When are we going to be hearing about those, would we hear about a lot of them in the beginning of the year or would we hear about them over the course of the year, I know Intellia is of huge investor interest as well as mine.\nLeonard Schleifer: I wonder if we shouldn't give Intellia the opportunity to give that kind of guidance, Robyn.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: I'm sure that might be the approach.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alethia Young of Cantor.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Before you get with that question. I do think just to help Robyn out a little bit, I think one really important point is, yes, as the data continues to mature and certainly, we expect excellent duration data coming out over time and so forth. But I think we all have to recognize that this represents the first true validation of this entire field and approach. And our ability working with Intellia using our specific approach to actually turn it from dream into reality. And this obviously dramatically increases the probability of success of all of our future programs based on our collaborative technology with Intellia, including both knockout and insertion approaches, and we have to, of course, highlight and point out the lack of such proof of concept and success with any other approaches to date. And I think that, that really distinguishes our collaboration with Intellia. And obviously, should adjust the risk profile for all of our programs going forward, which, as Len said, hopefully, we and Intellia will be giving more resolution on going forward.\nLeonard Schleifer: Go ahead, Alethia.\nAlethia Young: Congrats on the quarter. I just had a question about kind of, obviously, you have very robust AOE data with Dupixent. Can you just talk a little bit about how you think about the market opportunity there? And like how -- what diagnosis is like there and how you can potentially expand that?\nMarion McCourt: Sure. So we're very excited about the possibility of launching Dupixent also for eosinophilic esophagitis. As George was describing, there's tremendous unmet need in the marketplace in patients who truly are suffering and often end up in the emergency room with difficult procedures to try to remedy for the short-term, some of the difficult symptoms they have. The size of patient population for those who are undergoing recurrent treatment is about 48,000. And then obviously, there are patients who are entering the system beyond that. But probably just as a starter number that 48,000 to 50,000 who have failed multiple treatments is the core group. And then we will extend beyond that to probably about another 150,000 patients with EoE, who also have earned the need of treatment. But the failure group, obviously, of 50,000 is the most severe.\nJustin Holko: Didi, we have time for two more quick questions.\nOperator: Our next question is from Esther Rajavelu of UBS.\nEsther Rajavelu: I have one on EYLEA, perhaps a multipart question. Can you give us some details on use among diabetics versus nondiabetic patients? And is the uptake among diabetics type to more consistent use among treated patients? Or are you onboarding new diabetics? And lastly, anything you can share on NPDR versus diabetic macular edema patients would be helpful as well.\nMarion McCourt: Sure. So let me give you a little bit of background and some characterization. Certainly, our indications for diabetic eye disease are the fastest growing in terms of new patients proportionately coming into the treatment paradigm. We also see a growth in the diabetes treatment population for EYLEA opposite, for example, wet AMD. So now our wet AMD treatment is under 60% of the total utilization of EYLEA in the U.S. marketplace. The specific growth on diabetic eye disease by indication, it's difficult to give you the exact breakdown, but we are very optimistic on even the early efforts we see in market based on our new unbranded direct-to-consumer TV campaign, which is really educating diabetic patients broadly on the importance of having their vision checked, making sure it's part of the regular check-in as patients with diabetes have other areas that they standardly review and make sure of their care. Eye disease has often been neglected with very disastrous situations of vision loss that can't be corrected. So we see that as a really important area and one that will fuel diabetic eye disease treatment broadly. But even today, and before we embarked upon that program, we see it as a high growth indication.\nJustin Holko: Didi, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Yatin Suneja of Guggenheim Partners.\nYatin Suneja: Congrats on the quarter of good performance. Just quickly on the complement efforts. Can you just talk about other CNS or Neurology applications with either the monotherapy or the combination? And then with respect to the siRNA approach, could we take that -- could you take that into the eye and what the long-term vision there is?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes, we're not going to say too much about your first question. But in terms of your second question, absolutely. And so when we establish this relationship with Alnylam in terms of using siRNA, it was actually directed towards 3 separate areas. So really was 3 separate collaborations. The one in the first that we thought that we'd be moving the most rapidly into the clinic and that has turned out to be the case were with liver targets, both sort of more conventional targets like the C5, but also targets that were coming from our own pipeline like the HSD target that we talked about. And that -- those are all moving along forward and we think a very exciting fashion as we've discussed. Another key area that you just opened up, which is still preclinically, but we're hoping to eventually move into the clinic is targeting the eye targets with siRNAs. And that's really a very important area for us, and it was a very important separate part of the entire Alnylam collaboration. And the third really critical foundational part of our collaboration with Alnylam involved using siRNAs to target in the brain. And that's also moving forward in a very exciting fashion, and we'll be talking a lot more about that going forward. So really, it's a 3 sort of pillar program, liver targets, eye targets and CNS targets. We're very excited and moving forward on all of them. And as we had guided early on, the first set of targets, of course, would be in the liver and then we'd be moving into the other 2 areas as rapidly as possible.\nJustin Holko: Great. Thanks, everyone. That will conclude our call. Bob Landry and the IR team will be available today to answer any additional questions you may have. Thanks, everyone, and stay safe. Goodbye.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Marion McCourt",
            "content": "Thank you, George. Our third quarter business performance demonstrates the strength of our commercial portfolio. We are executing well on our in-line brands and are maximizing opportunities for diversified and sustainable growth through ongoing launches.  First, I will highlight recent achievements with REGEN-COV, our COVID-19 antibody cocktail, which is available in the U.S. under emergency use authorization by the FDA. In the third quarter, U.S. net sales were $677 million, primarily based on the initial deliveries of our third government agreement, which was announced in mid-September. Demand for REGEN-COV accelerated sharply over the third quarter as this promising treatment option continues to help fight the surge in COVID-19 cases. REGEN-COV is increasingly seen as standard of care for outpatient treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis in appropriate patients. Our field educators continue to support key stakeholders in health care systems at administration sites.  While COVID-19 cases have thankfully decreased over the last several weeks, demand for REGEN-COV remains high with many patients receiving treatment. REGEN-COV has broad therapeutic application in current and potential future integrations across the spectrum of disease from pre-exposure prevention to hospitalization. We look forward to the FDA's decision on our application for a full approval expected in April of 2022.  Beyond REGEN-COV, we delivered strong growth from our core business in the third quarter. Starting with EYLEA, third quarter global net sales grew 15% year-over-year to more than $2.4 billion. In the U.S., net sales grew 12% year-over-year to nearly $1.5 billion based on category recovery and EYLEA's competitor share gains. EYLEA secured nearly 50% of the overall category and over 75% of the branded category based on our overall platform of efficacy, safety and convenience.  There are positive early indicators from our unbranded direct-to-consumer campaign that educates patients with diabetic eye disease on the importance of vision care. Retina specialists have applauded our efforts encouraging diabetic patients to seek treatment to prevent irreversible vision loss.  EYLEA's competitive profile, coupled with favorable underlying demographic trends give us confidence in Regeneron's ongoing leadership position in retinal diseases.  Turning to Libtayo. Global net sales were $120 million. In the U.S., net sales reached $78 million despite continued COVID impacts on new patient starts. With new indication launches at early stages, the vast majority of sales came from advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or CSCC, where Libtayo is the #1 systemic treatment. Building on our success in CSCC, we are quickly establishing Libtayo as standard of care in advanced basal cell carcinoma for patients in the second-line setting or where a Hedgehog inhibitor is not appropriate. In lung cancer, we are working to secure a physician experience with Libtayo as a competitive monotherapy treatment option. We look forward to the potential chemotherapy combination approval, which would unlock the much larger group of first-line patients eligible for anti-PD-1.  Briefly turning to Evkeeza, which is now being used to treat more patients than the prior standard of care, we continue to see initiations in both switch and new-to-category patients, illustrating how our innovative patient identification efforts can be used to support those with HoFH and in the future, other rare diseases.  And finally, to Dupixent, in the third quarter, global net sales grew 55% year-over-year to $1.7 billion and U.S. net sales grew 48% to $1.3 billion. This growth was driven across all approved indications, with new patient starts above pre-COVID levels. In atopic dermatitis, prescribing trends are strong across the spectrum of moderate-to-severe disease, including adolescent and pediatric patients. Dupixent continues to capture market growth based on well-established efficacy and safety, breadth of current indications and unmatched physician and patient experience. There continues to be substantial potential growth in atopic dermatitis, including in children as young as 6 months in age and more broadly in Dermatology with new potential indications of chronic spontaneous urticaria and prurigo nodularis.  In respiratory disease, Dupixent continues to surpass recent competitive biologic launches. In asthma, we see ongoing potential to differentiate Dupixent through its competitive profile and label expansion as the market recovers from COVID, when asthma-related emergency room visits were down nearly 50%. Our launch in pediatric asthma is underway, extending this treatment option to 75,000 children in the U.S. who suffer from this often debilitating disease.  Dupixent's label was also recently updated to include an additional marker of type 2 inflammation called pheno, which extends the eligible population beyond those with high eosinophilic levels. In addition, Dupixent can be prescribed for steroid-dependent asthma regardless of eosinophilic levels.  In nasal polyps, we continue to see growth with Dupixent leading the market despite new competition. Dupixent continues to be the preferred choice of ENTs and allergists regardless of prior surgery.  In summary, our commercial team continues to deliver strong growth across the portfolio with differentiated brands, ongoing and potential future launches, we remain on track for long-term growth. Now, I'll turn the call over to Bob. Sure, Charlie. This is Marion. Let me take that. First off, we have great ambition, of course, for Libtayo. As I mentioned, the bulk of our sales today are from our launch of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.

            "name": "Leonard Schleifer",
            "content": "Thank you, Justin. And before I begin my remarks, let me just note that this may be Justin's last call, it may not be, at least in the position of IR. He is making a transition. He has decided he wants to make the news, not just report and explain the news and he is moving over to our commercial organization. So we're very excited, but we're not letting him go until his replacement is fully in place. So you may hear more from Justin in this role what you may not. He -- Justin has done a remarkable job. He is quick to point out to me that when he joined the company, the stock was only around $300. And now he says it's significantly higher. Justin, we thank you for your great service.  Turning to our business, we turned in another strong performance in the third quarter, which was marked by significant double-digit top and bottom line growth and continued operating leverage. This was more possible as a result of the truly exceptional execution by our colleagues across the entire company from R&D to production, commercial and support teams despite the challenges that we all faced imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Our core business of EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo, all contributed solid underlying growth. Additionally, we secured a third supply agreement with the United States government for REGEN-COV, our investigational antibody cocktail for treating and preventing COVID-19 in certain populations with initial deliveries fueling additional growth momentum in the quarter.  In R&D, our broad and growing pipeline, which now includes more than 30 clinical stage candidates with many more expected to enter the clinic in short order continues to advance new innovations to secure our long-term growth potential. Importantly, our pipeline continues to be largely composed and comprised of internal innovation. But increasingly, it is supplemented by external relationships that bring in novel modalities, including CRISPR and siRNA, creating unique treatment options and combination approaches as George will outline momentarily.  In the third quarter, beginning with EYLEA, global net sales of EYLEA were $2.4 billion, growing 15% compared to the prior year. U.S. EYLEA sales grew 12%, reflecting recovery of the anti-VEGF category and share gains as the leading anti-VEGF treatment for retinal diseases. We see the strength of EYLEA an opportunity for steady growth continuing despite potential upcoming competition from which we currently do not see any disruptive or game-changing new engines to the anti-VEGF space for treating retinal diseases.  Dupixent continues to be remarkable in delivering commercially and clinically across a wide spectrum of type 2 inflammatory diseases. In the third quarter, global net sales grew 55% to $1.7 billion. Growth contributions from inside and outside of the United States continued to improve operating leverage in our alliance with Sanofi.  Moreover, we announced positive results from 4 Phase III registrational studies in recent months, 1 in very young children with atopic dermatitis, and 3 in the potential new indications of eosinophilic esophagitis, prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria.  In October, the FDA expanded our asthma label to include children aged 6 to 11, a testament to not only the efficacy, but also the safety of Dupixent in the chronic treatment of type 2 inflammatory diseases. With several other disease opportunities in clinical development, such as COPD, the expansion possibilities are significant for this remarkable medicine that is already changing the lives of hundreds of thousands of patients.  In Oncology, Libtayo global net sales were $120 million and grew 24%. Despite the challenges imposed on the Oncology market by COVID-19, we're working hard as the leader in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and progressing in our basal cell carcinoma and lung cancer launches. We are also preparing for a potential launch in 2022 in the much larger opportunity of Libtayo combined with chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer.  REGEN-COV continues to grow in importance with increased utilization in the treatment of COVID-19. The FDA has accepted under priority review our biologic license application for the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19 in certain patients. We are also on review to expand the emergency use authorization for REGEN-COV in certain hospitalized patients and for pre-exposure prophylaxis.  Outside of the United States, our antibody cocktail has received a full approval in Japan, is conditionally approved in Australia and the U.K., and has emergency or temporary pandemic authorizations currently in place in more than 40 other countries.  REGEN-COV has the potential for a broad range of prevention and treatment applications from preexposure prophylaxis to treatment of infected hospitalized patients. Given the anticipation of new COVID infections over time, increased utilization of REGEN-COV in appropriate cases and the need for prophylaxis in immunocompromised individuals, we anticipate an ongoing role for REGEN-COV. If global demand warrants, we have the capacity to produce between 4 million to 5 million 1.2 gram doses in 2022, excluding any further supply contributions from Roche.  To conclude, as we close out 2021, our growth momentum is strong and our outlook for continued growth fueled by the breadth and depth of our pipeline is bright. Now I will turn the call over to George. So Chris, you're right. The ink isn't dry. Some of the bill has been written in disappearing ink and some is in changing ink, but -- so it's hard to get a fix on it. I would say -- as I understand the bill and based on the most recent update, the cap on expenditures is limited to Part D, as in David, drugs. So it would not affect Part B, as in boy. I think I've got that right as I said -- as you said, the ink is really not dry. I will say that, generally speaking, it is quite remarkable just from my personal perspective, that the industry that is most responsible for getting the country in the world out of the pandemic in as best shape as we can is the source of such great attack. But fortunately, I think that some rational heads have prevailed and the most draconian ideas have been written in that disappearing ink. Yes. I'll comment on the regulatory assets and George can comment maybe on the design aspects. But at the moment, we don't think this would be a new BLA, and this would be part of the -- this would likely be an SBLA, George? Yes. Let me just add to that and emphasize what George has said in his earlier remarks, which is that a lot of what we see as the big future need is in the pre-exposure prophylaxis. And that pre-exposure prophylaxis is likely not to go away because of the ongoing infections, the breakthrough infections that still occur in fully vaccinated people. Mind you, with the orals coming, we'll see whether they actually get to the United States. They do have some safety and efficacy issues as a class so far. They have not demonstrated the comparable core study comparisons, notwithstanding the kind of efficacy that monoclonals have delivered nor have they satisfied so many people's satisfaction, the safety concerns around using ImmunoGen perhaps okay for short term. But when you're getting into longer-term prophylaxis of the immunocompromised, which is where George mentioned, we have a lot of work ongoing. It's really important to remember that we expect to have -- our molecules should be able to be given quite less frequently, I think, one might expect because you're looking at a prophylaxis mode. And we think that they should, based on the evidence we have, delivered really rather remarkable efficacy in that setting as they already have in the non-immunocompromised. So as the market transitions to a prophylaxis mode, we see an ongoing demand and need, which we're preparing to meet for monoclonal cocktail therapy. George should take this. He's been the architect of the scientific underpinnings of our BD strategy and having a remarkable vision to be able to integrate that with our core expertise, George? I wonder if we shouldn't give Intellia the opportunity to give that kind of guidance, Robyn. Go ahead, Alethia."

            "name": "Robert Landry",
            "content": "Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. In the third quarter, Regeneron once again delivered strong top and bottom line growth on increasingly diversified revenue streams with contributions from REGEN-COV in our robust core business. For the third quarter, total revenues grew 51% year-over-year to $3.5 billion. Total diluted net income per share grew 84% year-over-year to $15.37 on net income of $1.8 billion. Excluding revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, total revenues grew 18% versus the prior year. Starting with REGEN-COV. In the third quarter, we recognized $677 million of U.S. net sales, which consist largely of the initial deliveries of approximately 300,000 doses to the U.S. government under the new 1.4 million dose contract as announced in September. Our collaborator, Roche, record sales of the COVID-19 antibody cocktail known as Ronapreve outside the U.S. In accordance with our Roche agreement, as a true-up payment for global profits, we recorded an additional $127 million as Roche collaboration revenue. In the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver approximately 800,000 doses of REGEN-COV in the U.S. out of which, Roche will supply approximately half of these doses. We will record all REGEN-COV U.S. net product sales. Given the mix of manufactured product supply to the market by Roche and Regeneron, the true-up payment for global profits is expected to result in 0 Roche collaboration revenues in the fourth quarter. The remaining doses from the U.S. government contract are expected to be delivered in the first quarter of 2022. I will now move to our Bayer collaboration. Ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales reported to us by Bayer worth $931 million for the third quarter of 2021, representing growth of 19% on a reported basis and 18% on a constant currency basis. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $365 million, of which we recorded $351 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $582 million in the third quarter of 2021. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and Kevzara was $387 million, which compares favorably to our share of profits of $213 million in the prior year. We also recognized a $50 million sales milestone payment related to achievement of $1.5 billion of ex-U.S. sales for the collaboration on a rolling 12-month basis. Moving on to operating expenses. R&D decreased slightly to $592 million, primarily due to lower spending of REGEN-COV development as compared to the third quarter of 2020. Next, SG&A expense increased 34% year-over-year to $391 million, primarily due to costs related to growth initiatives for EYLEA and higher headcount. Cost to goods sold increased versus the prior year from $122 million to $224 million, primarily due to REGEN-COV manufacturing costs. Cost of collaboration manufacturing increased 50% year-over-year to $214 million, driven by higher production to support the growing Dupixent sales. Finally, the effective tax rate was 10.8% in the third quarter of 2021. Shifting to cash flow on the balance sheet. Year-to-date, Regeneron has generated $4.3 billion in free cash flow and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of $8.7 billion. We continued to utilize our strong balance sheet in accordance with our capital allocation priorities of investing in internal R&D, funding strategic external R&D partnerships and returning cash to shareholders. Accordingly, in the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $191 million of our shares. To conclude, I'd like to provide select updates to our 2021 guidance. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release published earlier this morning. With our -- we are updating our 2021 gross margin guidance to be approximately 88%. This estimate is inclusive of an expected payment to Roche as a true-up of global profits for the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, which will be reported as cost of goods sold. As a result, we expect our gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter to be the lowest of the year. We are also updating our 2021 R&D guidance to be in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion. The change to the guidance range is related to updated phasing of expenses and lower spend on REGEN-COV. Looking ahead, we will continue to make investments into both our commercial business and our broad pipeline for long-term growth. In particular, we expect to advance critically important development programs in 2022, including the late-stage studies for the LAG-3 Libtayo combo, BCMA by CD3 and C5 along with branded comparators, as George mentioned earlier, in advancing programs with our collaborators. In conclusion, we're pleased with the third quarter as we invest in our robust pipeline to drive sustained long-term growth. I will now turn the call back to Justin. And Ronny, let me punctuate, right? So we'll give kind of guidance in our fourth quarter earnings in early February. I will tell you, if you look at our kind of run rate this year, R&D relative to 2020, we're coming out at roughly a 7% increase if you take the midpoint of my guidance. And I guess my word of caution is a lot of that's heavy REGEN-COV in 2020. So we're going up against the big REGEN-COV number in 2020 as compared to what we incurred in 2021. So that 7% is, I'd say, artificially light compared to where we're going to eventually end up and we do give that guidance. So I just want to make sure people are not kind of doing same year run rates as they're seeing in 2021."

            "name": "George Yancopoulos",
            "content": "Thank you, Len. I'll pick up where you left me with the REGEN-COV story. As Len mentioned, our robust COVID-19 development program involving more than 25,000 people to date has provided compelling evidence that REGEN-COV has the potential to be used for various prevention and treatment applications from pre-exposure prophylaxis to treating hospitalized patients. In the United States, REGEN-COV is currently authorized under an EUA and also being reviewed for full FDA approval for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 in certain patients with an action date of April 13, 2022. At Regeneron, we all appreciate that widespread vaccination is the best way to broadly protect as many people as possible from COVID-19. But recent research also reveals some important gaps in coverage provided by the vaccines, leaving some individuals uniquely vulnerable, particularly the several million immunocompromised people in the United States alone who remain prisoners of the pandemic.  First, many of the immunocompromised population respond sub-optimally or not at all to vaccination, even after booster shots. Second, breakthrough infections in the general population still occur after vaccination, meaning that immunocompromised people will continue to be at risk of encountering infected individuals even within a highly vaccinated population. Therefore, we believe that REGEN-COV could be of particular importance for these immunocompromised individuals who remain unprotected and also are at highest risk for developing the most severe COVID-19 disease. This includes people with certain hematologic cancers, for example, lymphomas, leukemias and myeloma and people who take certain immunosuppressive medicines for diseases such as multiple sclerosis, in rheumatoid arthritis, for organ transplant recipients and for those with primary immunodeficiencies.  In the United States, Regeneron submitted data and a request to the FDA to expand the existing emergency use authorization of REGEN-COV to include chronic prevention back in April. Further reflecting Regeneron's commitment to the immunocompromised, we recently began a big trial to optimize REGEN-COV prophylaxis in this population, including evaluation of extended dose.  Our current REGEN-COV cocktail retains potent activity against all known variants of interest, including the Delta variant. However, the virus continues to mutate and evolve. And thus, as we have previously discussed, we are advancing a novel anti-spike protein antibody cocktail into clinical development. We have done so proactively in the case of a novel innovative antibody cocktail that retains potency against new potential variants as required in the future.  Moving to Ophthalmology. We reported encouraging top line data of high-dose aflibercept in the Phase II CANDELA study in wet AMD. The small proof-of-concept study met its primary efficacy endpoint, a higher proportion of patients in the 8-milligram aflibercept group had no retinal fluid compared to patients treated with the currently approved 2-milligram EYLEA dose at week 16.  There were no safety signals observed in the comparison to the currently approved EYLEA 2-milligram dose, 2 large Phase III trials in wet AMD and DME, evaluating the high dose of aflibercept in dosing intervals of every 12 weeks and every 16 weeks are fully enrolled and are expected to report results in the second half of 2022. These Phase III data will be crucial to understanding overall efficacy, safety and convenience of high dose aflibercept.  Moving on to Dupixent. The remarkable clinical success of Dupixent across so many different allergic or type 2 inflammatory diseases, validates our early and long-standing hypothesis that these conditions are all driven by overactivation of the same fundamental immunologic pathway that is the interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 pathway, which is effectively blocked by Dupixent whether the disease manifests as asthma or chronic rhinositis with nasal polyps in the airways as atopic dermatitis or prurigo nodularis in the skin, as the eosinophilic esophagitis in the GI tract. Our clinical data have demonstrated an important impact of Dupixent on these many conditions that initially did not seem related. In only the past few months, Dupixent demonstrated positive results in 4 separate pivotal studies. This is a tremendous accomplishment stemming from the vision and dedication of our team and it's great news for patients suffering from these type 2 inflammatory diseases.  In a recent Phase III trial in atopic dermatitis in infants and children as young as 6 months of age, Dupixent met all primary and secondary endpoints as well as a lower observed rate of skin infections in the Dupixent group compared to placebo.  Detailed results from this trial will be presented at a future medical meeting, and data will be submitted to the FDA by the end of this year. These data reinforce the well-established efficacy and safety profile of Dupixent with over 0.5 million patients treated to date. We also reported recent Phase III data with Dupixent in eosinophilic esophagitis or EoE, a progressive disease that damages the esophagus and impairs the ability to swallow. More than 1/3 of the patients in our trial had manifestations of this disease so severe that they previously had to undergo endoscopic dilation of the esophagus for symptomatic relief. In our study, patients taking weekly Dupixent had an approximate 24-point improvement on the 0 to 84 dysphagia symptom questionnaire, representing a 64% improvement compared to a 14-point improvement for placebo.  This update reinforced previously reported Phase III results for which the 52-week follow-up results were recently presented at the United European Gastroenterology Week Virtual 2021 Congress. Completion of our regulatory filing for EoE in adolescents and adults is planned for early 2022. We also recently reported positive results for Dupixent from our Phase III trial in yet another inflammatory skin condition known as prurigo nodularis, an underdiagnosed disease characterized by extreme itch and skin nodules. The trial met its primary and all key secondary endpoints in comparison to placebo, including reduction in itch from baseline at 12 and 24 weeks, achieving clear skin and improvement in quality of life. A second trial in prurigo nodularis is fully enrolled and is expected to read out in the first half of '22 with regulatory submissions planned for the same year.  If all these exciting Phase III data lead to regulatory approvals, Dupixent would be approved for 6 different allergic or type 2 inflammatory disease indications, including patients as young as 6 months.  Moving to Libtayo in Oncology. Positive Phase III data of Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy in first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer were presented at the ESMO 2021 meeting. These data mark Libtayo as 1 of only 2 PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors to demonstrate positive Phase III results in first line non-small cell lung cancer, irrespective of histology, both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy. These Libtayo studies were conducted in a patient population that included difficult-to-treat disease characteristics that reflects everyday clinical practice. We are rapidly progressing towards regulatory submission for the Libtayo chemotherapy combination across histologies and PD-L1 expression levels, which could unlock an opportunity to help a larger population of lung cancer patients.  Turning to Hematology. At the upcoming American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting for ASH, we will provide updates to our developing Hematology portfolio. The nodal presentation we will provide a data update for our potentially registrational first-in-human trial of REGN5458. Our BCMA by CD3 bispecific antibody tested in patients with heavily pretreated multiple myeloma. REGN5458 to be a major advance in treatment of patients who have failed several prior lines of therapy, but the potential utility of our BCMA-targeted bispecific is not limited to this patient population. We will discuss our data and further development plans at our virtual ASH Investor event scheduled for Monday, December 13 regarding odronextamab or CD20 by CD3 bispecific. We are pleased with our -- with recruitment in our potentially pivotal trial since the partial clinical hall was lifted earlier this year. Exploration of subcutaneous formulation of odronextamab is on track to start by the end of this year. We are planning to initiate broader Phase III programs in 2022.  Our bispecific development program for solid tumors is progressing with our unique approaches, including the MUC16xCD3 bispecific as monotherapy in ovarian cancer as well as in combination with Libtayo or with our MUC16xCD28 costim. In addition, we expect to have initial data with our PSMAxCD28 costim in patients with prostate cancer in '22.  We are also excited about our EGFRxCD28 costim clinical program across multiple EGF high cancer settings, including lung cancer as well as our clinical stage METxMET bispecific and our METxMET antibody drug conjugate, presenting a new  for Regeneron into the realm of drug conjugates linked to our potentially best in class bispecific antibodies.  In conclusion for Oncology, we are approaching an important new phase for Regeneron. We have several novel Phase I/II programs in clinical development with more expected in the coming months. We also have large Phase III studies planned such as our LAG-3 Libtayo for first-line advanced melanoma against the pembrolizumab monotherapy comparator as well as large registrational programs for our Hematology/Oncology bispecifics. We're excited about the potential that these important investments in our portfolio may bring to patients.  I would like to conclude with our Regeneron genetics medicines in our collaboration updates. We are uniquely positioned to combine products of our established biologics portfolio and emerging findings from our genetics medicine efforts. As part of our collaboration with Alnylam, we are looking forward to multiple updates on our C5 program. As we already mentioned ASH meeting, we will show first-in-human data for our C5 antibody, pozelimab in combination with the C5 inhibiting siRNA, cemdisiran. We will present initial results in healthy volunteers, which supports development of this first-of-its-kind combination of an antibody and an siRNA therapeutic. Early data on siRNA monotherapy mediated C5  did not achieve complete terminal complement blockade, which is necessary for adequate disease control in PNH or paroxysmal nocturnal hematuria. Adding the antibody specific for the same target protein could provide patients with a lower dose therapy and a more convenient extended dosing regimen while providing more complete C5 inhibition, resulting in better efficacy and less breakthrough hemolysis.  We have also recently initiated a Phase III study testing the C5 antibody and siRNA combination in myasthenia gravis. For PNH, starting next year, we are planning to test our combo in both naive and switch patients tested against standard of care therapies, including ravulizumab and eculizumab. This study has the potential to show a true benefit of the combination approach for the treatment of this disease.  Also in collaboration with Alnylam, some of our initial genetic target discoveries are reaching the stage of clinical readouts for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH, a disease where finding compelling treatment options has been difficult. We're using the siRNA approach to silence the gene we identified as a potential target. Recall, we discovered that people with a protective HSD17B13 gene variant have a 30% to 70% lower odds of chronic liver disease. Our collaborator, Alnylam, will show initial healthy volunteer safety data for the Alnylam HSD, the HSD17B13 targeting siRNA at their upcoming R&D Day later this month.  Finally, in October, the Regeneron Genetics Center published a manuscript in nature, which highlighted achievement of the milestone of sequencing almost 0.5 million exomes from the U.K. Biobank database. This nature paper for the first time describes rare variants of genes that could be potential drug targets for diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, asthma and others.  And with that, I will turn the call over to Marion. Yes. As we indicated, we'll be hopefully providing data in the coming year, and it all depends on how the trials progress. Obviously, one has to deal with combination trials where one is dose escalating. And so those are what are limiting getting to effective doses and so forth. In terms of the choices, it all dependent on the science. Our various studies preclinically and in humanized animal models, which show that it was, in our minds, it made most sense to initiate our efforts with the CD28 costim approach. Yes. I mean we are hoping that this is going to turn out to be the best-in-class in terms of efficacy and also in terms of convenience for these disease categories. So yes, we're thinking about and depending on how the landscape evolves, that, that could be the opportunity that we would be going after. Yes. Basically, we are, as you said, we're looking, of course, to look at differences in terms of anatomic improvements, but the trial is a noninferiority study. Where we're going to be testing is whether patients that are being treated at a dramatically increased interval do as well as regular dose EYLEA had an 8-week interval. So it's going to depend on hopefully seeing that substantially higher numbers of patients are going to be able to be treated at extended dose intervals compared to the 2-milligram dose while achieving similar visual acuity effects. Yes, all good and somewhat complicated questions. Right now, obviously, as we've said, our cocktail remains active against all the known variants of concern that have emerged and created issues for other antibodies and so forth. However, we want to be prepared. So we're creating a complementary cocktail that if ever variants would arise that would raise problems for our current cocktail, we would have a complementary cocktail that the way we designed it would hopefully be unaffected by the same types of mutations. So it's to be prepared for that possibility that as the virus continues to evolve, we might need a cocktail that might not be sensitive to the same mutations as the first cocktail. But the current cocktail is still active against the variants of concern. Yes. There's a lot of questions in terms of how to design the study, where to do it, depending on rates of hospitalization and rates of infection. So these are the complications that we've had to navigate throughout this pandemic, as you might remember. And throughout this pandemic, we have managed to carry out the largest COVID-19 program for treatment and for prevention using antibodies. And we hope that, that all the knowledge that we gained from learning how to navigate changing, fluctuating infection rates and hospitalization rates and so forth, we can continue to take advantage of that and continue to carry out our program efficiently and as quickly as possible. Well, yes, I think if we were looking to get into new technologies and have new relationships, I don't think we would be telling you about them at this time. Well, I think, yes, what Len referring to is I think that the whole team, the whole company at many levels from the business development group through -- the science research folks through our premanufacturing group has done a spectacular job of pivoting us from a solely biologics company to a genetic medicines company. What we've managed to do is starting with our Regeneron Genetics Center is create what we believe is perhaps the world's most powerful technology to identify new genetic targets based on our sequencing of almost 2 million individuals, all linked to electronic digital records.  That allows us to understand, we think, more powerfully than anybody else, the role of genetic variation, both in disease protection and causation, which have led to a whole series of new disease targets for both protection and causation. And for those, some of those are addressable by biologics and they're part of our existing approaches with biologics, but we had to use new approaches. And for those purposes, we started creating some of these important outside alliances and collaborations with companies like Alnylam for the siRNA approaches, we talked a little bit about and with Intellia with CRISPR-based approaches. Many of these, we've been able to build and create and take them to another level based on our very productive collaborations with these 2 great companies that we're now collaborating with. And we also invested enormously internally in terms of building our own gene therapy approaches. So we believe that we're positioning ourselves to become leaders for the foreseeable future over the next decade or so in the genetic medicine space. It's becoming an increasingly important and larger part of our portfolio. It's almost a whole separate company, we believe, in terms of the opportunities and the value that it generates. While we're maintaining our leadership position with biologics, not only with classical antibodies but also with bispecifics and all sorts of engineered formats of biologics. So I think it's been a tremendous job by our entire team and organization to essentially create this entirely new capability. Okay. I'll remind you that I believe we announced last quarter, our first CRISPR results which were the first obtained by anybody in history in terms of using a systemic CRISPR-based therapy to actually modify genes within human beings. It was an incredibly successful study that we did in collaboration with Intellia. It was the first-ever systemic investigational CRISPR-based gene knockout approach. And in the first set of patients that we treated, we show that a single dose of this CRISPR-based therapy led to very dramatic and dose-dependent reductions in the target protein coming from the target gene. I think that the world viewed this as incredibly exciting data. I believe we announced it in June of '21. And I think it's just the beginning of a very large program. We have about 20 preclinical programs now under evaluation that will be rolling out in terms of going into the clinic and producing clinical results over the next couple of years. I'm sure that might be the approach. Before you get with that question. I do think just to help Robyn out a little bit, I think one really important point is, yes, as the data continues to mature and certainly, we expect excellent duration data coming out over time and so forth. But I think we all have to recognize that this represents the first true validation of this entire field and approach. And our ability working with Intellia using our specific approach to actually turn it from dream into reality. And this obviously dramatically increases the probability of success of all of our future programs based on our collaborative technology with Intellia, including both knockout and insertion approaches, and we have to, of course, highlight and point out the lack of such proof of concept and success with any other approaches to date. And I think that, that really distinguishes our collaboration with Intellia. And obviously, should adjust the risk profile for all of our programs going forward, which, as Len said, hopefully, we and Intellia will be giving more resolution on going forward. Yes, we're not going to say too much about your first question. But in terms of your second question, absolutely. And so when we establish this relationship with Alnylam in terms of using siRNA, it was actually directed towards 3 separate areas. So really was 3 separate collaborations. The one in the first that we thought that we'd be moving the most rapidly into the clinic and that has turned out to be the case were with liver targets, both sort of more conventional targets like the C5, but also targets that were coming from our own pipeline like the HSD target that we talked about. And that -- those are all moving along forward and we think a very exciting fashion as we've discussed. Another key area that you just opened up, which is still preclinically, but we're hoping to eventually move into the clinic is targeting the eye targets with siRNAs. And that's really a very important area for us, and it was a very important separate part of the entire Alnylam collaboration. And the third really critical foundational part of our collaboration with Alnylam involved using siRNAs to target in the brain. And that's also moving forward in a very exciting fashion, and we'll be talking a lot more about that going forward. So really, it's a 3 sort of pillar program, liver targets, eye targets and CNS targets. We're very excited and moving forward on all of them. And as we had guided early on, the first set of targets, of course, would be in the liver and then we'd be moving into the other 2 areas as rapidly as possible."

With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.\nLeonard Schleifer: Thank you, Justin, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. We had an outstanding performance across the enterprise in the second quarter. Not only did our base business performed exceptionally well with strong growth from EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo, but we also delivered 1.25 million doses of REGEN-COV for the United States government, fulfilling the entire supply contract with BARDA. We also continue to advance multiple programs across our innovative R&D pipeline with several important readouts. Starting with EYLEA. Global net sales were over $2.3 billion growing 33% compared to the prior year, reflecting recovery from the COVID pandemic impact on the second quarter of 2020. In the U.S., sales grew 28% EYLEA continues to set a high bar in terms of efficacy, safety and convenience. Dupixent also performed exceptionally well this quarter with global sales of $1.5 billion and growth of 59%. This quarter also marks the first time we and Sanofi exceeded $1 billion in U.S. Dupixent quarterly net sales. There remains considerable room for further growth from our in-line indications as well as from potential new opportunities, such as in chronic spontaneous urticaria with CSU where last week, we announced positive Phase III study results. We have additional Phase III readouts in prurigo nodularis, eosinophilic esophagitis and pediatric atopic dermatitis later this year, which could advance our conviction of Dupixent is a pipeline in a product to address numerous inflammatory diseases. In oncology, the entire global net sales were $117 million and grew 46% with meaningful growth contributions from both inside and outside the United States. We also announced this morning that in a large Phase III pivotal study in non-small cell lung cancer, Libtayo, combined with standard chemotherapy reduced the risk of death by nearly 30% and compared to chemotherapy alone. We are eager to share these data with regulatory agencies, which if approved, would dramatically increase the number of lung cancer eligible patients who could be treated with Libtayo. We also begin to see meaningful results from our Regeneron Genetics medicines pipeline. With our collaborators at Intellia, we showed the first ever proof-of-concept in vivo genome editing with NTLA-2001, investigation of CRISPR therapy for transthyretin amyloidosis or ATTR amyloidosis. This proof-of-concept study utilizing systemically administered CRISPR technology for genome modification suggests this approach could have broad applicability across a wide range of diseases. Beyond Intellia, our collaborations with Alnylam and Decibel are helping to form a whole new pipeline for next-generation therapies beyond our broad and diverse antibody pipeline. The second quarter represented another landmark in our efforts to combat COVID-19, which unfortunately, despite considerable rates of vaccination, continues to be a major global health service with rising cases and emerging variants. In addition to fulfilling our entire supply contract with the United States government, we were able to secure emergency use authorization updates for our lower 1.2 gram subcutaneous dose as well as for post-exposure prophylaxis for certain appropriate patients who are at high risk for disease. Utilization is increasing ready and currently more than 50,000 doses ordered per week. We also announced that the U.K. recovery study showed a 20% reduction in risk of death in hospitalized patients would not mounted their own immune response. With these results, together with supporting data from Regeneron study in hospitalized patients that George will discuss momentarily, REGEN-COV has the potential if so authorized to be the first treatment be using a wide spectrum of COVID-19 disease settings from prevention through the hospitalized setting. In summary, our core business is strong and continues to diversify, and our innovative pipeline continues to advance, positioning Regeneron well long-term growth. Now I will turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len. We have a lot to talk about this morning, which is all possible because of our Regeneron colleagues who have been working nonstop throughout this pandemic. And unfortunately, the world is still in the throes of this global COVID-19 pandemic. As the number of infected individuals in the United States are climbing again with nearly 100,000 Americans becoming infected every day. Therefore, I will start with Regeneron with REGEN-COV, our monoclonal antibody cocktail for COVID-19. In June, the REGEN-COV Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA, was updated to include the lower 1.2 gram REGEN-COV dose with both intravenous and subcutaneous administration for nonhospitalized patients. This EUA was supported by Phase III data showing that the 1.2 gram dose reduce risk of hospitalization or death by 70%. Just last week, the EUA was further expanded to include utilization in post-exposure prophylaxis for COVID-19 in certain populations, and also allows for repeated monthly dosing of REGEN-COV for high-risk patients, such as the immunocompromised who are at high risk of ongoing exposure to infected individuals in the same institutional setting. This latest authorization makes REGEN-COV the only treatment that is available for both treating infected individuals and also preventing infection in certain settings. We would like to emphasize that REGEN-COV is not a substitute for vaccination. Still under review by the FDA are additional data, which we believe could broaden the prevention application to pre-exposure prophylaxis as well as to extend the treatment paradigm to hospitalized patients. The details of Part A of our Phase III prophylaxis study in which we assessed efficacy and safety of subcutaneous REGEN-COV in preventing infection among previously uninfected individuals has just been published today in the New England Journal of Medicine. We believe there is enormous unmet need to try to protect immunocomprised individuals who have not responded to the vaccine and we hope that the FDA will agree that our data will support an authorization in this pre-exposure prophylaxis setting. For hospitalized patients, we recently reported that REGEN-COV tested as part of the Oxford University Phase III RECOVERY study met its primary outcome, reducing risk of death by 20% in hospitalized COVID-19 patients lacking immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Data from our own smaller study in hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed similar conclusions with 35% reduction in overall mortality in this study, which was limited to earlier-stage hospitalized patients with no oxygen or low oxygen support. These collective data from recovery and from our study in hospitalized patients have been shared with regulators. In addition, we are on track to complete the REGEN-COV BLA submissions in the second half of 2021. Outside of the United States, our collaborator Roche obtained emergency or temporary pandemic use authorizations for our COVID-19 antibody cocktail, known as Ronapreve outside the United States in more than 20 countries across the European Union, India, Switzerland and Canada, with more authorizations expected soon. Japan was the first country to grant formal regulatory approval to our antibody cocktail for COVID-19. Finally, REGEN-COV retains potent activity against all known variants of interest, including the Delta variant. For patients at high risk of serious consequences, including many with an inadequate response to vaccines, REGEN-COV could be an important option to patients and their physicians for the foreseeable future. Moving on to ophthalmology. In the coming months, we expect data from the Phase II study of high dose of libracept in wet AMD. This readout will consist of efficacy assessments on drawing in other anatomical measures as well as safety on the 8-milligram and the currently approved 2-milligram of libracept dose and an 8-week dosing interval. In the 106 patients dosed in the open-label Phase II to date, we have not seen any concerning safety signals. While the smaller study will not be definitive on durability measures, the Phase II data will help provide insights into the larger Phase III studies, which are testing high-dose aflibercept dosing intervals out to 12 and 16 weeks. I'm pleased to announce that the Phase III studies in DME and AMD have completed enrollment, allowing for Phase III data next year. Moving on to Dupixent in our immunology and inflammation portfolio. Just last week, we announced that a Phase III trial in chronic spontaneous urticaria, where CSU, met primary and all key 24-week secondary endpoints, showing Dupixent reduced itch and hive activity scores by nearly half. This is the fifth disease in which Dupixent demonstrated positive pivotal trial results and efficacy in this disease raises the possibility of IL-4 and IL-13 and are critical drivers in diseases not traditionally sought to be driven by type 2 inflammation. We plan to report results from a second trial in CSU patients who are not benefiting from the approved standard of care biologic in early 2022. This positive readout in CSU is continuing to build on Dupixent's efficacy and safety demonstrated across other inflammatory diseases. In the upcoming months, we also expect results from our confirmatory Phase IIIb study in adult and adolescent patients with eosinophilic esophagitis as well as readout of a Phase III study in prurigo nodularis. Thus far, Dupixent is approved in patients as young as 6 years old in atopic dermatitis and 12 years old in asthma. Later this year, we will report data from a Phase III study in preschool children as young as 6 months up to 5 years of age suffering from atopic dermatitis. In asthma, we anticipate a regulatory decision in October for children aged 6 to 11 years old in the United States. Moving to our anti interleukin-33 antibody Itupikumab. Results of the Phase II study in COPD patients were recently published in Lancet Respiratory Medicine. All the trial exhibited strong trends in its primary endpoint of exacerbation reduction in the overall population, which did not meet statistical significance, a prespecified subgroup analysis of former smokers with COPD is what accounted for the overall benefit with no negative subset in the remaining population. In the prespecified former smoker subgroup, Itupikumab demonstrated a 42% reduction in exacerbations and improvement in lung function of 0.09 liters compared to placebo with both endpoints reaching nominal statistical significance. Moreover, the publication includes genetic analyses that support a protective role for interleukin-33 in COPD. Based on these results, we and Sanofi are assessing the potential of Itupikumab in two Phase III studies focus on the former smoker population with COPD. I should also remind you that we have two ongoing studies we face -- two ongoing Phase III studies with Dupixent in a complementary COPD population. We are also progressing our novel approaches to treat allergies by using cocktails of monoclonal antibodies to directly bind and inactivate allergens, which have produced robust results in Phase II studies. Results of the initial Phase III study of our antibody cocktail against virtue allergy caused by the Betv1 allergen are expected later this year. The first Phase III study of an antibody cocktail for cat allergy caused by the Feld1 allergen, is now open for enrollment. We are enthusiastic about these innovative additions to our inflammation and immunology portfolio. In oncology, following its recent approvals in the United States or certain first-line non-small cell lung cancer in certain advanced basal cell carcinoma patients, Libtayo was subsequently approved in the EU for these settings. Furthermore, compelling overall survival data in second-line cervical cancer patients were presented at an ESMO virtual planar in May with the regulatory submissions to the FDA and EMA planned for this year. For lung cancer, we are pleased to report today that in our Phase III trial comparing with Tylus standard chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone the independent data monitoring committee recommended halting the trial for efficacy at the second interim analysis. Libtayo plus chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival as well as progression-free surveil compared to chemotherapy alone in first-line locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. With these data, Libtayo is now the second PD-1 targeting antibody that has been able to demonstrate significant overall survival benefit both as a monotherapy as well as in combination with chemotherapy for treating advanced lung cancer. With this validation, Libtayo provides an important foundation for a broad and multifaceted approach to address the great unmet need that patients with cancer in general and lung cancer, in particular, still face. In addition to our Libtayo monotherapy and chemo combination opportunities in lung cancer, we are developing several bispecifics. Our EGFR by CD28 costim and Libtayo combination is in dose escalation for lung and other advanced cancers. Our METxMET bispecific antibody is enrolling non-small cell lung cancer patients with a broad selection of patients, including MET exon 14 gene mutation, gene amplification and/or elevated MET protein expression. And as we introduced at our ASCO investor event, our first antibody drug conjugate METxMET ADC, is poised to enter the clinic in the coming months with a focus on patients with net overexpressing cancers, including lung cancer, where MET over expression occurs in as many as 25% patients. In terms of building on the potential of Tylus with combinations in skin cancer, we recently announced new clinical data for the combination Tyle with Fianlimab our LAG-3 inhibitor, in advanced melanoma at the ASCO annual meeting in June. The combination demonstrated a 67% response rate in PD-1 or PDL-1 naive patients with potential for a more favorable safety profile than with anti-CTLA-4 PD-1 combinations. We plan to initiate a Phase III study of Fianlimab and Libtayo as a first-line treatment for advanced melanoma in 2022. Ovarian cancer is the first tumor type for which we are clinically testing three powerful combinant approaches. First, our MUC16xCD3 bispecific with Libtayo, where we hope to share initial data next year. Next, our MUC16xCD28 costim bispecific with Libtayo. And third, our novel combination of the CD3 and costim bispecifics for which we have now dosed the first patient. This latter combination of two bispecifics of two different classes has potential to be a novel and disruptive approach for the treatment of solid tumors. Rounding out my commentary in solid tumors, our PSMAxCD28 program in prostate cancer continues in dose escalation with Libtayo, and we hope to share initial data next year. As we mentioned previously, we are planning on introducing a PSMAxCD3 bispecific to the clinic later this year, providing another unique experimental combination for prostate cancer treatment. The tumor viewed as nonresponsive currently to available immunotherapies. Moving on to hematologic cancers and starting with lymphoma. Odronextamab, our CD23 bispecific has demonstrated encouraging efficacy and durability of responses in hard-to-treat patient emulations. We have resumed enrollment in our potentially pivotal Phase II program in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, with lifting of the partial clinical hold following protocol amendments for a modified step-up dosing protocol. Later this year, we plan to initiate testing of the exome subcutaneous formulation. And next year, we plan to initiate the Phase III program as well as combination trials with our lymphoma-specific costim bispecific. In multiple myeloma, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific is on track to complete enrollment potentially pivotal Phase II study next year. We will also initiate studies evaluating a subcutaneous formulation in combinations with standard of care. With our unique position to mix and match multiple modalities and targets with the goal of deepening the responses we are already observing with our BCMAxCD3 bispecific we are on track to start a combination study with a costim bispecific for multiple myeloma next year. I would like to conclude with our Regeneron Genetic Medicines efforts. As you know, these efforts start with our Regeneron Genetics Center and its ability to genetically identify and validate new disease targets and is coupled with emerging gene-based therapeutic solutions to address these targets, including CRISPR-based technologies with our collaborator Intellia, siRNA technologies with Alnylam as well as viral gene debility technologies we are developing in-house. The Regeneron Genetics Center continues to emerge as a world leader in human sequencing and in defining genetic variants that can either be protective or causative for human disease. Most recently identifying a major new gene target that protects against obesity as described in a high-profile publication in Science last month. For this newly discovered target, we are deploying several strategies to develop new classes of potential therapeutics to fight obesity and potentially type two diabetes. In terms of progress with our gene-based therapeutic approaches, together with the Intellia, we recently announced positive clinical data for the first ever systemically delivered CRISPR-based gene knockout in human patients. In the first 6 patients with transthyretin amyloidosis with TTR amyloidosis, a single systemic treatment led to dose-dependent reduction in the disease-causing protein with no serious adverse events observed through day 28. This proof of asset clinical data increases the probability of success for both our knockout as well as our insertion CRISPR-based programs, unlocking the potential of many future possibilities for Intellia and Regeneron. Currently, we're evaluating more than 20 preclinical programs under this collaboration, and Regeneron has the rights to develop up to 15 in vivo products with Intellia. Regarding our efforts with Alnylam, on an siRNA for a novel NASH target identified by the Regeneron Genetic Center, we are hoping to see initial healthy volunteer data by the end of this year. This 2-part first-in-human study is now enrolling NASH patients. We are currently evaluating about 20 preclinical programs under this collaboration and Regeneron has rights to develop up to 30 products with Alnylam. With that brief glimpse into the future of genetic medicines, I would like to turn the call over to Marion.\nMarion McCourt: Thank you, George. Our business performance in the second quarter reflects robust momentum, competitive strength and focused execution across our commercial portfolio. Our in-line medicines continue to thrive, and our ongoing launches are progressing to plan, providing a platform for diversified growth. First, I will highlight our efforts supporting REGEN-COV, our COVID-19 antibody cocktail, which is available under emergency use authorization by the FDA. In the second quarter, U.S. net sales were $2.6 billion as a result of fulfilling our second contract with the U.S. government. There is significant ongoing need for effective treatments against COVID-19. As Len said, REGEN-COV utilization has recently accelerated and is now trending well over 50,000 doses ordered weekly. Uptake is driven by growing recognition of the importance of antibody cocktail treatment, focused educational efforts and competitive dynamics favoring REGEN-COV. We continue to work closely with all key stakeholders to increase REGEN-COV utilization and support hospitals and administration sites to reduce bottlenecks. The REGEN-COV antibody cocktail is both FDA authorized and NIH recommended and retains potency against known variants. We've also expanded our efforts following the recent post-exposure prophylaxis authorization, the first for an antibody therapy in this setting. Beyond REGEN-COV, our core portfolio performed very well in the second quarter. Starting with EYLEA. Second quarter global net sales grew 33% year-over-year to over $2.3 billion. In the U.S., EYLEA net sales grew 28% year-over-year to $1.42 billion, driven by underlying demand, category share gains and a favorable comparison versus the second quarter of 2020. EYLEA is the anti-VEGF category growth leader and preferred treatment option. As a reminder, EYLEA sets a high bar for efficacy and safety with more than 40 million injections administered worldwide, in a therapeutic category where patient vision and well-being are paramount. EYLEA continues to capture market and competitive share securing nearly 50% of the overall category and 75% of the branded category. Overall demand is improving with increased patient flow and return to pre-pandemic levels of new patient visits. Patients who may have delayed seeing the retina specialists are now seeking treatment. With this backdrop, we are accelerating promotional efforts to address the significant unmet needs in diabetic eye disease. We are confident in Regeneron's ongoing leadership position in retinal diseases, based on EYLEA's competitive advantages and future opportunities, including our high-dose program. Turning to Libtayo, where second quarter global net sales grew to $117 million, and the U.S. net sales grew 23% to $78 million. As expected, at this early stage of new indication launches, the vast majority of sales come from advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, where Libtayo is the number one systemic treatment despite new in-class competition. Our launches in both advanced non-small cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma or BCC are progressing to plan. In BCC, Libtayo brand awareness is high among treating oncologists. We are encouraged by meaningful patient starts in the second quarter as Libtayo becomes a standard of care. We're also making considerable progress in lung cancer where efforts are focused on establishing Libtayo in our monotherapy indication and will be an important foundation for our potential future chemotherapy combination launch, which will be based on the data announced today. Our expanded field force is now fully deployed and securing early successes with treating physicians. We're raising brand awareness, progressing formulary positioning and payer coverage, lung cancer thought leaders recognized Libtayo's clinical differentiation, highlighting the rapid response rates and efficacy in patients with clinically stable brain metastases or high PD-L1 expression. In this highly competitive market, we remain focused on differentiating Libtayo and increasing physician experience. Today's exciting chemotherapy combination news has the potential to dramatically expand the patient opportunity for Libtayo in non-small cell lung cancer. Turning now to Evkeeza, which was launched earlier this year in ultra-rare homozygous familial hypercholesteremia. Key thought leaders recognize the benefits of Evkeeza which delivers an efficacy, safety and tolerability in a market where many patients have struggled to stay on therapy in the face of life-threatening LDL-cholesterol levels. We're encouraged by early initiations across switch and new-to-category patients and can see a future where Evkeeza becomes the standard of care. Moving to Dupixent. Global net sales in the second quarter were $1.5 billion, growing 59% compared to the prior year. In the U.S., net sales grew 49% to $1.15 billion driven by broad-based growth across all approved indications. New patient starts are steadily growing and are above pre-COVID levels. In atopic dermatitis, prescribing trends are strong across a spectrum of moderate to severe disease including adolescent and pediatric patients. There is significant and sustained growth opportunity for Dupixent in a market where it is the #1 dermatologist prescribed biologic. This is based on its well-established efficacy and safety profile, broad label for patients is dealing is 6 years old and unmatched real-world physician and patient experience. In addition, as George outlined, we see an exciting future opportunities in dermatology, starting with CSU. Dupixent is the leading biologic and respiratory disease poised to capture meaningful growth now and in the future. Our asthma results outpace recent competitive biologic launches. Launch preparations are underway in the pediatric asthma setting the first regulatory approval expected in the U.S. this October. In nasal polyps, there's high demand among ENTs and allergists with patients initiated regardless of prior surgery. In summary, we delivered strong performance across our brands with current and potential future launches on track to deliver sustained growth. Now I'll turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Landry: Thanks, Marion, and good morning and afternoon to everyone listening to the call. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. In the second quarter, our core business continued to deliver impressive year-over-year growth bolstered by strong execution across the company to deliver the full $1.25 million dose contract to the U.S. government for REGEN-COV. For the second quarter, total revenues grew 163% year-over-year to $5.1 billion. Excluding revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, total revenue grew 22% versus the prior year. Total diluted net income per share grew 260% year-over-year to $25.80 on net income of $2.9 billion. In the second quarter, we recognized $2.6 billion of U.S. REGEN-COV sales, representing the vast majority of revenue related to the delivery of 1.25 million doses to the U.S. government. Due to revenue recognition rules, a residual $34 million of net product sales for doses delivered under this contract will be recorded in the third quarter. Given the delivery of these doses to the U.S. government and current utilization rates we anticipate the current U.S. government supply will be exhausted by the end of the year. We do not expect to record substantial additional sales this year in the U.S. in less the number of cases and related utilization continue to increase exponentially. I will now move to collaboration revenues, which were $955 million in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to $513 million second quarter of 2020. Let me begin with the Roche collaboration. Ex U.S. sales of the COVID antibody cocktail known as Ronapreve, outside of the U.S. were $470 million as reported to us by Roche, we recorded $168 million in Roche collaboration revenue for our share of profits from Roche's sale of Ronapreve, which is now available or approved in more than 20 countries. With new COVID cases on the rise globally, we expect the Ronapreve will continue to be a meaningful revenue contributor in 2021. With regard to our Bayer collaboration. Ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales reported to us by Bayer were $904 million for the second quarter of 2021, representing growth of 41% on a reported basis and 31% on a constant currency basis as a result of broad market recovery and a favorable comparison versus the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $349 million, of which we recorded $335 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Finally, total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $438 million in the second quarter of 2021. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and Kevzara was $328 million, which nearly doubled when compared to profits of $172 million in the prior year. Other revenue was $46 million in the second quarter compared to $212 million in the prior year. The decrease is primarily related to nonrecurring reinforce from BARDA in 2020 for development of COVID-19 and an Ebola treatments. We continue to expect 2021 other revenue to be less than half of what was recorded in 2020 on a full year basis. Moving on to our operating expenses. R&D increased 11% year-over-year to $643 million, primarily due to continued clinical development costs for our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail and higher headcount to support our expanding pipeline. Next, SG&A expense increased 21% year-over-year to $365 million due to costs related to COVID-19 related activities, launch investments for Libtayo, growth initiatives for EYLEA and higher headcount. Cost of goods sold increased versus the prior year from $93 million to $514 million, primarily due to REGEN-COV manufacturing costs. Finally, effective tax rate was 17% in the second quarter of 2021, reflecting the impact of REGEN-COV sales, which are taxed at the U.S. statutory rate. Shifting to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the second quarter of 2021, Regeneron generated $478 million in free cash flow and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of $5.1 billion. We received the full $2.625 billion of cash associated with completion of our second REGEN-COV contract with the U.S. government in July. As the business continues its strong performance, we are reiterating our capital allocation priorities of investing in internal R&D, funding strategic external R&D partnerships and returning cash to shareholders. Accordingly, in July, we announced a new $1.8 billion expansion of our Tarrytown facilities, primarily directed toward additional internal R&D operations and capabilities. We also continue to advance our next-generation technology partnerships with companies like Intellia and Alnylam, which are beginning to bear fruit as targets get selected and programs move forward into development. Finally, in the second quarter, we repurchased $289 million of our shares, and we remain opportunistic buyers in the market. To conclude, I'd like to provide select updates to our 2021 guidance. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release published earlier this morning. We are updating our full year 2021 guidance for SG&A to be in the range of $1.54 billion to $1.62 billion. The change is related to increased efforts in the second half for REGEN-COV. We are also revising our full year 2021 guidance for R&D to be in the range of $2.65 billion to $2.75 billion. The change is driven by lower-than-expected spend on REGEN-COV. Finally, we now expect our full year 2021 non-GAAP effective tax rate guidance to be in the range of 14% to 16%, driven by higher sales of REGEN-COV, which, as I said, are taxed at the U.S. statutory rate. In conclusion, Regeneron performed exceptionally well in the second quarter with the core business continuing on a strong growth trajectory as we invest in our diverse and differentiated pipeline for long-term sustainable growth. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Justin.\nJustin Holko: Thank you, Bob. Tamia, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. To ensure we are able to address as many callers as possible, we will answer one question from each caller prior to moving to the next. Please go ahead, Tamia.\nOperator:  Your first question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nChris Raymond: Just on the EMPOWER study guys, we're getting a few questions the comp to KEYTRUDA. I know it's hard to compare across trials, but it's a bit tricky because Empower had both squamous and non-squamous. But your 22-month median OS is right on top of the non-squamous experience for KEYTRUDA. I'm sure you're going to want to save a lot of detail for the full presentation, but can you maybe give us a sense of the balance here between squamous and non-squamous patients?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: As you said, I mean, we're going to provide the details in future publication and/or conferences. I think it's important to note, as you said, it's very difficult to compare across studies, done years apart. And especially when we allowed classes of patients that were not previously allowed in other studies and so forth. As you pointed out, the median survival numbers are right on top of each other. But as you also pointed out, we had two different subtypes in this study. I can comment in our preliminary analysis, and these remain to be fully validated and so forth. One of the subtypes our hazard ratio was better than what was observed with the KEYTRUDA study and the other one, it was worse. It's important to point out that these things bounce around in these cross-study comparisons. As you know, in other settings, which you try to do cross country -- cross-study comparisons, for example, when you compare our monotherapy results in the greater than 50% PDL population. It looks like our numbers are substantially better in the skin and particularly the CSCC comparisons they're better. So these things bounce around. It's always hard to do these things. But I think the important thing to point out is that in this field in lung cancer, very few have hit in both monotherapy greater than 50% and in chemo combination all comers. I remind you that Opdivo Jens and most of the PD-L1s did. So right now, the only 2 PD-1 antibodies that standalone, having demonstrated overall survival benefit, both in the monotherapy setting as well as now in the chemo combination setting. And I think this really well positioned Libtayo and across all the studies, I think it's -- the definitive conclusion is that it's a very active molecule that looks at least as active as any other agents out there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Gavin on for Cory. Just a thought on the last question. In terms of the longer-term outlook for Libtayo in lung specifically, you talked about the IO combo as kind of the differentiating strategy. And I'm just wondering if you're maintaining that position? Or with the results in hand today, that view has changed?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. Well, we think that certainly, we should be competitive right now. The opportunity for this class, which is obviously dominated by KEYTRUDA right now because up until now, it was the only agent that had this strong data across the spectrum of monotherapy and chemo combination. We think that now we can be legitimate competitors here in the lung cancer space. We see our combination opportunities as future growth and differentiator opportunities. But in the short term, we expect to be a viable competitor now with these data. And in the future, we hope to use the combinations to take the standard of care and elevate results to another level.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nRonny Gal: Question on the immunoco. Can you talk a little bit about the path to establish that antibody cocktail as a treatment for patients or immunocompromised before to before cancer driven and so forth? You need to have full authorization to begin to pursue this. But if we think about the product longer term beyond the current wave of the epidemic, what steps are you making towards establishing it as a long-term part of the treatment paradigm in various diseases?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. As you said, we think that the immunocompromised population which as I'm sure you all know, represents 3% to 4% of the U.S. population, that several million individuals, a variety of studies are showing that somewhere around 50% or more of these individuals do not respond after 2 or even after 3 attempts with the vaccine. And so these people are left without their own antibodies to protect them. So it's a huge unmet need setting where these individuals will not be protected. And as we're all seeing that it's very unlikely that we will be eliminating spread of infections through breakthrough infections, whether it was symptomatic or otherwise throughout the population for these individuals to be able to live normal lives they're going to need protection. And we believe that the most powerful protection is essentially providing them with these surrogate antibodies that our antibody cocktail provides. We already have very strong data, we believe, to support the notion that this agent can be used in chronic prevention settings, and we do intend to continue to explore future study opportunities where we can further enhance on the already existing data that shows that after the first week or so, we seem to obtain similar upwards of 90% protection against infection in individuals who do not have their own antibodies and are being exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. I think that, that is very strong data that bodes very well that this is potentially to be a very important treatment, particularly for these immunocompromised individuals who do not have antibodies on their own.\nLeonard Schleifer: Yes. Let me just add that implicit in what George said is we're working with the agency to try and convince them that our data is strong. And the agency, obviously, has a lot on its plate, and it's trying, I think, to sort through whether or not these individuals should try a third dose or not of a vaccine. That has to get sorted out, I think. And the FDA has our data. And as George said, we're looking at ways to enhance our data, but we already believe that in a pre-exposure prophylaxis mode, we have strong data, but it's not been authorized by the agency and it's under review.\nRonny Gal: So you might understand you're seeking a label for chronic treatment of immunocompromised population? And do you think you have the data to obtain such a label?\nLeonard Schleifer: So just to be clear, the current authorization allows chronic treatment but allows chronic treatment for people, for example, who are immunocompromised, but are in an institutional setting, working or living in a congress setting where they're exposed to infected individuals we would like to expand that to pre-exposure prophylaxis for the community-acquired infections. That is where immunocompromised people might be able to go out in the community and have some protection. So we do have chronic dosing for the immunocompromised in our current authorization, but that's restricted to this post exposure or ongoing exposure in the known infected people setting, and we're trying to expand that to protect these people in the community setting. It's -- we think the data are strong, but obviously, there's a lot going on and a lot of considerations, as I mentioned before, that need to get sorted out.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink. Your line is open.\nGeoffrey Porges: So many questions. Perhaps one for Marion on EYLEA, a really strong result. And by the way, congratulations on the spectacular quarter. On EYLEA, tremendous return to growth. Can you talk about whether there was any catch-up in the second quarter? Or is this a sustainable revenue run rate going forward? Because it's clearly significantly above where we were expecting. And then perhaps you could just give us a little bit more color on the proportion of AMD and DME.\nMarion McCourt: Sure. And thank you, Geoff. Yes, delighted to comment. We did have a very strong quarter and certainly, EYLEA performance was driven by return of market growth and our own share gains versus competition in capturing that market growth. In order, we did see a return of patient flow to offices consistent with the pre-pandemic period. And there also is the consideration of some patients who may have delayed treatment coming back in. So it's a combination of factors but certainly a very strong performance for EYLEA. As well, to your question related to future growth by indication, we do continue to see diabetic eye disease as the indications that have the highest growth trajectory. So that's balancing out our wet AMD business, which is still the majority of roughly 50%, 52%, 55% of overall use of EYLEA.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Cowen. Your line is open.\nYaron Werber: Great. Maybe a question for Marion and Bob relating to REGEN-COV 2. Are you -- in order to get the next U.S. government order, do you -- are you waiting for approval? Or are they just waiting to exhaust our current supply and then reorder?\nLeonard Schleifer: Maybe I'll take that question. The contract we have has been fulfilled. And so the government is going to need to decide whether or not they want to have another contract or they want us to switch over to a commercial model which could occur before or after a regular approval as it did with remdesivir. I think a lot of that is going to depend upon the government's assessment of what they think is the most efficient way to get people to use the product. There's been a tremendous acceleration in use our penetration in terms of addressing what we would say, estimated eligible patients has gone up dramatically to somewhere in the low single digits to almost 25% to 30% more recently in terms of eligible patients getting monoclonals. If that trend continues along with the trend of unfortunately, more cases, obviously, we're going to have to go with the direction that the government wants another contract or actual switchover. Capacity, of course, is always an issue, but we think we're sort of well positioned to continue to supply similar amounts that we've been able to supply and we'll have to look at -- and these demands can change pretty rapidly. And of course, we do have our partner, Roche, who's got capacity that we can perhaps turn to. So a lot of moving parts, Yaron. And the most important of which is what is the shape of the current surge in the pandemic.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nTerence Flynn: Congrats on the Dupixent CSU data. I was just wondering if there's incremental SG&A that's going to be required to launch this indication or if you'd be able to leverage your existing commercial footprint? And then the corollary is just how to think about the continued ramp of profitability of the JV here into 2022? Are there any other significant investments that we need to consider in our models?\nMarion McCourt: Sure, Terence. I'll start from the commercial perspective. So yes, we're really excited about adding potentially another indication for Dupixent. CSU is a large opportunity. They're about 300,000 potential patients with disease adults and very limited treatment offers for them today. We will be able to always look at the impact of our educational abilities and promotion by indication. But to your very clear point, we do have a leveraging opportunity here because we're already calling on the audiences that would be required to effectively promote CSU. It's premature for us to say absolutely what sort of additional effort we might need. But certainly, we will be able to leverage our current footprint in all areas.\nBob Landry: Yes. And Terrence, I'll just kind of punctuate what Marion said on that. Clearly, and you can see it in the MD&A that we disclosed, and you can do the calc right, our margins are getting better with this. I mean this is something that we talked about. Certainly, we've had a lot of ex U.S. launches, a lot of prelaunch expenses related to that. kind of held that back a little bit. I think you're now seeing certainly year-over-year, you're starting to see the fruits of the labor. And the leverage that we've been talking about for a while, again, kudos to Sanofi, another strong ex U.S. quarter by them as we continue to see the indications really starting to kick in ex U.S.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kennen MacKay with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nKennen MacKay: Huge congratulations on the quarter really across the Board commercially and clinically with a couple of surprises this season. Maybe a question on EYLEA. There was commentary from another earlier this Q2 earnings season that included conversation around somewhat aggressive development plans of EYLEA biosimilar. Just wondering sort of beyond the 2023 composition of matter patent, if you could talk to which intellectual property, you have the most confidence in keeping this franchise going, especially as it relates to the U.S.? Congrats again.\nLeonard Schleifer: Right. It's a great question, but we're going to have to defer on that one because of ongoing patent issues and what have you. We really can't make a comment. Sorry.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is open.\nCarter Gould: Obviously, I want to kind of change gears a bit. Obviously, we've seen some pretty transformational events across how FDA is addressing Alzheimer's since your last quarterly call. You did announce an early-stage program conjunction with Alnylam, but just wanted to see if you gauge your appetite to jump in sort of the antibody-directed amyloid beta lowering game. There's a few companies that innovate and iterate antibodies as well as Regeneron. And so as you think about your Alzheimer's effort going forward, if that was a point of focus and any broader color on that space would be helpful?\nLeonard Schleifer: Well, we should let the iterator and inventor answer that.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Sorry.\nLeonard Schleifer: We should let the iterator and inventor answer that. Go ahead George.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: I was going to just -- sorry, I didn't hear you speaking there. Yes, we have a very robust effort in neurodegenerative diseases here at Regeneron are not overly excited about some of the antibody developments and necessarily getting into those type of approaches. But we have a lot of things that we're actually very excited about in the neurodegenerative disease space. We think novel ways of addressing targets as well as brand new targets that haven't been discovered elsewhere. We will be discussing these efforts going forward in more detail over the coming months and year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney with Baird. Your line is open.\nBrian Skorney: Unfortunately, I kind of feel like this is going to be an evergreen question as we see SARS to genetic shift. But it seems like just this week, there's been some emergence of data for the lambasting showing potentially increased resistance of vaccination. Just wondering if you guys have any data yet on the antibody combo and how much activity might retain against the strength?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. I have to say that I'm not sure exactly what our results are and quantitatively. But so far, every variant and every strain that we've tested, we retained potency. And so far, there's hopefully no reason to think that's going to change because we prospectively took advantage of this cocktail approaches so that even if one antibody gets minimally affected, the other one can take its place. So we expect to retain robust activity. That said, I think we've also announced that we have second-generation antibodies that are also entering in the clinic where we're going to continue to retain broad coverage. But I believe that as far as it's been tested with Linda, we retain potency there as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nGeoff Meacham: I just wanted to ask on commercial Libtayo. Just wanted to see what sort of success or what metrics you can give us commercially with the initial first-line lung monotherapy rollout as well as the derm indication as well, just see how that's going early in the launch?\nMarion McCourt: Sure, Geoff. Happy to. So for Libtayo with our first lung indication in mono, as expected, that is the smaller indication. So we're really excited about the chemotherapy combination data that was shared today. And in fact, if I quantify it, that indication in terms of patient potential is about 4 times the size of the mono indication. But what we're doing today in the market commercially is certainly foundational to Libtayo and our oncology portfolio more broadly. I'll comment, we are still the standard of care in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. That was a very effective launch. We now have a competitor in that indication, but we retain our leadership. The basal cell carcinoma launch is also going well. And certainly, the efficacy and tolerability, safety of Libtayo is paramount for those patients, and we offer an alternative where the specialists in that area do believe Libtayo as evolving to become the standard of care. It's early days in lung. I think our team is doing a really good job. And when we talk to the opinion leaders, they're most excited, as I mentioned, about our rapid action, our efficacy even in those patients with stable brain metastases and with the high expression PD-L1 patients. So early days, we are right on track with where we expected to be, but there's a lot more potential and a lot more work to do.\nLeonard Schleifer: We have time for maybe 2 or 3 more quick questions, Tamia.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\nAlethia Young: I just wanted to talk a little bit about how you guys see what the therapeutic goals are for NASH for medicine and to your leader in genetics and there's been a lot of ups and downs in NASH?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Well, I think there's a variety of goals, but our major question right now with our first program is we believe that we have a novel approach that addresses not the steatosis component, but the inflammatory component, which is something that really is not being addressed by other approaches, other targets, other agents. So that if we can actually stop or reverse the inflammatory response to the steatosis that will be an entirely different and also potentially complementary approach to what anything that anybody else is doing right now. I think the genetics very strongly point to that. That's what it actually shows that this genetic target affects and that's what the protective mutations are actually showing. So we're excited about looking at this opportunity, whether we can halt or even reverse inflammatory signals, inflammatory processes and thus, actual progression of the disease irregardless of steatosis.\nLeonard Schleifer: Next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike King with H.C. Wainwright. Your line is open.\nMike King: I'm not sure how long -- how quickly this question could be answered, but I'm just trying to get a better appreciation of what I would call the real-world use of REGEN-COV. Can you point to -- I think Len said think about 25% of patients, but I think that was eligible. I don't know if you have any market data from real-world use versus what's been shipped and paid for -- shipped to and paid for by the government? Can we understand how that rubber band flexes a little more?\nLeonard Schleifer: Sure. So look, what we look at are the shipments from our distributor to institutions, hospitals, med centers and clinics, emergencies, et cetera, et cetera. And we believe, based on some real-world data that about 70% of the daily cases that occur are occurring in people who would be eligible for treatment, either because they're obese or they've got underlying conditions or they're elderly more -- we're seeing more younger and obese, frankly, than we -- than elderly that was seen earlier in the pandemic. So if you take, for example, that maybe it was 100,000 new cases, maybe 70,000 of them would be eligible. So that gives you an idea. I was just looking, Mike, at this to see what our repeat orders were. And the vast, vast majority, I think it's around or above 90% of the institutions ordering have or repeat orders, meaning that they're not people just stocking the stuff to have it around. They're using it up. And that's what our field people seem to tell us. I don't know if Marion wants to maybe add any more or not, but I hope that helps you.\nMarion McCourt: That would be the characterization. I think the other thing that's important is we are continuing to educate and to help with some of the bottlenecks that have been experienced early days. So we are seeing growing utilization. And certainly, as Len mentioned, the patient criteria who are eligible for treatment is broad to Len's point, age-related obesity, hypertension, diabetes, respiratory immune issues. So there are a lot of patients who are very much in need of treatment, and we're doing everything we can to help them have availability of product.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. I'll just add a couple of thoughts or points to that is during the last sort of surge, as Len said, we were probably only reaching somewhat of 1% of the potentially eligible patients. We're now well into the double digits in terms of the percentage of the eligible patients that we're probably reaching. And we've had some feedback from some of these institutions where we distribute to where they're actually low on inventory, suggesting that they're not stocking it up.\nMarion McCourt: Yes. The other thing, just to add because we obviously are all over this and get the individual stories. But the 1 thing that is so consistent when patients are doing poorly and then they're treated with REGEN-COV within a day, two days, they see a remarkable difference in the patient status that truly has been rewarding for those on the front line.\nLeonard Schleifer: Tamia, we're going to have to cut it after 1 more question.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Yatin Suneja with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.\nYatin Suneja: Just a question on the Intellia collaboration. Can you just share your views on the gene editing space, your vision or where do you see the new indication and obviously, the strategic goal of the broad collaboration that you have with Intellia?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. Obviously, these first-in-human results are incredibly exciting, both in terms of the percent knockdown. And also in terms of thus far in these early days, the observed safety. And as we said, we have two types of broad collaborative program areas with Intellia, both of which we think are greatly bolstered in terms of confidence based on these initial results. We have a series of programs which similarly involve systemic-based approaches to achieve gene knockdown. So obviously, those are chances of success are greatly bolstered by what we've seen with these first in-human results. But we also have, I think, just as if not even more exciting, a CRISPR-based gene insertion program that we're very excited about. And since it depends on essentially overlapping technologies, this program and its chance of success has greatly been increased based on the results we've seen to date. So we think that with the fact that we have so many programs ongoing in our collaboration with Intellia more than 20 programs under evaluation, and we have the ability to move forward quite a few of these. We're very excited that this could really change the practice of medicine and really bring CRISPR-based gene therapy to patients into the world. So nothing to be more exciting from the gene medicines point of view.\nJustin Holko: Thank you, everyone. Thanks for hanging in there a little longer today. Bob Landry and the IR team are around today to answer any further questions. We wish you a good end of the week and enjoy the rest of the summer. Please stay safe out there. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Marion McCourt",
            "content": "Thank you, George. Our business performance in the second quarter reflects robust momentum, competitive strength and focused execution across our commercial portfolio. Our in-line medicines continue to thrive, and our ongoing launches are progressing to plan, providing a platform for diversified growth. First, I will highlight our efforts supporting REGEN-COV, our COVID-19 antibody cocktail, which is available under emergency use authorization by the FDA. In the second quarter, U.S. net sales were $2.6 billion as a result of fulfilling our second contract with the U.S. government. There is significant ongoing need for effective treatments against COVID-19. As Len said, REGEN-COV utilization has recently accelerated and is now trending well over 50,000 doses ordered weekly. Uptake is driven by growing recognition of the importance of antibody cocktail treatment, focused educational efforts and competitive dynamics favoring REGEN-COV. We continue to work closely with all key stakeholders to increase REGEN-COV utilization and support hospitals and administration sites to reduce bottlenecks. The REGEN-COV antibody cocktail is both FDA authorized and NIH recommended and retains potency against known variants. We've also expanded our efforts following the recent post-exposure prophylaxis authorization, the first for an antibody therapy in this setting. Beyond REGEN-COV, our core portfolio performed very well in the second quarter. Starting with EYLEA. Second quarter global net sales grew 33% year-over-year to over $2.3 billion. In the U.S., EYLEA net sales grew 28% year-over-year to $1.42 billion, driven by underlying demand, category share gains and a favorable comparison versus the second quarter of 2020. EYLEA is the anti-VEGF category growth leader and preferred treatment option. As a reminder, EYLEA sets a high bar for efficacy and safety with more than 40 million injections administered worldwide, in a therapeutic category where patient vision and well-being are paramount. EYLEA continues to capture market and competitive share securing nearly 50% of the overall category and 75% of the branded category. Overall demand is improving with increased patient flow and return to pre-pandemic levels of new patient visits. Patients who may have delayed seeing the retina specialists are now seeking treatment. With this backdrop, we are accelerating promotional efforts to address the significant unmet needs in diabetic eye disease. We are confident in Regeneron's ongoing leadership position in retinal diseases, based on EYLEA's competitive advantages and future opportunities, including our high-dose program. Turning to Libtayo, where second quarter global net sales grew to $117 million, and the U.S. net sales grew 23% to $78 million. As expected, at this early stage of new indication launches, the vast majority of sales come from advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, where Libtayo is the number one systemic treatment despite new in-class competition. Our launches in both advanced non-small cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma or BCC are progressing to plan. In BCC, Libtayo brand awareness is high among treating oncologists. We are encouraged by meaningful patient starts in the second quarter as Libtayo becomes a standard of care. We're also making considerable progress in lung cancer where efforts are focused on establishing Libtayo in our monotherapy indication and will be an important foundation for our potential future chemotherapy combination launch, which will be based on the data announced today. Our expanded field force is now fully deployed and securing early successes with treating physicians. We're raising brand awareness, progressing formulary positioning and payer coverage, lung cancer thought leaders recognized Libtayo's clinical differentiation, highlighting the rapid response rates and efficacy in patients with clinically stable brain metastases or high PD-L1 expression. In this highly competitive market, we remain focused on differentiating Libtayo and increasing physician experience. Today's exciting chemotherapy combination news has the potential to dramatically expand the patient opportunity for Libtayo in non-small cell lung cancer. Turning now to Evkeeza, which was launched earlier this year in ultra-rare homozygous familial hypercholesteremia. Key thought leaders recognize the benefits of Evkeeza which delivers an efficacy, safety and tolerability in a market where many patients have struggled to stay on therapy in the face of life-threatening LDL-cholesterol levels. We're encouraged by early initiations across switch and new-to-category patients and can see a future where Evkeeza becomes the standard of care. Moving to Dupixent. Global net sales in the second quarter were $1.5 billion, growing 59% compared to the prior year. In the U.S., net sales grew 49% to $1.15 billion driven by broad-based growth across all approved indications. New patient starts are steadily growing and are above pre-COVID levels. In atopic dermatitis, prescribing trends are strong across a spectrum of moderate to severe disease including adolescent and pediatric patients. There is significant and sustained growth opportunity for Dupixent in a market where it is the #1 dermatologist prescribed biologic. This is based on its well-established efficacy and safety profile, broad label for patients is dealing is 6 years old and unmatched real-world physician and patient experience. In addition, as George outlined, we see an exciting future opportunities in dermatology, starting with CSU. Dupixent is the leading biologic and respiratory disease poised to capture meaningful growth now and in the future. Our asthma results outpace recent competitive biologic launches. Launch preparations are underway in the pediatric asthma setting the first regulatory approval expected in the U.S. this October. In nasal polyps, there's high demand among ENTs and allergists with patients initiated regardless of prior surgery. In summary, we delivered strong performance across our brands with current and potential future launches on track to deliver sustained growth. Now I'll turn the call over to Bob. Sure. And thank you, Geoff. Yes, delighted to comment. We did have a very strong quarter and certainly, EYLEA performance was driven by return of market growth and our own share gains versus competition in capturing that market growth. In order, we did see a return of patient flow to offices consistent with the pre-pandemic period. And there also is the consideration of some patients who may have delayed treatment coming back in. So it's a combination of factors but certainly a very strong performance for EYLEA. As well, to your question related to future growth by indication, we do continue to see diabetic eye disease as the indications that have the highest growth trajectory. So that's balancing out our wet AMD business, which is still the majority of roughly 50%, 52%, 55% of overall use of EYLEA. Sure, Terence. I'll start from the commercial perspective. So yes, we're really excited about adding potentially another indication for Dupixent. CSU is a large opportunity. They're about 300,000 potential patients with disease adults and very limited treatment offers for them today. We will be able to always look at the impact of our educational abilities and promotion by indication. But to your very clear point, we do have a leveraging opportunity here because we're already calling on the audiences that would be required to effectively promote CSU. It's premature for us to say absolutely what sort of additional effort we might need. But certainly, we will be able to leverage our current footprint in all areas. Sure, Geoff. Happy to. So for Libtayo with our first lung indication in mono, as expected, that is the smaller indication. So we're really excited about the chemotherapy combination data that was shared today. And in fact, if I quantify it, that indication in terms of patient potential is about 4 times the size of the mono indication. But what we're doing today in the market commercially is certainly foundational to Libtayo and our oncology portfolio more broadly. I'll comment, we are still the standard of care in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. That was a very effective launch. We now have a competitor in that indication, but we retain our leadership. The basal cell carcinoma launch is also going well. And certainly, the efficacy and tolerability, safety of Libtayo is paramount for those patients, and we offer an alternative where the specialists in that area do believe Libtayo as evolving to become the standard of care. It's early days in lung. I think our team is doing a really good job. And when we talk to the opinion leaders, they're most excited, as I mentioned, about our rapid action, our efficacy even in those patients with stable brain metastases and with the high expression PD-L1 patients. So early days, we are right on track with where we expected to be, but there's a lot more potential and a lot more work to do. That would be the characterization. I think the other thing that's important is we are continuing to educate and to help with some of the bottlenecks that have been experienced early days. So we are seeing growing utilization. And certainly, as Len mentioned, the patient criteria who are eligible for treatment is broad to Len's point, age-related obesity, hypertension, diabetes, respiratory immune issues. So there are a lot of patients who are very much in need of treatment, and we're doing everything we can to help them have availability of product. Yes. The other thing, just to add because we obviously are all over this and get the individual stories. But the 1 thing that is so consistent when patients are doing poorly and then they're treated with REGEN-COV within a day, two days, they see a remarkable difference in the patient status that truly has been rewarding for those on the front line."

            "name": "Leonard Schleifer",
            "content": "Thank you, Justin, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. We had an outstanding performance across the enterprise in the second quarter. Not only did our base business performed exceptionally well with strong growth from EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo, but we also delivered 1.25 million doses of REGEN-COV for the United States government, fulfilling the entire supply contract with BARDA. We also continue to advance multiple programs across our innovative R&D pipeline with several important readouts. Starting with EYLEA. Global net sales were over $2.3 billion growing 33% compared to the prior year, reflecting recovery from the COVID pandemic impact on the second quarter of 2020. In the U.S., sales grew 28% EYLEA continues to set a high bar in terms of efficacy, safety and convenience. Dupixent also performed exceptionally well this quarter with global sales of $1.5 billion and growth of 59%. This quarter also marks the first time we and Sanofi exceeded $1 billion in U.S. Dupixent quarterly net sales. There remains considerable room for further growth from our in-line indications as well as from potential new opportunities, such as in chronic spontaneous urticaria with CSU where last week, we announced positive Phase III study results. We have additional Phase III readouts in prurigo nodularis, eosinophilic esophagitis and pediatric atopic dermatitis later this year, which could advance our conviction of Dupixent is a pipeline in a product to address numerous inflammatory diseases. In oncology, the entire global net sales were $117 million and grew 46% with meaningful growth contributions from both inside and outside the United States. We also announced this morning that in a large Phase III pivotal study in non-small cell lung cancer, Libtayo, combined with standard chemotherapy reduced the risk of death by nearly 30% and compared to chemotherapy alone. We are eager to share these data with regulatory agencies, which if approved, would dramatically increase the number of lung cancer eligible patients who could be treated with Libtayo. We also begin to see meaningful results from our Regeneron Genetics medicines pipeline. With our collaborators at Intellia, we showed the first ever proof-of-concept in vivo genome editing with NTLA-2001, investigation of CRISPR therapy for transthyretin amyloidosis or ATTR amyloidosis. This proof-of-concept study utilizing systemically administered CRISPR technology for genome modification suggests this approach could have broad applicability across a wide range of diseases. Beyond Intellia, our collaborations with Alnylam and Decibel are helping to form a whole new pipeline for next-generation therapies beyond our broad and diverse antibody pipeline. The second quarter represented another landmark in our efforts to combat COVID-19, which unfortunately, despite considerable rates of vaccination, continues to be a major global health service with rising cases and emerging variants. In addition to fulfilling our entire supply contract with the United States government, we were able to secure emergency use authorization updates for our lower 1.2 gram subcutaneous dose as well as for post-exposure prophylaxis for certain appropriate patients who are at high risk for disease. Utilization is increasing ready and currently more than 50,000 doses ordered per week. We also announced that the U.K. recovery study showed a 20% reduction in risk of death in hospitalized patients would not mounted their own immune response. With these results, together with supporting data from Regeneron study in hospitalized patients that George will discuss momentarily, REGEN-COV has the potential if so authorized to be the first treatment be using a wide spectrum of COVID-19 disease settings from prevention through the hospitalized setting. In summary, our core business is strong and continues to diversify, and our innovative pipeline continues to advance, positioning Regeneron well long-term growth. Now I will turn the call over to George. Yes. Let me just add that implicit in what George said is we're working with the agency to try and convince them that our data is strong. And the agency, obviously, has a lot on its plate, and it's trying, I think, to sort through whether or not these individuals should try a third dose or not of a vaccine. That has to get sorted out, I think. And the FDA has our data. And as George said, we're looking at ways to enhance our data, but we already believe that in a pre-exposure prophylaxis mode, we have strong data, but it's not been authorized by the agency and it's under review. So just to be clear, the current authorization allows chronic treatment but allows chronic treatment for people, for example, who are immunocompromised, but are in an institutional setting, working or living in a congress setting where they're exposed to infected individuals we would like to expand that to pre-exposure prophylaxis for the community-acquired infections. That is where immunocompromised people might be able to go out in the community and have some protection. So we do have chronic dosing for the immunocompromised in our current authorization, but that's restricted to this post exposure or ongoing exposure in the known infected people setting, and we're trying to expand that to protect these people in the community setting. It's -- we think the data are strong, but obviously, there's a lot going on and a lot of considerations, as I mentioned before, that need to get sorted out. Maybe I'll take that question. The contract we have has been fulfilled. And so the government is going to need to decide whether or not they want to have another contract or they want us to switch over to a commercial model which could occur before or after a regular approval as it did with remdesivir. I think a lot of that is going to depend upon the government's assessment of what they think is the most efficient way to get people to use the product. There's been a tremendous acceleration in use our penetration in terms of addressing what we would say, estimated eligible patients has gone up dramatically to somewhere in the low single digits to almost 25% to 30% more recently in terms of eligible patients getting monoclonals. If that trend continues along with the trend of unfortunately, more cases, obviously, we're going to have to go with the direction that the government wants another contract or actual switchover. Capacity, of course, is always an issue, but we think we're sort of well positioned to continue to supply similar amounts that we've been able to supply and we'll have to look at -- and these demands can change pretty rapidly. And of course, we do have our partner, Roche, who's got capacity that we can perhaps turn to. So a lot of moving parts, Yaron. And the most important of which is what is the shape of the current surge in the pandemic. Right. It's a great question, but we're going to have to defer on that one because of ongoing patent issues and what have you. We really can't make a comment. Sorry. Well, we should let the iterator and inventor answer that. We should let the iterator and inventor answer that. Go ahead George. We have time for maybe 2 or 3 more quick questions, Tamia. Next question please. Sure. So look, what we look at are the shipments from our distributor to institutions, hospitals, med centers and clinics, emergencies, et cetera, et cetera. And we believe, based on some real-world data that about 70% of the daily cases that occur are occurring in people who would be eligible for treatment, either because they're obese or they've got underlying conditions or they're elderly more -- we're seeing more younger and obese, frankly, than we -- than elderly that was seen earlier in the pandemic. So if you take, for example, that maybe it was 100,000 new cases, maybe 70,000 of them would be eligible. So that gives you an idea. I was just looking, Mike, at this to see what our repeat orders were. And the vast, vast majority, I think it's around or above 90% of the institutions ordering have or repeat orders, meaning that they're not people just stocking the stuff to have it around. They're using it up. And that's what our field people seem to tell us. I don't know if Marion wants to maybe add any more or not, but I hope that helps you. Tamia, we're going to have to cut it after 1 more question."

            "name": "Bob Landry",
            "content": "Thanks, Marion, and good morning and afternoon to everyone listening to the call. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. In the second quarter, our core business continued to deliver impressive year-over-year growth bolstered by strong execution across the company to deliver the full $1.25 million dose contract to the U.S. government for REGEN-COV. For the second quarter, total revenues grew 163% year-over-year to $5.1 billion. Excluding revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, total revenue grew 22% versus the prior year. Total diluted net income per share grew 260% year-over-year to $25.80 on net income of $2.9 billion. In the second quarter, we recognized $2.6 billion of U.S. REGEN-COV sales, representing the vast majority of revenue related to the delivery of 1.25 million doses to the U.S. government. Due to revenue recognition rules, a residual $34 million of net product sales for doses delivered under this contract will be recorded in the third quarter. Given the delivery of these doses to the U.S. government and current utilization rates we anticipate the current U.S. government supply will be exhausted by the end of the year. We do not expect to record substantial additional sales this year in the U.S. in less the number of cases and related utilization continue to increase exponentially. I will now move to collaboration revenues, which were $955 million in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to $513 million second quarter of 2020. Let me begin with the Roche collaboration. Ex U.S. sales of the COVID antibody cocktail known as Ronapreve, outside of the U.S. were $470 million as reported to us by Roche, we recorded $168 million in Roche collaboration revenue for our share of profits from Roche's sale of Ronapreve, which is now available or approved in more than 20 countries. With new COVID cases on the rise globally, we expect the Ronapreve will continue to be a meaningful revenue contributor in 2021. With regard to our Bayer collaboration. Ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales reported to us by Bayer were $904 million for the second quarter of 2021, representing growth of 41% on a reported basis and 31% on a constant currency basis as a result of broad market recovery and a favorable comparison versus the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $349 million, of which we recorded $335 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Finally, total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $438 million in the second quarter of 2021. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and Kevzara was $328 million, which nearly doubled when compared to profits of $172 million in the prior year. Other revenue was $46 million in the second quarter compared to $212 million in the prior year. The decrease is primarily related to nonrecurring reinforce from BARDA in 2020 for development of COVID-19 and an Ebola treatments. We continue to expect 2021 other revenue to be less than half of what was recorded in 2020 on a full year basis. Moving on to our operating expenses. R&D increased 11% year-over-year to $643 million, primarily due to continued clinical development costs for our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail and higher headcount to support our expanding pipeline. Next, SG&A expense increased 21% year-over-year to $365 million due to costs related to COVID-19 related activities, launch investments for Libtayo, growth initiatives for EYLEA and higher headcount. Cost of goods sold increased versus the prior year from $93 million to $514 million, primarily due to REGEN-COV manufacturing costs. Finally, effective tax rate was 17% in the second quarter of 2021, reflecting the impact of REGEN-COV sales, which are taxed at the U.S. statutory rate. Shifting to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the second quarter of 2021, Regeneron generated $478 million in free cash flow and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of $5.1 billion. We received the full $2.625 billion of cash associated with completion of our second REGEN-COV contract with the U.S. government in July. As the business continues its strong performance, we are reiterating our capital allocation priorities of investing in internal R&D, funding strategic external R&D partnerships and returning cash to shareholders. Accordingly, in July, we announced a new $1.8 billion expansion of our Tarrytown facilities, primarily directed toward additional internal R&D operations and capabilities. We also continue to advance our next-generation technology partnerships with companies like Intellia and Alnylam, which are beginning to bear fruit as targets get selected and programs move forward into development. Finally, in the second quarter, we repurchased $289 million of our shares, and we remain opportunistic buyers in the market. To conclude, I'd like to provide select updates to our 2021 guidance. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release published earlier this morning. We are updating our full year 2021 guidance for SG&A to be in the range of $1.54 billion to $1.62 billion. The change is related to increased efforts in the second half for REGEN-COV. We are also revising our full year 2021 guidance for R&D to be in the range of $2.65 billion to $2.75 billion. The change is driven by lower-than-expected spend on REGEN-COV. Finally, we now expect our full year 2021 non-GAAP effective tax rate guidance to be in the range of 14% to 16%, driven by higher sales of REGEN-COV, which, as I said, are taxed at the U.S. statutory rate. In conclusion, Regeneron performed exceptionally well in the second quarter with the core business continuing on a strong growth trajectory as we invest in our diverse and differentiated pipeline for long-term sustainable growth. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Justin. Yes. And Terrence, I'll just kind of punctuate what Marion said on that. Clearly, and you can see it in the MD&A that we disclosed, and you can do the calc right, our margins are getting better with this. I mean this is something that we talked about. Certainly, we've had a lot of ex U.S. launches, a lot of prelaunch expenses related to that. kind of held that back a little bit. I think you're now seeing certainly year-over-year, you're starting to see the fruits of the labor. And the leverage that we've been talking about for a while, again, kudos to Sanofi, another strong ex U.S. quarter by them as we continue to see the indications really starting to kick in ex U.S."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "George Yancopoulos",
            "content": "Thank you, Len. We have a lot to talk about this morning, which is all possible because of our Regeneron colleagues who have been working nonstop throughout this pandemic. And unfortunately, the world is still in the throes of this global COVID-19 pandemic. As the number of infected individuals in the United States are climbing again with nearly 100,000 Americans becoming infected every day. Therefore, I will start with Regeneron with REGEN-COV, our monoclonal antibody cocktail for COVID-19. In June, the REGEN-COV Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA, was updated to include the lower 1.2 gram REGEN-COV dose with both intravenous and subcutaneous administration for nonhospitalized patients. This EUA was supported by Phase III data showing that the 1.2 gram dose reduce risk of hospitalization or death by 70%. Just last week, the EUA was further expanded to include utilization in post-exposure prophylaxis for COVID-19 in certain populations, and also allows for repeated monthly dosing of REGEN-COV for high-risk patients, such as the immunocompromised who are at high risk of ongoing exposure to infected individuals in the same institutional setting. This latest authorization makes REGEN-COV the only treatment that is available for both treating infected individuals and also preventing infection in certain settings. We would like to emphasize that REGEN-COV is not a substitute for vaccination. Still under review by the FDA are additional data, which we believe could broaden the prevention application to pre-exposure prophylaxis as well as to extend the treatment paradigm to hospitalized patients. The details of Part A of our Phase III prophylaxis study in which we assessed efficacy and safety of subcutaneous REGEN-COV in preventing infection among previously uninfected individuals has just been published today in the New England Journal of Medicine. We believe there is enormous unmet need to try to protect immunocomprised individuals who have not responded to the vaccine and we hope that the FDA will agree that our data will support an authorization in this pre-exposure prophylaxis setting. For hospitalized patients, we recently reported that REGEN-COV tested as part of the Oxford University Phase III RECOVERY study met its primary outcome, reducing risk of death by 20% in hospitalized COVID-19 patients lacking immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Data from our own smaller study in hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed similar conclusions with 35% reduction in overall mortality in this study, which was limited to earlier-stage hospitalized patients with no oxygen or low oxygen support. These collective data from recovery and from our study in hospitalized patients have been shared with regulators. In addition, we are on track to complete the REGEN-COV BLA submissions in the second half of 2021. Outside of the United States, our collaborator Roche obtained emergency or temporary pandemic use authorizations for our COVID-19 antibody cocktail, known as Ronapreve outside the United States in more than 20 countries across the European Union, India, Switzerland and Canada, with more authorizations expected soon. Japan was the first country to grant formal regulatory approval to our antibody cocktail for COVID-19. Finally, REGEN-COV retains potent activity against all known variants of interest, including the Delta variant. For patients at high risk of serious consequences, including many with an inadequate response to vaccines, REGEN-COV could be an important option to patients and their physicians for the foreseeable future. Moving on to ophthalmology. In the coming months, we expect data from the Phase II study of high dose of libracept in wet AMD. This readout will consist of efficacy assessments on drawing in other anatomical measures as well as safety on the 8-milligram and the currently approved 2-milligram of libracept dose and an 8-week dosing interval. In the 106 patients dosed in the open-label Phase II to date, we have not seen any concerning safety signals. While the smaller study will not be definitive on durability measures, the Phase II data will help provide insights into the larger Phase III studies, which are testing high-dose aflibercept dosing intervals out to 12 and 16 weeks. I'm pleased to announce that the Phase III studies in DME and AMD have completed enrollment, allowing for Phase III data next year. Moving on to Dupixent in our immunology and inflammation portfolio. Just last week, we announced that a Phase III trial in chronic spontaneous urticaria, where CSU, met primary and all key 24-week secondary endpoints, showing Dupixent reduced itch and hive activity scores by nearly half. This is the fifth disease in which Dupixent demonstrated positive pivotal trial results and efficacy in this disease raises the possibility of IL-4 and IL-13 and are critical drivers in diseases not traditionally sought to be driven by type 2 inflammation. We plan to report results from a second trial in CSU patients who are not benefiting from the approved standard of care biologic in early 2022. This positive readout in CSU is continuing to build on Dupixent's efficacy and safety demonstrated across other inflammatory diseases. In the upcoming months, we also expect results from our confirmatory Phase IIIb study in adult and adolescent patients with eosinophilic esophagitis as well as readout of a Phase III study in prurigo nodularis. Thus far, Dupixent is approved in patients as young as 6 years old in atopic dermatitis and 12 years old in asthma. Later this year, we will report data from a Phase III study in preschool children as young as 6 months up to 5 years of age suffering from atopic dermatitis. In asthma, we anticipate a regulatory decision in October for children aged 6 to 11 years old in the United States. Moving to our anti interleukin-33 antibody Itupikumab. Results of the Phase II study in COPD patients were recently published in Lancet Respiratory Medicine. All the trial exhibited strong trends in its primary endpoint of exacerbation reduction in the overall population, which did not meet statistical significance, a prespecified subgroup analysis of former smokers with COPD is what accounted for the overall benefit with no negative subset in the remaining population. In the prespecified former smoker subgroup, Itupikumab demonstrated a 42% reduction in exacerbations and improvement in lung function of 0.09 liters compared to placebo with both endpoints reaching nominal statistical significance. Moreover, the publication includes genetic analyses that support a protective role for interleukin-33 in COPD. Based on these results, we and Sanofi are assessing the potential of Itupikumab in two Phase III studies focus on the former smoker population with COPD. I should also remind you that we have two ongoing studies we face -- two ongoing Phase III studies with Dupixent in a complementary COPD population. We are also progressing our novel approaches to treat allergies by using cocktails of monoclonal antibodies to directly bind and inactivate allergens, which have produced robust results in Phase II studies. Results of the initial Phase III study of our antibody cocktail against virtue allergy caused by the Betv1 allergen are expected later this year. The first Phase III study of an antibody cocktail for cat allergy caused by the Feld1 allergen, is now open for enrollment. We are enthusiastic about these innovative additions to our inflammation and immunology portfolio. In oncology, following its recent approvals in the United States or certain first-line non-small cell lung cancer in certain advanced basal cell carcinoma patients, Libtayo was subsequently approved in the EU for these settings. Furthermore, compelling overall survival data in second-line cervical cancer patients were presented at an ESMO virtual planar in May with the regulatory submissions to the FDA and EMA planned for this year. For lung cancer, we are pleased to report today that in our Phase III trial comparing with Tylus standard chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone the independent data monitoring committee recommended halting the trial for efficacy at the second interim analysis. Libtayo plus chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival as well as progression-free surveil compared to chemotherapy alone in first-line locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. With these data, Libtayo is now the second PD-1 targeting antibody that has been able to demonstrate significant overall survival benefit both as a monotherapy as well as in combination with chemotherapy for treating advanced lung cancer. With this validation, Libtayo provides an important foundation for a broad and multifaceted approach to address the great unmet need that patients with cancer in general and lung cancer, in particular, still face. In addition to our Libtayo monotherapy and chemo combination opportunities in lung cancer, we are developing several bispecifics. Our EGFR by CD28 costim and Libtayo combination is in dose escalation for lung and other advanced cancers. Our METxMET bispecific antibody is enrolling non-small cell lung cancer patients with a broad selection of patients, including MET exon 14 gene mutation, gene amplification and/or elevated MET protein expression. And as we introduced at our ASCO investor event, our first antibody drug conjugate METxMET ADC, is poised to enter the clinic in the coming months with a focus on patients with net overexpressing cancers, including lung cancer, where MET over expression occurs in as many as 25% patients. In terms of building on the potential of Tylus with combinations in skin cancer, we recently announced new clinical data for the combination Tyle with Fianlimab our LAG-3 inhibitor, in advanced melanoma at the ASCO annual meeting in June. The combination demonstrated a 67% response rate in PD-1 or PDL-1 naive patients with potential for a more favorable safety profile than with anti-CTLA-4 PD-1 combinations. We plan to initiate a Phase III study of Fianlimab and Libtayo as a first-line treatment for advanced melanoma in 2022. Ovarian cancer is the first tumor type for which we are clinically testing three powerful combinant approaches. First, our MUC16xCD3 bispecific with Libtayo, where we hope to share initial data next year. Next, our MUC16xCD28 costim bispecific with Libtayo. And third, our novel combination of the CD3 and costim bispecifics for which we have now dosed the first patient. This latter combination of two bispecifics of two different classes has potential to be a novel and disruptive approach for the treatment of solid tumors. Rounding out my commentary in solid tumors, our PSMAxCD28 program in prostate cancer continues in dose escalation with Libtayo, and we hope to share initial data next year. As we mentioned previously, we are planning on introducing a PSMAxCD3 bispecific to the clinic later this year, providing another unique experimental combination for prostate cancer treatment. The tumor viewed as nonresponsive currently to available immunotherapies. Moving on to hematologic cancers and starting with lymphoma. Odronextamab, our CD23 bispecific has demonstrated encouraging efficacy and durability of responses in hard-to-treat patient emulations. We have resumed enrollment in our potentially pivotal Phase II program in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, with lifting of the partial clinical hold following protocol amendments for a modified step-up dosing protocol. Later this year, we plan to initiate testing of the exome subcutaneous formulation. And next year, we plan to initiate the Phase III program as well as combination trials with our lymphoma-specific costim bispecific. In multiple myeloma, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific is on track to complete enrollment potentially pivotal Phase II study next year. We will also initiate studies evaluating a subcutaneous formulation in combinations with standard of care. With our unique position to mix and match multiple modalities and targets with the goal of deepening the responses we are already observing with our BCMAxCD3 bispecific we are on track to start a combination study with a costim bispecific for multiple myeloma next year. I would like to conclude with our Regeneron Genetic Medicines efforts. As you know, these efforts start with our Regeneron Genetics Center and its ability to genetically identify and validate new disease targets and is coupled with emerging gene-based therapeutic solutions to address these targets, including CRISPR-based technologies with our collaborator Intellia, siRNA technologies with Alnylam as well as viral gene debility technologies we are developing in-house. The Regeneron Genetics Center continues to emerge as a world leader in human sequencing and in defining genetic variants that can either be protective or causative for human disease. Most recently identifying a major new gene target that protects against obesity as described in a high-profile publication in Science last month. For this newly discovered target, we are deploying several strategies to develop new classes of potential therapeutics to fight obesity and potentially type two diabetes. In terms of progress with our gene-based therapeutic approaches, together with the Intellia, we recently announced positive clinical data for the first ever systemically delivered CRISPR-based gene knockout in human patients. In the first 6 patients with transthyretin amyloidosis with TTR amyloidosis, a single systemic treatment led to dose-dependent reduction in the disease-causing protein with no serious adverse events observed through day 28. This proof of asset clinical data increases the probability of success for both our knockout as well as our insertion CRISPR-based programs, unlocking the potential of many future possibilities for Intellia and Regeneron. Currently, we're evaluating more than 20 preclinical programs under this collaboration, and Regeneron has the rights to develop up to 15 in vivo products with Intellia. Regarding our efforts with Alnylam, on an siRNA for a novel NASH target identified by the Regeneron Genetic Center, we are hoping to see initial healthy volunteer data by the end of this year. This 2-part first-in-human study is now enrolling NASH patients. We are currently evaluating about 20 preclinical programs under this collaboration and Regeneron has rights to develop up to 30 products with Alnylam. With that brief glimpse into the future of genetic medicines, I would like to turn the call over to Marion. As you said, I mean, we're going to provide the details in future publication and/or conferences. I think it's important to note, as you said, it's very difficult to compare across studies, done years apart. And especially when we allowed classes of patients that were not previously allowed in other studies and so forth. As you pointed out, the median survival numbers are right on top of each other. But as you also pointed out, we had two different subtypes in this study. I can comment in our preliminary analysis, and these remain to be fully validated and so forth. One of the subtypes our hazard ratio was better than what was observed with the KEYTRUDA study and the other one, it was worse. It's important to point out that these things bounce around in these cross-study comparisons. As you know, in other settings, which you try to do cross country -- cross-study comparisons, for example, when you compare our monotherapy results in the greater than 50% PDL population. It looks like our numbers are substantially better in the skin and particularly the CSCC comparisons they're better. So these things bounce around. It's always hard to do these things. But I think the important thing to point out is that in this field in lung cancer, very few have hit in both monotherapy greater than 50% and in chemo combination all comers. I remind you that Opdivo Jens and most of the PD-L1s did. So right now, the only 2 PD-1 antibodies that standalone, having demonstrated overall survival benefit, both in the monotherapy setting as well as now in the chemo combination setting. And I think this really well positioned Libtayo and across all the studies, I think it's -- the definitive conclusion is that it's a very active molecule that looks at least as active as any other agents out there. Yes. Well, we think that certainly, we should be competitive right now. The opportunity for this class, which is obviously dominated by KEYTRUDA right now because up until now, it was the only agent that had this strong data across the spectrum of monotherapy and chemo combination. We think that now we can be legitimate competitors here in the lung cancer space. We see our combination opportunities as future growth and differentiator opportunities. But in the short term, we expect to be a viable competitor now with these data. And in the future, we hope to use the combinations to take the standard of care and elevate results to another level. Yes. As you said, we think that the immunocompromised population which as I'm sure you all know, represents 3% to 4% of the U.S. population, that several million individuals, a variety of studies are showing that somewhere around 50% or more of these individuals do not respond after 2 or even after 3 attempts with the vaccine. And so these people are left without their own antibodies to protect them. So it's a huge unmet need setting where these individuals will not be protected. And as we're all seeing that it's very unlikely that we will be eliminating spread of infections through breakthrough infections, whether it was symptomatic or otherwise throughout the population for these individuals to be able to live normal lives they're going to need protection. And we believe that the most powerful protection is essentially providing them with these surrogate antibodies that our antibody cocktail provides. We already have very strong data, we believe, to support the notion that this agent can be used in chronic prevention settings, and we do intend to continue to explore future study opportunities where we can further enhance on the already existing data that shows that after the first week or so, we seem to obtain similar upwards of 90% protection against infection in individuals who do not have their own antibodies and are being exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. I think that, that is very strong data that bodes very well that this is potentially to be a very important treatment, particularly for these immunocompromised individuals who do not have antibodies on their own. Sorry. I was going to just -- sorry, I didn't hear you speaking there. Yes, we have a very robust effort in neurodegenerative diseases here at Regeneron are not overly excited about some of the antibody developments and necessarily getting into those type of approaches. But we have a lot of things that we're actually very excited about in the neurodegenerative disease space. We think novel ways of addressing targets as well as brand new targets that haven't been discovered elsewhere. We will be discussing these efforts going forward in more detail over the coming months and year. Yes. I have to say that I'm not sure exactly what our results are and quantitatively. But so far, every variant and every strain that we've tested, we retained potency. And so far, there's hopefully no reason to think that's going to change because we prospectively took advantage of this cocktail approaches so that even if one antibody gets minimally affected, the other one can take its place. So we expect to retain robust activity. That said, I think we've also announced that we have second-generation antibodies that are also entering in the clinic where we're going to continue to retain broad coverage. But I believe that as far as it's been tested with Linda, we retain potency there as well. Well, I think there's a variety of goals, but our major question right now with our first program is we believe that we have a novel approach that addresses not the steatosis component, but the inflammatory component, which is something that really is not being addressed by other approaches, other targets, other agents. So that if we can actually stop or reverse the inflammatory response to the steatosis that will be an entirely different and also potentially complementary approach to what anything that anybody else is doing right now. I think the genetics very strongly point to that. That's what it actually shows that this genetic target affects and that's what the protective mutations are actually showing. So we're excited about looking at this opportunity, whether we can halt or even reverse inflammatory signals, inflammatory processes and thus, actual progression of the disease irregardless of steatosis. Yes. I'll just add a couple of thoughts or points to that is during the last sort of surge, as Len said, we were probably only reaching somewhat of 1% of the potentially eligible patients. We're now well into the double digits in terms of the percentage of the eligible patients that we're probably reaching. And we've had some feedback from some of these institutions where we distribute to where they're actually low on inventory, suggesting that they're not stocking it up. Yes. Obviously, these first-in-human results are incredibly exciting, both in terms of the percent knockdown. And also in terms of thus far in these early days, the observed safety. And as we said, we have two types of broad collaborative program areas with Intellia, both of which we think are greatly bolstered in terms of confidence based on these initial results. We have a series of programs which similarly involve systemic-based approaches to achieve gene knockdown. So obviously, those are chances of success are greatly bolstered by what we've seen with these first in-human results. But we also have, I think, just as if not even more exciting, a CRISPR-based gene insertion program that we're very excited about. And since it depends on essentially overlapping technologies, this program and its chance of success has greatly been increased based on the results we've seen to date. So we think that with the fact that we have so many programs ongoing in our collaboration with Intellia more than 20 programs under evaluation, and we have the ability to move forward quite a few of these. We're very excited that this could really change the practice of medicine and really bring CRISPR-based gene therapy to patients into the world. So nothing to be more exciting from the gene medicines point of view."

Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the Investor Relations team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.\nLeonard Schleifer: Thank you, Justin, and thank you to everyone joining today's call. We were off to a strong start in 2021, again delivering double-digit growth on the top and bottom lines. I am immensely proud of all that Regeneron continues to accomplish in the fight against COVID and for patients suffering from a variety of diseases. \nGeorge Yancopoulos : Thank you, Len. With the COVID-19 still in the headlines, I will start with our monoclonal antibody treatment, the REGEN-COV cocktail. We recently reported data from the large Phase 3 outcomes trial in the outpatient setting confirming that REGEN-COV reduced the risk of hospitalization and death by 70% with both the 2.4 gram and the lower 1.2 gram doses.  We are pleased that based on these data, the NIH guidelines were updated in early April to include a strong recommendation for monoclonal antibody combinations to treat outpatients with mild or moderate COVID-19 as defined by the EUA criteria. We have also recently reported data from a large two-part Phase 3 trial of REGEN-COV with Part A in the preventative setting and Part B in the recently infected patients. \nMarion McCourt : Thank you, George. We are off to an exciting start in 2021. Our expanded commercial portfolio includes three recent product and indication launches and we continue to grow our largest brands, EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo based on competitive and differentiated profiles.  Beginning with EYLEA, first quarter global net sales grew 17% year-over-year to nearly $2.2 billion. In the U.S., EYLEA net sales grew 15% year-over-year to $1.35 billion based on increased demand and a favorable comparison to the early weeks of the pandemic in the first quarter of 2020. EYLEA is capturing category growth and continues to be the preferred treatment option.  In the branded anti VEGF category, EYLEA has approximately 75% share and is approaching 50% of the combined branded and unbranded category. EYLEA is differentiated by the combination of its efficacy, safety, dosing flexibility in range of indications. In addition, physicians have considerable real-world experience with more than 40 million injections administered worldwide.  Across the broader category, demand continues to improve in 2021 as patient flow normalizes and new patient volume grows, we are confident in our near and longer-term outlook based on favorable patient demographics, physician preference for EYLIA, growth opportunities in diabetic eye disease and future opportunities with our high dose clinical program.  Turning to Libtayo, first quarter global net sales grew to $101 million with U.S. net sales of $69 million. The vast majority of first quarter sales were in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma where Libtayo is the number one systemic treatment. We are excited by the recent approvals in non-small cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma or BCC, both of which represent meaningful growth opportunities for Libtayo.  In April, we deployed our expanded and highly experienced sales force across these indications to extend our Libtayo promotional impact.  In lung cancer, we have heard from oncologists that Libtayo is highly competitive based on the strength of our compelling clinical data and overall value proposition. Early launch indicators are encouraging with uptick evidence at top academic and community-based practices. We are advancing formulary placements, securing favorable peer coverage decisions and growing overall market awareness. Importantly, Libtayo was rapidly included in the NCCN guidelines with a Category 1 preferred rating.  The NCCN guidelines have also been updated to include Libtayo in BCC as the category to a option, Libtayo is the only anti-PD1 approved in advanced disease for this indication. Early feedback has been encouraging as physicians are eager to prescribe Libtayo based on its efficacy and tolerability.  Hedgehog inhibitors despite being used in its first-line treatment may not be suitable for patients for long-term or routine use. Libtayo is an important new care alternative for BCC patients.  In summary, our lung and BCC launches are progressing according to plan and we are highly focused on ensuring that appropriate patients benefit from Libtayo.  Turning now to EVKEEZA, which has also proved in the first quarter of 2021 and is in the initial launch phase. EVKEEZA represents a novel and effective treatment for patients with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia and is recognized by treating specialists as an improvement over the current standard-of-care. Patient demand is steadily building with multiple patients already initiated on therapy.  Moving to Dupixent, global net sales in the first quarter were $1.26 billion, representing 48% growth compared to the prior year. In the U.S., broad based growth across all the proved indications generated net sales of $962 million with new patient starts now higher than pre-COVID levels.  In atopic dermatitis, Dupixent\u2019s largest indication prescribing continues to be strong across the moderate and severe disease and across age groups following our adolescent and pediatric launches. There is significant for continued growth based on remaining unmet need among eligible patients. Dupixent is the number one dermatologist prescribed biologic based on the depth and breadth of its long-term efficacy and safety profile.  Turning to asthma, where we are actively preparing to launch in pediatric patients as young as six years of age later this year. Among adolescents and adults, we continue to meaningfully expand the number of Dupixent patients initiations driven by our extensive provider and patient educational efforts.  In addition, demand is strong among E&Ts and allergists for patients with nasal polyps. Dupixent is the fastest-growing biologic and respiratory disease in our approved indications with substantial room for growth.  I\u2019d also like to highlight efforts supporting our antibody cocktail REGEN-COV. In the first quarter, we recorded U.S. net sales of $262 million under the first contract with U.S. government. REGEN-COV is currently authorized under an EUA in patients based on age and risk factors which represent close to 40% of all adults diagnosed with COVID-19.  We are focused on reducing bottlenecks and increasing utilization, particularly in states with high infection rates. Efforts include, direct support to key facilities, medical education for REGEN-COV, partnering with third-party stakeholders and educating consumers on the availability of antibody treatments.  As George mentioned, we are preparing for a potential update of the REGEN-COV EUA to include prevention as we hope to be able to address an unmet need for millions of patients who may be candidates for ongoing preventative treatment. Preventative care may also be important for those who have known COVID exposure and requires very rapid protection.  In summary, we delivered robust performance across our portfolio in the first quarter of the year. There is strong positive momentum from our inline business, encouraging early signals from our recent launches and substantial opportunity for continued diversified growth.  Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bob. \nRobert Landry: Thanks, Marion. And good morning and afternoon to everyone listening to the call. My comments today on financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. As Len stated, Regeneron is off to a strong start in 2021 as we continue to execute across the business delivering double-digit top and bottom line growth in the first quarter.  For the first quarter, total revenues grew 38% year-over-year to $2.5 billion, driven by growth in global EYLEA sales; increased Sanofi collaboration profitability driven by Dupixent and sales of our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail. Diluted net income per share grew 50% year-over-year to $9.89 on net income of $1.1 billion. Excluding revenues related to REGEN-COV, Regeneron achieved 20% total revenue growth versus the prior year. As you\u2019ve heard from Marion, we completed our initial contract to supply REGEN-COV to the U.S. government in the first quarter assuming that we secure an updated EUA for the 1.2 gram treatment dose we expect to deliver at least 1 million of REGEN-COV at $2100 per dose for our follow-on contract with the U.S. government in the second quarter.  I will now move to collaboration revenues, which were $754 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $528 million in the first quarter of 2020. Starting with the Bayer collaboration, Ex-US EYLEA net product sales reported to us by Bayer were $824 million for the first quarter of 2021, representing growth of 21% on a reported basis and 12% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $323 million, of which we recorded $309 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $365 million in the first quarter. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and Kevzara was $261 million, which compares favorably to profits of $171 million in the prior year driven by Dupixent. We recorded initial Roche collaboration revenues of $67 million for our share of gross profits from the distribution of the antibody cocktail by Roche outside of the U.S.  Other revenue to $50 million in the first quarter, compared to $63 million in the prior year. In 2021, we expect this line to be less than half of what we recorded in 2020 due to lower border reimbursements with the EBOLA and COVID-19 programs.  Moving on to our operating expenses, and starting with R&D. R&D increased 28% year-over-year to $673 million, primarily due to continued clinical development costs for our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail.  Next, SG&A expense increased 16% year-over-year to $355 million. The year-over-year increase was driven by commercial investments for Libtayo, cost related to the roll out of REGEN-COV and higher employee-related expenses.  Cost of goods sold increased versus the prior year from $70 million to $173 million due to REGEN-COV manufacturing costs and Praluent manufacturing cost in the in the U.S. which were recorded by Sanofi in the first quarter of 2020.  Additionally, in other operating income and expense, we recorded $4 million expense, compared to $25 million of income in the prior year. This is driven by interest expense related to our $2 billion debt issuance in August 2020 and lower investment returns on our existing cash and marketable securities.  Finally, the effective tax rate was 10.5% in the first quarter of 2021. Included in this rate is the benefit achieved by a reduction in uncertain tax position liabilities related to the IRS audits of the 2015 and 2016 tax years.  Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the first quarter of 2021, Regeneron generated $553 million in free cash flow and ended the quarter with net cash and marketable securities of $5.1 billion. In the first quarter, we utilized $323 million of our $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization and we remain opportunistic buyers in the market.  I would now like to provide select updates to our 2021 guidance. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release published earlier this morning. We are updating full year 2021 guidance for COCM to be in the range of $660 million to $730 million, the lower guidance range is related to the timing of contract manufacturing of Praluent for Sanofi. We are also updating guidance for our 2021 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 13% to 15%. The increase from prior guidance is driven by higher forecasted delivery of REGEN-COV under our second U.S. government contract, which is passed at the U.S. statutory rate.  In Regeneron is off to a strong start in 2021 and continues to execute across all aspects of the business. We are well positioned for the remainder of 2021 and continue to make those investments necessary to ensure long-term growth.  With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Justin.\nJustin Holko: Thank you, Bob. Mary that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. With several callers in the queue and to ensure that we were able to address as many as possible, we will answer just one question from each caller before moving to the next. Please go ahead, Mary.\nOperator:  Your first question comes from the line of Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. \nTerence Flynn : Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess, with respect to the competitive landscape for Dupixent, the JAK inhibitors have been delayed, but assuming that it do reached the market later this year including at the high dose. How are you guys thinking about that as a competitive headwind to Dupixent? And maybe, if you think about the longer term market opportunity, you could walk us through kind of where penetration stands right now in the adult and the adolescent setting? Thank you. \nLeonard Schleifer: Go ahead, Marion. \nMarion McCourt: Sure. So, I am having to start off, first, let me say that we are seeing tremendous experience with Dupixent in the marketplace today. And this obviously is a cost indications including atopic dermatitis. And also very importantly, across age categories which demonstrate not only the efficacy, the speed of action, the safety, the tolerability, we pay really close attention to competitors coming into the marketplace.  And certainly in the case of these JAK inhibitors we are well aware of the multiple delays, also recent clinical data that is calling into question issues of safety, especially at the higher doses, but even at the lower doses and the continuation of Blackrock\u2019s warnings, we hear from our key opinion leaders who use Dupixent and see it as their main stay of therapy currently and going forward with great confidence in the safety profile.  This is a chronic therapy and certainly the risk of hematologic effects, malignancies, infection and so on are just not something that is tolerable for these patients when they have a tremendous alternative. So I think we feel very confident in our competitive profile going forward. And also remind that Dupixent, obviously, based on its mode of action, has great efficacy across Type 2 disease and other indications. Patients do sometimes have concomitant conditions. So, on balance, we\u2019ll stay very close to this and to our key opinion leaders and specialists who are very, very confident in the profile of Dupixent. \nLeonard Schleifer: Yes, I would just add two points that, one is the safety will be particularly concerning, I think for the long-term treatment of children. And so, I think, as the safety profile that Dupixent has shown is really, frankly \u2013 it\u2019s almost unparallel in terms of what you can do with the ageing on the efficacy side and not have any significant concerns on the safety side.  The other point in terms of the penetration, even if you look at how these markets have evolved, when more agents have come on for rheumatoid arthritis and for psoriasis, the penetration is so low here that, even with competition there is room for market growth rather than direct fighting it out in terms of a fixed amount of market share.  So, we expect our profile, safety as Marion says to be really firm on treating physicians\u2019 minds and we do think the low level of penetration thus far does leave room for growth nonetheless. \nJustin Holko: Great. Next question please.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond of Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. \nChris Raymond : Yes. Thanks. Just maybe another question on Dupixent. So, our checks indicate there is a lot of interest in AD with regard to add-on therapy and that there is a lot of Dupixent patients who may not be necessarily optimally managed, but are not exactly failing.  So, there is a lot of interest I guess with, maybe looking at atopical JAK or some other therapy. Just kind of curious if you guys have thought about maybe proactively looking at some combo work just to sort of ensure that Dupixent maintains its role as a core? Thanks. \nLeonard Schleifer: Well, George, you might want to comment if we have any interest in that, but in terms of the commercial side of this, when you talk to patients, the kind of patients we are treating moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, they have lesions over large fraction of their body.  I can remember exactly what it was in our trials, what we are seeing out there commercially is large fractions of their body are affected by this disease. And so, I think that adding topical perhaps, but people actually trying to get away from \u2013 trying to get away from having to lather up over their entire body.  The other thing about Dupixent that we can never forget is that, the broad aspects of approvals across lots of allergic diseases and with the growing number, it\u2019s very important because these diseases do tend to run in groups. There are many people who have asthma and atopic dermatitis or asthma and nasal polyposis or atopic dermatitis and other allergic diseases which we are studying. So, I think that our broad profile across lots of other diseases is also going to give us a very strong competitive position. \nJustin Holko: Next question please.\nMarion McCourt: Yes, I just - just going to add real quickly, this is Marion, on that question, I just wanted to share as well that, in the market experience, we do and obviously look at this very carefully to market research and have a very high level of satisfaction with Dupixent for patients with atopic dermatitis. So I just want to make sure that there is not an impression left that there lot of patients necessarily looking for something more who are treated with Dupixent for atopic dermatitis. \nJustin Holko: Next question please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. \nCory Kasimov: Hey, good morning guys. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask on the COVID front. Do you have a sense of the remaining hurdles and anticipated timing for the low dose emergency authorization for REGEN-COV and are you continuing to ship high doses to antibody cocktail as you wait on it? Thank you. \nLeonard Schleifer: Right. Thanks for that question, Cory. We\u2019ve been active discussions and productive discussions with the FDA. Obviously, one never knows what they are going to do exactly and when they are going to do it. But we anticipate an action by the FDA over the next \u2013 sometime in the next several weeks in terms of the lower 1.2 gram dose.  I think from there, they will turn their attention to the prevention data which they have in front of them as well as the subcu data, as well as the chronic prevention opportunities. So, I can assure you the FDA has been working really hard. We are in constant contact with them answering questions, going over things and as I said, we expect something to \u2013 anticipated decisions sometime in the next several weeks. \nCory Kasimov: Great. Thank you. \nJustin Holko: Next question please.\nLeonard Schleifer: And Cory, I am sorry, of course, we are continuing to supply the market and there is no shortage of product out there in terms of people needing to be treated now can be treated with the 2.4 gram dose and there is ample product available. \nCory Kasimov: Perfect. Thanks. \nOperator: Next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of SVB Leerink. Your line is now open. \nGeoffrey Porges : So many things to ask questions about in such a little time. But, operating margin 48% to 49% the last couple of quarters, what would that have been without the COVID 2, the antibody and is it sustainable at the current level and I would squeeze in, and if the tax rate sustainable at the current level as well? Thanks. \nRobert Landry: Yes, I mean, I\u2019ll talk about the tax rate. I mean, certainly there is a lot to be played out with regards to what\u2019s going to happen on the tax rate. You heard what I said, we are obviously moving well within our full year guidance. We did have favorable outcome with regards uncertain tax positions that we are able to reverse, which kind of drove a little lower in the quarter on that front.  On operating margins, Geoff, you know, I guess, the one piece that\u2019s not so transparent everybody is, we are still incurring a lot of R&D as it pertains to REGEN-COV with regards to the trials, the enrollment numbers. So, I don\u2019t want people to come our way and say, you know, as a result of the Roche benefit we got in the REGEN-COV product sales that without that the margins would have been as good.  But we did incur a lot of expenses pertaining to that that are within the R&D line that we just don\u2019t specifically talk about. The business on its own, excluding REGEN-COV it was 20% top-line and 35% EBI, okay? So, again, it shows you the underlying strength as you\u2019ve heard from Len at the very beginning of his words in terms of how we are performing.  We think the operating margin is \u2013 continue to stay at that and improve at that level. I mean, certainly, it\u2019s the leverage on Dupixent, right? To the extent you saw that Sanofi did a terrific job ex U.S. where we are starting to get a little momentum in terms of ex U.S. sales. So, to the extent that that will continue to play out, we\u2019ll continue to get good operating margins associated with that and then that will drive our overall margins. \nGeoffrey Porges : Great. Thanks, Rob. \nRobert Landry: Thanks, Geoff. \nJustin Holko: Next question please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Yatin Suneja of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open. \nYatin Suneja: Hey guys. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question on the deployment of cash. Could you maybe talk about the top priorities? Are there areas where you would like to collaborate or bring in capabilities? And how should we think about BD? Thank you. \nLeonard Schleifer: Bob? \nRobert Landry: Sure. Our cash balance on a net cash basis sitting at $5.1 billion and we are roughly at $7 billion on a gross basis. And again, we like the flexibility that it affords us. I always need to make sure that internally, we have enough to obviously support the internal R&D of which we continue to go after different modalities and that\u2019s kind of tied into our second leg of the stool where we don\u2019t have kind of in-house capability on everything.  It\u2019s great that we have the capability for George and the BT team to go out and get other technologies whether it be the Intellia-driven technology on CRISPR or Alnylam and alike. And we are continuing to play heavy in that space and we need to make sure that things we go after are most likely going to be early-stage.  We are not looking for kind of transformative kind of M&A deals on that front as of right now and we continue to stay hungry in that place with the right opportunities. And then as you saw, we did $325 million share buybacks. We have a $1.5 billion program that we authorized in January.  We are opportunistic buyers and we think the intrinsic value of where we see it compared to where the market is currently playing we are going to take advantage of that delta and we did such that in the first quarter and we are continuing to do that on that front. And that continues to be an active play for us. \nYatin Suneja: Okay. Thank you. \nJustin Holko: Thanks, Bob. Next question please.\nOperator: Next question comes from . Your line is now open. \nUnidentified Analyst: Hey guys. This is Alex on for Jeff. Thanks for taking our question. Just one on EYLEA, obviously, scrips and sales are holding up fairly well despite COVID-19 and new market entrants in wet AMD. But, looking to lifecycle management over the next few years, do you see this primarily coming from the high-dose formulation? And on this, is there a venue or an update on timing for data from the CANDELA study? Thanks.\nLeonard Schleifer : Yes. I think that the lifecycle management continues to beat from more data that kind of data that we generated in diabetic retinopathy with the PANORAMA and Protocol W, which George reviewed, I think are very important results. And so, I think that will drive more treatment in that area. In terms of the high dose, I think you heard from George, that we\u2019ll get some of the preliminary Phase 2 data later this year. And then, for next entrants, we have readying for the clinic a newer version, if you will, which we will unveil for you when we get that into the clinic.\nJustin Holko : Next question please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Truist. Your line is now open.\nRobyn Karnauskas : Guys thanks for taking the question. I am scared to ask this question, but, what is your latest thoughts on counterdetailing faricimab? What are you hearing from the specific centers that you think might be more likely utilize the product? And how do you counterdetail to prevent that from taking any share from EYLEA? Thanks.\nMarion McCourt : Sure. So, let me say, first of all, obviously, the product you mentioned is not approved and still at the stage where the clinical data is being reviewed. As I mentioned to some of you who were on the last call, as we look at the clinical profile today of faricimab, we do not see a threat to EYLEA.  Certainly, some of the recent data had some questions on clinical profile and certainly with an increase in IOIO rate, question on the safety profile. I think the net conclusion on the key opinion leaders that I spoke to in retinal community was that they didn\u2019t see an obvious benefit to the product and perhaps even questions in matching the safety, durability, and clinical profile of EYLEA across indications. I\u2019ll mention that certainly with EYLEA, when an important attribute is the ability to treat and extend therapy and there is some elements of that clinical trial designed to constrain EYLEA\u2019s dosing interval, we actually hear on a regular basis that one of the reasons why EYLEA is performing so well in the first quarter of 2021 and frankly performed so well last year is because of its efficacy and the ability to treat and extend for patients. We remain very confident in EYLEA\u2019s profile against the competitive product you mentioned.\nJustin Holko : Next question please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Alethia Young of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.\nAlethia Young : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on all the progress this quarter. I just want a couple of about the 6 to 11 asthma expansion indications. Just can you kind of talk about how you are thinking about uptake there. It feels like it could be pretty robust in light of the safety profile and the fact that kids are on their atopic march as well. So, just wanted to get your perspective on that thing?\nMarion McCourt : Sure. You mentioned something that we look forward to and will be very much prepared for the pediatric launch for Dupixent in the asthma market later this year. We do see this as a tremendous opportunities for these really young patients, age six and up, who are struggling today and will benefit tremendously from the Dupixent ability to improve their airway function and reduce exacerbations and help these patients and their families with these children living more normal and healthy lives.  It\u2019s very important and then, at the same time, recognizing Dupixent\u2019s safety profile. So, at the same time, we take care of the asthma and as Len mentioned before the possibility of concomitant diseases associated with type 2 disease. So we do feel that this will be a very important indication launch. We look forward to and it once again confirms the efficacy and the safety of Dupixent.\nJustin Holko : Thanks, Marion. Next question please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Mohit Bansal of Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nMohit Bansal : Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the progress. One more question on the high dose EYLEA. So, we do know that back in the days, Roche also ran a trial, HARBOR trial, which you talked about  I understand that this trial is designed to be little bit different. It is not a superiority trial that you are running.  But, could that be helpful is my first question. And then, I mean, scientifically, why would a high-dose would result into some kind of better benefit in your opinion that give us some confidence there. Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos : Yes, I think that basically a higher dose will simply - the notion is extend the duration of action. That would be the primary thing that we are looking at. So, obviously, it allows for longer duration of action because, you will go longer until you achieve the minimally effective dose. So, the notion is, is, can we show that we will now have increased numbers of patients, who can do well with every 12-week dosing or every 16-week dosing? So, that\u2019s the major goal of testing the higher dose.\nLeonard Schleifer : Yes. And as George was saying that, you\u2019re trying to extend the action, but, if you look at an interval where in some patients, let\u2019s say, you take them at an every eight weekend, but, there is still some people who are not completely dry, because the drug probably isn\u2019t lasting the full eight weeks even. And so, you might see more drying as a manifestation of the longer action. So there is couple of ways to slice, but, surely, you\u2019re looking to put more drugs and having it last longer.\nMohit Bansal : Got it. Super helpful. Thank you.\nJustin Holko : Next question please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Yaron Werber of Cowen. Your line is now open.\nYaron Werber : Great. Marion, maybe for you on asthma. Can you give us a sense of what\u2019s the share now for Dupi in asthma? And we understand that some physicians for Centerra has been very aggressive on pricing. What can you do to offset some of that growth into Centerra? Thank you.\nMarion McCourt : Sure. Happy to take your question. First, I\u2019ll say, we are very pleased with the performance of Dupixent, both in terms of initiations and total scrips. We haven\u2019t given details of share by indications. So I\u2019ll stay away from that specificity today. But, as you can see from our total performance and the data shared, we certainly are performing very, very well in the asthma marketplace. I am not going to comment on other company\u2019s pricing strategies, but what I can say is, when we look at the data comparing Dupixent uptake either initiations or total scrips, it compares very favorably to the IL-5s and we know that this is a result of the clinical profile, the safety profile and the value that not only pulmonologists, but also allergists are seeing in Dupixent for asthma. And as you know with allergists also treating patients with concomitant diseases.\nJustin Holko : Next question please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Kennen MacKay of RBC Markets. Your line is now open.\nKennen MacKay : Hi, thanks for taking the question. One on Dupixent maybe also for Marion. It seems like Dupi is growing much faster in asthma than in AD. But, it just seems like that because derm has such a larger sales basis. So, Marion, just wondering if you can frame what percent of Dupixent\u2019s quarter-over-quarter growth is coming from asthma versus derm? Thank you.\nMarion McCourt : Sure. So let me talk about the total indications that I can share with you is that, the dermatology, atopic dermatitis business in Dupixent is about 75%, about 25% in respiratory disease both asthma and nasal polyps, asthma, of course, being the larger of the two in respiratory disease. Both are growing very, very strongly.  And remember that we launched in atopic dermatitis several years before we did in the asthma marketplace. Both are growing very, very strongly and certainly, as we look at the future potential for Dupixent in atopic dermatitis, we have a long way to go. There is still tremendous unmet need across all age groups, the youngest patients, adolescents and adults. And then, the asthma marketplace as well, it\u2019s important to note that today, about 75% of the patients in asthma going on Dupixent are biologic-naive. So, we\u2019re getting these new starts. There is tremendous opportunity and Dupixent has been one of the growers of the overall asthma biologics marketplace.  As mentioned the - in response to the earlier question, we look forward to - with an FDA approval to launch in pediatrics later this year, but, among adults and adolescents, there\u2019s still tremendous opportunity in asthma as well. Both are growth engines for the product.  And this is without even the many indications I look forward to launching in the future related to type 2 disease like eosinophilic esophagitis and some of the other areas in allergy that George mentioned in his update today.\nJustin Holko : Mary, we have time for two more questions. We are going to try to squeeze them in quickly.\nOperator: Sure. Next question comes from Brian Skorney of Baird. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you for taking our question. This is  dialing in for Brian Skorney. Our question is based on your partnership with Intellia. I see that we are anticipating the first in vivo CRISPR data pretty soon and we\u2019ve seen good success here with the ex-vivo approach. Maybe, you can share your thoughts on in vivo approach and how we should think about it in terms of looking at the safety of this approach, not just for the ATTR indications, but more broadly for the proof-of-concept for the street? Thank you.\nLeonard Schleifer : George, do you want take that?\nGeorge Yancopoulos : Yes, I think that is the most important aspect of this for us is, this is a platform. And as we\u2019ve said, we have multiple targets that might be amenable to this platform that we\u2019ve already identified through our Regeneron Genetic Center. And so, of great interest will be does it work and what will be the safety and the tolerability profile? So, we think that this will be a platform determining sort of a result, depending on how it turns out.\nJustin Holko : Thanks, George. We have time for one more question.\nOperator: Next question comes from Carter Gould of Barclays. Your line is now open.\nCarter Gould : Great. Congratulations on the quarter and thanks for all the progress in tackling COVID and for taking the question. As you think \u2013 how should we think about - how do you think about appropriate REGEN-COV2 production in an increasingly sort of post-vaccination world and any read into how countries and healthcare systems are approaching supply and stockpiling?  And I guess, in answering that question, can you just clarify kind of where you and Roche stand in terms of capacity given the efficacy of lower doses and continued improvements in efficiency and scale? Thank you.\nJustin Holko : Len, do you want to take that?\nLeonard Schleifer : I don\u2019t think we are really in a position. It\u2019s better for Roche to comment on how the market is developing outside of the United States. But, I do know that they are working on a lot of different discussions with a lot of different jurisdictions. And there is, as we speak now, adequate supply. But, obviously, the pandemic changes pretty quickly. So, I think Roche is probably going to be better positioned to answer that, unless Justin has anything more specific for you.\nJustin Holko : No, that\u2019s it. Well, thank you for everyone joining the call today. We still have several callers in the queue that we didn\u2019t get to; we apologize for that. We will follow up with you after the call. Thanks to everyone for dialing in. Be safe and have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference call. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

            "name": "Marion McCourt",
            "content": "Thank you, George. We are off to an exciting start in 2021. Our expanded commercial portfolio includes three recent product and indication launches and we continue to grow our largest brands, EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo based on competitive and differentiated profiles.  Beginning with EYLEA, first quarter global net sales grew 17% year-over-year to nearly $2.2 billion. In the U.S., EYLEA net sales grew 15% year-over-year to $1.35 billion based on increased demand and a favorable comparison to the early weeks of the pandemic in the first quarter of 2020. EYLEA is capturing category growth and continues to be the preferred treatment option.  In the branded anti VEGF category, EYLEA has approximately 75% share and is approaching 50% of the combined branded and unbranded category. EYLEA is differentiated by the combination of its efficacy, safety, dosing flexibility in range of indications. In addition, physicians have considerable real-world experience with more than 40 million injections administered worldwide.  Across the broader category, demand continues to improve in 2021 as patient flow normalizes and new patient volume grows, we are confident in our near and longer-term outlook based on favorable patient demographics, physician preference for EYLIA, growth opportunities in diabetic eye disease and future opportunities with our high dose clinical program.  Turning to Libtayo, first quarter global net sales grew to $101 million with U.S. net sales of $69 million. The vast majority of first quarter sales were in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma where Libtayo is the number one systemic treatment. We are excited by the recent approvals in non-small cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma or BCC, both of which represent meaningful growth opportunities for Libtayo.  In April, we deployed our expanded and highly experienced sales force across these indications to extend our Libtayo promotional impact.  In lung cancer, we have heard from oncologists that Libtayo is highly competitive based on the strength of our compelling clinical data and overall value proposition. Early launch indicators are encouraging with uptick evidence at top academic and community-based practices. We are advancing formulary placements, securing favorable peer coverage decisions and growing overall market awareness. Importantly, Libtayo was rapidly included in the NCCN guidelines with a Category 1 preferred rating.  The NCCN guidelines have also been updated to include Libtayo in BCC as the category to a option, Libtayo is the only anti-PD1 approved in advanced disease for this indication. Early feedback has been encouraging as physicians are eager to prescribe Libtayo based on its efficacy and tolerability.  Hedgehog inhibitors despite being used in its first-line treatment may not be suitable for patients for long-term or routine use. Libtayo is an important new care alternative for BCC patients.  In summary, our lung and BCC launches are progressing according to plan and we are highly focused on ensuring that appropriate patients benefit from Libtayo.  Turning now to EVKEEZA, which has also proved in the first quarter of 2021 and is in the initial launch phase. EVKEEZA represents a novel and effective treatment for patients with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia and is recognized by treating specialists as an improvement over the current standard-of-care. Patient demand is steadily building with multiple patients already initiated on therapy.  Moving to Dupixent, global net sales in the first quarter were $1.26 billion, representing 48% growth compared to the prior year. In the U.S., broad based growth across all the proved indications generated net sales of $962 million with new patient starts now higher than pre-COVID levels.  In atopic dermatitis, Dupixent's largest indication prescribing continues to be strong across the moderate and severe disease and across age groups following our adolescent and pediatric launches. There is significant for continued growth based on remaining unmet need among eligible patients. Dupixent is the number one dermatologist prescribed biologic based on the depth and breadth of its long-term efficacy and safety profile.  Turning to asthma, where we are actively preparing to launch in pediatric patients as young as six years of age later this year. Among adolescents and adults, we continue to meaningfully expand the number of Dupixent patients initiations driven by our extensive provider and patient educational efforts.  In addition, demand is strong among E&Ts and allergists for patients with nasal polyps. Dupixent is the fastest-growing biologic and respiratory disease in our approved indications with substantial room for growth.  I'd also like to highlight efforts supporting our antibody cocktail REGEN-COV. In the first quarter, we recorded U.S. net sales of $262 million under the first contract with U.S. government. REGEN-COV is currently authorized under an EUA in patients based on age and risk factors which represent close to 40% of all adults diagnosed with COVID-19.  We are focused on reducing bottlenecks and increasing utilization, particularly in states with high infection rates. Efforts include, direct support to key facilities, medical education for REGEN-COV, partnering with third-party stakeholders and educating consumers on the availability of antibody treatments.  As George mentioned, we are preparing for a potential update of the REGEN-COV EUA to include prevention as we hope to be able to address an unmet need for millions of patients who may be candidates for ongoing preventative treatment. Preventative care may also be important for those who have known COVID exposure and requires very rapid protection.  In summary, we delivered robust performance across our portfolio in the first quarter of the year. There is strong positive momentum from our inline business, encouraging early signals from our recent launches and substantial opportunity for continued diversified growth.  Now I'll turn the call over to Bob. Sure. So, I am having to start off, first, let me say that we are seeing tremendous experience with Dupixent in the marketplace today. And this obviously is a cost indications including atopic dermatitis. And also very importantly, across age categories which demonstrate not only the efficacy, the speed of action, the safety, the tolerability, we pay really close attention to competitors coming into the marketplace.  And certainly in the case of these JAK inhibitors we are well aware of the multiple delays, also recent clinical data that is calling into question issues of safety, especially at the higher doses, but even at the lower doses and the continuation of Blackrock's warnings, we hear from our key opinion leaders who use Dupixent and see it as their main stay of therapy currently and going forward with great confidence in the safety profile.  This is a chronic therapy and certainly the risk of hematologic effects, malignancies, infection and so on are just not something that is tolerable for these patients when they have a tremendous alternative. So I think we feel very confident in our competitive profile going forward. And also remind that Dupixent, obviously, based on its mode of action, has great efficacy across Type 2 disease and other indications. Patients do sometimes have concomitant conditions. So, on balance, we'll stay very close to this and to our key opinion leaders and specialists who are very, very confident in the profile of Dupixent. Yes, I just - just going to add real quickly, this is Marion, on that question, I just wanted to share as well that, in the market experience, we do and obviously look at this very carefully to market research and have a very high level of satisfaction with Dupixent for patients with atopic dermatitis. So I just want to make sure that there is not an impression left that there lot of patients necessarily looking for something more who are treated with Dupixent for atopic dermatitis. Sure. So, let me say, first of all, obviously, the product you mentioned is not approved and still at the stage where the clinical data is being reviewed. As I mentioned to some of you who were on the last call, as we look at the clinical profile today of faricimab, we do not see a threat to EYLEA.  Certainly, some of the recent data had some questions on clinical profile and certainly with an increase in IOIO rate, question on the safety profile. I think the net conclusion on the key opinion leaders that I spoke to in retinal community was that they didn't see an obvious benefit to the product and perhaps even questions in matching the safety, durability, and clinical profile of EYLEA across indications. I'll mention that certainly with EYLEA, when an important attribute is the ability to treat and extend therapy and there is some elements of that clinical trial designed to constrain EYLEA's dosing interval, we actually hear on a regular basis that one of the reasons why EYLEA is performing so well in the first quarter of 2021 and frankly performed so well last year is because of its efficacy and the ability to treat and extend for patients.

            "content": "Thank you, Justin, and thank you to everyone joining today's call. We were off to a strong start in 2021, again delivering double-digit growth on the top and bottom lines. I am immensely proud of all that Regeneron continues to accomplish in the fight against COVID and for patients suffering from a variety of diseases. Go ahead, Marion. Yes, I would just add two points that, one is the safety will be particularly concerning, I think for the long-term treatment of children. And so, I think, as the safety profile that Dupixent has shown is really, frankly \u2013 it's almost unparallel in terms of what you can do with the ageing on the efficacy side and not have any significant concerns on the safety side.  The other point in terms of the penetration, even if you look at how these markets have evolved, when more agents have come on for rheumatoid arthritis and for psoriasis, the penetration is so low here that, even with competition there is room for market growth rather than direct fighting it out in terms of a fixed amount of market share.  So, we expect our profile, safety as Marion says to be really firm on treating physicians' minds and we do think the low level of penetration thus far does leave room for growth nonetheless. Well, George, you might want to comment if we have any interest in that, but in terms of the commercial side of this, when you talk to patients, the kind of patients we are treating moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, they have lesions over large fraction of their body.  I can remember exactly what it was in our trials, what we are seeing out there commercially is large fractions of their body are affected by this disease. And so, I think that adding topical perhaps, but people actually trying to get away from \u2013 trying to get away from having to lather up over their entire body.  The other thing about Dupixent that we can never forget is that, the broad aspects of approvals across lots of allergic diseases and with the growing number, it's very important because these diseases do tend to run in groups. There are many people who have asthma and atopic dermatitis or asthma and nasal polyposis or atopic dermatitis and other allergic diseases which we are studying. So, I think that our broad profile across lots of other diseases is also going to give us a very strong competitive position. Right. Thanks for that question, Cory. We've been active discussions and productive discussions with the FDA. Obviously, one never knows what they are going to do exactly and when they are going to do it. But we anticipate an action by the FDA over the next \u2013 sometime in the next several weeks in terms of the lower 1.2 gram dose.  I think from there, they will turn their attention to the prevention data which they have in front of them as well as the subcu data, as well as the chronic prevention opportunities. So, I can assure you the FDA has been working really hard. We are in constant contact with them answering questions, going over things and as I said, we expect something to \u2013 anticipated decisions sometime in the next several weeks. And Cory, I am sorry, of course, we are continuing to supply the market and there is no shortage of product out there in terms of people needing to be treated now can be treated with the 2.4 gram dose and there is ample product available. Bob? Yes. I think that the lifecycle management continues to beat from more data that kind of data that we generated in diabetic retinopathy with the PANORAMA and Protocol W, which George reviewed, I think are very important results. And so, I think that will drive more treatment in that area. In terms of the high dose, I think you heard from George, that we'll get some of the preliminary Phase 2 data later this year. And then, for next entrants, we have readying for the clinic a newer version, if you will, which we will unveil for you when we get that into the clinic. Yes. And as George was saying that, you're trying to extend the action, but, if you look at an interval where in some patients, let's say, you take them at an every eight weekend, but, there is still some people who are not completely dry, because the drug probably isn't lasting the full eight weeks even. And so, you might see more drying as a manifestation of the longer action. So there is couple of ways to slice, but, surely, you're looking to put more drugs and having it last longer. George, do you want take that? I don't think we are really in a position. It's better for Roche to comment on how the market is developing outside of the United States. But, I do know that they are working on a lot of different discussions with a lot of different jurisdictions. And there is, as we speak now, adequate supply. But, obviously, the pandemic changes pretty quickly. So, I think Roche is probably going to be better positioned to answer that, unless Justin has anything more specific for you."

            "content": "Thanks, Marion. And good morning and afternoon to everyone listening to the call. My comments today on financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. As Len stated, Regeneron is off to a strong start in 2021 as we continue to execute across the business delivering double-digit top and bottom line growth in the first quarter.  For the first quarter, total revenues grew 38% year-over-year to $2.5 billion, driven by growth in global EYLEA sales; increased Sanofi collaboration profitability driven by Dupixent and sales of our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail. Diluted net income per share grew 50% year-over-year to $9.89 on net income of $1.1 billion. Excluding revenues related to REGEN-COV, Regeneron achieved 20% total revenue growth versus the prior year. As you've heard from Marion, we completed our initial contract to supply REGEN-COV to the U.S. government in the first quarter assuming that we secure an updated EUA for the 1.2 gram treatment dose we expect to deliver at least 1 million of REGEN-COV at $2100 per dose for our follow-on contract with the U.S. government in the second quarter.  I will now move to collaboration revenues, which were $754 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $528 million in the first quarter of 2020. Starting with the Bayer collaboration, Ex-US EYLEA net product sales reported to us by Bayer were $824 million for the first quarter of 2021, representing growth of 21% on a reported basis and 12% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $323 million, of which we recorded $309 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $365 million in the first quarter. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and Kevzara was $261 million, which compares favorably to profits of $171 million in the prior year driven by Dupixent. We recorded initial Roche collaboration revenues of $67 million for our share of gross profits from the distribution of the antibody cocktail by Roche outside of the U.S.  Other revenue to $50 million in the first quarter, compared to $63 million in the prior year. In 2021, we expect this line to be less than half of what we recorded in 2020 due to lower border reimbursements with the EBOLA and COVID-19 programs.  Moving on to our operating expenses, and starting with R&D. R&D increased 28% year-over-year to $673 million, primarily due to continued clinical development costs for our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail.  Next, SG&A expense increased 16% year-over-year to $355 million. The year-over-year increase was driven by commercial investments for Libtayo, cost related to the roll out of REGEN-COV and higher employee-related expenses.  Cost of goods sold increased versus the prior year from $70 million to $173 million due to REGEN-COV manufacturing costs and Praluent manufacturing cost in the in the U.S. which were recorded by Sanofi in the first quarter of 2020.  Additionally, in other operating income and expense, we recorded $4 million expense, compared to $25 million of income in the prior year. This is driven by interest expense related to our $2 billion debt issuance in August 2020 and lower investment returns on our existing cash and marketable securities.  Finally, the effective tax rate was 10.5% in the first quarter of 2021. Included in this rate is the benefit achieved by a reduction in uncertain tax position liabilities related to the IRS audits of the 2015 and 2016 tax years.  Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the first quarter of 2021, Regeneron generated $553 million in free cash flow and ended the quarter with net cash and marketable securities of $5.1 billion. In the first quarter, we utilized $323 million of our $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization and we remain opportunistic buyers in the market.  I would now like to provide select updates to our 2021 guidance. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release published earlier this morning. We are updating full year 2021 guidance for COCM to be in the range of $660 million to $730 million, the lower guidance range is related to the timing of contract manufacturing of Praluent for Sanofi. We are also updating guidance for our 2021 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 13% to 15%. The increase from prior guidance is driven by higher forecasted delivery of REGEN-COV under our second U.S. government contract, which is passed at the U.S. statutory rate.  In Regeneron is off to a strong start in 2021 and continues to execute across all aspects of the business. We are well positioned for the remainder of 2021 and continue to make those investments necessary to ensure long-term growth.  With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Justin. Yes, I mean, I'll talk about the tax rate. I mean, certainly there is a lot to be played out with regards to what's going to happen on the tax rate. You heard what I said, we are obviously moving well within our full year guidance. We did have favorable outcome with regards uncertain tax positions that we are able to reverse, which kind of drove a little lower in the quarter on that front.  On operating margins, Geoff, you know, I guess, the one piece that's not so transparent everybody is, we are still incurring a lot of R&D as it pertains to REGEN-COV with regards to the trials, the enrollment numbers. So, I don't want people to come our way and say, you know, as a result of the Roche benefit we got in the REGEN-COV product sales that without that the margins would have been as good.  But we did incur a lot of expenses pertaining to that that are within the R&D line that we just don't specifically talk about. The business on its own, excluding REGEN-COV it was 20% top-line and 35% EBI, okay? So, again, it shows you the underlying strength as you've heard from Len at the very beginning of his words in terms of how we are performing.  We think the operating margin is \u2013 continue to stay at that and improve at that level. I mean, certainly, it's the leverage on Dupixent, right? To the extent you saw that Sanofi did a terrific job ex U.S. where we are starting to get a little momentum in terms of ex U.S. sales. So, to the extent that that will continue to play out, we'll continue to get good operating margins associated with that and then that will drive our overall margins. Thanks, Geoff. Sure. Our cash balance on a net cash basis sitting at $5.1 billion and we are roughly at $7 billion on a gross basis. And again, we like the flexibility that it affords us. I always need to make sure that internally, we have enough to obviously support the internal R&D of which we continue to go after different modalities and that's kind of tied into our second leg of the stool where we don't have kind of in-house capability on everything.  It's great that we have the capability for George and the BT team to go out and get other technologies whether it be the Intellia-driven technology on CRISPR or Alnylam and alike. And we are continuing to play heavy in that space and we need to make sure that things we go after are most likely going to be early-stage.  We are not looking for kind of transformative kind of M&A deals on that front as of right now and we continue to stay hungry in that place with the right opportunities. And then as you saw, we did $325 million share buybacks. We have a $1.5 billion program that we authorized in January.  We are opportunistic buyers and we think the intrinsic value of where we see it compared to where the market is currently playing we are going to take advantage of that delta and we did such that in the first quarter and we are continuing to do that on that front. And that continues to be an active play for us."

            "content": "Thank you, Len. With the COVID-19 still in the headlines, I will start with our monoclonal antibody treatment, the REGEN-COV cocktail. We recently reported data from the large Phase 3 outcomes trial in the outpatient setting confirming that REGEN-COV reduced the risk of hospitalization and death by 70% with both the 2.4 gram and the lower 1.2 gram doses.  We are pleased that based on these data, the NIH guidelines were updated in early April to include a strong recommendation for monoclonal antibody combinations to treat outpatients with mild or moderate COVID-19 as defined by the EUA criteria. We have also recently reported data from a large two-part Phase 3 trial of REGEN-COV with Part A in the preventative setting and Part B in the recently infected patients. Yes, I think that basically a higher dose will simply - the notion is extend the duration of action. That would be the primary thing that we are looking at. So, obviously, it allows for longer duration of action because, you will go longer until you achieve the minimally effective dose. So, the notion is, is, can we show that we will now have increased numbers of patients, who can do well with every 12-week dosing or every 16-week dosing? So, that's the major goal of testing the higher dose. Yes, I think that is the most important aspect of this for us is, this is a platform. And as we've said, we have multiple targets that might be amenable to this platform that we've already identified through our Regeneron Genetic Center. And so, of great interest will be does it work and what will be the safety and the tolerability profile? So, we think that this will be a platform determining sort of a result, depending on how it turns out."

With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Len Schleifer. Len?\nLeonard Schleifer: Good morning to everybody and for those of you experiencing the optic freeze, I hope you are staying warm. Our strong fourth quarter performance kept remarkable year of Regeneron, highlighted by significant achievements that better position the company to deliver sustainable growth and shareholder value. Fourth quarter 2022 revenue increased 14% compared to the prior year when excluding the impact of contributions from REGEN-COV and Ronapreve underscoring the commercial strength and increasing diversity of our business. We also made several important advances across our pipeline during the quarter, notably the submission of a Biologic License Application for aflibercept 8 milligrams in neovascular age-related macular degeneration or wet AMD as well as diabetic macular edema, or DME, positioning us for a potential U.S. launch in late August of this year. Additionally, we received FDA approval for Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy as a first line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer, making Libtayo only the second PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody approved in this setting, regardless of the patient\u2019s histology or PD-L1 expressions level. We also presented data from our rapidly advancing oncology pipeline, including fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody in combination with Libtayo in advanced non-small cell lung cancer, odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific in B-cell lymphomas and linvoseltamab, our BCMA x CD3 bispecific in multiple myeloma. Finally, Dupixent was approved for prurigo nodularis in Europe. Briefly reflecting on 2022, we ended the year with three strategic imperatives that we felt we had to accomplish in order to position the company for long-term growth. First, we had to fortify the medium and long-term outlook for our retinal franchise. Based on the positive results that we reported in September 2022, we believe aflibercept 8 milligrams has the potential to change the treatment paradigm for patients with wet AMD and DME by becoming the new standard of care for these patients, positioning Regeneron for prolonged leadership in this category. Second, we needed to maintain and grow DUPIXENT leadership across a variety of Type 2 allergic diseases. 2022 turned out to be a phenomenal year with Dupixent global net product sales approaching $8.7 billion and growing 44% at constant currency. Despite new competition, Dupixent maintained a leading market position in atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyps and was also approved in new indications, geographies and younger populations, which George will detail shortly. Collectively, these 2022 approvals meaningfully expanded the Dupixent commercial opportunity, allowing the addressable population to increase by approximately 225,000 patients, bringing the total addressable population to over 7 million patients globally. And third, we wanted to make significant progress towards becoming a leader in immunooncology and 2022 turned out to be a crucial year. Key to this long-term goal was requiring Sanofi\u2019s share of global rights to Libtayo, an antibody discovered by Regeneron, which was a necessary step towards realizing the full clinical and commercial potential of this foundational therapy. It also enables us to unlock combination opportunities from promising candidates in our oncology pipeline, including with our LAG-3 antibody, our costimulatory bispecifics and our CD3 bispecifics. Looking ahead, we expect 2023 to be another notable year with significant incremental progress across these imperatives as well as in other areas of our business. We are preparing for a potential U.S. launch for aflibercept 8 milligrams in late August given prescribers decade plus experience with EYLEA. And now with the 48-week data for aflibercept 8 milligrams, which demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety to EYLEA, but with longer treatment intervals, we believe that over time there is an opportunity for aflibercept 8 milligrams to become the new standard of care for wet AMD and DME. We expect Dupixent to continue to strengthen its leadership position across approved Type 2 allergic diseases based on its differentiated mechanism of blocking both interleukin-4 and interleukin-13. In 2023, we have an opportunity to reach even more patients with potential regulatory approvals in new diseases, geographies and younger populations that could add another approximately 500,000 patients globally to the biologic eligible population. Additionally, we look forward to the upcoming readout of our first Phase 3 study of Dupixent in COPD in the first half of this year. In oncology, we expect to continue rapidly advancing our pipeline. For our LAG-3 combination with Libtayo, we are moving forward with expansion beyond melanoma to include lung cancer and potentially other solid tumors. For our costimulatory bispecifics, in combination with Libtayo, we are continuing dose expansion in our Phase 1/2 PSMAxCD28 program in advanced prostate cancer. We also expect to report additional Phase 1 data from our EGFRxCD28 program in solid tumors and to present initial clinical data for our MUC16xCD28 program in recurrent ovarian cancer. And within Heme-Onc, we anticipate second half regulatory submissions for odronextamab in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma as well as limvolseltumab in refractory multiple myeloma. In 2023, we also plan to rapidly move forward with clinical development of our next-generation COVID-19 antibody, which we believe could help protect the millions of vulnerable patients who were unable to map a sufficient immune response from vaccination and treat those who require other alternatives. Activities enabling clinical manufacturing have commenced and we expect to enter clinical development later this year. In closing, 2022 was a pivotal year at Regeneron and we expect to continue making significant progress in 2023. Our strategy remains focused on investing in our internal R&D capabilities which has historically generated a high rate of return. We remain confident in our near and long-term growth prospects with approximately 35 pipeline candidates currently progressing through clinical trials. We will also continue looking for opportunities to complement these internal efforts by exploring potential collaborations. With our commercial capabilities continue to drive revenue growth and our strong financial position, Regeneron is extremely well positioned to continue delivering breakthroughs for patients and value to shareholders. Now, I will turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Thanks, Len. I would like to briefly walk you through our pipeline\u2019s progress in 2022 and touch upon what lies ahead in 2023. In ophthalmology, we presented pivotal \u2013 positive pivotal results for aflibercept 8 milligram in wet AMD and DME. These trials showed that aflibercept 8 milligram extended dosing intervals to every 12 or even 16 weeks for the vast majority of patients through 48 weeks without compromising the visual improvement or safety seen with EYLEA. These are truly unprecedented and potentially game-changing results who have not \u2013 which have not been achieved using any other anti-VEGF agents. Moving to Dupixent, in 2022, Dupixent became the only biologic approved in atopic dermatitis, for infants as young as 6 months of age, the first treatment for prurigo nodularis and the first treatment in the United States for eosinophilic esophagitis. And just this week, we obtained the European Commission approval for eosinophilic esophagitis as well. In addition, we submitted a supplemental BLA for chronic spontaneous urticaria and shared positive Phase 3 data in children with the eosinophilic esophagitis. Dupixent is now approved in 5 related Type 2 allergic conditions. And our data shows that these diseases are mediated by IL-4 and IL-13 driven Type 2 inflammation. Because many patients suffer from systemic Type 2 inflammation, they often suffer from several of these diseases concurrently. And thus, Dupixent has the potential to holistically address these patients multiple Type 2 conditions for which Dupixent is approved. While many other immunomodulators are associated with worrisome immunosuppression and carry boxed warnings, Dupixent\u2019s safety profile supports its approval in infants. In 2023, we are looking forward to the initial results of BOREAS, the first Dupixent Phase 3 study in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. Our Dupixent COPD Phase 3 studies have enrolled patients with elevated blood eosinophils aiming to select for patients with COPD driven by Type 2 inflammation. The BOREAS study passed an interim futility analysis in 2020, an encouraging event, which triggered the start of the replicate Phase 3 NOTUS study. We are looking forward to the readout of BOREAS with the primary endpoint of annualized rate of acute, moderate and severe COPD exacerbations expected in the first half of \u201823. Moving on to oncology, 2022 was an important year for our oncology programs. Libtayo was approved by the FDA in combination with chemotherapy in first-line non-small cell lung cancer, irrespective of histology or PD-L1 expression levels, an achievement met by only one other PD-1 or PD-L1 targeting agent. Libtayo is also emerging as an essential backbone of our oncology pipeline as several programs in combination with Libtayo are starting to yield encouraging data. First, I will discuss our LAG-3 antibody, fianlimab in combination with Libtayo, where we have recently shown positive data from a second confirmatory cohort of PD-1 naive metastatic melanoma patients and reported encouraging results from a smaller dataset in non-small-cell lung cancer patients. These initial results suggest that the fianlimab Libtayo combination has a potentially best-in-class profile in melanoma. And we are advancing broad pivotal programs in both melanoma and lung cancer. Phase 3 studies in metastatic melanoma and adjuvant melanoma are already enrolling and we have plans to soon initiate another Phase 3 study in perioperative melanoma as well as Phase 2/3 studies in first-line advanced as well as perioperative non-small cell lung cancer. Other notable Libtayo combination used from this year was the early but very encouraging data with our PSMA by CD28 costimulatory bispecific in advanced metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, a tumor type considered immunologically cold with multiple recent Phase 3 failures demonstrating that prostate cancer is largely unresponsive to anti-PD-1 therapy in other end as well as in other types of chemo combination. In our proof-of-concept study of our PSMA by CD28 costimulatory bispecific, we observed first evidence that combining this new class of bispecifics with anti-PD-1 can confer profound responsiveness to tumors previously thought to be cold and unresponsive to anti-PD-1 therapy with 3 out of the 4 patients treated at the highest dose levels showing greater than 90% reductions within 6 weeks of initiating combination therapy in the prostate cancer biomarker PSA. Following up on these early but exciting results, we are continuing to enroll patients in this study and we are planning to present additional data at medical meetings in 2023. We also presented our first clinical data for a CD3 bispecific in a solid tumor for ubamatamab, our MUC16xCD3 bispecific in development for advanced ovarian cancer. As a single agent in a Phase 1 dose escalation study in heavily pretreated recurrent ovarian cancer patients, we observed a 4% overall response rate with a 31% response rates in a small subset of patients with high MUC16 expressing tumors. We expect initial dose escalation data later this year for ubamatamab with Libtayo as well as for our MUC16xCD28 costimulatory bispecific with Libtayo in advanced ovarian cancer. We also expect updated clinical data for our EGFRxCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with Libtayo in various solid tumors later this year. Moving on to our hematology oncology pipeline, at the American Society of Hematology, or ASH Annual Meeting, we presented new data from odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific as well as linvoseltamab our BCMAxCD3 bispecific. For odronextamab, we presented pivotal Phase 2 ELM-2 data. Odronextamab in third or later line relapsed or recurrent follicular lymphoma has a potential best-in-class efficacy profile with 82% of patients responding and 92% of these responders achieving a complete response with encouraging durability. Our optimized step-up dosing regimen has improved odronextamab\u2019s safety profile while retaining efficacy similar to the prior dosing regimen. In third or later \u2013 in relapse or recurrent diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, odronextamab demonstrated efficacy regardless of prior CAR-T experience and a safety profile generally similar to that seen in follicular lymphoma. We are planning regulatory submissions in the second half of 2023 for both indications, which we hope will support potential accelerated approvals. In 2023, we anticipate initiating several Phase 3 studies in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, including in earlier lines of therapy. These trials will serve as confirmatory studies which could potentially support conversion to full approval. We also expect to initiate a proof-of-concept study of our CD22xCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with odronextamab in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which we hope could further add to the anticancer benefit for these patients. For linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody we presented efficacy and safety data from our pivotal Phase 2 study in third or later line multiple myeloma at ASH. Early, deep and durable responses were observed in patients with high disease burden and these responses may improve with longer follow-up. In 2023, we plan to initiate a confirmatory Phase 3 study of linvoseltamab in second line multiple myeloma and are on track for a BLA submission in the second half of the year. As with odronextamab, we plan to initiate combination studies for linvoseltamab with costimulatory bispecifics in the near future. I\u2019d also like to update some additional clinical programs. Our antibody blocking Factor XI for anticoagulation and our antibody that activates the NPR1 receptor for heart failure are both completing proof of mechanism trials. Moving on to Regeneron Genetics Medicine, regarding our collaboration with Alnylam and siRNA Therapeutics, we are planning a broad and multi-pronged approach to develop treatments for NASH, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. We are initiating a Phase 2 study of ALN-HSD and NASH patients with genetic risk factors. We also dosed first subjects in the first-in-human study of another siRNA medicine in development for NASH, ALN-PNP, which targets a different gene and can be potentially combined with ALN-HSD in appropriate patients. We have discovered additional NASH targets, which we have validated using our Regeneron Genetics Center, including side B, which will potentially be the next NASH therapeutic candidate to enter the clinic. With regard to our collaboration with Alnylam for central nervous system targets, our initial dose escalation study is ongoing. Our collaboration with Intellia and CRISPR-based therapeutics, this is expected to progress further in 2023, building on continuing data readouts from the Phase 1 study of NTLA-2001 in transthyretin amyloidosis in both cardiomyopathy and neuropathy patients, which provided the first demonstration in humans that CRISPR-based technologies can deliver up to 90% reduction of the pathological gene product for over a year. Regarding our gene therapy efforts, our collaborators at Decibel Therapeutics recently announced that a clinical trial has been authorized by both the U.S. FDA and the UK MHRA for DB-OTO, a virally delivered gene therapy designed to restore hearing to individuals with otoferlin-related hearing loss. A Phase 1/2 study in patients 2 years of age and younger is expected to initiate in the first half of 2023 with initial data from the first cohort of patients anticipated in the first quarter of 2024. I\u2019d like to conclude with our next-generation COVID-19 efforts. As we recently announced, we have identified a potent broadly neutralizing COVID-19 antibody, which, unlike other neutralizing antibodies find outside of the so-called receptor binding domain, or RBD, of the spike protein. This antibody retains activity against all the viral variants seen throughout the pandemic because it binds to an atop that has remained highly conserved, greater than 99.9% across all known variants. The vast majority of antiviral antibodies generated as a result of vaccination or due to natural infection target the RBD domain, which results in overwhelming selective pressure driving the emergence of these resistant variants. We hope that by targeting this unique and conservative to outside of the RBD this antibody will also retain its activity in the face of future variance. We plan to initiate clinical trials to test this antibody this year, and we are looking to develop it in both treatment and prophylactic setting. In conclusion, Regeneron\u2019s R&D engine continues its productivity, including the early-stage pipeline. Just in the first weeks of this year, we have initiated clinical studies for two new drug candidates and we anticipate clinical trials starting or IND submission for up to 10 new therapeutic candidates this year as well as for additional indications for candidates that are already in the clinic. So with that, I will turn it over to Marion.\nMarion McCourt: Thanks, George. The fourth quarter capped off a strong year of execution and growth, delivering results across our commercial portfolio. We expanded into new indications, which, coupled with our existing business, is expected to drive meaningful growth in 2023 and beyond. We look forward to several important potential approvals and subsequent launches this year, providing additional opportunities for growth. Starting with EYLEA, where we announced in January, fourth quarter U.S. net sales of $1.5 billion, full year 2022 net sales were $6.3 billion, representing 8% year-over-year growth and outpacing total growth of the anti-VEGF category for the year. At the end of the fourth quarter, EYLEA category share was approaching previous levels of approximately 50% of injections. This followed the short-term shift earlier in the quarter where EYLEA was negatively impacted by a temporary increase in use of off-label compounded Avastin. During this time, there was a short-term closure of a not-for-profit patient co-pay assistance fund, which reopened later in the quarter. We believe we have substantially recovered from the issue encountered in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect competitive pressures but remain confident in Regeneron\u2019s overall retinal franchise as we look forward to our potential upcoming aflibercept 8-milligram launch. In summary, our retinal franchise leads the anti-VEGF category with EYLEA as the current standard of care and aflibercept 8-milligram, if approved, offering a differentiated clinical profile that can potentially shift the treatment paradigm. Turning to Libtayo. Total fourth quarter global net sales were $169 million, growing 44% on a constant currency basis. In the U.S., net sales grew 36% to $110 million with contributions across all indications. In advanced non-melanoma skin cancers, we continue to build our leadership position in the PD-1 class. In lung cancer, Libtayo continues to see steady growth in utilization in prescribers. Customer ordering has accelerated following the chemotherapy combination approval last November. We are working to maximize launch uptake by increasing depth and breath of prescribers. Early launch indicators are positive community and academic centers have welcomed Libtayo\u2019s expanded role as an important treatment option in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. There are more than 200,000 new cases of lung cancer per year in the U.S. alone for which Libtayo is an important treatment option. Outside the U.S., Libtayo net sales grew 60% on a constant currency basis to $59 million driven by steady demand growth and additional launches as we secure access and reimbursement globally. We continue a targeted approach to extend our global commercial footprint in priority international markets. designed to maximize opportunities for Libtayo and potential future medicines. Finally, turning to DUPIXENT, where in the fourth quarter, global net sales grew 42% on a constant currency basis to $2.45 billion. In the U.S., net sales grew 44% to $1.94 billion, with strong growth continuing across atopic dermatitis, asthma, nasal polyps with additional contributions from recent launches in the eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis. DUPIXENT is well positioned to expand market penetration and drive revenue growth across established new and potential future indications in 2023 and beyond. Atopic dermatitis DUPIXENT\u2019s largest indication continues to rapidly grow across all age groups, firmly establishing DUPIXENT as the preferred systemic therapy for patients with moderate to severe disease. There continues to be rapid uptake in younger populations, further confirming DUPIXENT\u2019s differentiated efficacy and safety profile. We\u2019ve also seen meaningful early adoption in prurigo nodularis where DUPIXENT is the only FDA-approved medicine for this debilitating disease. We expect ongoing uptake of DUPIXENT as the launch progresses and physicians identify patients need. DUPIXENT continues to perform well in the highly competitive biologic asthma space with steady market share gains and strong growth in total prescriptions and new patient starts. In nasal polyps, DUPIXENT\u2019s differentiated clinical profile continues to drive uptake as the leading first-line treatment option in patients requiring systemic therapy. In the eosinophilic esophagitis, the launch is going exceptionally well finally offering physicians and their patients a treatment to effectively manage the underlying mechanism of the disease. Patients treated with DUPIXEN have experienced dramatic improvements in their symptoms and quality of life we\u2019ve seen rapid uptake across both gastroenterologists and allergists. We also continue to advance our clinical efforts in younger patients where there is also substantial unmet need. Outside the U.S., DUPIXENT net sales worth $513 million, growing 37% on a constant currency basis, driven by rapid uptake across approved indications and launches in new geographies. In Europe, DUPIXENT was approved for prurigo nodularis in December. And earlier this week, DUPIXENT was also approved for eosinophilic esophagitis. We expect these new indications to contribute to DUPIXENT\u2019s ongoing international growth. In summary, during 2022, we executed on our core focus to deliver life-changing medicines to patients. Our commercial initiatives and strategies are driving increases in market penetration for our in-line brands and optimizing the potential of new and upcoming launches. Taken together, we are confident in Regeneron\u2019s future and are well positioned to deliver long-term and sustainable growth. Now I\u2019ll turn the call to Bob.\nBob Landry: Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron\u2019s financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted. Regeneron ended 2022 with a strong fourth quarter with continued execution driving positive results across the business. Excluding contributions from REGEN-COV and Ronapreve, fourth quarter total revenues increased 14% year-over-year to $3 billion, driven by growth across our core brands. Fourth quarter diluted net income per share was $12.56 on net income of $1.4 billion. Beginning with collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. Fourth quarter 2022 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $839 million, up 7% on a constant currency basis versus fourth quarter 2021. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $355 million, of which $324 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $836 million in the fourth quarter and grew 61%, driven by DUPIXENT. Our share of profits from the commercialization of DUPIXENT and KEVZARA was $619 million, an increase of 60% versus the prior year. We also recognized a $50 million sales-based milestone in the fourth quarter of 2022 due to achievement of $2.5 billion of ex-U.S. sales of antibody collaboration products on a rolling 12-month basis. Finally, we recorded Roche collaboration revenue of $396 million in the fourth quarter for our share of gross profits from ex-U.S. sales of Ronapreve related to a previously signed contract. Moving now to our operating expenses. Fourth quarter 2022 R&D expense increased 43% year-over-year to $911 million, driven by the impact of the Libtayo transaction with Regeneron now recording all R&D expense for Libtayo and our full 50% share of antibody collaboration R&D spend for DUPIXENT and odronextamab, as well as additional costs incurred in connection with the company\u2019s late-stage pipeline and increasing clinical manufacturing activities and higher headcount-related costs. SG&A expense increased 17% year-over-year to $579 million due to higher headcount and related costs, incremental costs to fully support the global commercialization of Libtayo and higher contributions to an independent not-for-profit patient systems organization. Product gross margin in the quarter increased to 93% as compared to 86% in the prior year. The improved gross margin was driven by a favorable change in product mix and no longer having to pay Sanofi for their share of U.S. Libtayo gross profits. Finally, fourth quarter 2022 effective tax rate was 11.3% compared to 12.6% in the prior year. Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. For full year 2022, Regeneron generated $4.4 billion in free cash flow, favorably impacted by our first quarter 2022 payment from the U.S. government for sales REGEN-COV that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021. We ended 2022 with cash and marketable securities less debt of $11.6 billion. We continue to deliver on our capital allocation priorities in 2022 by deploying approximately $3.4 billion towards business development and share repurchases while continuing to fund our internal R&D efforts. In 2022, we executed approximately $1.3 billion in business development initiatives, including the acquisitions of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals in the exclusive worldwide rights to Libtayo. We also purchased approximately $2.1 billion of our shares in 2022, including $431 million in the fourth quarter. This morning, we announced a new $3 billion share repurchase authorization reflecting our continued confidence in our business and our pipeline. We remain buyers of our shares at current levels, and this new authorization enables us to continue returning capital directly to shareholders. I\u2019d like to conclude with our initial financial guidance and outlook for 2023. We expect 2023 SG&A spend to be in the range of $2.13 billion to $2.2 billion. This primarily reflects the full year impact of global Life tile commercialization expenses, the build-out of our international commercial infrastructure in select markets and higher headcount to support our growing organization. We expect our 2023 R&D expense to be in the range of $3.725 billion to $3.925 billion. As George mentioned, we have numerous strategically important development programs advancing in 2023, including late-stage studies for our fianlimab, Libtayo combination in melanoma and lung cancer in confirmatory Phase 3 studies for odronextamab, both in FL and DLBCL and linvoseltamab in myeloma. In addition, we continue to advance programs in our early pipeline across multiple therapeutic areas including with collaborators such as Alnylam and Intellia positioning us for long-term growth. This range also includes the full year impact of the Libtayo transaction, we are now recording all development expenses for Libtayo recognizing our full 50% share of development expenses for DUPIXENT in itepekimab. COCM is expected to be in the range of $720 million to $800 million, similar to 2022 reflecting the gradual phase-in of a new Regeneron developed manufacturing process for DUPIXENT that is designed to improve drug substance yields. We expect our capital expenditures in 2023 to be in the range of $825 million to $950 million. These expenditures will support the continued expansion of our manufacturing facilities, including ongoing construction of a fill/finish facility as well as the previously announced expansion of R&D facilities at our Tarrytown, New York headquarters. Finally, we anticipate 2023 gross margin to be between 90% to 92% and our effective tax rate to be in the range of 11% to 13%. In addition to our full year financial guidance, we expect higher interest income in 2023, given our greater cash balance plus higher interest rates as compared to last year, which will favorably impact other income and expense. We also expect 2023 other revenue to be slightly lower than 2022. Finally, as I said in November, we no longer expect to record any material other operating income or expense in 2023 are beyond absent a new transaction. In conclusion, Regeneron continued to deliver robust financial results in 2022, and we are well positioned to drive continued growth in 2023 and beyond. With that, I will now pass the call back to Ryan.\nRyan Crowe: Thank you, Bob. Shannon, that concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019d now like to open the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Shannon, please go ahead and poll for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nTyler Van Buren: Hey, guys. Good morning and congratulations on the results and thanks for the question. Regarding EYLEA, it would be great to hear the latest on what you are seeing in the marketplace with respect to [indiscernible]. Apparently, Roche is not seeing switches from [indiscernible] back to EYLEA despite what we are hearing from the KOLs. So any additional color there would be helpful?\nMarion McCourt: Hi, Tyler. Yes, and let me comment that certainly, EYLEA performance in the market, as I reported, continues to be very strong, a quick reminder on the year growing at 8% to $6.3 billion and certainly a very strong competitive performance. We are conscious of competition in the marketplace. But to give a bit of an update, we continue to hear that first nAb use has been modest and results, in some cases, have resulted in patients switching back to other agents, including EYLEA probably most frequently EYLEA. Certainly, we look forward to continued efforts on EYLEA this year is the standard of care. And as you know, from many of us talking to KOLs, they\u2019re incredibly enthusiastic about the launch \u2013 potential launch of aflibercept 8-milligram coming later this year.\nRyan Crowe: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nLeonard Schleifer: Matt, we don\u2019t\u2019 hear you.\nMatthew Harrison: Sorry, could you not hear me, Len?\nLeonard Schleifer: We hear you now.\nRyan Crowe: Yes, we can.\nMatthew Harrison: Okay. Alright. Sorry. So I was just wondering if you could comment on COPD and what you view as clinically meaningful in terms of result there. Other companies have reported sort of 15%. But I think in the past, you\u2019ve talked about that as not being a particularly high bar. So maybe you could just talk about how you view clinical meaning from this. Thanks.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Well, we powered our futility analysis as well as our clinical trial to deliver what we believe would be clinically meaningful benefit if the study proves positive, which we hope it will. And remember, we\u2019re going to be looking at both exist patios, but also improvement in lung function. So it will be a sort of integration of the benefit that patients can receive from both those measures. I remind you that in other settings in asthma, in particular, DUPIXENT has distinguished itself from other immunomodulators and delivering pretty substantial improvements in pulmonary lung function. So it\u2019s not only all about exacerbations, but we hope to have significant improvements in exacerbations as well as in lung functions which will hopefully provide important benefits to patients.\nRyan Crowe: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nCarter Gould: Hi, guys. Thank you very much for taking the question. You do have some APP data on the horizon here with Alnylam. I would love to kind of hear your thoughts on how you\u2019re thinking about that. And if we should be thinking about that as more just a proof of concept or as a potential product opportunity even with intrathecal delivery? And if, I guess, more of the former, how much of this is sort of a gating factor to really kind of expanding the effort here potentially dramatically across a number of CNS diseases. Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Well, as you say, the important thing about that aspect of the Alnylam collaboration is together, we were hoping for the first time to see if we could develop technology that would actually allow us to do what\u2019s been done now by Alnylam and others in the liver to bring it to other tissues, particularly to the central nervous system in this case. So this \u2013 the first study, which is focused on APP is really a proof of concept that can we get this technology to work, we view it as a potential sort of platform enabler, meaning that if we see anything here and obviously these are challenging things to be first and to do something that nobody has ever done before. And it\u2019s obviously very early in the program. But the goal is to establish proof of principle that this type of technology, which looks like it can be pretty effective in the liver, chat and work outside of the liver, particularly in the CNS. So this would be a platform enabler.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks, George. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nBrian Abrams: Hey, guys. Congrats on all the progress and thanks for taking my question. So with the potential approval coming this December, I am curious how we should be thinking about the launch cadence for high-dose aflibercept just considering some elements like the introduction of pre-filled syringe, the J-code and maybe your overall strategy and how you are thinking about converting market segments and where you are initially focused? Thanks.\nLeonard Schleifer: Give us a second. We will disconnect all the Roche people on the call, so we can get you our strategy. In all seriousness, obviously, there is a lot of thought that\u2019s going to go in between now and what we hope will be our late August approval on pricing, on rollout, on targeting, on strategy, etcetera, etcetera. But we are working on that. We have to get our label. We have to get it approved, and we will have everything else ready to go. The initial launch will be with a vial and then we hope down the road, not too far with the pre-filled syringe. Marion, I don\u2019t know if you want to give away any of the secrets at this point.\nMarion McCourt: I would just say that we have a highly experienced team in commercialization, and we certainly will be ready for the launch. And in the meantime, we are very focused on our participation in the market today with EYLEA. But certainly more to come, and we absolutely look forward to the potential launch of 8 milligrams.\nBrian Abrams: Very good.\nLeonard Schleifer: Obviously, the Vabysmo launch has not turned the market sideways on us. It\u2019s real competition. But that, I think there is a window that\u2019s sort of closing for them to compete against 2 milligrams, we hope and then 8 milligrams, we hope could become the standard of care. So, lots to look forward to later in the year.\nRyan Crowe: Certainly. Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a follow-up to Matt\u2019s question, can you just speak to what you saw in the pre-specified interim efficacy analysis of the BOREAS trial and just any additional color on the level of benefit versus placebo that triggered the initiation of the NOTUS trial? Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: All I can say is that we powered it to deliver would be a clinically significant improvement. There was a combination of measures of exacerbations and lung function improvement, and we haven\u2019t disclosed what those numbers were.\nLeonard Schleifer: And we remain blinded to that interim analysis Evan. So, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nSalveen Richter: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. With regard to the oncology portfolio, what do you consider the most meaningful milestones for the next 12 months and particularly here the PSMAxCD28 asset? Thank you.\nLeonard Schleifer: Well, we obviously have some important submissions we need to get in later in the year, as we mentioned, for our CD3 bispecifics. And we need to continue to get data later in the year with more patients with PSMAxCD28 bispecifics as well as from some of the other costim bispecifics. And we have to move aggressively enrolling the additional studies we planned for LAG-3. So \u2013 and we have to make Libtayo even more successful, we hope in the marketplace around the world. So, lots to do. I don\u2019t know if George or Marion have anything else to add there?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. I think it\u2019s \u2013 it was really critically important for us to validate individual agents in each class. That was our strategy. We wanted to develop the best-in-class checkpoint inhibitors, such as our PD-1 antibody, Libtayo, such as our LAG-3 antibody, fianlimab. We wanted to establish three bispecifics that we are best-in-class and that we are working in hem/onc settings, but also in solid tumor settings. And then, of course, we want to validate that this incredible principle of co-stimulatory bispecifics that we introduced into the world, which were truly magical in animal studies with essentially working like turnkey agents to synergize with the other two classes in animal studies that that we could reproduce that sort of activity in humans. And to us obviously, it takes years to get to that point, but we feel we are in a very exciting position right now because, as I have said, the individual classes are validated. We are starting to see impressive combination opportunities. We talked about combining two checkpoints, combining our LAG-3 with PD-1, where it looks like we have maybe taken first-line melanoma to a different point where patients can get a lot more benefit from this combination. And now having validated those, we are expanding much more broadly. Same thing with the CD3 bispecifics, we are growing that franchise now that we have shown that our platform works, and we are working both in hem/onc and outside in solid tumor settings. And the fact that our first costim bispecific delivered the sort of exciting early data that it delivered really gets us \u2013 very excited about the possibility now that we have this whole rollout. We have several of these costim bispecifics in the clinic, clearing their dose escalation safety settings, and we are now going to be rolling out data from these combinations, more data from the PSMA, costim bispecific in prostate cancer in more patients, but we are also going to be reporting on a series of other costims, including not only in combinations that we already talked about in solid tumors. But in the hem/onc space, where we are very excited, obviously, about our CD20xCD3 bispecific by itself and our BCMAxCD3 bispecific by themselves, that Len said. We are both filing for those hopefully by the end of the year, but also initiating earlier line studies. But just as importantly, we are going to be initiating combination with these costim bispecifics, which we think yet again, if these continue to work like they work not only in the animal models, but now how they are looking in the early human study, these could really leapfrog the individual agents to a whole place where they are really changing the practice of medicine and delivering much more benefit to patients, which is what we are all about.\nLeonard Schleifer: Yes. I don\u2019t think George\u2019s point, can be overstated. Cancer cures in serious advanced tumors are still far and few between. And there is still tremendous need which makes this a very dynamic treatment marketplace because people want that extra benefit because it\u2019s not like they are getting cures. We haven\u2019t cured lung cancer or we haven\u2019t cured most serious cancers. So, the ability to have foundational individual treatments and then get more by combining them really does position us to leapfrog to use George\u2019s word in the treatment paradigm out in the world because patients and their doctors are very sensitive to improve outcomes because there is still tremendous, tremendous need.\nRyan Crowe: Next question, Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMohit Bansal: Good. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe staying with COPD, so talking to some KOLs and reading some papers. It seems like IL-13 has some implication into fibrosis as well. Now, so the question is, do you think there could be a beneficial effect of IL-13 blockade and its impact on fibrosis on COPD-4 and above blocking inflammation? And if yes, do you think a 1-year trial would be enough to see that?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: I think you bring up really interesting points. We were actually involved in some of the experiments years ago that showed that IL-13 could actually cause fibrosis in animal models. And certainly, we do believe that long-term, like in many of the diseases that we have studied so far, that the benefit of Dupixent and blocking both IL-4 and IL-13 can continue to accrue for the patient in terms of preventing the chronic inflammation that results in so much of this remodeling that you talked about. We believe this may be true in asthma. And we are actually involved in programs and studies to show that some of the same things that you are talking about will also benefit in that and you will prevent long-term remodeling that decreases lung function over time in structural changes in the asthmatic patients and we believe that, that may also be true, of course, in COPD. But first, we need, as you say, the shorter term studies to be positive, but we do believe that if they produce the type of data that we hope if Dupixent type data, we are hoping it could in COPD, that longer term studies, like you say, could end up showing even longer term benefits in terms of exactly the type of remodeling and fibrotic changes that result in permanent loss of function, lung function in these patients. So, we think that you are totally right, but it will probably, as you say, take longer term studies to actually pick that up.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks George. Next question Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow with UBS. Your line is now open.\nColin Bristow: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to sort of push a little more on the COPD readout. And just trying to understand what\u2019s underpinning your confidence here. It certainly feels like you are more enthusiastic than what we are hearing out of Europe. Is this primarily based on the threshold set for BOREAS interim and these were sufficiently robust that you just \u2013 you feel good about the ultimate result, or is there something else you can point us to? Thanks.\nLeonard Schleifer: Yes. I wouldn\u2019t over under-read our situation right here. And it almost doesn\u2019t matter because Regeneron is a data-driven enterprise, and we are all going to see the data coming up, we hope later this quarter. We are totally blinded to the evaluation that was done on the interim analysis. We have said we set it at a reasonable bar, but it was only a fraction of the patients. So, you never know how this is going to turn out, we would not be as confident about something like this compared to another classic Type 2 inflammatory disease. So, you have that on the negative side. But on the positive side, you do have the fact that we have selected patients who have eosinophils and we had this interim analysis. Bottom line is we look forward to the data as well as you do.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks Len. Next question Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nChris Raymond: Thanks. Maybe a broader question on the VEGF retinal market. Last year, at AAO, there was a lot of discussion and debate around the potential impact on the retinal specialist practices if intravitreal therapies for geographic atrophy are approved. And some folks were talking about, just back of the envelope, this could drive a pretty sizable like 30%-some increase in injection volume, the practices just from treating geographic atrophy patients. As you guys think about this dynamic, we have heard some KOLs sort of offer up potential fix to that, that they would move in a more accelerated fashion to longer duration, longer-acting therapies for wet AMD. Are you guys seeing that? Is that something that we should be thinking about in terms of a driver from short-acting to longer acting?\nLeonard Schleifer: Yes. I mean I think despite all of these practice aspects, the primary driver will be that patients would prefer to get a needle in the eye less frequently. With every time you put a needle in the eye, there is a risk of inflammation or more serious complications hemorrhages, detachments, things like that. So, the less you have to do that and get the same benefit is better for the patients from the needle in the eye perspective. And it\u2019s better for the patient from the number of times they have to come to the doctor\u2019s office. These are elderly patients. Frequently, they have to have a caregiver. From a practice perspective, certainly, as many doctors\u2019 offices are overwhelmed by \u2013 in the number of injections that they are giving and that they could free up time with if you could get the same result. From a practice point of view with less frequent injections, certainly that would free up more time and would drive them. But I believe at the end of the docs do make the decision with their patient on this primarily because less injections in the eye are just stapled and more convenient for the patient.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Well we also shouldn\u2019t lose sight of the fact that if treatments for geographic accuracy become much more take off and become much more prevalent that they do have a side effect. They are actually increasing levels of macular edema in these patients, which will of course, necessarily treatment there as well.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks. We have time for two more questions, Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the question. Just on the costim platform, I guess once you land on the right dose for these products, do you expect that there could be accelerating filing pathways given the few options available for most of these patients \u2013 or do we still need to think about needing to go slowly even with the registrational studies as you are kind of balancing, I guess safety versus efficacy. Thank you.\nLeonard Schleifer: Well, we certainly believe that when you are in something where there is tremendous medical need and no alternative, that there will be opportunities to move for accelerated approval. We are all aware of the new FDA guidelines that they want you to be underway with your pivotal studies are well underway, I think is a phrase they use. So, we are taking that into account. But there is no question that if we can reproduce the efficacy that we saw in these late-stage prostate cancer patients. There is not only the need, but there will be a mechanism to get that to patients as quickly as possible. Remember, the main issue as you referred to, is being mindful of the safety. And of course, we are doing everything we can to mitigate that. But remember, thus far for the most part, there has been an extremely tight linkage of safety and efficacy. That is the adverse events occurred in those patients who were having the substantial benefit. So, that makes the risk/reward even more attractive from a regulator\u2019s and doctor\u2019s and frankly, a patient\u2019s perspective. But the short answer is we think we are not going to go too fast where one would be reckless. We have to be careful. But we do think there is an opportunity for an accelerated approval if we follow the new approach the FDA has laid out.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks Len. Last question, please, Shannon.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Truist. Your line is now open.\nRobyn Karnauskas: Great. Thank you for squeezing me in. So, just a follow-up on the prior question. So, for your MUC16, CD28 and MUC16 is a great combination, what are you expecting regarding the safety profile and how do you think about that type of combination efficacy and safety vice versa as CD28-CPI combo? And just a follow-up to that, I know the FDA was concerned back in the day about dosing up with CD28 is superagonist, like do you think that your initial data might alleviate some of the needs of the low doses for CD28 bispecifics? Thanks.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Well, a lot of good questions in there. I will start from the end first. For sure, when we started the program, there was very serious concerns about previous experience with general CD28 activators that activated all over the body that resulted in really horrific situations for patients, which almost killed the field. We invented this new approach to tightly limit where we were limiting CD28 activation right at the tumor surface and so forth. And of course, there was a concern from the FDA, which is why, as you said, they made us employ a very, very conservative dose escalation program. We had to go through five or six dose levels just to get to where we thought were the active dose levels where we then start to see the rather dramatic antitumor activity that we began to report. We are hoping that as we get more experience and show that what we had demonstrated pre-clinically is really holding true in humans. In fact, the side effects that Len was talking about immune-related adverse events are totally unrelated to the sort of toxicities that were seen with non-specific CD28 superagonist in the past. They were really much more on target and on mechanism that is we were generating a presumably a polyclonal T-cell response against the tumor and some of that cross-reacted to tissues in the patients, and that\u2019s what we were seeing. So, we are hoping that increasingly we might be able to move a little bit more quickly through some of these dose escalation stages to get to the active doses with these other agents. What we are seeing so far, as we have presented in our posters on MUC16xCD3 that right now it\u2019s having an acceptable safety margin. And we also hope to see that when combined, either the CD3 combined with the MUC16xCD28 or when the MUC16 is combined with Libtayo that we will see the same sort of things that we saw with the PSMAxD28 that we will be getting, hopefully, market synergy and increase in the antitumor activity with hopefully a satisfactory safety window. And but that remains to be seen, and that\u2019s why we are carefully going through the combination studies and the dose escalation studies. But once again, I mean just to say how I mean exciting it is for those of us who have been working on these programs for over 10 years to be at this point where the individual agents and the individual classes are now validated and we now get to mix and match these things. And as Len said, the history of the field is when you have active agents and you start combining this, you can then leapfrog and get to the next level that would change the practice of medicine for these cancers. That\u2019s what we are aiming to do to try to save more lives, extend more lives, and it\u2019s an exciting place to be in.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks George. That\u2019s all the time we have for today. Thanks to everybody who dialed in and for your interest in Regeneron. We apologize to those remaining in the queue that we did not have a chance to get to. And as always, the IR team is available to answer any questions you may have. Thank you once again and have a great day and a nice weekend.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

            "content": "Thanks, George. The fourth quarter capped off a strong year of execution and growth, delivering results across our commercial portfolio. We expanded into new indications, which, coupled with our existing business, is expected to drive meaningful growth in 2023 and beyond. We look forward to several important potential approvals and subsequent launches this year, providing additional opportunities for growth. Starting with EYLEA, where we announced in January, fourth quarter U.S. net sales of $1.5 billion, full year 2022 net sales were $6.3 billion, representing 8% year-over-year growth and outpacing total growth of the anti-VEGF category for the year. At the end of the fourth quarter, EYLEA category share was approaching previous levels of approximately 50% of injections. This followed the short-term shift earlier in the quarter where EYLEA was negatively impacted by a temporary increase in use of off-label compounded Avastin. During this time, there was a short-term closure of a not-for-profit patient co-pay assistance fund, which reopened later in the quarter. We believe we have substantially recovered from the issue encountered in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect competitive pressures but remain confident in Regeneron's overall retinal franchise as we look forward to our potential upcoming aflibercept 8-milligram launch. In summary, our retinal franchise leads the anti-VEGF category with EYLEA as the current standard of care and aflibercept 8-milligram, if approved, offering a differentiated clinical profile that can potentially shift the treatment paradigm. Turning to Libtayo. Total fourth quarter global net sales were $169 million, growing 44% on a constant currency basis. In the U.S., net sales grew 36% to $110 million with contributions across all indications. In advanced non-melanoma skin cancers, we continue to build our leadership position in the PD-1 class. In lung cancer, Libtayo continues to see steady growth in utilization in prescribers. Customer ordering has accelerated following the chemotherapy combination approval last November. We are working to maximize launch uptake by increasing depth and breath of prescribers. Early launch indicators are positive community and academic centers have welcomed Libtayo's expanded role as an important treatment option in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. There are more than 200,000 new cases of lung cancer per year in the U.S. alone for which Libtayo is an important treatment option. Outside the U.S., Libtayo net sales grew 60% on a constant currency basis to $59 million driven by steady demand growth and additional launches as we secure access and reimbursement globally. We continue a targeted approach to extend our global commercial footprint in priority international markets. designed to maximize opportunities for Libtayo and potential future medicines. Finally, turning to DUPIXENT, where in the fourth quarter, global net sales grew 42% on a constant currency basis to $2.45 billion. In the U.S., net sales grew 44% to $1.94 billion, with strong growth continuing across atopic dermatitis, asthma, nasal polyps with additional contributions from recent launches in the eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis. DUPIXENT is well positioned to expand market penetration and drive revenue growth across established new and potential future indications in 2023 and beyond. Atopic dermatitis DUPIXENT's largest indication continues to rapidly grow across all age groups, firmly establishing DUPIXENT as the preferred systemic therapy for patients with moderate to severe disease. There continues to be rapid uptake in younger populations, further confirming DUPIXENT's differentiated efficacy and safety profile. We've also seen meaningful early adoption in prurigo nodularis where DUPIXENT is the only FDA-approved medicine for this debilitating disease. We expect ongoing uptake of DUPIXENT as the launch progresses and physicians identify patients need. DUPIXENT continues to perform well in the highly competitive biologic asthma space with steady market share gains and strong growth in total prescriptions and new patient starts. In nasal polyps, DUPIXENT's differentiated clinical profile continues to drive uptake as the leading first-line treatment option in patients requiring systemic therapy. In the eosinophilic esophagitis, the launch is going exceptionally well finally offering physicians and their patients a treatment to effectively manage the underlying mechanism of the disease. Patients treated with DUPIXEN have experienced dramatic improvements in their symptoms and quality of life we've seen rapid uptake across both gastroenterologists and allergists. We also continue to advance our clinical efforts in younger patients where there is also substantial unmet need. Outside the U.S., DUPIXENT net sales worth $513 million, growing 37% on a constant currency basis, driven by rapid uptake across approved indications and launches in new geographies. In Europe, DUPIXENT was approved for prurigo nodularis in December. And earlier this week, DUPIXENT was also approved for eosinophilic esophagitis. We expect these new indications to contribute to DUPIXENT's ongoing international growth. In summary, during 2022, we executed on our core focus to deliver life-changing medicines to patients. Our commercial initiatives and strategies are driving increases in market penetration for our in-line brands and optimizing the potential of new and upcoming launches. Taken together, we are confident in Regeneron's future and are well positioned to deliver long-term and sustainable growth. Now I'll turn the call to Bob. Hi, Tyler. Yes, and let me comment that certainly, EYLEA performance in the market, as I reported, continues to be very strong, a quick reminder on the year growing at 8% to $6.3 billion and certainly a very strong competitive performance. We are conscious of competition in the marketplace. But to give a bit of an update, we continue to hear that first nAb use has been modest and results, in some cases, have resulted in patients switching back to other agents, including EYLEA probably most frequently EYLEA. Certainly, we look forward to continued efforts on EYLEA this year is the standard of care. And as you know, from many of us talking to KOLs, they're incredibly enthusiastic about the launch \u2013 potential launch of aflibercept 8-milligram coming later this year. I would just say that we have a highly experienced team in commercialization, and we certainly will be ready for the launch. And in the meantime, we are very focused on our participation in the market today with EYLEA. But certainly more to come, and we absolutely look forward to the potential launch of 8 milligrams."

            "name": "Leonard Schleifer",
            "content": "Good morning to everybody and for those of you experiencing the optic freeze, I hope you are staying warm. Our strong fourth quarter performance kept remarkable year of Regeneron, highlighted by significant achievements that better position the company to deliver sustainable growth and shareholder value. Fourth quarter 2022 revenue increased 14% compared to the prior year when excluding the impact of contributions from REGEN-COV and Ronapreve underscoring the commercial strength and increasing diversity of our business. We also made several important advances across our pipeline during the quarter, notably the submission of a Biologic License Application for aflibercept 8 milligrams in neovascular age-related macular degeneration or wet AMD as well as diabetic macular edema, or DME, positioning us for a potential U.S. launch in late August of this year. Additionally, we received FDA approval for Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy as a first line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer, making Libtayo only the second PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody approved in this setting, regardless of the patient's histology or PD-L1 expressions level. We also presented data from our rapidly advancing oncology pipeline, including fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody in combination with Libtayo in advanced non-small cell lung cancer, odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific in B-cell lymphomas and linvoseltamab, our BCMA x CD3 bispecific in multiple myeloma. Finally, Dupixent was approved for prurigo nodularis in Europe. Briefly reflecting on 2022, we ended the year with three strategic imperatives that we felt we had to accomplish in order to position the company for long-term growth. First, we had to fortify the medium and long-term outlook for our retinal franchise. Based on the positive results that we reported in September 2022, we believe aflibercept 8 milligrams has the potential to change the treatment paradigm for patients with wet AMD and DME by becoming the new standard of care for these patients, positioning Regeneron for prolonged leadership in this category. Second, we needed to maintain and grow DUPIXENT leadership across a variety of Type 2 allergic diseases. 2022 turned out to be a phenomenal year with Dupixent global net product sales approaching $8.7 billion and growing 44% at constant currency. Despite new competition, Dupixent maintained a leading market position in atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyps and was also approved in new indications, geographies and younger populations, which George will detail shortly. Collectively, these 2022 approvals meaningfully expanded the Dupixent commercial opportunity, allowing the addressable population to increase by approximately 225,000 patients, bringing the total addressable population to over 7 million patients globally. And third, we wanted to make significant progress towards becoming a leader in immunooncology and 2022 turned out to be a crucial year. Key to this long-term goal was requiring Sanofi's share of global rights to Libtayo, an antibody discovered by Regeneron, which was a necessary step towards realizing the full clinical and commercial potential of this foundational therapy. It also enables us to unlock combination opportunities from promising candidates in our oncology pipeline, including with our LAG-3 antibody, our costimulatory bispecifics and our CD3 bispecifics. Looking ahead, we expect 2023 to be another notable year with significant incremental progress across these imperatives as well as in other areas of our business. We are preparing for a potential U.S. launch for aflibercept 8 milligrams in late August given prescribers decade plus experience with EYLEA. And now with the 48-week data for aflibercept 8 milligrams, which demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety to EYLEA, but with longer treatment intervals, we believe that over time there is an opportunity for aflibercept 8 milligrams to become the new standard of care for wet AMD and DME. We expect Dupixent to continue to strengthen its leadership position across approved Type 2 allergic diseases based on its differentiated mechanism of blocking both interleukin-4 and interleukin-13. In 2023, we have an opportunity to reach even more patients with potential regulatory approvals in new diseases, geographies and younger populations that could add another approximately 500,000 patients globally to the biologic eligible population. Additionally, we look forward to the upcoming readout of our first Phase 3 study of Dupixent in COPD in the first half of this year. In oncology, we expect to continue rapidly advancing our pipeline. For our LAG-3 combination with Libtayo, we are moving forward with expansion beyond melanoma to include lung cancer and potentially other solid tumors. For our costimulatory bispecifics, in combination with Libtayo, we are continuing dose expansion in our Phase 1/2 PSMAxCD28 program in advanced prostate cancer. We also expect to report additional Phase 1 data from our EGFRxCD28 program in solid tumors and to present initial clinical data for our MUC16xCD28 program in recurrent ovarian cancer. And within Heme-Onc, we anticipate second half regulatory submissions for odronextamab in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma as well as limvolseltumab in refractory multiple myeloma. In 2023, we also plan to rapidly move forward with clinical development of our next-generation COVID-19 antibody, which we believe could help protect the millions of vulnerable patients who were unable to map a sufficient immune response from vaccination and treat those who require other alternatives. Activities enabling clinical manufacturing have commenced and we expect to enter clinical development later this year. In closing, 2022 was a pivotal year at Regeneron and we expect to continue making significant progress in 2023. Our strategy remains focused on investing in our internal R&D capabilities which has historically generated a high rate of return. We remain confident in our near and long-term growth prospects with approximately 35 pipeline candidates currently progressing through clinical trials. We will also continue looking for opportunities to complement these internal efforts by exploring potential collaborations. With our commercial capabilities continue to drive revenue growth and our strong financial position, Regeneron is extremely well positioned to continue delivering breakthroughs for patients and value to shareholders. Now, I will turn the call over to George. Matt, we don't' hear you. We hear you now. Give us a second. We will disconnect all the Roche people on the call, so we can get you our strategy. In all seriousness, obviously, there is a lot of thought that's going to go in between now and what we hope will be our late August approval on pricing, on rollout, on targeting, on strategy, etcetera, etcetera. But we are working on that. We have to get our label. We have to get it approved, and we will have everything else ready to go. The initial launch will be with a vial and then we hope down the road, not too far with the pre-filled syringe. Marion, I don't know if you want to give away any of the secrets at this point. Obviously, the Vabysmo launch has not turned the market sideways on us. It's real competition. But that, I think there is a window that's sort of closing for them to compete against 2 milligrams, we hope and then 8 milligrams, we hope could become the standard of care. So, lots to look forward to later in the year. And we remain blinded to that interim analysis Evan. So, next question please. Well, we obviously have some important submissions we need to get in later in the year, as we mentioned, for our CD3 bispecifics. And we need to continue to get data later in the year with more patients with PSMAxCD28 bispecifics as well as from some of the other costim bispecifics. And we have to move aggressively enrolling the additional studies we planned for LAG-3. So \u2013 and we have to make Libtayo even more successful, we hope in the marketplace around the world. So, lots to do. I don't know if George or Marion have anything else to add there? Yes. I don't think George's point, can be overstated. Cancer cures in serious advanced tumors are still far and few between. And there is still tremendous need which makes this a very dynamic treatment marketplace because people want that extra benefit because it's not like they are getting cures. We haven't cured lung cancer or we haven't cured most serious cancers. So, the ability to have foundational individual treatments and then get more by combining them really does position us to leapfrog to use George's word in the treatment paradigm out in the world because patients and their doctors are very sensitive to improve outcomes because there is still tremendous, tremendous need. Yes. I wouldn't over under-read our situation right here. And it almost doesn't matter because Regeneron is a data-driven enterprise, and we are all going to see the data coming up, we hope later this quarter. We are totally blinded to the evaluation that was done on the interim analysis. We have said we set it at a reasonable bar, but it was only a fraction of the patients. So, you never know how this is going to turn out, we would not be as confident about something like this compared to another classic Type 2 inflammatory disease. So, you have that on the negative side. But on the positive side, you do have the fact that we have selected patients who have eosinophils and we had this interim analysis. Bottom line is we look forward to the data as well as you do. Yes. I mean I think despite all of these practice aspects, the primary driver will be that patients would prefer to get a needle in the eye less frequently. With every time you put a needle in the eye, there is a risk of inflammation or more serious complications hemorrhages, detachments, things like that. So, the less you have to do that and get the same benefit is better for the patients from the needle in the eye perspective. And it's better for the patient from the number of times they have to come to the doctor's office. These are elderly patients. Frequently, they have to have a caregiver. From a practice perspective, certainly, as many doctors' offices are overwhelmed by \u2013 in the number of injections that they are giving and that they could free up time with if you could get the same result. From a practice point of view with less frequent injections, certainly that would free up more time and would drive them. But I believe at the end of the docs do make the decision with their patient on this primarily because less injections in the eye are just stapled and more convenient for the patient. Well, we certainly believe that when you are in something where there is tremendous medical need and no alternative, that there will be opportunities to move for accelerated approval. We are all aware of the new FDA guidelines that they want you to be underway with your pivotal studies are well underway, I think is a phrase they use. So, we are taking that into account. But there is no question that if we can reproduce the efficacy that we saw in these late-stage prostate cancer patients. There is not only the need, but there will be a mechanism to get that to patients as quickly as possible. Remember, the main issue as you referred to, is being mindful of the safety. And of course, we are doing everything we can to mitigate that. But remember, thus far for the most part, there has been an extremely tight linkage of safety and efficacy. That is the adverse events occurred in those patients who were having the substantial benefit. So, that makes the risk/reward even more attractive from a regulator's and doctor's and frankly, a patient's perspective. But the short answer is we think we are not going to go too fast where one would be reckless. We have to be careful. But we do think there is an opportunity for an accelerated approval if we follow the new approach the FDA has laid out."

            "content": "Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted. Regeneron ended 2022 with a strong fourth quarter with continued execution driving positive results across the business. Excluding contributions from REGEN-COV and Ronapreve, fourth quarter total revenues increased 14% year-over-year to $3 billion, driven by growth across our core brands. Fourth quarter diluted net income per share was $12.56 on net income of $1.4 billion. Beginning with collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. Fourth quarter 2022 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $839 million, up 7% on a constant currency basis versus fourth quarter 2021. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $355 million, of which $324 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $836 million in the fourth quarter and grew 61%, driven by DUPIXENT. Our share of profits from the commercialization of DUPIXENT and KEVZARA was $619 million, an increase of 60% versus the prior year. We also recognized a $50 million sales-based milestone in the fourth quarter of 2022 due to achievement of $2.5 billion of ex-U.S. sales of antibody collaboration products on a rolling 12-month basis. Finally, we recorded Roche collaboration revenue of $396 million in the fourth quarter for our share of gross profits from ex-U.S. sales of Ronapreve related to a previously signed contract. Moving now to our operating expenses. Fourth quarter 2022 R&D expense increased 43% year-over-year to $911 million, driven by the impact of the Libtayo transaction with Regeneron now recording all R&D expense for Libtayo and our full 50% share of antibody collaboration R&D spend for DUPIXENT and odronextamab, as well as additional costs incurred in connection with the company's late-stage pipeline and increasing clinical manufacturing activities and higher headcount-related costs. SG&A expense increased 17% year-over-year to $579 million due to higher headcount and related costs, incremental costs to fully support the global commercialization of Libtayo and higher contributions to an independent not-for-profit patient systems organization. Product gross margin in the quarter increased to 93% as compared to 86% in the prior year. The improved gross margin was driven by a favorable change in product mix and no longer having to pay Sanofi for their share of U.S. Libtayo gross profits. Finally, fourth quarter 2022 effective tax rate was 11.3% compared to 12.6% in the prior year. Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. For full year 2022, Regeneron generated $4.4 billion in free cash flow, favorably impacted by our first quarter 2022 payment from the U.S. government for sales REGEN-COV that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021. We ended 2022 with cash and marketable securities less debt of $11.6 billion. We continue to deliver on our capital allocation priorities in 2022 by deploying approximately $3.4 billion towards business development and share repurchases while continuing to fund our internal R&D efforts. In 2022, we executed approximately $1.3 billion in business development initiatives, including the acquisitions of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals in the exclusive worldwide rights to Libtayo. We also purchased approximately $2.1 billion of our shares in 2022, including $431 million in the fourth quarter. This morning, we announced a new $3 billion share repurchase authorization reflecting our continued confidence in our business and our pipeline. We remain buyers of our shares at current levels, and this new authorization enables us to continue returning capital directly to shareholders. I'd like to conclude with our initial financial guidance and outlook for 2023. We expect 2023 SG&A spend to be in the range of $2.13 billion to $2.2 billion. This primarily reflects the full year impact of global Life tile commercialization expenses, the build-out of our international commercial infrastructure in select markets and higher headcount to support our growing organization. We expect our 2023 R&D expense to be in the range of $3.725 billion to $3.925 billion. As George mentioned, we have numerous strategically important development programs advancing in 2023, including late-stage studies for our fianlimab, Libtayo combination in melanoma and lung cancer in confirmatory Phase 3 studies for odronextamab, both in FL and DLBCL and linvoseltamab in myeloma. In addition, we continue to advance programs in our early pipeline across multiple therapeutic areas including with collaborators such as Alnylam and Intellia positioning us for long-term growth. This range also includes the full year impact of the Libtayo transaction, we are now recording all development expenses for Libtayo recognizing our full 50% share of development expenses for DUPIXENT in itepekimab. COCM is expected to be in the range of $720 million to $800 million, similar to 2022 reflecting the gradual phase-in of a new Regeneron developed manufacturing process for DUPIXENT that is designed to improve drug substance yields. We expect our capital expenditures in 2023 to be in the range of $825 million to $950 million. These expenditures will support the continued expansion of our manufacturing facilities, including ongoing construction of a fill/finish facility as well as the previously announced expansion of R&D facilities at our Tarrytown, New York headquarters. Finally, we anticipate 2023 gross margin to be between 90% to 92% and our effective tax rate to be in the range of 11% to 13%. In addition to our full year financial guidance, we expect higher interest income in 2023, given our greater cash balance plus higher interest rates as compared to last year, which will favorably impact other income and expense. We also expect 2023 other revenue to be slightly lower than 2022. Finally, as I said in November, we no longer expect to record any material other operating income or expense in 2023 are beyond absent a new transaction. In conclusion, Regeneron continued to deliver robust financial results in 2022, and we are well positioned to drive continued growth in 2023 and beyond. With that, I will now pass the call back to Ryan."

            "name": "George Yancopoulos",
            "content": "Thanks, Len. I would like to briefly walk you through our pipeline's progress in 2022 and touch upon what lies ahead in 2023. In ophthalmology, we presented pivotal \u2013 positive pivotal results for aflibercept 8 milligram in wet AMD and DME. These trials showed that aflibercept 8 milligram extended dosing intervals to every 12 or even 16 weeks for the vast majority of patients through 48 weeks without compromising the visual improvement or safety seen with EYLEA. These are truly unprecedented and potentially game-changing results who have not \u2013 which have not been achieved using any other anti-VEGF agents. Moving to Dupixent, in 2022, Dupixent became the only biologic approved in atopic dermatitis, for infants as young as 6 months of age, the first treatment for prurigo nodularis and the first treatment in the United States for eosinophilic esophagitis. And just this week, we obtained the European Commission approval for eosinophilic esophagitis as well. In addition, we submitted a supplemental BLA for chronic spontaneous urticaria and shared positive Phase 3 data in children with the eosinophilic esophagitis. Dupixent is now approved in 5 related Type 2 allergic conditions. And our data shows that these diseases are mediated by IL-4 and IL-13 driven Type 2 inflammation. Because many patients suffer from systemic Type 2 inflammation, they often suffer from several of these diseases concurrently. And thus, Dupixent has the potential to holistically address these patients multiple Type 2 conditions for which Dupixent is approved. While many other immunomodulators are associated with worrisome immunosuppression and carry boxed warnings, Dupixent's safety profile supports its approval in infants. In 2023, we are looking forward to the initial results of BOREAS, the first Dupixent Phase 3 study in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. Our Dupixent COPD Phase 3 studies have enrolled patients with elevated blood eosinophils aiming to select for patients with COPD driven by Type 2 inflammation. The BOREAS study passed an interim futility analysis in 2020, an encouraging event, which triggered the start of the replicate Phase 3 NOTUS study. We are looking forward to the readout of BOREAS with the primary endpoint of annualized rate of acute, moderate and severe COPD exacerbations expected in the first half of \u201823. Moving on to oncology, 2022 was an important year for our oncology programs. Libtayo was approved by the FDA in combination with chemotherapy in first-line non-small cell lung cancer, irrespective of histology or PD-L1 expression levels, an achievement met by only one other PD-1 or PD-L1 targeting agent. Libtayo is also emerging as an essential backbone of our oncology pipeline as several programs in combination with Libtayo are starting to yield encouraging data. First, I will discuss our LAG-3 antibody, fianlimab in combination with Libtayo, where we have recently shown positive data from a second confirmatory cohort of PD-1 naive metastatic melanoma patients and reported encouraging results from a smaller dataset in non-small-cell lung cancer patients. These initial results suggest that the fianlimab Libtayo combination has a potentially best-in-class profile in melanoma. And we are advancing broad pivotal programs in both melanoma and lung cancer. Phase 3 studies in metastatic melanoma and adjuvant melanoma are already enrolling and we have plans to soon initiate another Phase 3 study in perioperative melanoma as well as Phase 2/3 studies in first-line advanced as well as perioperative non-small cell lung cancer. Other notable Libtayo combination used from this year was the early but very encouraging data with our PSMA by CD28 costimulatory bispecific in advanced metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, a tumor type considered immunologically cold with multiple recent Phase 3 failures demonstrating that prostate cancer is largely unresponsive to anti-PD-1 therapy in other end as well as in other types of chemo combination. In our proof-of-concept study of our PSMA by CD28 costimulatory bispecific, we observed first evidence that combining this new class of bispecifics with anti-PD-1 can confer profound responsiveness to tumors previously thought to be cold and unresponsive to anti-PD-1 therapy with 3 out of the 4 patients treated at the highest dose levels showing greater than 90% reductions within 6 weeks of initiating combination therapy in the prostate cancer biomarker PSA. Following up on these early but exciting results, we are continuing to enroll patients in this study and we are planning to present additional data at medical meetings in 2023. We also presented our first clinical data for a CD3 bispecific in a solid tumor for ubamatamab, our MUC16xCD3 bispecific in development for advanced ovarian cancer. As a single agent in a Phase 1 dose escalation study in heavily pretreated recurrent ovarian cancer patients, we observed a 4% overall response rate with a 31% response rates in a small subset of patients with high MUC16 expressing tumors. We expect initial dose escalation data later this year for ubamatamab with Libtayo as well as for our MUC16xCD28 costimulatory bispecific with Libtayo in advanced ovarian cancer. We also expect updated clinical data for our EGFRxCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with Libtayo in various solid tumors later this year. Moving on to our hematology oncology pipeline, at the American Society of Hematology, or ASH Annual Meeting, we presented new data from odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific as well as linvoseltamab our BCMAxCD3 bispecific. For odronextamab, we presented pivotal Phase 2 ELM-2 data. Odronextamab in third or later line relapsed or recurrent follicular lymphoma has a potential best-in-class efficacy profile with 82% of patients responding and 92% of these responders achieving a complete response with encouraging durability. Our optimized step-up dosing regimen has improved odronextamab's safety profile while retaining efficacy similar to the prior dosing regimen. In third or later \u2013 in relapse or recurrent diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, odronextamab demonstrated efficacy regardless of prior CAR-T experience and a safety profile generally similar to that seen in follicular lymphoma. We are planning regulatory submissions in the second half of 2023 for both indications, which we hope will support potential accelerated approvals. In 2023, we anticipate initiating several Phase 3 studies in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, including in earlier lines of therapy. These trials will serve as confirmatory studies which could potentially support conversion to full approval. We also expect to initiate a proof-of-concept study of our CD22xCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with odronextamab in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which we hope could further add to the anticancer benefit for these patients. For linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody we presented efficacy and safety data from our pivotal Phase 2 study in third or later line multiple myeloma at ASH. Early, deep and durable responses were observed in patients with high disease burden and these responses may improve with longer follow-up. In 2023, we plan to initiate a confirmatory Phase 3 study of linvoseltamab in second line multiple myeloma and are on track for a BLA submission in the second half of the year. As with odronextamab, we plan to initiate combination studies for linvoseltamab with costimulatory bispecifics in the near future. I'd also like to update some additional clinical programs. Our antibody blocking Factor XI for anticoagulation and our antibody that activates the NPR1 receptor for heart failure are both completing proof of mechanism trials. Moving on to Regeneron Genetics Medicine, regarding our collaboration with Alnylam and siRNA Therapeutics, we are planning a broad and multi-pronged approach to develop treatments for NASH, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. We are initiating a Phase 2 study of ALN-HSD and NASH patients with genetic risk factors. We also dosed first subjects in the first-in-human study of another siRNA medicine in development for NASH, ALN-PNP, which targets a different gene and can be potentially combined with ALN-HSD in appropriate patients. We have discovered additional NASH targets, which we have validated using our Regeneron Genetics Center, including side B, which will potentially be the next NASH therapeutic candidate to enter the clinic. With regard to our collaboration with Alnylam for central nervous system targets, our initial dose escalation study is ongoing. Our collaboration with Intellia and CRISPR-based therapeutics, this is expected to progress further in 2023, building on continuing data readouts from the Phase 1 study of NTLA-2001 in transthyretin amyloidosis in both cardiomyopathy and neuropathy patients, which provided the first demonstration in humans that CRISPR-based technologies can deliver up to 90% reduction of the pathological gene product for over a year. Regarding our gene therapy efforts, our collaborators at Decibel Therapeutics recently announced that a clinical trial has been authorized by both the U.S. FDA and the UK MHRA for DB-OTO, a virally delivered gene therapy designed to restore hearing to individuals with otoferlin-related hearing loss. A Phase 1/2 study in patients 2 years of age and younger is expected to initiate in the first half of 2023 with initial data from the first cohort of patients anticipated in the first quarter of 2024. I'd like to conclude with our next-generation COVID-19 efforts. As we recently announced, we have identified a potent broadly neutralizing COVID-19 antibody, which, unlike other neutralizing antibodies find outside of the so-called receptor binding domain, or RBD, of the spike protein. This antibody retains activity against all the viral variants seen throughout the pandemic because it binds to an atop that has remained highly conserved, greater than 99.9% across all known variants. The vast majority of antiviral antibodies generated as a result of vaccination or due to natural infection target the RBD domain, which results in overwhelming selective pressure driving the emergence of these resistant variants. We hope that by targeting this unique and conservative to outside of the RBD this antibody will also retain its activity in the face of future variance. We plan to initiate clinical trials to test this antibody this year, and we are looking to develop it in both treatment and prophylactic setting. In conclusion, Regeneron's R&D engine continues its productivity, including the early-stage pipeline. Just in the first weeks of this year, we have initiated clinical studies for two new drug candidates and we anticipate clinical trials starting or IND submission for up to 10 new therapeutic candidates this year as well as for additional indications for candidates that are already in the clinic. So with that, I will turn it over to Marion. Well, we powered our futility analysis as well as our clinical trial to deliver what we believe would be clinically meaningful benefit if the study proves positive, which we hope it will. And remember, we're going to be looking at both exist patios, but also improvement in lung function. So it will be a sort of integration of the benefit that patients can receive from both those measures. I remind you that in other settings in asthma, in particular, DUPIXENT has distinguished itself from other immunomodulators and delivering pretty substantial improvements in pulmonary lung function. So it's not only all about exacerbations, but we hope to have significant improvements in exacerbations as well as in lung functions which will hopefully provide important benefits to patients. Well, as you say, the important thing about that aspect of the Alnylam collaboration is together, we were hoping for the first time to see if we could develop technology that would actually allow us to do what's been done now by Alnylam and others in the liver to bring it to other tissues, particularly to the central nervous system in this case. So this \u2013 the first study, which is focused on APP is really a proof of concept that can we get this technology to work, we view it as a potential sort of platform enabler, meaning that if we see anything here and obviously these are challenging things to be first and to do something that nobody has ever done before. And it's obviously very early in the program. But the goal is to establish proof of principle that this type of technology, which looks like it can be pretty effective in the liver, chat and work outside of the liver, particularly in the CNS. So this would be a platform enabler. All I can say is that we powered it to deliver would be a clinically significant improvement. There was a combination of measures of exacerbations and lung function improvement, and we haven't disclosed what those numbers were. Yes. I think it's \u2013 it was really critically important for us to validate individual agents in each class. That was our strategy. We wanted to develop the best-in-class checkpoint inhibitors, such as our PD-1 antibody, Libtayo, such as our LAG-3 antibody, fianlimab. We wanted to establish three bispecifics that we are best-in-class and that we are working in hem/onc settings, but also in solid tumor settings. And then, of course, we want to validate that this incredible principle of co-stimulatory bispecifics that we introduced into the world, which were truly magical in animal studies with essentially working like turnkey agents to synergize with the other two classes in animal studies that that we could reproduce that sort of activity in humans. And to us obviously, it takes years to get to that point, but we feel we are in a very exciting position right now because, as I have said, the individual classes are validated. We are starting to see impressive combination opportunities. We talked about combining two checkpoints, combining our LAG-3 with PD-1, where it looks like we have maybe taken first-line melanoma to a different point where patients can get a lot more benefit from this combination. And now having validated those, we are expanding much more broadly. Same thing with the CD3 bispecifics, we are growing that franchise now that we have shown that our platform works, and we are working both in hem/onc and outside in solid tumor settings. And the fact that our first costim bispecific delivered the sort of exciting early data that it delivered really gets us \u2013 very excited about the possibility now that we have this whole rollout. We have several of these costim bispecifics in the clinic, clearing their dose escalation safety settings, and we are now going to be rolling out data from these combinations, more data from the PSMA, costim bispecific in prostate cancer in more patients, but we are also going to be reporting on a series of other costims, including not only in combinations that we already talked about in solid tumors. But in the hem/onc space, where we are very excited, obviously, about our CD20xCD3 bispecific by itself and our BCMAxCD3 bispecific by themselves, that Len said. We are both filing for those hopefully by the end of the year, but also initiating earlier line studies. But just as importantly, we are going to be initiating combination with these costim bispecifics, which we think yet again, if these continue to work like they work not only in the animal models, but now how they are looking in the early human study, these could really leapfrog the individual agents to a whole place where they are really changing the practice of medicine and delivering much more benefit to patients, which is what we are all about. I think you bring up really interesting points. We were actually involved in some of the experiments years ago that showed that IL-13 could actually cause fibrosis in animal models. And certainly, we do believe that long-term, like in many of the diseases that we have studied so far, that the benefit of Dupixent and blocking both IL-4 and IL-13 can continue to accrue for the patient in terms of preventing the chronic inflammation that results in so much of this remodeling that you talked about. We believe this may be true in asthma. And we are actually involved in programs and studies to show that some of the same things that you are talking about will also benefit in that and you will prevent long-term remodeling that decreases lung function over time in structural changes in the asthmatic patients and we believe that, that may also be true, of course, in COPD. But first, we need, as you say, the shorter term studies to be positive, but we do believe that if they produce the type of data that we hope if Dupixent type data, we are hoping it could in COPD, that longer term studies, like you say, could end up showing even longer term benefits in terms of exactly the type of remodeling and fibrotic changes that result in permanent loss of function, lung function in these patients. So, we think that you are totally right, but it will probably, as you say, take longer term studies to actually pick that up. Well we also shouldn't lose sight of the fact that if treatments for geographic accuracy become much more take off and become much more prevalent that they do have a side effect. They are actually increasing levels of macular edema in these patients, which will of course, necessarily treatment there as well. Well, a lot of good questions in there. I will start from the end first. For sure, when we started the program, there was very serious concerns about previous experience with general CD28 activators that activated all over the body that resulted in really horrific situations for patients, which almost killed the field. We invented this new approach to tightly limit where we were limiting CD28 activation right at the tumor surface and so forth. And of course, there was a concern from the FDA, which is why, as you said, they made us employ a very, very conservative dose escalation program. We had to go through five or six dose levels just to get to where we thought were the active dose levels where we then start to see the rather dramatic antitumor activity that we began to report. We are hoping that as we get more experience and show that what we had demonstrated pre-clinically is really holding true in humans. In fact, the side effects that Len was talking about immune-related adverse events are totally unrelated to the sort of toxicities that were seen with non-specific CD28 superagonist in the past. They were really much more on target and on mechanism that is we were generating a presumably a polyclonal T-cell response against the tumor and some of that cross-reacted to tissues in the patients, and that's what we were seeing. So, we are hoping that increasingly we might be able to move a little bit more quickly through some of these dose escalation stages to get to the active doses with these other agents. What we are seeing so far, as we have presented in our posters on MUC16xCD3 that right now it's having an acceptable safety margin. And we also hope to see that when combined, either the CD3 combined with the MUC16xCD28 or when the MUC16 is combined with Libtayo that we will see the same sort of things that we saw with the PSMAxD28 that we will be getting, hopefully, market synergy and increase in the antitumor activity with hopefully a satisfactory safety window. And but that remains to be seen, and that's why we are carefully going through the combination studies and the dose escalation studies. But once again, I mean just to say how I mean exciting it is for those of us who have been working on these programs for over 10 years to be at this point where the individual agents and the individual classes are now validated and we now get to mix and match these things. And as Len said, the history of the field is when you have active agents and you start combining this, you can then leapfrog and get to the next level that would change the practice of medicine for these cancers. That's what we are aiming to do to try to save more lives, extend more lives, and it's an exciting place to be in."

Regeneron's strong operational momentum continued in the third quarter, highlighted by important developments across our pipeline and outstanding commercial execution. Total revenues for the quarter increased by 11% compared to last year when excluding contributions from our COVID antibody cocktail. With global net sales of Dupixent and Libtayo, as well as U.S. net sales of EYLEA once again reaching new all-time quarterly highs and growing by double digits. Before diving deeper into our commercial results, I'd like to review some of the recent progress we have made across our pipeline, starting with the striking pivotal data that we reported, in September, for our investigational Aflibercept8 mg, which we believe could ultimately transform the treatment landscape for patients. With nearly 90% of DME patients and 80% of wet AMD patients able to sustain 16-weeks maintenance dosing through 48 weeks of treatment, we believe Aflibercept8 mg may shift the current treatment paradigm, with more patients receiving less frequent injections, while achieving visual acuity gains anatomical improvements, and a safety profile comparable to EYLEA. It has proven to be very difficult to decrease the treatment burden beyond what we were able to achieve with EYLEA over a decade ago with many potential treatments failing either due to suboptimal visual outcomes or safety issues. A recently issued anti-VEGF agent did not demonstrate in pivotal studies that the majority of patients in either disease were able to sustain 16-week maintenance dosing throughout the first year of treatment, supporting our view that Aflibercept8 mg has the potential to become the next generation's standard of care anti-VEGF treatment, assuming regulatory approval. We plan to submit the Aflibercept8 mg pivotal data to the FDA under a single BLA at the end of this year, and have decided to use a previously granted priority review voucher to expedite the FDA review process. Pre-launch planning is already underway, with a potential FDA approval by late August 2023. In addition to the pivotal Aflibercept8 mg data, Regeneron continued to make notable progress in our immunology and oncology pipelines. Starting with immunology, in September, we received FDA approval for Dupixent in prurigo nodularis, the first systemic therapy for this indication, and the fifth disease for which Dupixent is now approved. So far this year, Dupixent has received four U.S. or E.U. regulatory approvals, expanding the treatment-eligible population by approximately 225,000 patients, including in two diseases that previously had no FDA-approved systemic therapies. In the first-half of next year, we are looking forward the E.U. regulatory decisions for eosinophilic esophagitis, prurigo nodularis, and atopic dermatitis in patients as young as six months. With these potential additional indications, approximately 200,000 more patients with these type 2 inflammatory diseases could benefit from Dupixent's unmatched clinical profile. Additionally, we expect pivotal data readouts for Dupixent in chronic inducible cold-urticaria, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the first-half of next year. Moving to oncology, where the depth and breadth of our pipeline has positioned Regeneron to ultimately become a global leader. We presented several datasets at this year's European Society for Medical Oncology Annual Meeting, further underscoring the importance of Libtayo as the foundation for our overall oncology strategy. George will review the data in more detail during his remarks, but we were particularly encouraged by the results for Libtayo monotherapy in neoadjuvant CSCC as well as Libtayo in combination with Fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody, in first-line metastatic melanoma. We also presented monotherapy data for our MUC16 by CD3 bispecific in recurrent ovarian cancer, which has the potential to be combined with Libtayo as well as data for our METxMET biparatopic bispecific in MET-altered non-small cell lung cancer. I'd also note the early but very exciting results for our PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with Libtayo, which showed promising anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The patients enrolled in our study have a poor prognosis, with an expected survival of one to two years depending up on their treatment history. Given prostate cancer has been largely unresponsive to PD-1 inhibition and immunotherapy in general, there is a clear need for new treatments. In 2020 alone, there were over 375,000 deaths globally from prostate cancer, and it was the second leading cause of cancer death in American men. We continue to expand our costimulatory bispecific efforts in prostate cancer with an acceleration in enrollment in our first immune study since we reported our top line results, in August. And we look forward to updating you on this program in the first-half of next year. Now turning to our commercial performance, in the third quarter, EYLEA global net sales grew 8% at constant currency to $2.4 billion. In the U.S. EYLEA net sales were $1.63 billion, up 11% year-over-year, and outperforming the anti-VEGF category growth of only 4%. Despite recent branded and biosimilar entrants, EYLEA set a new all-time high for anti-VEGF category share in the United States. Dupixent continued to grow at a remarkable pace bolstered by approvals in new diseases and younger patient populations in previously approved indications. In the third quarter, global net product sales were $2.3 billion, up 45% at constant currency compared to last year, reflecting growth across all indications and all geographies. Dupixent's differentiated clinical profile and ability to effectively treat more and more patients in both currently approved indications and potentially for additional type-2 inflammatory diseases is expected to drive strong growth in the future. Libtayo total net sales grew 25% globally at constant currency, to $143 million in the third quarter, including 21% growth in United States driven by non-melanoma skin cancer indications and monotherapy non-small cell lung cancer. At the start of the third quarter, we acquired global rights to Libtayo from Sanofi, with potential future combinations including with chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer as well as other pipeline agents in development, we believe Libtayo is poised to become a more meaningful revenue contributor over time. We are excited about the strong commercial performance for our core products with compelling efficacy, safety, and durability data that we reported for Aflibercept8 mg, as well as the notable progress we have made advancing our pipeline, particularly in oncology. Our pipeline now includes approximately 35 product candidates in clinical development including a number of marketed products that we are investigating for additional indications. Some of which, George will discuss in a moment. In closing, our strategy continues to focus on investing in our internal R&D capabilities while exploring potential collaborations that will enable us to fully realize the power of our science. We remain confident in this strategy and in our growth prospects as well as in our ability to deliver breakthroughs to patients and value to shareholders. Now, I will turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len. I will start with ophthalmology. Positive pivotal results for Aflibercept8 mg in the PULSAR and PHOTON study recently presented at the American Academy of Ophthalmology Annual Meeting. Results of these trials in wet AMD and DME respectively demonstrated that a remarkably high percentage of patients were able to be rapidly initiated into and then successfully maintained through week 48 on 12- and 16-week dosing intervals while achieving vision gains that were non-inferior to the current standard of care, EYLEA 2 mg dosed every 8 weeks. These results suggest that Aflibercept8 mg has the potential to become the new standard of care in these retinal diseases. I think it would be helpful if we step back for a minute and try to put these results in context. What our trials did was push the limits far beyond what has been accomplished with any currently available anti-VEGF therapies. Rather than using response criteria to try to identify or slowly extend patients to longer dosing intervals, our trials tested whether all patients could be randomly assigned and rapidly initiated on extended dosing intervals of Aflibercept8 mg without compromising visual improvement or safety. These Aflibercept8 mg trials accomplished just that for the vast majority while delivering a safety profile consistent with that of EYLEA. Eighty nine percent of DME patients and 77% of wet AMD patients were able to be rapidly initiated and maintained on a 16-week of Aflibercept8 mg dosing regimen while 93% of DME and 83% of wet AMD patients were able to be rapidly initially maintained on at least a 12-week dosing interval. All while delivering efficacy similar to that of EYLEA administered every 8 weeks. We believe these are truly unprecedented and potentially game changing results which have not been achieved using any other anti-VEGF agent. Others have speculated that PULSAR and PHOTON results were due to our dose modification criteria and even tried to theoretically extrapolate that their agent could have somehow approached these results using our criteria. We put these speculative extrapolations into the category of wishful thinking. And based on our expert analysis of the data, we conclude it is all about the drug and not the trial design. Briefly moving on to Dupixent, building on our recent approval in eosinophilic esophagitis in adults and adolescents, we are planning on submitting a supplementary BLA for eosinophilic esophagitis in 1- to 1-year old children in mid 2023. Dupixent ability to treat eosinophilic esophagitis highlights how important it is that our IL-4 and IL-13 blocker more completely target the entire type 2 inflammatory cascade and not only eosinophils. As you heard Len mention, the FDA label was expanded yet again in the third quarter ad Dupixent became the first and only treatment indicated for prurigo nodularis, a debilitating chronic skin disease. This marks the fifth disease for which Dupixent is now approved. Our collective clinical data with Dupixent support a unifying molecular mechanism underlying these related diseases from asthma to atopic dermatitis to nasal polyps to prurigo nodularis to eosinophilic esophagitis. In this unifying hypothesis, IL-4 and IL-13 induced inflammation is driving all these related diseases in different tissue compartments. Moving to Libtayo and oncology, in the third quarter, our robust oncology pipeline has started to deliver data readout from our latest and most innovative programs. We are expecting these readouts to accelerate in the remainder of 2022 and continue into 2023. The European Society of Medical Oncology or ESMO Annual Meeting in September was a truly a banner event for Regeneron with several notable oral presentations for assets in our oncology pipeline, which I would like to briefly summarize. Starting with Fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody in combination with Libtayo, at ESMO, we shared data from two independent advanced melanoma expansion cohorts from our first in human study which importantly showed consistent efficacy and safety between the two replicate cohorts. Fianlimab in combination with Libtayo demonstrated greater than 60% response rates in each cohort. A median PFS estimated will be 24 months across both cohorts, and a median duration of response that has not yet been reached. The preliminary safety profile of the combination appears to be in line with anti-PD-1 monotherapy and potentially with less toxicity compared to anti-CTLA-4 combination. While dual LAG-3 and PD-1 inhibition has previously shown promise in advanced melanoma, response rates greater than 45% with median PFS of more than a year has not been previously reported. These initial results in melanoma suggest that Fianlimab\u2013Libtayo combination has the potentially best-in-class profile in the setting. We are enrolling our Phase 3 metastatic melanoma study. Intend to initiate a Phase 3 adjuvant melanoma study later this year and have additional plans in other solid tumors where Fianlimab has a potential to be first-in-class. The neoadjuvant cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or CSCC, a Phase 2 study of Libtayo monotherapy has shown promising results. Given prior to potentially curative surgery in patients with large tumors, Libtayo was able to deliver major pathological responses to 63% of patients prior to surgery. This raises the possibility that Libtayo could decrease the burden of these major and potentially disfiguring surgeries for the many patients who require them each year. We are pleased that concurrent with the ESMO presentation, these data were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Regarding next steps, we are talking to regulators about possible pathways to labeling and potential inclusion in the NCCN guidelines. Also at ESMO, we presented initial clinical data for Ubamatamab, our MUC16xCD3 bispecific developed for advanced ovarian cancer, our first clinical data for a CD3 bispecific in a solid tumor. In heavily pre-treated ovarian cancer population, we observed durable responses to this MUC16xCD3 monotherapy. In a patient subset whose tumors over expressed MUC16, response rates were as high as 31%. Most of the treatment emergent adverse events occurred with the initial step up dosing. Ubamatamab is being developed as a monotherapy as well as in combination with Libtayo as well as in combination with our MUC16 co-stim bispecific. We are looking forward to more data across these programs in 2023. In our ESMO investor presentation, we shared more detailed data for our PSMAxCD28 co-stim bispecific in combination with Libtayo, representing the first efficacy and safety data with this new class of bispecifics which we had initially top lined and discussed at our second quarter earnings. We have since continued to enroll patients in the study. We are planning to present updated data at a medical meeting in the first-half of 2023. Regarding our hem/onc pipeline, we are looking forward to data from Odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific as well as Linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific at the American Society of Hematology or ASH Annual Meeting in December. For Odronextamab, we will present pivotal Phase 2 data for both follicular lymphoma and diffused large B-cell lymphoma in two separate oral presentations. Upon discussions with the FDA, we are now targeting a second-half 2023 regulatory filing of this program. We hope to initiate combination studies with an appropriate CD28 co-stim bispecific in the near future. For Linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody, we remain on-track with development. And we are planning to file pending discussions with the FDA in 2023. We have now completed enrollment in our potentially pivotal Phase 2 study. As I mentioned earlier, data from this study will be updated at ASH. As with our Odronextamab, we are planning on initiating combination studies for Linvoseltamab with co-stimulatory bispecifics in the near future. We believe existing standard of care therapies leave significant room for improvement in these difficult-to-treat settings. And we have been encouraged by the interim efficacy and safety data we have generated today for both Odronextamab and Linvoseltamab. Finally at ESMO, we also shared initial data for our Maftivimab bispecific antibody in MET-altered non-small cell lung cancer. Responses were rich in patients with high levels of MET expression. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Even the modest over expression of MET may render lung cancer susceptible to this mechanism of action. And we are looking forward to the METxMET antibody-drug conjugate data next year. In summary, for oncology, a rich commentarial pipeline is delivering competitive data. And with our full ownership of Libtayo, we are excited about the potential to advance standard of care in oncology with our portfolio approach. Concluding with the Regeneron genetic medicines efforts where we continue to progress our pipeline and discovery engine. In September we and Alnylam reported promising data from our ongoing Phase 1 study of Alnylam HSD nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH. We are planning on initiating a Phase 2 studies shortly, which is just one part of our multi-pronged approach exploring multiple genetically validated targets for NASH. Also in September, we and Intellia announced initial data from the cardiomyopathy arm of our ongoing Phase 1 study of NTLA-2001. An investigational CRISPR-based therapy for the treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis, which show deep and sustained mean serum TTR reductions of over 90% and was generally well tolerated. Finally, in October our collaborators at Decibel Therapeutics announced FDA clearance where an NDA application for DB-OTO, a first virally delivered gene therapeutic product candidate designed to provide hearing to individuals with otoferlin-related hearing loss. This IND provides clearance to initiate a pediatric Phase 1/2 clinical trial in the United States. With that, I will turn it over to Marion.\nMarion McCourt: Thank you, George. Our third quarter performance reflects strength and across our commercial portfolio. We continue to extend our leadership position in additional therapeutic categories as part of our commitment to deliver life-changing medicines to patients in need. With Dupixent\u2019s approval in prurigo nodularis, Libtayo\u2019s anticipated approval in combination with chemotherapy in first line event non-small cell lung cancer and recent data demonstrating the compelling profile of Aflibercept8 mg, Regeneron\u2019s commercial business is poised to deliver long-term growth. Starting with EYLEA, which reached $2.4 billion in global net sales for the third quarter, this represents an 8% increase on a constant currency basis, a remarkable achievement for brand that launched 11 years ago. In the U.S., EYLEA net sales grew 11% year-over-year to $1.63 billion to again achieve over a million injections in the quarter. Despite the overall 2% sequential category decline in volume from the second to third quarter of 2022, EYLEA continued to grow across all indications gaining share from both branded and unbranded agents. In fact, EYLEA reached all-time highs in category share of approximately 50% with a commanding 75% share in the branded category. We continue to strengthen and extend EYLEA\u2019s leadership position in the anti-VEGF category as we recently announced the FDA has granted pediatric exclusivity for EYLEA, thereby, extending the period of EYLEA U.S. market exclusivity by an additional six months through May 17, 2024. Since announcing positive Phase 3 results earlier this year, there has been widespread excitement in the retina community about the Aflibercept8 mg dataset and Aflibercept8 mg\u2019s potential to become the future standard of care, if approved. Next to Libtayo, total global product sales were $143 million, growing 25% on a constant currency basis. In the U.S., net sales grew 21% to $95 million based on growth in our lung and non-melanoma skin indications. We see particular opportunity for growth in lung cancer over time. In monotherapy, there are already steady increases in prescribers and total utilization. We are launch-ready for the potential chemotherapy combination approval which significantly expands the patient opportunity. And finally to Dupixent, third quarter global net sales were $2.3 billion, up 45% on a constant currency basis. In the U.S., net sales grew 45% to $1.82 billion driven by a robust demand across atopic dermatitis, asthma, and nasal polyps. Growth was also driven by a rapid launch trajectory across recent indications including eosinophilic esophagitis and pediatric atopic dermatitis where Dupixent is the only biologic to be approved from infancy through adulthood. Starting with dermatology, in atopic dermatitis, Dupixent is the leading first line systemic therapy with strong uptake across the spectrum of moderate to severe disease, and across age groups. The ongoing launching short in as young as six months is professing very well, providing release shot in MS families as well as enforcing the safety of Dupixent for all age groups. We've also expanded Dupixent's leadership in dermatology. Following its approval in prurigo nodularis, Dupixent is the only FDA approved medicine for this chronic stabilitating skin disease that affects approximately 75,000 adults in the U.S. Early launch indicators are positive with patients already being initiated on therapy. Dupixent also continue to perform well in the highly competitive asthma market, with steady growth in prescriptions and new patient starts, as well as nasal polyps. Early launch performance in eosinophilic esophagitis has been very strong, with broad adoption from both gastroenterologists and allergists. The medical community has embraced Dupixent as patients previously had very limited options. Dupixent is the only medicine indicated to treat eosinophilic esophagitis, and is the only treatment shown to address the underlying disease causes resulting in unprecedented symptom release. There are presently 50,000 adults and adolescent patients in the U.S., and we continue to advance our clinical efforts in younger patients where substantial unmet need remains. Outside the U.S., Dupixent net sales were 506 million, going 44% on a constant currency basis. There is rapid uptake across approved indications, and we continue to execute on recent launches, and expand into new geographies. As part of this, Regeneron's increased presence in key international market supports efforts to bring Dupixent to even more patients. In conclusion, our third quarter performance demonstrates strength in growth across our commercial portfolio. We are successfully executing on initiative to deliver life-changing medicines to patients, and advancing strategies to maximize new and upcoming launches. Our commercial portfolio is positioned well to drive long-term and sustainable growth. Now, I will turn the call to Bob.\nRobert Landry: Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted. Regeneron performed well in the third quarter, with growth from key brands and execution across the business continuing to drive strong financial results on both the top and bottom line. Excluding global revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, third quarter total revenues increased 11% year-over-year to $2.9 billion, demonstrating continued growth momentum from our core business and reflecting the favorable impact of the Libtayo transaction. Third quarter total diluted net income per share was $11.14 on net income of $1.3 billion. Beginning with collaboration revenue, and starting with Bayer; third quarter 2022 ex-U.S. product sales were 817 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis, versus third quarter of 2021. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $333 million, of which, $315 million related to our share of EYLEA in those profits outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $711 million in the third quarter of 2022, and grew 22% from the prior year, driven by Dupixent. Recall that in connection with the Libtayo transaction, we increased the repayment of our antibody collaboration development balance from 10% to 20% of antibody collaboration profits. A portion of this step-up is recorded as a reduction to antibody collaboration revenues, while another portion is recorded as R&D expense. Given Regeneron is now recording its full 50% share of antibody collaboration R&D expense has incurred, previously Regeneron had only recognized a partial share of its antibody collaboration R&D expense has incurred, with the remaining share of expenses added to the antibody development balance. Also, as we highlighted last quarter, in accordance with the agreement, we recorded a one time development balance repayment of $57 million as an incremental reduction to Sanofi collaboration revenue in the third quarter of 2022. We have posted to our Web site supporting materials to further explain the accounting associated with this and other elements of the Libtayo transaction. Moving now to our operating expenses, R&D increased 38% year-over-year to $817 million, partially driven by the impact of the Libtayo transaction, which affects R&D in two ways. First, Regeneron now records all R&D expense for Libtayo, which was previously shared equally with Sanofi. Second, as I mentioned earlier, Regeneron now records our full 50% share of antibody collaborations spend for Dupixent and Itepekimab. SG&A expense increased 20% year-over-year, to $467 million primarily driven due to incremental costs related to assuming global rights to Libtayo. Cost of goods sold in the third quarter was $109 million, and product gross margin in the quarter increased to 94% as compared to 90.2% in the prior year. The more favorable gross margin was driven by the non-recurrence of REGEN-COV sales in the current period and the removal of the payment to Sanofi for their share of U.S. Libtayo gross margin. Finally, the third quarter 2022 effective tax rate was 12.1% compared to 10.8% in the prior year. Shifting now to cash flow in the balance sheet, year-to-date in 2022, Regeneron has generated $2.9 billion in free cash flow, and ended the third quarter of 2022 with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $10.3 billion. We remain focused on leveraging our strong financial position to deliver long-term value for shareholders. Over the first nine months of 2022, we have deployed in excess of $2.8 billion in capital; we have executed approximately $1.2 billion in business development initiatives including the $900 million acquisition of Libtayo rights. Additionally, we have repurchased over $1.6 billion of our shares, including over $900 million in the third quarter alone. As of September 30, we had approximately $1.2 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization, and we remain opportunistic buyers. As we approach the end of the year, we've made some minor changes to our 2022 guidance ranges. A complete summary of our latest full-year financial guidance is available on our press release issued earlier this morning. In addition to these changes, I would also like to provide some initial thoughts on our 2023 expense outlook. We continue to make investments to advance our pipeline and position the company for long-term growth. We expect R&D investment to grow in 2023 comparable to our slightly above the nine-month year-to-date growth rate reported earlier today. The incremental R&D investment in 2023 will be driven by advancing our immuno-oncology, hematology, immunology, and genetics medicine pipeline, as well as the continued expansion of our R&D organization. In addition, 2023 will be the first full-year reflecting the impact of the Libtayo transaction where we record 100% of the global R&D spend for Libtayo and our full 50% share of the Sanofi antibody collaboration R&D spend as incurred. For SG&A in 2023, we currently project growth in the mid teens versus 2022 given we'll be recording a full-year of global Libtayo expenses along with targeted investments in the build-out of our international infrastructure. Finally, for other operating income and expense in the third quarter of 2022, we recognized the remaining $44 million of deferred income related to previously-received upfront payments in development milestone for Fasinumab as a result of the program discontinuation. We do not currently expect any material other operating income or expense in the fourth quarter of 2022, in 2023, and beyond absent any new transactions. In conclusion, Regeneron has performed exceptionally well in the first nine-months of 2022, and our strong financial position enables continued investment to drive long-term growth. With that, I will pass the call back to Ryan.\nRyan Crowe: Thank you, Bob. So, Towanda, this concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. With the number of callers in the queue, I'd like to ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible. As a result, we'll only be able to answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. So, Towanda, please open the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Evan Seigerman with BMO. Your line is open.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my questions, and congrats on the progress. So, with nearly $13 billion on the balance sheet and minimal debt, can you provide more color on your capital allocation priorities? Would you consider business development on a larger scale and/or issuing a dividend?\nRobert Landry: Evan, hi, good morning, it's Bob. With regards to capital allocation, and demonstrated today by our growth in R&D in the 2023 forward guidance, we are going to continue to invest, first and foremost, in the R&D pipeline that we have. We issued our 10-Q this morning, within the MD&A; you'll see a plethora of trials that are currently ongoing. And as George mentioned in his script, we're very bullish with regards to what is in the pipeline. Now, again with regards to business development, it's not a [and or and or] [Ph], right, as you saw in what we've done in the first nine months of 2022, where we do think there are opportunities and where we do think we can do collaborations where one plus one is three, then we're absolutely going to take that opportunity, and I think Checkmate was a good example of that. And I would expect that you'd see more of that. With regards to your question on dividends, it's never a never. Obviously, that tool is in our tool chest if we do decide to play that card. As of right now, we don't have dividends in the foreseeable future in our plan. We have been very opportunistic with regards to buybacks. Again, the MD&A issued earlier today, the 10-Q will show you what we've been buying back our shares. Again, we'll remain opportunistic buyers. And we do have a remaining $1.2 billion remaining under our current $3 billion authorization.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks, Bob. So, Towanda, please have the next question on, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren with Cowen. Your line is open.\nTyler Van Buren: Hi, guys. Good morning. Congratulations on the great quarter. So, I just pulled up the Odronextamab and 5458 NASH abstracts, and it'd be great to get a brief preview from you guys on what you need -- what you believe you ultimately need to show at the conference to be competitive relative to what others have shown?\nLeonard Schleifer: Yes, I don't think we want to scoop ourselves given that the conference is coming up pretty soon, Tyler. But Odronextamab has the potential of being a very important molecule. We recognize that there are some people ahead of us, and we recognize that some of the most recent timelines are pushed back a little bit based on recent regulatory feedback. The regulators have recently been focused on having Phase 3 trials substantially enrolled at the time of submission before they'll grant accelerated approval. But we are confident in the profile of Odronextamab. And as George says, there is also the future possibility of combinations with other things in our pipeline that could really even leapfrog.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks, Len. Next question, please, Towanda?\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nSalveen Richter: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On EYLEA, what are you observing in the market between yourselves and Roche for the Vabysmo launch?\nMarion McCourt: So, happy to give more characterization, as I mentioned, we see EYLEA continuing to perform extremely well, reaching all-times high category share of 50%, and now as well growth in the overall branded market where we participate with other branded agents, including Roche. One thing I will mention just to give a bit more insight is that EYLEA captured growth coming primarily from Lucentis and also from Avastin. And, in fact, if you put the Roche portfolio together, the growth of EYLEA obviously was positive, while there was a decline in a real market share for the Roche products combined.\nRyan Crowe: Thank you, Marion. Next question, Towanda?\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMatthew Harrison: Great, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. George, I was wondering if you could just comment on your outlook for the COPD study for Dupixent and how you think about that market opportunity? Thanks.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Actually COPD has been a very difficult disease for new therapies in biologics in particular. We think that there is a category of patients with COPD who have or are marked by more of what we call Th2-type inflammation. We think that, as I said in my remarks, that there's this unifying hypothesis there are a lot of Th2-type diseases that manifest in different ways. We believe that this subset of patients with COPD may maybe or fit into that category. And being able to benefit these patients in [technical difficulty] terms of either reducing their exacerbations and/or improving their lung function would really make a difference to these patients. And so, we're anxiously awaiting the data, and we're hopeful that we will have another set of patients where we might be able to demonstrate that Dupixent could really make a difference.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks, George. Towanda, next question?\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nTim Anderson: Thank you so much. Lilly will be launching Lebrikizumab in '23 in atopic derm, and they have data that looks comparable to Dupixent, at least in this one indication. Pretty much a direct competitor, although not identical on mechanism, they know the derma space because it halts, and the positioning is going to be that they can dose every month versus Dupixent, which is every two weeks. So, I'm wondering if you have any strong views on that product or if you think that it's going to be total nonstarter which is pretty much the consensus view I get?\nLeonard Schleifer: Maybe Marion can comment on it. But look, there's room for competitors in this market. We're really modestly penetrated in the opportunity. I don't think that the profile that you say is actually going to be suppressed. We've seen it so far, all that's similar. We have the earliest, from infancy already to adulthood. That's a big deal, okay. In addition, the fact that many of these people have other comorbidities, whether it be asthma or nasal polyps, for example, and they can get, if they do have comorbidities, this single drug can treat both. It's a very big differentiator. So, I think when you're the market leader, when you're so far ahead, when you have really a differentiated profile you have an advantage. Obviously, Lilly is a fine company; they know what they're doing. But as I said, there's room, frequently, when new, good drugs come to market there is a growth of the market. And we're not going after a fixed number of patients; we're actually growing those patients. Marion, I don't know if you want to add anything?\nMarion McCourt: So, I would just add that most of the key opinion leaders that we speak to recognize that the dual mechanism of action, the NTIL-4 coupled with NTIL-13 is very, very important, so certainly efficacy shouldn't be assumed. There's also reinforcement on the incredible efficacy that's seen for patients with moderate-through-severe disease. And, obviously, real world experience is compelling. The administration with Dupixent is really quite straightforward, it's self-administration, and we actually see there the active patient or parent involvement has been very helpful in establishing Dupixent. But certainly as Len mentioned, expanding the education in category to bring more atopic dermatitis patients into the treatment continuum is very positive for patients, and certainly for Dupixent.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Not to pile on, but since -- just to add on to what Len was saying. I mean the fact that the IL-13 have failed in these other important Th2 inflammation-driven diseases, like asthma and like COPD and others right now really does suggest that they are not fully addressing the Th2 inflammation, both in any one particular disease, but also as Len said, so many of these individuals, if you just look at our label or any label that describes these diseases, they suffer from other allergic comorbidities. And so, obviously, it can make such a difference for a patient where one drug can treat a systemic disease as opposed to treating the disease only in one of the many compartments where it manifests itself. I think this is the way I think medicine in the field should be moving. This is a systemic disease where Th2 inflammation is probably rampant in many compartments in the body, you don't only want to treat it in one compartment, you want to treat the entire body. And that's what we've been showing systematically, by going one disease after another with Dupixent. It works in every compartment, and it broadly attacks the underlying inflammation that's related and causative in all of these diseases.\nRyan Crowe: Okay, thank you for that response. Towanda, can we go to the next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMohit Bansal: Great, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the progress. If I could probe little bit further on the comments you made about the growth of anti-VEGF market, you said it's about 4% year-over-year. Seems like bit of slowdown from what the high growth we have seen. Could you elaborate it further, do you see -- just one quarter, do you see any underlying trend there and it because of the high growth we saw post-COVID, which is tapering down, if you could help us understand that? Thank you.\nMarion McCourt: I think it's very difficult to extrapolate one quarter. Certainly I did mentioned that there'd been a sequential decline of about 2% going from the second quarter into the third quarter in the overall anti-VEGF category. But I think it's really difficult to extrapolate from that. The numbers you shared on overall year-over-year growth of category, at about 4%, we recognize as well. I think we'll have to see as a bit more time goes by. But it's really difficult to draw conclusions on what may or may not have occurred in a one-quarter period.\nMohit Bansal: Got it.\nLeonard Schleifer: There's still quite a bit of room of growth in the diabetic eye diseases area. We still see a decent growth there in that category.\nMohit Bansal: Helpful, thank you.\nLeonard Schleifer: Next question.\nRyan Crowe: Thank you. Thank you, Len, and Marion, and Mohit. Next question, please, Towanda?\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Raymond with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nChristopher Raymond: Hey, thanks. Just another question maybe on the VEGF market and EYLEA specifically, so in our checks we get a sense that there's some docs who believe that Vabysmo confers differentiated efficacy. But on the other hand, there's still a sizable amount of docs who've yet to see a patient for follow-up after the first dose. So, sort of just curious if, in the field, you're seeing a difference in perception of Vabysmo by time of experience, that is any discernable change in perception with the more patient follow-up they've had? Thanks.\nMarion McCourt: I think it's probably best that Roche answer questions on what they're hearing about use. I'll just share at this point, I haven't heard characterization or that use is still at a low level, in fact quite modest. I can characterize the EYLEA performance, as I did, in terms of market leadership and the growth we see in our business in terms of market share and other parameters, and that is across indications, and certainly substantially creating EYLEA as leader in the anti-VEGF category. And, obviously, we're very enthusiastic as is the retina community, probably even more important about the possibilities and potential of Aflibercept8 mg if approved in the future.\nRyan Crowe: Thank you, Marion. Next question, please.\nOperator: Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow with UBS. Your line is open.\nColin Bristow: Hey, good morning, and congrats on the quarter. So, on EYLEA, in '23, we're starting to see [confirmary] [Ph] updates. So, I was wondering, could you just speak to how you see the market share evolving over the course of '23 in light of Vabysmo, and then, obviously, biosimilars? And then just as we think about high-dose EYLEA in the back-half of the year, anything you can say in terms of anticipated OpEx changes? Thank you.\nMarion McCourt: So, as a start, we don't predict future market share performance, so I'm going to stay away from specifics in that area. Certainly, not only this quarter but over several quarters, we've been able to demonstrate continuing strong performance with EYLEA as anti-VEGF category leader. And certainly we'll continue to work on that. And as agents have entered the market, our competitive readiness abilities have been very strong. But most important, frankly, it's the profile of EYLEA; the clinical attributes, the safety of the product, the breadth of indications, ease of access for physicians and patients, but going forward, certainly we will be very much prepared to launch Aflibercept8 mg and you know, as we get into that launch potentially with an FDA approval we will be able to give more characterization, but as George and Len described today, the profile of Aflibercept8 mg and opinion leaders in the retina community confirm that this profile potentially has all the ingredients to become standard of care, and certainly that's what we work on all the benefits of vision coupled with safety, and now this potential of substantial durability that hasn\u2019t been seen before in the category.\nRobert Landry: Collin, it's Bob. With regards to OpEx, I mean Marion and I will do what we always do on the brands. We'll look at what totally makes sense. I mean as you know, it's kind of to find number of retinal docs. It's not as if we are going into tremendously new area that creates a lot of new touch points on it. And on top of that, Marion's team right now is a very tight functioning sales rep team on the top of their game. So, again, we don\u2019t expect some gigantic pivots in this area, but again, we will make sure that we fund this appropriately and that it is -- the commercial side of it is going to match how well the clinical data is going to stand up on it. Thanks.\nColin Bristow: Thank you.\nRyan Crowe: Okay. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC. Your line is open.\nBrian Abrahams: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the continued execution and innovation. On Costimulatory Bispecifics, by specific, now that you have more time with the evolving data, any views on predictors of response of durability there, and I'm curious how your learnings might shape your latest thoughts on threading the therapeutic window, both for the PSMA as you accelerate the trail enrollment, as well as your other Costimulatory Bispecifics? Thanks.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. I think that our data actually shows that with the remarkable response rates, which we saw especially going to the higher doses, yet it's not as if you have to look hard to find biomarkers for response, the number just to remind you that is at the highest dose; three out of the four patients had very profound responses. So, response predictors are not an issue, but you also pointed the question about therapeutic window, certainly we are seeing autoimmune-related side effects associated with these responses. And so, we are working hard now, we are actually -- we have accelerated enrollment in this program, we are trying to understand more of the relationship between the responders, and having these sorts of new side effects, I mean one very positive perspective is we don\u2019t see these series autoimmune side effects in people who don\u2019t see responses. So, it's the people who benefit, who do get the autoimmune side effects these have obviously coupled, it's because I think the drug is doing what we intent it to do. I think this is some of the most exciting data in the history of immunotherapy that you can take what people have historically called a \"Cold tumor,\" that has almost no responses to immunotherapy or repeating one therapy, and get these incredibly high rate of very deep and so-called durable responses, and we will continue to work on improving the therapeutic window. In terms of the bispecific program more broadly, and I want to hearken back, Len sort of answered the previous question about CD20 and BCMA, but I do want to amplify on some of these comments, which is we think that there are indeed a very small number of bispecs in the CD20 space, and the BCMA space, which are actually looking quite competitive with each other, including ours, the emerging data suggests the efficacy and safety profiles of these agents will be competitive with each other, you will see our updated data, we will present it at ASH, but I think what's emerging is that these small numbers of competitors will exist in this field. I think that there is going to be room to these, there is actually a lot of patients in this late-stage settings who need treatment. So, I think that there is going to room for these small numbers of competitors there. But the future is going to be about moving into earlier lines of therapy, and there is going to therapies there about how one executes designs to those studies, the co-therapies, more standard co-therapies that are used there, and so there is going to be a lot of actually art to have one move these agents into the earlier lines of therapies, but the other very important thing is in addition to moving into earlier lines of therapy with these more standard combinations, where as I said, there is going to a lot of art to doing those studies, it's going to be of novel combos. And as we just talk about, with the CD20 and costim bispecifics that we're now showing that we are leading the field with, in prostate cancer we have very similar type agents now, that we are going to be combining with our CD20 bispecific in lymphoma and with our BCMA bispecific in myeloma, and we think that these are going to really have the opportunity to continue to change the game, and change the practice in medicine for these patients. So, it's about taking agents that R&D is going to be competitive and quite competitive with each other in these late stage settings, where I think they're all going to be making important contributions to the treatment in patients, but then moving in very artful ways to these earlier lines of therapy and using them there, where I think there is also going to be room, there is also going to be room for differentiation as well as the future, we are making these combos look all of these exciting opportunities we have in our portfolio can really take the utilization of these agents and the treatments of these patients, and these cancers to a whole another level, as we believe we are already showing that we are doing in prostate cancer.\nRyan Crowe: George, there was one question about biomarkers in prostate cancer, maybe you might just comment on how quickly you can use PSA you know, as studies after paper works is exposed to both agents?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Right. And in some of the data we have already shown, and we will continue to show, many of our patients have remarkably high PSA levels, because they have very high burden of disease, as all know depending on the assay and the lab and so forth, normal PSA levels are in the low single-digits, you know, maybe one to four, consider the highest levels. We have patients who entered into our study with PSAs in the 100s, 500s, 600 and so forth. And we saw with this combination treatment, as soon as you put the combination on board essentially at the next time point that we measured within three weeks or so, we saw dramatic drops in the order of 99% reductions in the PSA. And these are really astounding results, and now where we continue to follow our patients over time we have seen that, for example, bone lesions have entirely normalized, and so forth. So, the effects are incredibly rapid as reflected in the PSA. And to the point about predicting which patients respond, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you had patients who had relatively low burden as measured by PSA, where their PSA was measured in let's say, 40 to 50 range or whether you had incredibly high PSAs in 500 to 600 range, those patients seem to similarly respond in terms of very dramatic, very profound drops in the PSA within weeks of starting therapy. And as we continue to follow these patient's incredibly durable responses, first patient has now been out for more than a year. Their immune side effects have resolved, whereas their complete remission has remained completely intact, and as I said, not only completely normalized the PSA levels, but the bone lesions and so forth have all normalized at least as measured by bone scans and so forth. So, this really has the potential to be so game-changing for these late stage patients who really have at this point no other real recourse.\nRyan Crowe: Thank you, Len and George. I think we have time for one more question. Towanda?\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our final question. Our final question comes from the line of Carter Gould that Barclays. Your line is open.\nCarter Gould: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me, and taking the time. Maybe just come back to -- for Marion, how we should think about your expectations for timeline to receive a J Code for high dose EYLEA next year, you know, we have seen in the past pretty varied timelines here in terms of like AVEVO got their's trending around, Eli Lilly and Roche clearly had a more pace process, and I guess more to the point, should our expectation be that's more of like a January 1, 2024 type of event that's potential for J Code, maybe in the later part of '23? Thank you.\nMarion McCourt: Carter, thank you for the question, and certainly we will stay very close on this. And obviously the importance of new BLA and new J Code is important. In terms of timing, I would need a crystal ball you know, certainly would share with you, we will be working very closely with the proper organizations and officials, but at this time it's too early to give anything definitive on expectation for J Code timing.\nLeonard Schleifer: Yes. My own perspective on this and slightly different is that I'm not convinced in this particular setting that the J Code is the end of the all of -- like, you are going to see these dramatic changes in uptakes post J Code, so -- \nCarter Gould: Okay, thank you.\nRyan Crowe: I think that's all we have time for today. Thank you everyone for joining the call. As always, the Investor Relation team is standing by for any follow-up questions you may have. Have a great day, everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Marion McCourt",
            "content": "Thank you, George. Our third quarter performance reflects strength and across our commercial portfolio. We continue to extend our leadership position in additional therapeutic categories as part of our commitment to deliver life-changing medicines to patients in need. With Dupixent's approval in prurigo nodularis, Libtayo's anticipated approval in combination with chemotherapy in first line event non-small cell lung cancer and recent data demonstrating the compelling profile of Aflibercept8 mg, Regeneron's commercial business is poised to deliver long-term growth. Starting with EYLEA, which reached $2.4 billion in global net sales for the third quarter, this represents an 8% increase on a constant currency basis, a remarkable achievement for brand that launched 11 years ago. In the U.S., EYLEA net sales grew 11% year-over-year to $1.63 billion to again achieve over a million injections in the quarter. Despite the overall 2% sequential category decline in volume from the second to third quarter of 2022, EYLEA continued to grow across all indications gaining share from both branded and unbranded agents. In fact, EYLEA reached all-time highs in category share of approximately 50% with a commanding 75% share in the branded category. We continue to strengthen and extend EYLEA's leadership position in the anti-VEGF category as we recently announced the FDA has granted pediatric exclusivity for EYLEA, thereby, extending the period of EYLEA U.S. market exclusivity by an additional six months through May 17, 2024. Since announcing positive Phase 3 results earlier this year, there has been widespread excitement in the retina community about the Aflibercept8 mg dataset and Aflibercept8 mg's potential to become the future standard of care, if approved. Next to Libtayo, total global product sales were $143 million, growing 25% on a constant currency basis. In the U.S., net sales grew 21% to $95 million based on growth in our lung and non-melanoma skin indications. We see particular opportunity for growth in lung cancer over time. In monotherapy, there are already steady increases in prescribers and total utilization. We are launch-ready for the potential chemotherapy combination approval which significantly expands the patient opportunity. And finally to Dupixent, third quarter global net sales were $2.3 billion, up 45% on a constant currency basis. In the U.S., net sales grew 45% to $1.82 billion driven by a robust demand across atopic dermatitis, asthma, and nasal polyps. Growth was also driven by a rapid launch trajectory across recent indications including eosinophilic esophagitis and pediatric atopic dermatitis where Dupixent is the only biologic to be approved from infancy through adulthood. Starting with dermatology, in atopic dermatitis, Dupixent is the leading first line systemic therapy with strong uptake across the spectrum of moderate to severe disease, and across age groups. The ongoing launching short in as young as six months is professing very well, providing release shot in MS families as well as enforcing the safety of Dupixent for all age groups. We've also expanded Dupixent's leadership in dermatology. Following its approval in prurigo nodularis, Dupixent is the only FDA approved medicine for this chronic stabilitating skin disease that affects approximately 75,000 adults in the U.S. Early launch indicators are positive with patients already being initiated on therapy. Dupixent also continue to perform well in the highly competitive asthma market, with steady growth in prescriptions and new patient starts, as well as nasal polyps. Early launch performance in eosinophilic esophagitis has been very strong, with broad adoption from both gastroenterologists and allergists. The medical community has embraced Dupixent as patients previously had very limited options. Dupixent is the only medicine indicated to treat eosinophilic esophagitis, and is the only treatment shown to address the underlying disease causes resulting in unprecedented symptom release. There are presently 50,000 adults and adolescent patients in the U.S., and we continue to advance our clinical efforts in younger patients where substantial unmet need remains. Outside the U.S., Dupixent net sales were 506 million, going 44% on a constant currency basis. There is rapid uptake across approved indications, and we continue to execute on recent launches, and expand into new geographies. As part of this, Regeneron's increased presence in key international market supports efforts to bring Dupixent to even more patients. In conclusion, our third quarter performance demonstrates strength in growth across our commercial portfolio. We are successfully executing on initiative to deliver life-changing medicines to patients, and advancing strategies to maximize new and upcoming launches. Our commercial portfolio is positioned well to drive long-term and sustainable growth. Now, I will turn the call to Bob. So, happy to give more characterization, as I mentioned, we see EYLEA continuing to perform extremely well, reaching all-times high category share of 50%, and now as well growth in the overall branded market where we participate with other branded agents, including Roche. One thing I will mention just to give a bit more insight is that EYLEA captured growth coming primarily from Lucentis and also from Avastin. And, in fact, if you put the Roche portfolio together, the growth of EYLEA obviously was positive, while there was a decline in a real market share for the Roche products combined. So, I would just add that most of the key opinion leaders that we speak to recognize that the dual mechanism of action, the NTIL-4 coupled with NTIL-13 is very, very important, so certainly efficacy shouldn't be assumed. There's also reinforcement on the incredible efficacy that's seen for patients with moderate-through-severe disease. And, obviously, real world experience is compelling. The administration with Dupixent is really quite straightforward, it's self-administration, and we actually see there the active patient or parent involvement has been very helpful in establishing Dupixent. But certainly as Len mentioned, expanding the education in category to bring more atopic dermatitis patients into the treatment continuum is very positive for patients, and certainly for Dupixent. I think it's very difficult to extrapolate one quarter. Certainly I did mentioned that there'd been a sequential decline of about 2% going from the second quarter into the third quarter in the overall anti-VEGF category. But I think it's really difficult to extrapolate from that. The numbers you shared on overall year-over-year growth of category, at about 4%, we recognize as well. I think we'll have to see as a bit more time goes by. But it's really difficult to draw conclusions on what may or may not have occurred in a one-quarter period. I think it's probably best that Roche answer questions on what they're hearing about use. I'll just share at this point, I haven't heard characterization or that use is still at a low level, in fact quite modest. I can characterize the EYLEA performance, as I did, in terms of market leadership and the growth we see in our business in terms of market share and other parameters, and that is across indications, and certainly substantially creating EYLEA as leader in the anti-VEGF category. And, obviously, we're very enthusiastic as is the retina community, probably even more important about the possibilities and potential of Aflibercept8 mg if approved in the future. So, as a start, we don't predict future market share performance, so I'm going to stay away from specifics in that area. Certainly, not only this quarter but over several quarters, we've been able to demonstrate continuing strong performance with EYLEA as anti-VEGF category leader. And certainly we'll continue to work on that. And as agents have entered the market, our competitive readiness abilities have been very strong. But most important, frankly, it's the profile of EYLEA; the clinical attributes, the safety of the product, the breadth of indications, ease of access for physicians and patients, but going forward, certainly we will be very much prepared to launch Aflibercept8 mg and you know, as we get into that launch potentially with an FDA approval we will be able to give more characterization, but as George and Len described today, the profile of Aflibercept8 mg and opinion leaders in the retina community confirm that this profile potentially has all the ingredients to become standard of care, and certainly that's what we work on all the benefits of vision coupled with safety, and now this potential of substantial durability that hasn't been seen before in the category. Carter, thank you for the question, and certainly we will stay very close on this. And obviously the importance of new BLA and new J Code is important. In terms of timing, I would need a crystal ball you know, certainly would share with you, we will be working very closely with the proper organizations and officials, but at this time it's too early to give anything definitive on expectation for J Code timing."

            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone joining today's call. Regeneron's strong operational momentum continued in the third quarter, highlighted by important developments across our pipeline and outstanding commercial execution. Total revenues for the quarter increased by 11% compared to last year when excluding contributions from our COVID antibody cocktail. With global net sales of Dupixent and Libtayo, as well as U.S. net sales of EYLEA once again reaching new all-time quarterly highs and growing by double digits. Before diving deeper into our commercial results, I'd like to review some of the recent progress we have made across our pipeline, starting with the striking pivotal data that we reported, in September, for our investigational Aflibercept8 mg, which we believe could ultimately transform the treatment landscape for patients. With nearly 90% of DME patients and 80% of wet AMD patients able to sustain 16-weeks maintenance dosing through 48 weeks of treatment, we believe Aflibercept8 mg may shift the current treatment paradigm, with more patients receiving less frequent injections, while achieving visual acuity gains anatomical improvements, and a safety profile comparable to EYLEA. It has proven to be very difficult to decrease the treatment burden beyond what we were able to achieve with EYLEA over a decade ago with many potential treatments failing either due to suboptimal visual outcomes or safety issues. A recently issued anti-VEGF agent did not demonstrate in pivotal studies that the majority of patients in either disease were able to sustain 16-week maintenance dosing throughout the first year of treatment, supporting our view that Aflibercept8 mg has the potential to become the next generation's standard of care anti-VEGF treatment, assuming regulatory approval. We plan to submit the Aflibercept8 mg pivotal data to the FDA under a single BLA at the end of this year, and have decided to use a previously granted priority review voucher to expedite the FDA review process. Pre-launch planning is already underway, with a potential FDA approval by late August 2023. In addition to the pivotal Aflibercept8 mg data, Regeneron continued to make notable progress in our immunology and oncology pipelines. Starting with immunology, in September, we received FDA approval for Dupixent in prurigo nodularis, the first systemic therapy for this indication, and the fifth disease for which Dupixent is now approved. So far this year, Dupixent has received four U.S. or E.U. regulatory approvals, expanding the treatment-eligible population by approximately 225,000 patients, including in two diseases that previously had no FDA-approved systemic therapies. In the first-half of next year, we are looking forward the E.U. regulatory decisions for eosinophilic esophagitis, prurigo nodularis, and atopic dermatitis in patients as young as six months. With these potential additional indications, approximately 200,000 more patients with these type 2 inflammatory diseases could benefit from Dupixent's unmatched clinical profile. Additionally, we expect pivotal data readouts for Dupixent in chronic inducible cold-urticaria, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the first-half of next year. Moving to oncology, where the depth and breadth of our pipeline has positioned Regeneron to ultimately become a global leader. We presented several datasets at this year's European Society for Medical Oncology Annual Meeting, further underscoring the importance of Libtayo as the foundation for our overall oncology strategy. George will review the data in more detail during his remarks, but we were particularly encouraged by the results for Libtayo monotherapy in neoadjuvant CSCC as well as Libtayo in combination with Fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody, in first-line metastatic melanoma. We also presented monotherapy data for our MUC16 by CD3 bispecific in recurrent ovarian cancer, which has the potential to be combined with Libtayo as well as data for our METxMET biparatopic bispecific in MET-altered non-small cell lung cancer. I'd also note the early but very exciting results for our PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with Libtayo, which showed promising anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The patients enrolled in our study have a poor prognosis, with an expected survival of one to two years depending up on their treatment history. Given prostate cancer has been largely unresponsive to PD-1 inhibition and immunotherapy in general, there is a clear need for new treatments. In 2020 alone, there were over 375,000 deaths globally from prostate cancer, and it was the second leading cause of cancer death in American men. We continue to expand our costimulatory bispecific efforts in prostate cancer with an acceleration in enrollment in our first immune study since we reported our top line results, in August. And we look forward to updating you on this program in the first-half of next year. Now turning to our commercial performance, in the third quarter, EYLEA global net sales grew 8% at constant currency to $2.4 billion. In the U.S. EYLEA net sales were $1.63 billion, up 11% year-over-year, and outperforming the anti-VEGF category growth of only 4%. Despite recent branded and biosimilar entrants, EYLEA set a new all-time high for anti-VEGF category share in the United States. Dupixent continued to grow at a remarkable pace bolstered by approvals in new diseases and younger patient populations in previously approved indications. In the third quarter, global net product sales were $2.3 billion, up 45% at constant currency compared to last year, reflecting growth across all indications and all geographies. Dupixent's differentiated clinical profile and ability to effectively treat more and more patients in both currently approved indications and potentially for additional type-2 inflammatory diseases is expected to drive strong growth in the future. Libtayo total net sales grew 25% globally at constant currency, to $143 million in the third quarter, including 21% growth in United States driven by non-melanoma skin cancer indications and monotherapy non-small cell lung cancer. At the start of the third quarter, we acquired global rights to Libtayo from Sanofi, with potential future combinations including with chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer as well as other pipeline agents in development, we believe Libtayo is poised to become a more meaningful revenue contributor over time. We are excited about the strong commercial performance for our core products with compelling efficacy, safety, and durability data that we reported for Aflibercept8 mg, as well as the notable progress we have made advancing our pipeline, particularly in oncology. Our pipeline now includes approximately 35 product candidates in clinical development including a number of marketed products that we are investigating for additional indications. Some of which, George will discuss in a moment. In closing, our strategy continues to focus on investing in our internal R&D capabilities while exploring potential collaborations that will enable us to fully realize the power of our science. We remain confident in this strategy and in our growth prospects as well as in our ability to deliver breakthroughs to patients and value to shareholders. Now, I will turn the call over to George. Yes, I don't think we want to scoop ourselves given that the conference is coming up pretty soon, Tyler. But Odronextamab has the potential of being a very important molecule. We recognize that there are some people ahead of us, and we recognize that some of the most recent timelines are pushed back a little bit based on recent regulatory feedback. The regulators have recently been focused on having Phase 3 trials substantially enrolled at the time of submission before they'll grant accelerated approval. But we are confident in the profile of Odronextamab. And as George says, there is also the future possibility of combinations with other things in our pipeline that could really even leapfrog. Maybe Marion can comment on it. But look, there's room for competitors in this market. We're really modestly penetrated in the opportunity. I don't think that the profile that you say is actually going to be suppressed. We've seen it so far, all that's similar. We have the earliest, from infancy already to adulthood. That's a big deal, okay. In addition, the fact that many of these people have other comorbidities, whether it be asthma or nasal polyps, for example, and they can get, if they do have comorbidities, this single drug can treat both. It's a very big differentiator. So, I think when you're the market leader, when you're so far ahead, when you have really a differentiated profile you have an advantage. Obviously, Lilly is a fine company; they know what they're doing. But as I said, there's room, frequently, when new, good drugs come to market there is a growth of the market. And we're not going after a fixed number of patients; we're actually growing those patients. Marion, I don't know if you want to add anything? There's still quite a bit of room of growth in the diabetic eye diseases area. We still see a decent growth there in that category. Next question. Yes. My own perspective on this and slightly different is that I'm not convinced in this particular setting that the J Code is the end of the all of -- like, you are going to see these dramatic changes in uptakes post J Code, so --"

            "content": "Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted. Regeneron performed well in the third quarter, with growth from key brands and execution across the business continuing to drive strong financial results on both the top and bottom line. Excluding global revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, third quarter total revenues increased 11% year-over-year to $2.9 billion, demonstrating continued growth momentum from our core business and reflecting the favorable impact of the Libtayo transaction. Third quarter total diluted net income per share was $11.14 on net income of $1.3 billion. Beginning with collaboration revenue, and starting with Bayer; third quarter 2022 ex-U.S. product sales were 817 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis, versus third quarter of 2021. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $333 million, of which, $315 million related to our share of EYLEA in those profits outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $711 million in the third quarter of 2022, and grew 22% from the prior year, driven by Dupixent. Recall that in connection with the Libtayo transaction, we increased the repayment of our antibody collaboration development balance from 10% to 20% of antibody collaboration profits. A portion of this step-up is recorded as a reduction to antibody collaboration revenues, while another portion is recorded as R&D expense. Given Regeneron is now recording its full 50% share of antibody collaboration R&D expense has incurred, previously Regeneron had only recognized a partial share of its antibody collaboration R&D expense has incurred, with the remaining share of expenses added to the antibody development balance. Also, as we highlighted last quarter, in accordance with the agreement, we recorded a one time development balance repayment of $57 million as an incremental reduction to Sanofi collaboration revenue in the third quarter of 2022. We have posted to our Web site supporting materials to further explain the accounting associated with this and other elements of the Libtayo transaction. Moving now to our operating expenses, R&D increased 38% year-over-year to $817 million, partially driven by the impact of the Libtayo transaction, which affects R&D in two ways. First, Regeneron now records all R&D expense for Libtayo, which was previously shared equally with Sanofi. Second, as I mentioned earlier, Regeneron now records our full 50% share of antibody collaborations spend for Dupixent and Itepekimab. SG&A expense increased 20% year-over-year, to $467 million primarily driven due to incremental costs related to assuming global rights to Libtayo. Cost of goods sold in the third quarter was $109 million, and product gross margin in the quarter increased to 94% as compared to 90.2% in the prior year. The more favorable gross margin was driven by the non-recurrence of REGEN-COV sales in the current period and the removal of the payment to Sanofi for their share of U.S. Libtayo gross margin. Finally, the third quarter 2022 effective tax rate was 12.1% compared to 10.8% in the prior year. Shifting now to cash flow in the balance sheet, year-to-date in 2022, Regeneron has generated $2.9 billion in free cash flow, and ended the third quarter of 2022 with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $10.3 billion. We remain focused on leveraging our strong financial position to deliver long-term value for shareholders. Over the first nine months of 2022, we have deployed in excess of $2.8 billion in capital; we have executed approximately $1.2 billion in business development initiatives including the $900 million acquisition of Libtayo rights. Additionally, we have repurchased over $1.6 billion of our shares, including over $900 million in the third quarter alone. As of September 30, we had approximately $1.2 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization, and we remain opportunistic buyers. As we approach the end of the year, we've made some minor changes to our 2022 guidance ranges. A complete summary of our latest full-year financial guidance is available on our press release issued earlier this morning. In addition to these changes, I would also like to provide some initial thoughts on our 2023 expense outlook. We continue to make investments to advance our pipeline and position the company for long-term growth. We expect R&D investment to grow in 2023 comparable to our slightly above the nine-month year-to-date growth rate reported earlier today. The incremental R&D investment in 2023 will be driven by advancing our immuno-oncology, hematology, immunology, and genetics medicine pipeline, as well as the continued expansion of our R&D organization. In addition, 2023 will be the first full-year reflecting the impact of the Libtayo transaction where we record 100% of the global R&D spend for Libtayo and our full 50% share of the Sanofi antibody collaboration R&D spend as incurred. For SG&A in 2023, we currently project growth in the mid teens versus 2022 given we'll be recording a full-year of global Libtayo expenses along with targeted investments in the build-out of our international infrastructure. Finally, for other operating income and expense in the third quarter of 2022, we recognized the remaining $44 million of deferred income related to previously-received upfront payments in development milestone for Fasinumab as a result of the program discontinuation. We do not currently expect any material other operating income or expense in the fourth quarter of 2022, in 2023, and beyond absent any new transactions. In conclusion, Regeneron has performed exceptionally well in the first nine-months of 2022, and our strong financial position enables continued investment to drive long-term growth. With that, I will pass the call back to Ryan. Evan, hi, good morning, it's Bob. With regards to capital allocation, and demonstrated today by our growth in R&D in the 2023 forward guidance, we are going to continue to invest, first and foremost, in the R&D pipeline that we have. We issued our 10-Q this morning, within the MD&A; you'll see a plethora of trials that are currently ongoing. And as George mentioned in his script, we're very bullish with regards to what is in the pipeline. Now, again with regards to business development, it's not a [and or and or] [Ph], right, as you saw in what we've done in the first nine months of 2022, where we do think there are opportunities and where we do think we can do collaborations where one plus one is three, then we're absolutely going to take that opportunity, and I think Checkmate was a good example of that. And I would expect that you'd see more of that. With regards to your question on dividends, it's never a never. Obviously, that tool is in our tool chest if we do decide to play that card. As of right now, we don't have dividends in the foreseeable future in our plan. We have been very opportunistic with regards to buybacks. Again, the MD&A issued earlier today, the 10-Q will show you what we've been buying back our shares. Again, we'll remain opportunistic buyers. And we do have a remaining $1.2 billion remaining under our current $3 billion authorization. Collin, it's Bob. With regards to OpEx, I mean Marion and I will do what we always do on the brands. We'll look at what totally makes sense. I mean as you know, it's kind of to find number of retinal docs. It's not as if we are going into tremendously new area that creates a lot of new touch points on it. And on top of that, Marion's team right now is a very tight functioning sales rep team on the top of their game. So, again, we don't expect some gigantic pivots in this area, but again, we will make sure that we fund this appropriately and that it is -- the commercial side of it is going to match how well the clinical data is going to stand up on it. Thanks."

            "name": "George Yancopoulos",
            "content": "Thank you, Len. I will start with ophthalmology. Positive pivotal results for Aflibercept8 mg in the PULSAR and PHOTON study recently presented at the American Academy of Ophthalmology Annual Meeting. Results of these trials in wet AMD and DME respectively demonstrated that a remarkably high percentage of patients were able to be rapidly initiated into and then successfully maintained through week 48 on 12- and 16-week dosing intervals while achieving vision gains that were non-inferior to the current standard of care, EYLEA 2 mg dosed every 8 weeks. These results suggest that Aflibercept8 mg has the potential to become the new standard of care in these retinal diseases. I think it would be helpful if we step back for a minute and try to put these results in context. What our trials did was push the limits far beyond what has been accomplished with any currently available anti-VEGF therapies. Rather than using response criteria to try to identify or slowly extend patients to longer dosing intervals, our trials tested whether all patients could be randomly assigned and rapidly initiated on extended dosing intervals of Aflibercept8 mg without compromising visual improvement or safety. These Aflibercept8 mg trials accomplished just that for the vast majority while delivering a safety profile consistent with that of EYLEA. Eighty nine percent of DME patients and 77% of wet AMD patients were able to be rapidly initiated and maintained on a 16-week of Aflibercept8 mg dosing regimen while 93% of DME and 83% of wet AMD patients were able to be rapidly initially maintained on at least a 12-week dosing interval. All while delivering efficacy similar to that of EYLEA administered every 8 weeks. We believe these are truly unprecedented and potentially game changing results which have not been achieved using any other anti-VEGF agent. Others have speculated that PULSAR and PHOTON results were due to our dose modification criteria and even tried to theoretically extrapolate that their agent could have somehow approached these results using our criteria. We put these speculative extrapolations into the category of wishful thinking. And based on our expert analysis of the data, we conclude it is all about the drug and not the trial design. Briefly moving on to Dupixent, building on our recent approval in eosinophilic esophagitis in adults and adolescents, we are planning on submitting a supplementary BLA for eosinophilic esophagitis in 1- to 1-year old children in mid 2023. Dupixent ability to treat eosinophilic esophagitis highlights how important it is that our IL-4 and IL-13 blocker more completely target the entire type 2 inflammatory cascade and not only eosinophils. As you heard Len mention, the FDA label was expanded yet again in the third quarter ad Dupixent became the first and only treatment indicated for prurigo nodularis, a debilitating chronic skin disease. This marks the fifth disease for which Dupixent is now approved. Our collective clinical data with Dupixent support a unifying molecular mechanism underlying these related diseases from asthma to atopic dermatitis to nasal polyps to prurigo nodularis to eosinophilic esophagitis. In this unifying hypothesis, IL-4 and IL-13 induced inflammation is driving all these related diseases in different tissue compartments. Moving to Libtayo and oncology, in the third quarter, our robust oncology pipeline has started to deliver data readout from our latest and most innovative programs. We are expecting these readouts to accelerate in the remainder of 2022 and continue into 2023. The European Society of Medical Oncology or ESMO Annual Meeting in September was a truly a banner event for Regeneron with several notable oral presentations for assets in our oncology pipeline, which I would like to briefly summarize. Starting with Fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody in combination with Libtayo, at ESMO, we shared data from two independent advanced melanoma expansion cohorts from our first in human study which importantly showed consistent efficacy and safety between the two replicate cohorts. Fianlimab in combination with Libtayo demonstrated greater than 60% response rates in each cohort. A median PFS estimated will be 24 months across both cohorts, and a median duration of response that has not yet been reached. The preliminary safety profile of the combination appears to be in line with anti-PD-1 monotherapy and potentially with less toxicity compared to anti-CTLA-4 combination. While dual LAG-3 and PD-1 inhibition has previously shown promise in advanced melanoma, response rates greater than 45% with median PFS of more than a year has not been previously reported. These initial results in melanoma suggest that Fianlimab\u2013Libtayo combination has the potentially best-in-class profile in the setting. We are enrolling our Phase 3 metastatic melanoma study. Intend to initiate a Phase 3 adjuvant melanoma study later this year and have additional plans in other solid tumors where Fianlimab has a potential to be first-in-class. The neoadjuvant cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or CSCC, a Phase 2 study of Libtayo monotherapy has shown promising results. Given prior to potentially curative surgery in patients with large tumors, Libtayo was able to deliver major pathological responses to 63% of patients prior to surgery. This raises the possibility that Libtayo could decrease the burden of these major and potentially disfiguring surgeries for the many patients who require them each year. We are pleased that concurrent with the ESMO presentation, these data were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Regarding next steps, we are talking to regulators about possible pathways to labeling and potential inclusion in the NCCN guidelines. Also at ESMO, we presented initial clinical data for Ubamatamab, our MUC16xCD3 bispecific developed for advanced ovarian cancer, our first clinical data for a CD3 bispecific in a solid tumor. In heavily pre-treated ovarian cancer population, we observed durable responses to this MUC16xCD3 monotherapy. In a patient subset whose tumors over expressed MUC16, response rates were as high as 31%. Most of the treatment emergent adverse events occurred with the initial step up dosing. Ubamatamab is being developed as a monotherapy as well as in combination with Libtayo as well as in combination with our MUC16 co-stim bispecific. We are looking forward to more data across these programs in 2023. In our ESMO investor presentation, we shared more detailed data for our PSMAxCD28 co-stim bispecific in combination with Libtayo, representing the first efficacy and safety data with this new class of bispecifics which we had initially top lined and discussed at our second quarter earnings. We have since continued to enroll patients in the study. We are planning to present updated data at a medical meeting in the first-half of 2023. Regarding our hem/onc pipeline, we are looking forward to data from Odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific as well as Linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific at the American Society of Hematology or ASH Annual Meeting in December. For Odronextamab, we will present pivotal Phase 2 data for both follicular lymphoma and diffused large B-cell lymphoma in two separate oral presentations. Upon discussions with the FDA, we are now targeting a second-half 2023 regulatory filing of this program. We hope to initiate combination studies with an appropriate CD28 co-stim bispecific in the near future. For Linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody, we remain on-track with development. And we are planning to file pending discussions with the FDA in 2023. We have now completed enrollment in our potentially pivotal Phase 2 study. As I mentioned earlier, data from this study will be updated at ASH. As with our Odronextamab, we are planning on initiating combination studies for Linvoseltamab with co-stimulatory bispecifics in the near future. We believe existing standard of care therapies leave significant room for improvement in these difficult-to-treat settings. And we have been encouraged by the interim efficacy and safety data we have generated today for both Odronextamab and Linvoseltamab. Finally at ESMO, we also shared initial data for our Maftivimab bispecific antibody in MET-altered non-small cell lung cancer. Responses were rich in patients with high levels of MET expression. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Even the modest over expression of MET may render lung cancer susceptible to this mechanism of action. And we are looking forward to the METxMET antibody-drug conjugate data next year. In summary, for oncology, a rich commentarial pipeline is delivering competitive data. And with our full ownership of Libtayo, we are excited about the potential to advance standard of care in oncology with our portfolio approach. Concluding with the Regeneron genetic medicines efforts where we continue to progress our pipeline and discovery engine. In September we and Alnylam reported promising data from our ongoing Phase 1 study of Alnylam HSD nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH. We are planning on initiating a Phase 2 studies shortly, which is just one part of our multi-pronged approach exploring multiple genetically validated targets for NASH. Also in September, we and Intellia announced initial data from the cardiomyopathy arm of our ongoing Phase 1 study of NTLA-2001. An investigational CRISPR-based therapy for the treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis, which show deep and sustained mean serum TTR reductions of over 90% and was generally well tolerated. Finally, in October our collaborators at Decibel Therapeutics announced FDA clearance where an NDA application for DB-OTO, a first virally delivered gene therapeutic product candidate designed to provide hearing to individuals with otoferlin-related hearing loss. This IND provides clearance to initiate a pediatric Phase 1/2 clinical trial in the United States. With that, I will turn it over to Marion. Actually COPD has been a very difficult disease for new therapies in biologics in particular. We think that there is a category of patients with COPD who have or are marked by more of what we call Th2-type inflammation. We think that, as I said in my remarks, that there's this unifying hypothesis there are a lot of Th2-type diseases that manifest in different ways. We believe that this subset of patients with COPD may maybe or fit into that category. And being able to benefit these patients in [technical difficulty] terms of either reducing their exacerbations and/or improving their lung function would really make a difference to these patients. And so, we're anxiously awaiting the data, and we're hopeful that we will have another set of patients where we might be able to demonstrate that Dupixent could really make a difference. Not to pile on, but since -- just to add on to what Len was saying. I mean the fact that the IL-13 have failed in these other important Th2 inflammation-driven diseases, like asthma and like COPD and others right now really does suggest that they are not fully addressing the Th2 inflammation, both in any one particular disease, but also as Len said, so many of these individuals, if you just look at our label or any label that describes these diseases, they suffer from other allergic comorbidities. And so, obviously, it can make such a difference for a patient where one drug can treat a systemic disease as opposed to treating the disease only in one of the many compartments where it manifests itself. I think this is the way I think medicine in the field should be moving. This is a systemic disease where Th2 inflammation is probably rampant in many compartments in the body, you don't only want to treat it in one compartment, you want to treat the entire body. And that's what we've been showing systematically, by going one disease after another with Dupixent. It works in every compartment, and it broadly attacks the underlying inflammation that's related and causative in all of these diseases. Yes. I think that our data actually shows that with the remarkable response rates, which we saw especially going to the higher doses, yet it's not as if you have to look hard to find biomarkers for response, the number just to remind you that is at the highest dose; three out of the four patients had very profound responses. So, response predictors are not an issue, but you also pointed the question about therapeutic window, certainly we are seeing autoimmune-related side effects associated with these responses. And so, we are working hard now, we are actually -- we have accelerated enrollment in this program, we are trying to understand more of the relationship between the responders, and having these sorts of new side effects, I mean one very positive perspective is we don't see these series autoimmune side effects in people who don't see responses. So, it's the people who benefit, who do get the autoimmune side effects these have obviously coupled, it's because I think the drug is doing what we intent it to do. I think this is some of the most exciting data in the history of immunotherapy that you can take what people have historically called a \"Cold tumor,\" that has almost no responses to immunotherapy or repeating one therapy, and get these incredibly high rate of very deep and so-called durable responses, and we will continue to work on improving the therapeutic window. In terms of the bispecific program more broadly, and I want to hearken back, Len sort of answered the previous question about CD20 and BCMA, but I do want to amplify on some of these comments, which is we think that there are indeed a very small number of bispecs in the CD20 space, and the BCMA space, which are actually looking quite competitive with each other, including ours, the emerging data suggests the efficacy and safety profiles of these agents will be competitive with each other, you will see our updated data, we will present it at ASH, but I think what's emerging is that these small numbers of competitors will exist in this field. I think that there is going to be room to these, there is actually a lot of patients in this late-stage settings who need treatment. So, I think that there is going to room for these small numbers of competitors there. But the future is going to be about moving into earlier lines of therapy, and there is going to therapies there about how one executes designs to those studies, the co-therapies, more standard co-therapies that are used there, and so there is going to be a lot of actually art to have one move these agents into the earlier lines of therapies, but the other very important thing is in addition to moving into earlier lines of therapy with these more standard combinations, where as I said, there is going to a lot of art to doing those studies, it's going to be of novel combos. And as we just talk about, with the CD20 and costim bispecifics that we're now showing that we are leading the field with, in prostate cancer we have very similar type agents now, that we are going to be combining with our CD20 bispecific in lymphoma and with our BCMA bispecific in myeloma, and we think that these are going to really have the opportunity to continue to change the game, and change the practice in medicine for these patients. So, it's about taking agents that R&D is going to be competitive and quite competitive with each other in these late stage settings, where I think they're all going to be making important contributions to the treatment in patients, but then moving in very artful ways to these earlier lines of therapy and using them there, where I think there is also going to be room, there is also going to be room for differentiation as well as the future, we are making these combos look all of these exciting opportunities we have in our portfolio can really take the utilization of these agents and the treatments of these patients, and these cancers to a whole another level, as we believe we are already showing that we are doing in prostate cancer. Right. And in some of the data we have already shown, and we will continue to show, many of our patients have remarkably high PSA levels, because they have very high burden of disease, as all know depending on the assay and the lab and so forth, normal PSA levels are in the low single-digits, you know, maybe one to four, consider the highest levels. We have patients who entered into our study with PSAs in the 100s, 500s, 600 and so forth. And we saw with this combination treatment, as soon as you put the combination on board essentially at the next time point that we measured within three weeks or so, we saw dramatic drops in the order of 99% reductions in the PSA. And these are really astounding results, and now where we continue to follow our patients over time we have seen that, for example, bone lesions have entirely normalized, and so forth. So, the effects are incredibly rapid as reflected in the PSA. And to the point about predicting which patients respond, it doesn't matter whether you had patients who had relatively low burden as measured by PSA, where their PSA was measured in let's say, 40 to 50 range or whether you had incredibly high PSAs in 500 to 600 range, those patients seem to similarly respond in terms of very dramatic, very profound drops in the PSA within weeks of starting therapy. And as we continue to follow these patient's incredibly durable responses, first patient has now been out for more than a year. Their immune side effects have resolved, whereas their complete remission has remained completely intact, and as I said, not only completely normalized the PSA levels, but the bone lesions and so forth have all normalized at least as measured by bone scans and so forth. So, this really has the potential to be so game-changing for these late stage patients who really have at this point no other real recourse."

Len?\nLeonard Schleifer: Thank you, Ryan and thank you to everyone joining today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call. Regeneron had a strong second quarter with notable execution across R&D, Commercial, and Business Development functions. Total revenues increased by 20% when excluding contributions from our COVID antibody cocktail. With net sales for EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo, each reaching new all-time quarterly highs and growing by double digits year-over-year on a constant currency basis. In addition to exceptional commercial execution, we made significant pipeline progress with three regulatory approvals, two accepted regulatory filings, and one positive Phase 3 readout. We also completed the acquisition of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals and the third quarter purchase of worldwide rights to Libtayo from Sanofi, both of which we believe will strengthen our oncology franchise in the near, medium and long-term. We also reported today preliminary, but promising anti-tumor activity and safety data for REGN5678 our PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with Libtayo in patients with advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. George will have more to say on this shortly. But we believe this represents an important step towards validating our costimulatory approach to fighting cancer and potentially advancing the science of immuno-oncology. Turning to our commercial performance. In the second quarter, EYLEA global net sales grew 13% at constant exchange rates to $2.5 billion. In the U.S. EYLEA net sales were $1.6 billion, up 14% year-over-year and outperforming anti-VEGF category growth of approximately 8%. Despite new competition EYLEA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share was approximately half of the anti-VEGF category and 75% among branded agents, confirming its status as the gold standard anti-VEGF category. We believe aflibercept represents a significant potential growth opportunity going forward given favorable demographic trends as well as the potential for aflibercept 8 mg to augment the category and complement our retinal franchise. Regarding our investigational aflibercept 8 mg, the goal of our clinical program is to evaluate whether visual acuity among wet AMD and DME patients can be maintained or improved compared to EYLEA while extending the interval between doses. Equally important is maintaining the high bar for safety that has been set by EYLEA over the past 10 years, 55 million injections, worldwide and 8 million patient years of experience. We anticipate pivotal results in late quarter three or early quarter four and with supportive data, a BLA submission completed by early 2023. Dupixent continued to grow at a remarkable pace after five years and more than 450,000 patients treated since launch. In quarter two, global net product sales were $2.1 billion, an increase of 43% at constant exchange rates compared to last year, reflecting Dupixent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s differentiated clinical profile and ability to effectively treat more and more patients with the type two inflammatory diseases where Dupixent is approved. In the U.S. we saw growth across all indications, including initial contributions from atopic dermatitis in patients as young as six months to five years of age and from eosinophilic esophagitis, both of which are indications approved by the FDA during the second quarter and represent the first approved systemic treatment options for these patients. We hope to add a third first-in-class indication for Dupixent later this year in patients with prurigo nodularis, which is currently under Priority Review with the FDA. In Oncology, Libtayo net product sales grew 25% globally at a constant currency to $141 million in the second quarter of 2022, including 17% growth in the U.S., driven by non-melanoma skin cancer indications and monotherapy non-small cell lung cancer. We have long believed that the key to fully unlocking the opportunity in oncology is through differentiated combinations with Libtayo possibly serving as our foundation for many of them. That belief was the basis for our acquisition of the global rights to Libtayo. We plan to invest further in Libtayo based combinations, pairing it with promising candidates in our oncology pipeline, such as LAG-3 antibody fianlimab and our many investigational bispecifics, as well as with candidates from external collaborations. We continue to make progress with these Libtayo combinations and intend to share initial data in the second half of this year from our emerging oncology pipeline, which George will discuss in more detail. Regarding the FDA's review of our Libtayo chemo combo supplemental BLA for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, we are pleased with the progress that we have made as the FDA continues its review. However, we recently were informed that an FDA travel complication relating to scheduling a routine clinical trial site inspection in Eastern Europe will likely delay their decision until after our September 19 PDUFA date. While any delay is disappointing, a new site inspection date has been scheduled. Therefore, we do not expect a lengthy extension of the review period, and we do not expect it to meaningfully impact our launch plans assuming FDA approval. We continue to actively work with the FDA believing the ongoing review is otherwise progressing well and all other elements of the review remain on track. Regarding our COVID-19 response, Regeneron remains committed to combating the virus by developing additional novel antibodies. We continue to work with the FDA to establish a regulatory pathway for these antibodies, which could potentially serve an important role in protecting immunocompromised individuals who do not respond adequately to COVID-19 vaccines, as well as treating infected patients whom all antiviral therapy is not appropriate. In closing, as I reflect on our performance during the first half of the year, I am very proud of our numerous achievements, which were only made possible by the dedicated Regeneron employees around the world. Together we have continued to serve patients in need while strengthening the foundation of the company and leveraging our financial strength to better position Regeneron to achieve sustainable growth over time. We are excited about the increasing commercial momentum of our core products and the important progress we have made in advancing our pipeline. Our strategy continues to focus on investing in our internal R&D capabilities while exploring potential collaborations that will enable us to fully realize the power of our science. We remain confident in the strategy and in our growth prospects, as well as in our ability to deliver breakthroughs to patients and value to shareholders. Now, I'll turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Thanks Len. I will start with ophthalmology. We are looking forward to the upcoming Phase 3 readouts of aflibercept 8 mg in patients with diabetic macular edema and in wet age-related macular degeneration. PHOTON in patients with DME and PULSAR in patients with wet AMD will test whether patients treated with 8 mg dose every 12 weeks or every 16 weeks can achieve non-inferior best corrected visual acuity at week 48, compared to the currently approved EYLEA 2 mg dose every eight weeks. Unlike studies from other sponsors, in which patients were assigned to a dosing interval based on disease activity assessments following the loading phase, patients enrolled in the PHOTON and PULSAR studies were randomized at baseline into one of the three treatment groups, which we believe will allow us to determine whether extend dosing can truly be achieved. If the studies are positive and the high safety standard established with EYLEA is maintained, we believe aflibercept 8 mg would represent a significant clinical advance for patients. And we would target a U.S. regulatory filing by early 2023. Moving to Dupixent, which continued to deliver notable milestones in the second quarter of the year, Dupixent was recently improved in children with atopic dermatitis as young as six months old, making Dupixent the first and only biologic medicine approved to treat atopic dermatitis from infancy through adulthood. Marion will talk more about this as well as about our recent earlier than expected FDA approval for a brand new gastroenterology indication, eosinophilic esophagitis, or EOE. Since receiving approval in adults and in adolescent aged 12 and over, we have reported positive data in pediatric patients with EOE as young as 1 year of age. Our Phase 3 study in children 1 to 11 years of age met the primary endpoint with 68% of patients on the higher Dupixent dose and 58% on the lower Dupixent dose achieving histological disease remission compared to 3% of children on placebo at 16 weeks. EOE symptoms can be difficult to assess in these young patients. However, we also observed medical improvement in EOE symptom score. In an exploratory analysis we recorded 3.1% increase from baseline and body weight for age percentile for the higher dose group, compared to 0.3% of the placebo. These data will be discussed with regulatory authorities starting with the FDA later this year. Regarding approvals for new indications expected in the near future, for prurigo nodularis we received a PDUFA action date from the FDA of September 30. And the European Commission's decision expected in the first half of 2023. Also in the first half of next year, we are also looking forward to the readout of the first Dupixent study in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD. Moving on to Libtayo and oncology. As Len mentioned, we are excited to have acquired Sanofi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stake in Libtayo, thereby gaining exclusive worldwide rights to a PD1 inhibitor review as foundational for our oncology franchise, which has the potential to be utilized in numerous combinations with other candidates in our pipeline, such as our costimulatory bispecifics, our C3 bispecifics and novel checkpoint inhibitors, such as fianlimab. Regarding such combinations, I'd like to provide a brief update on our first clinical data from our costimulatory pipeline involving REGN5678, a PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with Libtayo. This combination is being studied in patients with advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, who have previously progressed on multiple anti-antigen therapies. These patients unfortunately have a poor prognosis with approximately one to two years of life expectancy and with limited treatment options. Metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer is considered an immunologically cold tumor and is largely resistant to immune checkpoint inhibitor, with large trials of PD1 antibodies showing monotherapy response rates in the single digits. As just announced today by Merck, the challenge of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer in terms of lack of efficacy for checkpoint inhibitors used in standard ways is emphasized by the failure of their large Phase 3 trial in earlier stage of this disease. Our costim program was designed to innovatively enhance responsiveness in these types of cold tumor classes, such as prostate cancer, and essentially turn these cold tumors into hot tumors. I will remind you of the extensive preclinical data we have published supporting this hypothesis. Since 2019 we have been in careful dose escalation for this prostate cancer program in close collaboration with the FDA. In our study, patients are dosed weekly with REGN5678 and every three weeks with Libtayo. However, first dose of Libtayo is not  until week-four, permitting a period of PSMAxCD28 leading to evaluate monotherapy safety and efficacy. Earlier today, we announced the first clinical data from 33 patients across eight dose levels, which showed dose dependent anti-tumor activity. The key efficacy endpoint in the study is objective response rate defined as a greater than 50% decline of prostate-specific antigen or PSA from baseline and/or tumor shrinkage. PSA is a protein produced by the prostate gland and by prostate tumors and this is commonly used as a biomarker to diagnose and follow up prostate cancer as many metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients have diseased limited to bone lesions and cannot be assessed by conventional resist criteria. Preliminary data from the ongoing dose escalation portion of the trial across eight dose level cohorts in a total of 33 patients showed dose dependent antitumor activity is assessed by PSA values at the five lowest dose levels, which are preclinical models predicted might be subtherapeutic. There was almost no evidence of any anti-tumor activity with only 1 in 17 patients showing a decrease in PSA. There were no greater than grade 3 -- greater or equal to grade 3 immune related adverse events or irAEs at these doses. The lack of anti-tumor activity among these patients was consistent with the approximate 6% response rate reported in other trials with anti-PD1 monotherapy. At the next three dose levels we began to see clear evidence of dose dependent anti-tumor activity, which was generally seen within six weeks of starting the combination. At dose level six, one of four patients experienced a 100% decrease in PSA and a complete response in target lesions based on resist criteria. The patient discontinued therapy due to a grade 3 immune-related adverse event of the skin that was considered to be a recurrence of a preexisting condition and has since resolved with treatment per investigator report. Despite termination of the treatment, he has maintained his 100% decrease in PSA and complete response in target lesions for approximately 10 months to date per investigator report. We continue to see anti-tumor activity at the next dose level or dose level seven. And in our eighth and most recent dose level, three out of four patients had dramatic and rapid PSA reductions, two with greater than 99% reductions and one with an 82% reduction. Of the two patients with greater than 99% PSA reductions, one experienced a grade 3 case of mucositis, which has resolved and the other experienced a grade 3 case of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy, which is ongoing. In terms of safety, very importantly, no grade 3 or higher irAEs were observed in patients without anti-tumor activity. And the occurrence of irAEs was correlated with anti-tumor activity. This is consistent with previous trials with anti PD1 immunotherapy, wherein irAEs have been reported to occur at a higher rate in responding patients. No grade 4 irAEs were greater than or equal to grade 2 cytokine release syndrome have been observed in the trial to date. There was one death that was considered unrelated to treatment. In this trial, irAEs are being treated according to standard management practices used for checkpoint inhibitors. We are planning on sharing more detailed data from this study at an upcoming medical meeting. Let remind you that through extensive preclinical research, we hypothesized that augmenting T-cell costimulation alongside PD inhibition could be a key to turning immunologically cold tumors hot. These preliminary data for a PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecific provides the first clinical evidence supporting the promise of our broader pipeline of coast inventory bispecifics in diverse solid tumors, as well as hemalogic malignancies. By combining these costimulatory bispecific  well with our CD3 bispecifics we have the opportunity to create novel therapeutic synergies to address some of the most difficult to treat cancers. We look forward to partnering with the oncology community on this ambitious and potentially groundbreaking efforts. In addition to these exciting early data, we anticipate several important oncology milestones in the second half of the year. At the upcoming ESMO Conference, we will provide updates on fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody in combination with Libtayo in a Phase 2 cohort of metastatic melanoma that will hopefully confirm the encouraging combined efficacy that we previously reported in this setting. In addition, we will present initial data for  our MUC16xCD3 bispecific in metastatic ovarian cancer, where I'd like to remind you that we have also combination studies ongoing with both costimulatory bispecifics and Libtayo. We will also report initial data for a METxMET bispecific in advanced met-altered non-small cell lung cancer as well as for Libtayo monotherapy with neoadjuvant cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Moving on to our hematology pipeline. Odronextamab has the potential to be the first CD20xCD3 bispecific to be approved for both major types of advanced B-cell lymphoma, that is both follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Based on interim data from a cohort of patients dosed with our recently modified step-up regimen, we believe odronextamab may have the lowest rates of grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome for this class of bispecific in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma while still maintaining the efficacy profile previously reported. We look forward to presenting these updated data and potentially submitting a BLA for both indications in the second half of this year, pending feedback from the FDA. We also plan to share updated data for a BCMAxCD3 bispecific study in relapse or refractory multiple myeloma by the end of the year. Pending regulatory feedback, we are planning to submit for regulatory approval in 2023. An umbrella study in multiple myeloma investigating BCMAxCD3 in combination with various standard of care products and investigational candidates is now open to enrollment while we plan to initiate an additional study in earlier lines of multiple myeloma later this year. As you can see, the pace of innovation in our oncology pipeline has been accelerating, building upon piles of foundation with data readouts for novel mechanisms for cancer indications that historically have not responded to immunotherapy. Concluding with our Regeneron genetics medicines, where we in collaboration continue to progress our pipeline and discovery engine. Our siRNA collaboration with Alnylam, a non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH contains product candidates addressing various targets, including those discovered by the Regeneron Genetic Center. First data in NASH for ALN-HSD are anticipated this fall. We are progressing a second target, PNPLA3 into the clinic later this year and we have recently identified an additional novel promising target for NASH site B. as we just published in the New England Journal of Medicine, we found unprecedented association of very rare site B loss of function variants with lower risk of liver disease. In the largest association study examined protection from liver disease ever described, individuals with loss of function of side B variant has about 53% lower risk of developing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and about 54% lower risk of developing non-alcoholic cirrhosis. Regeneron and Alnylam are developing siRNA therapeutic candidate leads to advance to the clinic. And with that, I will turn the call over to Marion.\nMarion McCourt: Thank you, George. Regeneron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commercial business achieved another strong quarter demonstrating durable growth across our brands. We're building on the momentum of inline brands, including EYLEA, Dupixent, and Libtayo and also accelerating the potential across our portfolio from new and anticipated future launches. Let me start with EYLEA. Second quarter global net sales grew 13% year-over-year at constant currency to $2.5 billion. In the U.S. EYLEA net sales exceeded $1.6 billion, a 14% year-over-year increase driven by prescribing demand with strong demand continuing into the third quarter. EYLEA year-over-year growth significantly outpaced the category, gaining competitive share and further enhancing EYLEA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position as the anti-VEGF agent of choice for retinal disease. We continue to see durable growth based on patient flow and new patient starts, ongoing demographic trends such as the aging population and prevalence of diabetes support anticipated mid-to-high single digit category growth for the foreseeable future. In diabetic eye disease, increasing diagnosis rates are also driving strong growth for EYLEA with more than $55 million injections worldwide since launch and well over 1 million injections in the U.S. alone in the second quarter of 2022. Physicians continue to recognize and prefer EYLEA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s differentiated efficacy and safety profile. We are confident in our ability to continue to build on our leadership over the long-term. Pending FDA approvals, there are potential incremental opportunities for EYLEA, including extending the dosing interval up to 16 weeks for diabetic retinopathy and treating preterm infants suffering from retinopathy of prematurity. In addition, aflibercept 8 investigational program has garnered significant enthusiasm from the retinal community and has the potential to significantly enhance the anti-VEGF treatment paradigm. Turning now to Libtayo, global net sales in the second quarter grew 25%, at constant currency to $141 million with U.S. net sales of $91 million. Libtayo continues to grow across all approved indications, including non-melanoma skin cancers, where Libtayo is the leading immunotherapy treatment. In monotherapy non-small cell lung cancer we are generating increased utilization across a broader number of prescribers. We are launch-ready for the potential chemotherapy combination approval, which will significantly expand the patient opportunity and physician choice for Libtayo in treating lung cancer. Regeneron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full ownership of Libtayo presents many exciting opportunities across our current and future oncology portfolio. Key thought leaders recognize our growing commitment to oncology and have high interest in the potential for Libtayo combinations to meaningfully advance the standard of care in many cancer indications. We are taking a measured approach to expanding our global commercial footprint in key international markets to maximize the impact of our innovations to patients and Regeneron. These capabilities and infrastructure will support Libtayo in overtime future medicines. And now turning to Dupixent, in the second quarter global Dupixent net sales grew 43% year-over-year at constant currency to $2.1 billion. Dupixent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance was fueled by strong uptake across all indications with recent launches performing well across new diseases, age groups, and geographies. In the U.S. Dupixent net sales grew 38% to $1.58 billion. We continue to expand Dupixent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leadership position as the first line systemic treatment in atopic dermatitis. There's robust demand for Dupixent across the spectrum of moderate and severe disease, as well as across age groups. With the recent approval in children as young as six months, Dupixent is the first and only biologic medicine approved to treat moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis from infancy through adulthood and the launch in our youngest patients is off to a very strong start based on initiations. We are also preparing for the potential approval next month in prurigo nodularis, a dermatologic condition where approximately 75,000 U.S. patients have no FDA approved medicines and are most in need. In asthma Dupixent is the number one biologic prescribed by both allergists and pulmonologists. We continue to see strong growth in new patient starts and total prescriptions, driven by Dupixent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s differentiated profile, unique mechanism of action, ease of prescribing broad label and demonstrated efficacy and safety. In nasal polyps, robust demand continues with Dupixent capturing the majority of market share and increased prescribing from ENTs. In eosinophilic esophagitis, our first gastroenterology indication, Dupixent is the only approved medicine for adults and children aged 12 and above. Early launch indicators have been favorable with encouraging adoption from both allergists and gastroenterologists. In addition, we are expanding our outreach to educate patients and caregivers about Dupixent as a new therapeutic option that provides meaningful symptom relief. Turning now to Dupixent and markets outside the U.S., in the second quarter, net sales grew 61% on a constant currency basis to $510 million, driven by robust growth across all indications. Regeneron continues to expand our presence in key international markets to bring Dupixent to patients. In summary, Dupixent is transforming the type 2 inflammatory disease landscape and has significant growth potential ahead driven by further penetration and existing indications, as well as from potential future indications. In conclusion, our commercial execution delivered solid results for the second quarter, bringing our life-changing medicines to even more patients. Our inline brands continue to perform well and new launches provide additional opportunities for sustainable long-term growth. Now I'll turn the call to Bob.\nRobert Landry: Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outstanding performance continued in the second quarter as our core business maintained a strong growth trajectory, and we have leveraged our strong financial position to complete two business development oncology transactions. Excluding global revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, second quarter total revenues increased 20% year-over-year to $2.9 billion demonstrating continued momentum across our business. Second quarter total diluted net income per share was $9.77 on net income of $1.1 billion. Beginning with collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. Second quarter 2022 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $870 million, up to 13% on a constant currency basis versus second quarter 2021. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $358 million of which $340 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $678 million in the second quarter of 2022, improved 55% from the prior year driven by Dupixent. Finally, we recorded Roche collaboration revenue of $8 million related to Roche\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sales of Ronapreve outside the U.S. We expect to record additional revenue from this collaboration in the fourth quarter of 2022. Moving now to our operating expenses. R&D increased 7% year-over-year to $690 million driven by higher head count in cost to support our expanding pipeline, partially offset by lower development costs for REGEN-COV. In the second quarter of 2022 acquired IPR&D was $197 million, which includes a previously disclosed $195 million charge related to our acquisition of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals. SG&A expense increased 14% year-over-year to $418 million, primarily due to costs related to growth initiatives for EYLEA and higher headcount to support our growing organization. Cost of goods sold decreased 73% year-over-year to $137 million primarily due to sales of REGEN-COV in the prior year that did not reoccur. Finally, the second quarter 2022 effective tax rate was 13.6% compared to 17% in the prior year. The lower rate is partially related to the non-recurrence of REGEN-COV sales. Shifting now to cash flow in the balance sheet. Year-to-date in 2022, Regeneron has generated $2.4 billion in free cash flow and ended the second quarter of 2022 with cash and marketable securities, less debt of $11.3 billion. We continue to deliver on our capital allocation priorities, completing our acquisition of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals, the first acquisition in Regeneron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history and the purchase of Sanofi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stake in Libtayo. In addition, we repurchased approximately $400 million of our shares in the second quarter of 2022, bringing our year-to-date total through July to over $1.1 billion. We continue to be opportunistic buyers where we see dislocation between our stock price and our intrinsic valuation. I will now discuss updates to our full year 2022 guidance driven by the closing of the Libtayo transaction. We are updating full year R&D expense guidance to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.24 billion, an increase of $170 million at the midpoint from our previous guidance. Approximately one third of the increase is driven by Regeneron now recording all R&D expense for Libtayo, which was previously shared with Sanofi. The remaining two thirds reflects the recording of our full 50% share of antibody collaboration spend as incurred beginning in the third quarter of 2022. Previously our share of antibody collaboration expenses was only partially expensed in the period incurred with the remaining share added to the antibody collaboration development balance. We were updating full year SG&A expense guidance to be in the range of $1.74 billion to $1.84 billion. The updated range reflects the inclusion of a 100% of Libtayo commercial expenses, which were previously shared with Sanofi net of anticipated synergies. We are also updating full year gross margin guidance to be in the range of 92% to 93%. The more favorable gross margin is due to the removal of the payment of Sanofi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share of U.S. Libtayo gross margin that was previously recorded in this slide. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. Let me conclude by highlighting four important financial modeling considerations related to the Libtayo transaction. First, effective July 1, Regeneron will record a 100% of the global Libtayo net product sales. We previously recorded only U.S. Libtayo net product sales. Second, the Libtayo off fund payment milestones and royalties will be recorded as an intangible asset on the balance sheet and amortized through cost of goods sold over the useful life of Libtayo. This amortization expense will be excluded from non-GAAP results. Third, as you may recall, we will now pay 20% of our share of antibody profits to reduce the antibody development balance instead of the previous 10% arrangement. The quarterly development balance repayment going forward will be reflected in our P&L as incremental antibody R&D expense I mentioned earlier when discussing revised R&D guidance with the remainder coming in the form of a reduction to antibody collaboration revenue. Therefore, the reduction in antibody collaboration revenue will be less than 20% of our share of antibody profits. As a result of the development balance repayment step-up, we expect to shorten the period to fully repay the development balance resulting in an earlier and very significant inflection in collaboration profits in the other years. Finally, in the third quarter of 2022, we will record a one-time development balance repayment per the Libtayo transaction agreement of approximately $55 million in addition to our regular quarterly repayments, which will be recorded as a deduction within the antibody collaboration revenue line. In conclusion, Regeneron is performing well and we continue to make investments in our business supported by our strong financial position to drive sustainable long-term growth. With that, I will pass the call back to Ryan.\nRyan Crowe: Thank you, Bob. Bella that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. With several callers in the queue and to ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. Bella please go ahead and poll for questions.\nOperator:  And our first question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMohit Bansal: Yes, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter and data. Maybe a question on high dose EYLEA DME trial, especially with the loading dose sticking to that, so if we go back in the memory lane, it seems like the use of five loading doses only came along after the DRCR protocol, because I couldn't find anything which were -- in the history, which suggests that you should use five loading doses. Could you talk a little bit about that? And also, what is the realistic utility of fourth and fifth loading dose even for standard dose EYLEA, especially in the context of one year long trial? Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes, those are really interesting questions and they get into the detail of very specific points of the regimen. Many of these, as you point out have not been directly studied in sort of head to head studies. So where we would have to maybe offline discuss some of these issues, but as I said, details that would require a lot of experimentation, maybe the answer.\nMohit Bansal: Thanks, George.\nRyan Crowe: Bella, can we go to the next question, please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital. Your line is now open.\nEvan Seigerman: Hey guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. I'd love for you to expand on kind of some of the next steps for REGN5678. What do you want to see in additional cohort 8 patients and even at potentially higher dose cohorts to move into a registration directed trial? Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes, no, thanks. We are obviously very excited about these data that have been, long been coming. As you all know we had to go through a very careful dose escalation starting with very low doses, but what we've now seen at the dose level 6, 7 and 8 has really been very exciting. I think that what we're going to be doing is we're going to be continuing to expand the number of patients at these dose levels. We're going to continue to evaluate the tumor activity as well as the safety and we hope that we're going to see that the responses remain profound and durable while the safety hopefully most of them will resolve and be managed well. And if we continue down that path, we will, as you say, also continue to explore other dose levels and so forth. But the level of tumor activity and balanced by the safety event that we're seeing on doses, are occurring now at levels where we think that they could be providing a new standard for benefit risk for this population. I think that it's important now to point out and remind everybody, I mean, I said it, but just to say it again, the IRAs  were only seen in the patients who had profound anti-tumor activity. That is the patients who didn't benefit did not really indicate in terms of higher level IRAs  to have significant safety concern. And that is of course, what you want to see, that the patients who have the benefit that the safety is limited to those, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not doing harm to the patients that do not benefit. Okay, I guess we're ready for next question.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks, George. Bella, next question please?\nOperator:\nTyler:\nRyan Crowe: You must be on mute. We don't hear a question, but maybe we could take the opportunity to amplify even a little further and repeat what George said about this, the safety and one thing, hello?\nTyler Van Buren: Can, can you hear me? Sorry. It cut out.\nRyan Crowe: Yes, yes, Tyler.\nTyler Van Buren: Good morning. Thanks very much for taking the question. I wanted to ask about PULSAR and PHOTON, just a follow up. Can you elaborate on the decision to randomize patients to the 12-week and 16-week arms prior to assessing their response for loading doses? Since patients can only be rescued during that first year or moved down in dosing interval and not moved up to a less frequent regimen, even though they might be doing well. Doesn't this make the comparison to the  term studies difficult, and given this, how do you expect to communicate the data to the physicians when we see it?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Well, we have to, we were somewhat confused by the whole of the business data and it's meaning it's intense because of the confusing study design. We are basically only after you see how well patients are doing you then shift them. So if you take your best patients and you shift them, for example, to a Q 12 or Q 16 regimen, and you say, oh, X percent of patients can send this regimen, you are not really understanding how good your drug is and what percent of the patients can actually achieve that dosing regimen. We know, and we've already published on this, that patients who do well can be dramatically extended. We're trying to answer a very different question, which we think is going to be very, very important to the community, which is whether you can truly achieve extended dosing. And whether you can prospectively put people into these dosing regimens and get substantial numbers of them to stay at these dosing regimens, because we're giving the higher dose of EYLEA, which we believe has this ability to maintain more patients at these longer intervals. So we really believe that this would represent a significant clinical advance and would also clarify how to use these drugs as opposed to the prior somewhat confusing approaches.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks, George.\nTyler Van Buren: Okay, that's helpful. And just a brief follow up, in year two is it going to be able to be\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nRyan Crowe: We have to move to the next one. I'm sorry, Tyler. Bella, can we go to the next question?\nLeonard Schleifer: We'll deal with that privately Tyler, sorry.\nOperator: Sure. And your next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nSalveen Richter: Good morning. Thank you for taking our question. This is Andrea on for Salveen. Can you walk us through how to think about implications from the potential Medicare negotiation provision to high dose EYLEA, given that there is no distinct IP there, but there will be a biosimilar for the regular dose by mid-24? Thanks so much.\nLeonard Schleifer: Yes, it's a complicated -- it's a complicated question that until we see the final language in the statute, how it's interpreted and how it's actually implemented as to whether and how we file for the high dose, whether or not there'll be separate considerations for high dose versus the standard dose EYLEA. If there are -- if it turns out that there are, if it turns out that there are separate, we get a separate BLA, obviously you get, I can't remember what the statute says now, 11 or 12 years before this comes into play. And based on our current understanding of the bill, we believe that a new BLA would constitute a new biologic product. And therefore the 8 mg would not be subject to price negotiations in years. But we have to see what the final bill looks like and how it's interpreted. So we we're as anxious to see some of that as you are so being, so we will keep you informed about thinking as the bill is finalized and starting to be interpreted.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks, Len. Bella, next question please?\nOperator: Yes. Your next question comes through the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Harrison: Great, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could comment maybe a bit more broadly on costims and how the impact of today's data makes you think about investment in additional tumor types or broader investment across costims and other combinations? Thanks very much.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: That's a great question. I think you bring up a great point. And I think those of us who have been in this field now, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re of course so excited by the early promise of immunotherapy checkpoint inhibitors and particularly PD1 antibodies. But of course over the years it's been recognized that only a small percentage of tumors, even in responding, even in the most responsive cancers, not all the patients respond and for many tumor classes, as we just saw with Merck's announcement of their failure today, in many classes, there's almost no detectable activity. So the Holy Grail in the field that people have been looking for is an answer to the question of, how do you activate immunotherapy in all these cold tumors, which is unfortunately the vast majority of cancers, both solid tumors and hemalogic malignancies. And so we went down this path based on the science that we could add the second signal, signal 2 to the first signal that could activate T cells. And these preliminary data suggest that that hypothesis might be right, and that we are on the way to this Holy Grail, that this is we believe very early data. We have a long way to go, but it's a spectacular indication that we have done where we are in the midst of doing and on the path of doing exactly what we set out to do, which is to turn immunotherapy cold tumors into hot tumors with dramatic anti-tumor activity. And the implications here based on all the pre-clinical data suggest that this is going to be broadly applicable. And as you all know, we have been developing a very broad costimulatory pipeline across many, many tumor classes, and several of them are already in the clinic, I mentioned. We have the prostate data. We have ongoing studies with the costim for ovarian cancer. We have other costims that are in the clinic for -- and we have other costims that are going to be entering into the clinic over the next short period of time. These are going to cover all sorts of cancers from the lung cancers that don't respond to hemalogic malignancies and so forth and so on. So we really think that this could be groundbreaking and taking immunotherapy now to the next level where all of us in the field were hoping it was going to go with the early advances with checkpoint inhibitors and have been frustrated over obviously the last decade or so that we haven't been able to get there. This may be the way to get there for the field. We have a very broad pipeline of costimulatory bispecific. By the way, we believe this validates the concept of the combinations, not only with Libtayo, and the PD1 class, but also with our CD3 class of bispecifics, because it suggests that the preclinical data which is so strongly supported now with this clinical data might also be very predictive for that class. So, a lot of exciting possibilities across very broad areas, diverse  hemalogic malignancies. This is, I think, could represent the next breakthrough for immunotherapy.\nLeonard Schleifer: Yes. And Matthew it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Len. Maybe just add to, or what George said in terms of the investment side, we're prepared and we're able to make the investment across many different areas that George is talking about. And having under one roof, all the reagents owning all of Libtayo, having the variety of costims, having a variety of the CD3 three bispecifics and having all that knowledge, we think and the ability to invest puts us in a really terrific position. It is early going. We have to work through the safety. But to me, it's sort of reminiscent of once you started to see the excitement around the CAR T-cells, and the CAR T-cells actually provide a pretty good lesson in that they give very high levels of activity, response rates, 75% in some tumors or higher. And when you get those very high response rates, you also got very high levels of these immune reactions. You had -- and you look at the labels, you'll see 25% grade 3 neurologic adverse events and a whole bunch of other, not to mention all the cytokine release syndromes. So I think that these -- this is sort of an equivalent stage. We have got this tiger by the tail I really believe and George has described it well. And the amazing thing that should be echoed is that the preclinical data was extremely valuable. So Regeneron is not a company that just has all these molecules that we've acquired from others. These are all homegrown molecules, home tested, home validated, et cetera. There's a whole collection. We couldn't be more excited. I could keep going on, but maybe I'm getting waved off. We should take the next question.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: No, I just want to add and build on what Len has said. So I think just like he said, in some ways, the CAR Ts in terms of high efficacy, particularly in hematologic malignancies, because that's where it's seen high efficacy seeing along with the AEs and in some of the responding patients, that's a good analogy. But I do have to point out the many differences. These are off the shelf reagents. Okay? Which God forbid, if there is a safety issue can be stopped. And it's much easier as we're already demonstrating to create a whole pipeline across a whole variety of broad cancers and unlike the Car T world right now, anyway, these are dramatic effects in solid tumors which were never really seen before by any other modality. So this is actually pretty exciting. There are analogies, there are in terms of dramatic efficacy, but also very important differences here that establish this as a potential breakthrough new class.\nRyan Crowe: Okay. Thank you, George and Len. Next question, please, Bella.\nOperator: Sure. Your next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nTim Anderson: Thank you. A question on the REGN5678 data, you report out one CR but no other response rate data using recess criteria. So I'm wondering if there's anything else you can say about tumor shrinkage beyond that one CR in those upper three cohorts? And then to clarify, you mentioned a host of grade 3 AEs in the press release and some of those to me don't seem like the classic immune related AEs. So are you, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hoping you can clarify which of those you consider to be IRAEs, maybe you consider all of them to be? Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: I think we've given a lot of the details and we're going be giving a lot more details obviously in upcoming meetings. Suffice it to say that as I mentioned for most of these patients, actually many of these patients, they don't have lesions outside of the bone, which is why we use PSA as as the indicator of total disease activity, because you don't have that many lesions. Okay? So that's one point where we're focusing on the PSA. We do believe that many of the IRAEs are the sort of IRAEs that you do see with both PD1 therapy and as Len mentioned also with CAR T therapy. And I think we indicate every single great 3 that we had and indicated that actually even though these are very early data in the treatment most of these patients many of these are actually already resolving or resolved. And we're going to continue to follow these patients and look for hopefully as seen, remember a total of six that one patient, the reason we highlighted then is they were the first responding patients, so we've now had almost a year follow up and we have this very impressive durability of response there. The other cohorts are much more recently treated and that's why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not giving that much follow up because these are patients who are in the very early months of being treated. But obviously you hear it, you hear it in our voices probably, those of us who have commented, we think this rule has the potential to be game changing, game changing for the field of immunotherapy and taking immunotherapy to the next level, also game changing for our oncology program and for our company.\nRyan Crowe: Thank you. Bella, next question, please? I think we have time for two more.\nOperator: All right. Your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nChris Raymond: Hey thanks. Maybe back to EYLEA and the high dose format for a second. So our checks have indicated a pretty good chunk of the bio patients are actually EYLEA patients, and specifically EYLEA patients who are on a higher frequency dose regimen. I guess maybe a two part question here. First maybe talk about the plan to sort of mitigate this, you know, either before the high dose format or even after? And I guess is the plan with the high dose one would expect that switching paradigm for the high dose EYLEA would be easier than  is that sort of part of the plan? And then the second part is our checks also indicate surprisingly low awareness of this high dose format among docs. Are these signals at odds with what you're seeing or is that correct? And outside of, you know, actually just having the data presented\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Marion is going to answer the question. By the way we don't market products before they are approved. So it's not surprising that there is not awareness of a product that's an investigational product. Marion can comment on the other stuff.\nMarion McCourt: Sure. Let me take a start on some of the situations in market and perhaps George will add to that. But first let me comment that obviously we presented today very strong results on the growth of EYLEA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standard of care in the marketplace, both in the U.S. and the worldwide information. You know, today in the branded category, U.S. anti-VEGF category, we have 75% of the branded market. We are approaching 50% of the overall market. So truly EYLEA is the standard of care. You know, it, it's probably best that fianlimab organization comment on where their product is being used, I'll comment anecdotally that early days, the response has been fairly muted, fairly low grade use in concentrated accounts rather than market wide. As for the future, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very excited and optimistic that the aflibercept 8 mg will represent a new standard of care with true durability of dosing and the same type of efficacy and safety that we see with EYLEA. So we're really excited. And certainly our clinical organization has put together trial designs that truly test the durability of the product, and then we'll allow the commercial organization to determine what the best strategy is for launch if and when we get FDA approval.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: All right, let me just add to that, that it's important to point out that the reason why EYLEA has become the leading anti-VEGF agent, branded VEGF agent is because it allows most of the EYLEA patients to go on longer interval dosing and have, and be very satisfied with the response. Now, of course, as with any disease and situation, not every patient is going do perfectly well. And we know that there is a small percentage of patients who do need more frequent EYLEA. And, and of course, if one has a new untested agent that doctors haven't seen, their hope in the place that they would first try in a small percentage of patients who don't -- who are not doing well. And of course, that's why it's being used in that setting. Now our goal, of course, with the high dose of EYLEA is to take now the best-in-class agent and hopefully produce even better results in terms of allowing these small percentage of patients who are being dosed more frequently, or even the patients who are now on eight-week regimens or 12-week regimens to go to more extended regimen. And that's the whole point of the design in the study. So I don't think there's any surprises that it's the small percentage of very hard to treat patients where somebody would try an untested agent that they're hoping might work better, but we have a real logical rational way that we are now taking EYLEA, bringing forth this high dose formulation and hope to extend the benefits that we're already seeing with this tried and true in terms of both safety and efficacy reagent, and even expand it and get even for these small percentage of patients longer dosing and even extend maybe everybody else.\nRyan Crowe: Okay. Thanks, George. Oh, last question please?\nOperator: Sure. And your last question comes from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nCarter Gould: Hi sorry. Thanks, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Thanks for squeezing us in. I guess, now that you fully own sort of Libtayo, can you update us on kind of where you stand on a subcutaneous formulation given what we've seen data from some of your competitors there and the importance of that the kind of key pace? And I guess, looking down the road then can you talk about the feasibility of potentially co-formulating Libtayo with one of these bispecifics, excuse me, costimulatories and if that's even feasibly possible recognizing it's or either way? Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: You can imagine we're working on the subq. We'll give you some details I think down the road later this year. In terms of co-formulation and we have a strong view that if you're doing it for gamesmanship or patent work and all that kind of stuff, you know that's one thing, but we, what we're more focused on is getting the optimal dose and the optimal regimen and they are not likely to be the same in many of these settings. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only useful if you're going try to have a single regimen that covers both. So, but we're a long way from worrying about that. We're far more focused on the fact that we've turned cold to hot which is a big deal at least in our eyes. And obviously it hasn't escaped yours, or I'm sure anybody's attention that now with this just appreciated new data where it looks like we're on the way of turning cold tumors to hot in combination with Libtayo we are in retrospect, very happy that we now have taken on sole ownership of Libtayo.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks Len and George. I think that that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all we have time for today. Bella, could you please conclude the call?\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, George. Regenerona\u0302\u0080\u0099s commercial business achieved another strong quarter demonstrating durable growth across our brands. We're building on the momentum of inline brands, including EYLEA, Dupixent, and Libtayo and also accelerating the potential across our portfolio from new and anticipated future launches. Let me start with EYLEA. Second quarter global net sales grew 13% year-over-year at constant currency to $2.5 billion. In the U.S. EYLEA net sales exceeded $1.6 billion, a 14% year-over-year increase driven by prescribing demand with strong demand continuing into the third quarter. EYLEA year-over-year growth significantly outpaced the category, gaining competitive share and further enhancing EYLEAa\u0302\u0080\u0099s position as the anti-VEGF agent of choice for retinal disease. We continue to see durable growth based on patient flow and new patient starts, ongoing demographic trends such as the aging population and prevalence of diabetes support anticipated mid-to-high single digit category growth for the foreseeable future. In diabetic eye disease, increasing diagnosis rates are also driving strong growth for EYLEA with more than $55 million injections worldwide since launch and well over 1 million injections in the U.S. alone in the second quarter of 2022. Physicians continue to recognize and prefer EYLEAa\u0302\u0080\u0099s differentiated efficacy and safety profile. We are confident in our ability to continue to build on our leadership over the long-term. Pending FDA approvals, there are potential incremental opportunities for EYLEA, including extending the dosing interval up to 16 weeks for diabetic retinopathy and treating preterm infants suffering from retinopathy of prematurity. In addition, aflibercept 8 investigational program has garnered significant enthusiasm from the retinal community and has the potential to significantly enhance the anti-VEGF treatment paradigm. Turning now to Libtayo, global net sales in the second quarter grew 25%, at constant currency to $141 million with U.S. net sales of $91 million. Libtayo continues to grow across all approved indications, including non-melanoma skin cancers, where Libtayo is the leading immunotherapy treatment. In monotherapy non-small cell lung cancer we are generating increased utilization across a broader number of prescribers. We are launch-ready for the potential chemotherapy combination approval, which will significantly expand the patient opportunity and physician choice for Libtayo in treating lung cancer. Regenerona\u0302\u0080\u0099s full ownership of Libtayo presents many exciting opportunities across our current and future oncology portfolio. Key thought leaders recognize our growing commitment to oncology and have high interest in the potential for Libtayo combinations to meaningfully advance the standard of care in many cancer indications. We are taking a measured approach to expanding our global commercial footprint in key international markets to maximize the impact of our innovations to patients and Regeneron. These capabilities and infrastructure will support Libtayo in overtime future medicines. And now turning to Dupixent, in the second quarter global Dupixent net sales grew 43% year-over-year at constant currency to $2.1 billion. Dupixenta\u0302\u0080\u0099s performance was fueled by strong uptake across all indications with recent launches performing well across new diseases, age groups, and geographies. In the U.S. Dupixent net sales grew 38% to $1.58 billion. We continue to expand Dupixenta\u0302\u0080\u0099s leadership position as the first line systemic treatment in atopic dermatitis. There's robust demand for Dupixent across the spectrum of moderate and severe disease, as well as across age groups. With the recent approval in children as young as six months, Dupixent is the first and only biologic medicine approved to treat moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis from infancy through adulthood and the launch in our youngest patients is off to a very strong start based on initiations. We are also preparing for the potential approval next month in prurigo nodularis, a dermatologic condition where approximately 75,000 U.S. patients have no FDA approved medicines and are most in need. In asthma Dupixent is the number one biologic prescribed by both allergists and pulmonologists. We continue to see strong growth in new patient starts and total prescriptions, driven by Dupixenta\u0302\u0080\u0099s differentiated profile, unique mechanism of action, ease of prescribing broad label and demonstrated efficacy and safety. In nasal polyps, robust demand continues with Dupixent capturing the majority of market share and increased prescribing from ENTs. In eosinophilic esophagitis, our first gastroenterology indication, Dupixent is the only approved medicine for adults and children aged 12 and above. Early launch indicators have been favorable with encouraging adoption from both allergists and gastroenterologists. In addition, we are expanding our outreach to educate patients and caregivers about Dupixent as a new therapeutic option that provides meaningful symptom relief. Turning now to Dupixent and markets outside the U.S., in the second quarter, net sales grew 61% on a constant currency basis to $510 million, driven by robust growth across all indications. Regeneron continues to expand our presence in key international markets to bring Dupixent to patients. In summary, Dupixent is transforming the type 2 inflammatory disease landscape and has significant growth potential ahead driven by further penetration and existing indications, as well as from potential future indications. In conclusion, our commercial execution delivered solid results for the second quarter, bringing our life-changing medicines to even more patients. Our inline brands continue to perform well and new launches provide additional opportunities for sustainable long-term growth. Now I'll turn the call to Bob. Sure. Let me take a start on some of the situations in market and perhaps George will add to that. But first let me comment that obviously we presented today very strong results on the growth of EYLEAa\u0302\u0080\u0099s standard of care in the marketplace, both in the U.S. and the worldwide information. You know, today in the branded category, U.S. anti-VEGF category, we have 75% of the branded market. We are approaching 50% of the overall market. So truly EYLEA is the standard of care. You know, it, it's probably best that fianlimab organization comment on where their product is being used, I'll comment anecdotally that early days, the response has been fairly muted, fairly low grade use in concentrated accounts rather than market wide. As for the future, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re very excited and optimistic that the aflibercept 8 mg will represent a new standard of care with true durability of dosing and the same type of efficacy and safety that we see with EYLEA.

            "content": "Thank you, Ryan and thank you to everyone joining todaya\u0302\u0080\u0099s call. Regeneron had a strong second quarter with notable execution across R&D, Commercial, and Business Development functions. Total revenues increased by 20% when excluding contributions from our COVID antibody cocktail. With net sales for EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo, each reaching new all-time quarterly highs and growing by double digits year-over-year on a constant currency basis. In addition to exceptional commercial execution, we made significant pipeline progress with three regulatory approvals, two accepted regulatory filings, and one positive Phase 3 readout. We also completed the acquisition of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals and the third quarter purchase of worldwide rights to Libtayo from Sanofi, both of which we believe will strengthen our oncology franchise in the near, medium and long-term. We also reported today preliminary, but promising anti-tumor activity and safety data for REGN5678 our PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with Libtayo in patients with advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. George will have more to say on this shortly. But we believe this represents an important step towards validating our costimulatory approach to fighting cancer and potentially advancing the science of immuno-oncology. Turning to our commercial performance. In the second quarter, EYLEA global net sales grew 13% at constant exchange rates to $2.5 billion. In the U.S. EYLEA net sales were $1.6 billion, up 14% year-over-year and outperforming anti-VEGF category growth of approximately 8%. Despite new competition EYLEAa\u0302\u0080\u0099s share was approximately half of the anti-VEGF category and 75% among branded agents, confirming its status as the gold standard anti-VEGF category. We believe aflibercept represents a significant potential growth opportunity going forward given favorable demographic trends as well as the potential for aflibercept 8 mg to augment the category and complement our retinal franchise. Regarding our investigational aflibercept 8 mg, the goal of our clinical program is to evaluate whether visual acuity among wet AMD and DME patients can be maintained or improved compared to EYLEA while extending the interval between doses. Equally important is maintaining the high bar for safety that has been set by EYLEA over the past 10 years, 55 million injections, worldwide and 8 million patient years of experience. We anticipate pivotal results in late quarter three or early quarter four and with supportive data, a BLA submission completed by early 2023. Dupixent continued to grow at a remarkable pace after five years and more than 450,000 patients treated since launch. In quarter two, global net product sales were $2.1 billion, an increase of 43% at constant exchange rates compared to last year, reflecting Dupixenta\u0302\u0080\u0099s differentiated clinical profile and ability to effectively treat more and more patients with the type two inflammatory diseases where Dupixent is approved. In the U.S. we saw growth across all indications, including initial contributions from atopic dermatitis in patients as young as six months to five years of age and from eosinophilic esophagitis, both of which are indications approved by the FDA during the second quarter and represent the first approved systemic treatment options for these patients. We hope to add a third first-in-class indication for Dupixent later this year in patients with prurigo nodularis, which is currently under Priority Review with the FDA. In Oncology, Libtayo net product sales grew 25% globally at a constant currency to $141 million in the second quarter of 2022, including 17% growth in the U.S., driven by non-melanoma skin cancer indications and monotherapy non-small cell lung cancer. We have long believed that the key to fully unlocking the opportunity in oncology is through differentiated combinations with Libtayo possibly serving as our foundation for many of them. That belief was the basis for our acquisition of the global rights to Libtayo. We plan to invest further in Libtayo based combinations, pairing it with promising candidates in our oncology pipeline, such as LAG-3 antibody fianlimab and our many investigational bispecifics, as well as with candidates from external collaborations. We continue to make progress with these Libtayo combinations and intend to share initial data in the second half of this year from our emerging oncology pipeline, which George will discuss in more detail. Regarding the FDA's review of our Libtayo chemo combo supplemental BLA for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, we are pleased with the progress that we have made as the FDA continues its review. However, we recently were informed that an FDA travel complication relating to scheduling a routine clinical trial site inspection in Eastern Europe will likely delay their decision until after our September 19 PDUFA date. While any delay is disappointing, a new site inspection date has been scheduled. Therefore, we do not expect a lengthy extension of the review period, and we do not expect it to meaningfully impact our launch plans assuming FDA approval. We continue to actively work with the FDA believing the ongoing review is otherwise progressing well and all other elements of the review remain on track. Regarding our COVID-19 response, Regeneron remains committed to combating the virus by developing additional novel antibodies. We continue to work with the FDA to establish a regulatory pathway for these antibodies, which could potentially serve an important role in protecting immunocompromised individuals who do not respond adequately to COVID-19 vaccines, as well as treating infected patients whom all antiviral therapy is not appropriate. In closing, as I reflect on our performance during the first half of the year, I am very proud of our numerous achievements, which were only made possible by the dedicated Regeneron employees around the world. Together we have continued to serve patients in need while strengthening the foundation of the company and leveraging our financial strength to better position Regeneron to achieve sustainable growth over time. We are excited about the increasing commercial momentum of our core products and the important progress we have made in advancing our pipeline. Our strategy continues to focus on investing in our internal R&D capabilities while exploring potential collaborations that will enable us to fully realize the power of our science. We remain confident in the strategy and in our growth prospects, as well as in our ability to deliver breakthroughs to patients and value to shareholders. Now, I'll turn the call over to George. We'll deal with that privately Tyler, sorry. Yes, it's a complicated -- it's a complicated question that until we see the final language in the statute, how it's interpreted and how it's actually implemented as to whether and how we file for the high dose, whether or not there'll be separate considerations for high dose versus the standard dose EYLEA. If there are -- if it turns out that there are, if it turns out that there are separate, we get a separate BLA, obviously you get, I can't remember what the statute says now, 11 or 12 years before this comes into play. And based on our current understanding of the bill, we believe that a new BLA would constitute a new biologic product. And therefore the 8 mg would not be subject to price negotiations in years. But we have to see what the final bill looks like and how it's interpreted. So we we're as anxious to see some of that as you are so being, so we will keep you informed about thinking as the bill is finalized and starting to be interpreted. Yes. And Matthew ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s Len. Maybe just add to, or what George said in terms of the investment side, we're prepared and we're able to make the investment across many different areas that George is talking about. And having under one roof, all the reagents owning all of Libtayo, having the variety of costims, having a variety of the CD3 three bispecifics and having all that knowledge, we think and the ability to invest puts us in a really terrific position. It is early going. We have to work through the safety. But to me, it's sort of reminiscent of once you started to see the excitement around the CAR T-cells, and the CAR T-cells actually provide a pretty good lesson in that they give very high levels of activity, response rates, 75% in some tumors or higher. And when you get those very high response rates, you also got very high levels of these immune reactions. You had -- and you look at the labels, you'll see 25% grade 3 neurologic adverse events and a whole bunch of other, not to mention all the cytokine release syndromes. So I think that these -- this is sort of an equivalent stage. We have got this tiger by the tail I really believe and George has described it well. And the amazing thing that should be echoed is that the preclinical data was extremely valuable. So Regeneron is not a company that just has all these molecules that we've acquired from others. These are all homegrown molecules, home tested, home validated, et cetera. There's a whole collection. We couldn't be more excited. I could keep going on, but maybe I'm getting waved off. We should take the next question."

            "content": "Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regenerona\u0302\u0080\u0099s financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regenerona\u0302\u0080\u0099s outstanding performance continued in the second quarter as our core business maintained a strong growth trajectory, and we have leveraged our strong financial position to complete two business development oncology transactions. Excluding global revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, second quarter total revenues increased 20% year-over-year to $2.9 billion demonstrating continued momentum across our business. Second quarter total diluted net income per share was $9.77 on net income of $1.1 billion. Beginning with collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. Second quarter 2022 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $870 million, up to 13% on a constant currency basis versus second quarter 2021. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $358 million of which $340 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $678 million in the second quarter of 2022, improved 55% from the prior year driven by Dupixent. Finally, we recorded Roche collaboration revenue of $8 million related to Rochea\u0302\u0080\u0099s sales of Ronapreve outside the U.S. We expect to record additional revenue from this collaboration in the fourth quarter of 2022. Moving now to our operating expenses. R&D increased 7% year-over-year to $690 million driven by higher head count in cost to support our expanding pipeline, partially offset by lower development costs for REGEN-COV. In the second quarter of 2022 acquired IPR&D was $197 million, which includes a previously disclosed $195 million charge related to our acquisition of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals. SG&A expense increased 14% year-over-year to $418 million, primarily due to costs related to growth initiatives for EYLEA and higher headcount to support our growing organization. Cost of goods sold decreased 73% year-over-year to $137 million primarily due to sales of REGEN-COV in the prior year that did not reoccur. Finally, the second quarter 2022 effective tax rate was 13.6% compared to 17% in the prior year. The lower rate is partially related to the non-recurrence of REGEN-COV sales. Shifting now to cash flow in the balance sheet. Year-to-date in 2022, Regeneron has generated $2.4 billion in free cash flow and ended the second quarter of 2022 with cash and marketable securities, less debt of $11.3 billion. We continue to deliver on our capital allocation priorities, completing our acquisition of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals, the first acquisition in Regenerona\u0302\u0080\u0099s history and the purchase of Sanofia\u0302\u0080\u0099s stake in Libtayo. In addition, we repurchased approximately $400 million of our shares in the second quarter of 2022, bringing our year-to-date total through July to over $1.1 billion. We continue to be opportunistic buyers where we see dislocation between our stock price and our intrinsic valuation. I will now discuss updates to our full year 2022 guidance driven by the closing of the Libtayo transaction. We are updating full year R&D expense guidance to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.24 billion, an increase of $170 million at the midpoint from our previous guidance. Approximately one third of the increase is driven by Regeneron now recording all R&D expense for Libtayo, which was previously shared with Sanofi. The remaining two thirds reflects the recording of our full 50% share of antibody collaboration spend as incurred beginning in the third quarter of 2022. Previously our share of antibody collaboration expenses was only partially expensed in the period incurred with the remaining share added to the antibody collaboration development balance. We were updating full year SG&A expense guidance to be in the range of $1.74 billion to $1.84 billion. The updated range reflects the inclusion of a 100% of Libtayo commercial expenses, which were previously shared with Sanofi net of anticipated synergies. We are also updating full year gross margin guidance to be in the range of 92% to 93%. The more favorable gross margin is due to the removal of the payment of Sanofia\u0302\u0080\u0099s share of U.S. Libtayo gross margin that was previously recorded in this slide. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. Let me conclude by highlighting four important financial modeling considerations related to the Libtayo transaction. First, effective July 1, Regeneron will record a 100% of the global Libtayo net product sales. We previously recorded only U.S. Libtayo net product sales. Second, the Libtayo off fund payment milestones and royalties will be recorded as an intangible asset on the balance sheet and amortized through cost of goods sold over the useful life of Libtayo. This amortization expense will be excluded from non-GAAP results. Third, as you may recall, we will now pay 20% of our share of antibody profits to reduce the antibody development balance instead of the previous 10% arrangement. The quarterly development balance repayment going forward will be reflected in our P&L as incremental antibody R&D expense I mentioned earlier when discussing revised R&D guidance with the remainder coming in the form of a reduction to antibody collaboration revenue. Therefore, the reduction in antibody collaboration revenue will be less than 20% of our share of antibody profits. As a result of the development balance repayment step-up, we expect to shorten the period to fully repay the development balance resulting in an earlier and very significant inflection in collaboration profits in the other years. Finally, in the third quarter of 2022, we will record a one-time development balance repayment per the Libtayo transaction agreement of approximately $55 million in addition to our regular quarterly repayments, which will be recorded as a deduction within the antibody collaboration revenue line. In conclusion, Regeneron is performing well and we continue to make investments in our business supported by our strong financial position to drive sustainable long-term growth. With that, I will pass the call back to Ryan."

            "name": "George Yancopoulos",
            "content": "Thanks Len. I will start with ophthalmology. We are looking forward to the upcoming Phase 3 readouts of aflibercept 8 mg in patients with diabetic macular edema and in wet age-related macular degeneration. PHOTON in patients with DME and PULSAR in patients with wet AMD will test whether patients treated with 8 mg dose every 12 weeks or every 16 weeks can achieve non-inferior best corrected visual acuity at week 48, compared to the currently approved EYLEA 2 mg dose every eight weeks. Unlike studies from other sponsors, in which patients were assigned to a dosing interval based on disease activity assessments following the loading phase, patients enrolled in the PHOTON and PULSAR studies were randomized at baseline into one of the three treatment groups, which we believe will allow us to determine whether extend dosing can truly be achieved. If the studies are positive and the high safety standard established with EYLEA is maintained, we believe aflibercept 8 mg would represent a significant clinical advance for patients. And we would target a U.S. regulatory filing by early 2023. Moving to Dupixent, which continued to deliver notable milestones in the second quarter of the year, Dupixent was recently improved in children with atopic dermatitis as young as six months old, making Dupixent the first and only biologic medicine approved to treat atopic dermatitis from infancy through adulthood. Marion will talk more about this as well as about our recent earlier than expected FDA approval for a brand new gastroenterology indication, eosinophilic esophagitis, or EOE. Since receiving approval in adults and in adolescent aged 12 and over, we have reported positive data in pediatric patients with EOE as young as 1 year of age. Our Phase 3 study in children 1 to 11 years of age met the primary endpoint with 68% of patients on the higher Dupixent dose and 58% on the lower Dupixent dose achieving histological disease remission compared to 3% of children on placebo at 16 weeks. EOE symptoms can be difficult to assess in these young patients. However, we also observed medical improvement in EOE symptom score. In an exploratory analysis we recorded 3.1% increase from baseline and body weight for age percentile for the higher dose group, compared to 0.3% of the placebo. These data will be discussed with regulatory authorities starting with the FDA later this year. Regarding approvals for new indications expected in the near future, for prurigo nodularis we received a PDUFA action date from the FDA of September 30. And the European Commission's decision expected in the first half of 2023. Also in the first half of next year, we are also looking forward to the readout of the first Dupixent study in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD. Moving on to Libtayo and oncology. As Len mentioned, we are excited to have acquired Sanofia\u0302\u0080\u0099s stake in Libtayo, thereby gaining exclusive worldwide rights to a PD1 inhibitor review as foundational for our oncology franchise, which has the potential to be utilized in numerous combinations with other candidates in our pipeline, such as our costimulatory bispecifics, our C3 bispecifics and novel checkpoint inhibitors, such as fianlimab. Regarding such combinations, I'd like to provide a brief update on our first clinical data from our costimulatory pipeline involving REGN5678, a PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with Libtayo. This combination is being studied in patients with advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, who have previously progressed on multiple anti-antigen therapies. These patients unfortunately have a poor prognosis with approximately one to two years of life expectancy and with limited treatment options. Metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer is considered an immunologically cold tumor and is largely resistant to immune checkpoint inhibitor, with large trials of PD1 antibodies showing monotherapy response rates in the single digits. As just announced today by Merck, the challenge of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer in terms of lack of efficacy for checkpoint inhibitors used in standard ways is emphasized by the failure of their large Phase 3 trial in earlier stage of this disease. Our costim program was designed to innovatively enhance responsiveness in these types of cold tumor classes, such as prostate cancer, and essentially turn these cold tumors into hot tumors. I will remind you of the extensive preclinical data we have published supporting this hypothesis. Since 2019 we have been in careful dose escalation for this prostate cancer program in close collaboration with the FDA. In our study, patients are dosed weekly with REGN5678 and every three weeks with Libtayo. However, first dose of Libtayo is not  until week-four, permitting a period of PSMAxCD28 leading to evaluate monotherapy safety and efficacy. Earlier today, we announced the first clinical data from 33 patients across eight dose levels, which showed dose dependent anti-tumor activity. The key efficacy endpoint in the study is objective response rate defined as a greater than 50% decline of prostate-specific antigen or PSA from baseline and/or tumor shrinkage. PSA is a protein produced by the prostate gland and by prostate tumors and this is commonly used as a biomarker to diagnose and follow up prostate cancer as many metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients have diseased limited to bone lesions and cannot be assessed by conventional resist criteria. Preliminary data from the ongoing dose escalation portion of the trial across eight dose level cohorts in a total of 33 patients showed dose dependent antitumor activity is assessed by PSA values at the five lowest dose levels, which are preclinical models predicted might be subtherapeutic. There was almost no evidence of any anti-tumor activity with only 1 in 17 patients showing a decrease in PSA. There were no greater than grade 3 -- greater or equal to grade 3 immune related adverse events or irAEs at these doses. The lack of anti-tumor activity among these patients was consistent with the approximate 6% response rate reported in other trials with anti-PD1 monotherapy. At the next three dose levels we began to see clear evidence of dose dependent anti-tumor activity, which was generally seen within six weeks of starting the combination. At dose level six, one of four patients experienced a 100% decrease in PSA and a complete response in target lesions based on resist criteria. The patient discontinued therapy due to a grade 3 immune-related adverse event of the skin that was considered to be a recurrence of a preexisting condition and has since resolved with treatment per investigator report. Despite termination of the treatment, he has maintained his 100% decrease in PSA and complete response in target lesions for approximately 10 months to date per investigator report. We continue to see anti-tumor activity at the next dose level or dose level seven. And in our eighth and most recent dose level, three out of four patients had dramatic and rapid PSA reductions, two with greater than 99% reductions and one with an 82% reduction. Of the two patients with greater than 99% PSA reductions, one experienced a grade 3 case of mucositis, which has resolved and the other experienced a grade 3 case of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy, which is ongoing. In terms of safety, very importantly, no grade 3 or higher irAEs were observed in patients without anti-tumor activity. And the occurrence of irAEs was correlated with anti-tumor activity. This is consistent with previous trials with anti PD1 immunotherapy, wherein irAEs have been reported to occur at a higher rate in responding patients. No grade 4 irAEs were greater than or equal to grade 2 cytokine release syndrome have been observed in the trial to date. There was one death that was considered unrelated to treatment. In this trial, irAEs are being treated according to standard management practices used for checkpoint inhibitors. We are planning on sharing more detailed data from this study at an upcoming medical meeting. Let remind you that through extensive preclinical research, we hypothesized that augmenting T-cell costimulation alongside PD inhibition could be a key to turning immunologically cold tumors hot. These preliminary data for a PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecific provides the first clinical evidence supporting the promise of our broader pipeline of coast inventory bispecifics in diverse solid tumors, as well as hemalogic malignancies. By combining these costimulatory bispecific  well with our CD3 bispecifics we have the opportunity to create novel therapeutic synergies to address some of the most difficult to treat cancers. We look forward to partnering with the oncology community on this ambitious and potentially groundbreaking efforts. In addition to these exciting early data, we anticipate several important oncology milestones in the second half of the year. At the upcoming ESMO Conference, we will provide updates on fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody in combination with Libtayo in a Phase 2 cohort of metastatic melanoma that will hopefully confirm the encouraging combined efficacy that we previously reported in this setting. In addition, we will present initial data for  our MUC16xCD3 bispecific in metastatic ovarian cancer, where I'd like to remind you that we have also combination studies ongoing with both costimulatory bispecifics and Libtayo. We will also report initial data for a METxMET bispecific in advanced met-altered non-small cell lung cancer as well as for Libtayo monotherapy with neoadjuvant cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Moving on to our hematology pipeline. Odronextamab has the potential to be the first CD20xCD3 bispecific to be approved for both major types of advanced B-cell lymphoma, that is both follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Based on interim data from a cohort of patients dosed with our recently modified step-up regimen, we believe odronextamab may have the lowest rates of grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome for this class of bispecific in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma while still maintaining the efficacy profile previously reported. We look forward to presenting these updated data and potentially submitting a BLA for both indications in the second half of this year, pending feedback from the FDA. We also plan to share updated data for a BCMAxCD3 bispecific study in relapse or refractory multiple myeloma by the end of the year. Pending regulatory feedback, we are planning to submit for regulatory approval in 2023. An umbrella study in multiple myeloma investigating BCMAxCD3 in combination with various standard of care products and investigational candidates is now open to enrollment while we plan to initiate an additional study in earlier lines of multiple myeloma later this year. As you can see, the pace of innovation in our oncology pipeline has been accelerating, building upon piles of foundation with data readouts for novel mechanisms for cancer indications that historically have not responded to immunotherapy. Concluding with our Regeneron genetics medicines, where we in collaboration continue to progress our pipeline and discovery engine. Our siRNA collaboration with Alnylam, a non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH contains product candidates addressing various targets, including those discovered by the Regeneron Genetic Center. First data in NASH for ALN-HSD are anticipated this fall. We are progressing a second target, PNPLA3 into the clinic later this year and we have recently identified an additional novel promising target for NASH site B. as we just published in the New England Journal of Medicine, we found unprecedented association of very rare site B loss of function variants with lower risk of liver disease. In the largest association study examined protection from liver disease ever described, individuals with loss of function of side B variant has about 53% lower risk of developing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and about 54% lower risk of developing non-alcoholic cirrhosis. Regeneron and Alnylam are developing siRNA therapeutic candidate leads to advance to the clinic. And with that, I will turn the call over to Marion. Yes, those are really interesting questions and they get into the detail of very specific points of the regimen. Many of these, as you point out have not been directly studied in sort of head to head studies. So where we would have to maybe offline discuss some of these issues, but as I said, details that would require a lot of experimentation, maybe the answer. Yes, no, thanks. We are obviously very excited about these data that have been, long been coming. As you all know we had to go through a very careful dose escalation starting with very low doses, but what we've now seen at the dose level 6, 7 and 8 has really been very exciting. I think that what we're going to be doing is we're going to be continuing to expand the number of patients at these dose levels. We're going to continue to evaluate the tumor activity as well as the safety and we hope that we're going to see that the responses remain profound and durable while the safety hopefully most of them will resolve and be managed well. And if we continue down that path, we will, as you say, also continue to explore other dose levels and so forth. But the level of tumor activity and balanced by the safety event that we're seeing on doses, are occurring now at levels where we think that they could be providing a new standard for benefit risk for this population. I think that it's important now to point out and remind everybody, I mean, I said it, but just to say it again, the IRAs  were only seen in the patients who had profound anti-tumor activity. That is the patients who didn't benefit did not really indicate in terms of higher level IRAs  to have significant safety concern. And that is of course, what you want to see, that the patients who have the benefit that the safety is limited to those, youa\u0302\u0080\u0099re not doing harm to the patients that do not benefit. Okay, I guess we're ready for next question. Well, we have to, we were somewhat confused by the whole of the business data and it's meaning it's intense because of the confusing study design. We are basically only after you see how well patients are doing you then shift them. So if you take your best patients and you shift them, for example, to a Q 12 or Q 16 regimen, and you say, oh, X percent of patients can send this regimen, you are not really understanding how good your drug is and what percent of the patients can actually achieve that dosing regimen. We know, and we've already published on this, that patients who do well can be dramatically extended. We're trying to answer a very different question, which we think is going to be very, very important to the community, which is whether you can truly achieve extended dosing. And whether you can prospectively put people into these dosing regimens and get substantial numbers of them to stay at these dosing regimens, because we're giving the higher dose of EYLEA, which we believe has this ability to maintain more patients at these longer intervals. So we really believe that this would represent a significant clinical advance and would also clarify how to use these drugs as opposed to the prior somewhat confusing approaches. That's a great question. I think you bring up a great point. And I think those of us who have been in this field now, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re of course so excited by the early promise of immunotherapy checkpoint inhibitors and particularly PD1 antibodies. But of course over the years it's been recognized that only a small percentage of tumors, even in responding, even in the most responsive cancers, not all the patients respond and for many tumor classes, as we just saw with Merck's announcement of their failure today, in many classes, there's almost no detectable activity. So the Holy Grail in the field that people have been looking for is an answer to the question of, how do you activate immunotherapy in all these cold tumors, which is unfortunately the vast majority of cancers, both solid tumors and hemalogic malignancies. And so we went down this path based on the science that we could add the second signal, signal 2 to the first signal that could activate T cells. And these preliminary data suggest that that hypothesis might be right, and that we are on the way to this Holy Grail, that this is we believe very early data. We have a long way to go, but it's a spectacular indication that we have done where we are in the midst of doing and on the path of doing exactly what we set out to do, which is to turn immunotherapy cold tumors into hot tumors with dramatic anti-tumor activity. And the implications here based on all the pre-clinical data suggest that this is going to be broadly applicable. And as you all know, we have been developing a very broad costimulatory pipeline across many, many tumor classes, and several of them are already in the clinic, I mentioned. We have the prostate data. We have ongoing studies with the costim for ovarian cancer. We have other costims that are in the clinic for -- and we have other costims that are going to be entering into the clinic over the next short period of time. These are going to cover all sorts of cancers from the lung cancers that don't respond to hemalogic malignancies and so forth and so on. So we really think that this could be groundbreaking and taking immunotherapy now to the next level where all of us in the field were hoping it was going to go with the early advances with checkpoint inhibitors and have been frustrated over obviously the last decade or so that we haven't been able to get there. This may be the way to get there for the field. We have a very broad pipeline of costimulatory bispecific. By the way, we believe this validates the concept of the combinations, not only with Libtayo, and the PD1 class, but also with our CD3 class of bispecifics, because it suggests that the preclinical data which is so strongly supported now with this clinical data might also be very predictive for that class. So, a lot of exciting possibilities across very broad areas, diverse  hemalogic malignancies. This is, I think, could represent the next breakthrough for immunotherapy. No, I just want to add and build on what Len has said. So I think just like he said, in some ways, the CAR Ts in terms of high efficacy, particularly in hematologic malignancies, because that's where it's seen high efficacy seeing along with the AEs and in some of the responding patients, that's a good analogy. But I do have to point out the many differences. These are off the shelf reagents. Okay? Which God forbid, if there is a safety issue can be stopped. And it's much easier as we're already demonstrating to create a whole pipeline across a whole variety of broad cancers and unlike the Car T world right now, anyway, these are dramatic effects in solid tumors which were never really seen before by any other modality. So this is actually pretty exciting. There are analogies, there are in terms of dramatic efficacy, but also very important differences here that establish this as a potential breakthrough new class. I think we've given a lot of the details and we're going be giving a lot more details obviously in upcoming meetings. Suffice it to say that as I mentioned for most of these patients, actually many of these patients, they don't have lesions outside of the bone, which is why we use PSA as as the indicator of total disease activity, because you don't have that many lesions. Okay? So that's one point where we're focusing on the PSA. We do believe that many of the IRAEs are the sort of IRAEs that you do see with both PD1 therapy and as Len mentioned also with CAR T therapy. And I think we indicate every single great 3 that we had and indicated that actually even though these are very early data in the treatment most of these patients many of these are actually already resolving or resolved. And we're going to continue to follow these patients and look for hopefully as seen, remember a total of six that one patient, the reason we highlighted then is they were the first responding patients, so we've now had almost a year follow up and we have this very impressive durability of response there. The other cohorts are much more recently treated and that's why wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re not giving that much follow up because these are patients who are in the very early months of being treated. But obviously you hear it, you hear it in our voices probably, those of us who have commented, we think this rule has the potential to be game changing, game changing for the field of immunotherapy and taking immunotherapy to the next level, also game changing for our oncology program and for our company. Marion is going to answer the question. By the way we don't market products before they are approved. So it's not surprising that there is not awareness of a product that's an investigational product. Marion can comment on the other stuff. All right, let me just add to that, that it's important to point out that the reason why EYLEA has become the leading anti-VEGF agent, branded VEGF agent is because it allows most of the EYLEA patients to go on longer interval dosing and have, and be very satisfied with the response. Now, of course, as with any disease and situation, not every patient is going do perfectly well. And we know that there is a small percentage of patients who do need more frequent EYLEA. And, and of course, if one has a new untested agent that doctors haven't seen, their hope in the place that they would first try in a small percentage of patients who don't -- who are not doing well. And of course, that's why it's being used in that setting. Now our goal, of course, with the high dose of EYLEA is to take now the best-in-class agent and hopefully produce even better results in terms of allowing these small percentage of patients who are being dosed more frequently, or even the patients who are now on eight-week regimens or 12-week regimens to go to more extended regimen. And that's the whole point of the design in the study. So I don't think there's any surprises that it's the small percentage of very hard to treat patients where somebody would try an untested agent that they're hoping might work better, but we have a real logical rational way that we are now taking EYLEA, bringing forth this high dose formulation and hope to extend the benefits that we're already seeing with this tried and true in terms of both safety and efficacy reagent, and even expand it and get even for these small percentage of patients longer dosing and even extend maybe everybody else. You can imagine we're working on the subq. We'll give you some details I think down the road later this year. In terms of co-formulation and we have a strong view that if you're doing it for gamesmanship or patent work and all that kind of stuff, you know that's one thing, but we, what we're more focused on is getting the optimal dose and the optimal regimen and they are not likely to be the same in many of these settings. Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s only useful if you're going try to have a single regimen that covers both. So, but we're a long way from worrying about that. We're far more focused on the fact that we've turned cold to hot which is a big deal at least in our eyes. And obviously it hasn't escaped yours, or I'm sure anybody's attention that now with this just appreciated new data where it looks like we're on the way of turning cold tumors to hot in combination with Libtayo we are in retrospect, very happy that we now have taken on sole ownership of Libtayo."

With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer. Len?\nLeonard Schleifer: Thank you Ryan. Welcome to your first earnings call. I hope all of us stakeholders will join me in giving you a warm welcome to the Regeneron team. Thanks for everyone joining the call as well. Following an exceptional 2021, Regeneron is off to a strong start in 2022. Our first quarter results were driven by execution across the entire company as we continued to realize the benefits of our sustained investment in differentiated research and development along with our focus on commercial performance. We also continued to drive shareholder value through proven capital allocation, including approximately $350 million of share repurchases in the first three months of this year. Regarding our financial performance, we delivered strong double-digit revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share growth. Excluding revenue contributions from our investigation of COVID antibody cocktails, revenues grew 25%, reflecting our increasingly diversified core business which continues to thrive. For EYLEA, global net sales grew 11% to nearly $2.4 billion in the first quarter, including $1.5 billion of revenues in the United States, up 13% versus last year which outpaced the U.S. anti-VEGF category. In yet another milestone for EYLEA after more than 10 years, we recently surpassed 50 million EYLEA injections globally, a testament to its well-established efficacy and safety profile. We believe EYLEA continues to represent a significant long term growth opportunity primarily driven by an aging population, increasing utilization among the rapidly growing diabetic population, as well as the potential for our investigational aflibercept 8 milligrams to complement and enhance our retinal franchise.  For Dupixent in quarter one, global revenues for the quarter exceeded $1.8 billion, an increase of 43% to last year as we continued to redefine the treatment of Type 2 inflammatory diseases. A significant opportunity remains to reach even more patients in already approved indications and we look forward to potentially launching Dupixent in seven new indications in the U.S. later this year and in early 2023, including pediatric atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, and prurigo nodularis. Collectively, approximately 200,000 U.S. patients are suffering from these three indications today but currently have no FDA-approved systemic treatment options. In oncology, Libtayo continues to capture significant share in FDA-approved non-melanoma skin cancer indications, where it is considered the standard of care. Beyond dermato-oncology, we\u2019re beginning to generate momentum in monotherapy non-small cell lung cancer in the United States, helping to build a foundation for potential launch of Libtayo post-chemotherapy later this year, which would allow Libtayo to address a much larger population of non-small cell lung cancer patients.  As we have said before, we continue to consider Libtayo to be foundation to our immune-oncology development strategy and expect it to serve as the backbone for our investigation of clinical programs in combination with various antibodies, bispecifics and co-stimulatory bispecifics in our pipeline, as well as other pipeline candidates including those from our collaborations.  In April, we announced our agreement to acquire Checkmate Pharmaceuticals, Regeneron\u2019s first-ever acquisition of a company. Upon closing we expect Checkmate\u2019s differentiated toll receptor 9 agonist, vidutolimod will add a promising new modality to Regeneron\u2019s pipeline of potential approaches for difficult to treat cancers.  Looking ahead, we remain on track for the second half of this year to share data in difficult to treat solid tumors, such as ovarian and prostate cancers, to submit a BLA for Odronextamab, our potentially best-in-class CD20xCD3 bispecific for refractory B-cell lymphomas, and to advance Regeneron 5458, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific.  Finally regarding our ongoing COVID-19 response, Regeneron remains committed to combating the virus as we head toward the likely endemic stage. We firmly believe that monoclonal antibodies will continue to play an important role, particularly to protect immunocompromised individuals who do not respond adequately to COVID-19 vaccines as well as to treat infected patients for whom an oral antiviral therapy is not well tolerated or might trigger serious drug-drug interactions. We are progressing next-generation antibodies that are designed to be active against multiple variants, including those of omicron lineage, and initiated a first in human study last month concurrently as the FDA continues their review of our REGEN-COV BLA for COVID-19 treatment and prophylaxis. We\u2019re working closely and collaboratively with them and other global regulatory authorities to establish clinical and regulatory pathways to bring additional safe and effective monoclonal treatment options to patients as quickly as possible. In closing, we are excited about the strong commercial momentum for our inline portfolio and the progress we have made advancing our pipeline so far this year. For the remainder of 2022, we anticipate up to eight additional U.S. and EU regulatory approvals, up to four additional U.S. or EU regulatory filings, pivotal data for aflibercept 8 milligrams, as well as various other data read-outs from other pipeline programs, which George will discuss.  We remain confident in the long term outlook for our business and our pipeline continues to be highly productive, and we are in a strong financial position, all of which positions Regeneron to deliver sustainable growth and long term value creation.  Now I will turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Thank you Len. I will start with ophthalmology today.  At the recent Angiogenesis meeting, we presented encouraging results for the Phase II CANDELA study of aflibercept 8 milligrams in patients with wet AMD  primary safety end points with no new safety signals observed through week 44 and efficacy end points numerically favored aflibercept 8 milligrams in visual acuity, drying, and other anatomical measures through week 44. Phase III studies, PHOTON in DME and PULSAR in wet AMD are ongoing. The primary objective of the Phase III studies is to determine whether aflibercept 8 milligram dosing can allow for more extended dosing intervals while maintaining efficacy and safety.  Regarding Phase III design in both PHOTON and the PULSAR study, patients are randomized at baseline to three groups: an every 8 week EYLEA 2 milligram arm, an every 12 week 8 milligram aflibercept arm, and an every 16 week aflibercept 8 milligram arm following loading doses. The primary end point of both these studies is mean change in best corrected visual acuity, or BCVA at week 48. The primary end point will be met if 8 milligram aflibercept is not inferior to 2 milligram EYLEA while being dosed less frequently. We anticipate results of both PHOTON and PULSAR in the second half of this year and if positive, to file for regulatory approvals in the U.S. and EU by early 2023. Moving to Dupixent, which had a remarkable quarter in terms of clinical updates and regulatory progress, in January we announced our second positive Phase III study in prurigo nodularis, a disease with high unmet need. At the AAAAI and AAD meetings this year, we presented detailed data from the first positive Phase III study in prurigo nodularis and we also presented detailed data from our positive Phase III studies in eosinophilic esophagitis and in chronic spontaneous urticaria, or CSU, in biologic na\u00efve patients. The second Phase III CSU study in patients refractory to omalizumab did not reach statistical significance in an interim analysis, and as announced in March, we have completed enrollment in the first of the two Phase III Dupixent studies in COPD and anticipate data from this first study to read out in the first half of next year. In terms of regulatory progress, we expect an FDA decision for Dupixent in children aged six months to five years with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis by the new June 9 PDUFA date. We are also excited about an upcoming trial in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or the NIAID, to assess efficacy and safety of Dupixent for asthma in underserved populations, including Black and Hispanic children in the United States. Additionally, we are expecting an FDA decision for our supplementary BLA in eosinophilic esophagitis in patients 12 years and older by August 3, and we completed our regulatory submission for prurigo nodularis indication with FDA acceptance of this application anticipated shortly. Moving to Libtayo and oncology, we are excited about the upcoming milestones in our oncology pipeline, including the FDA decision on our Libtayo chemo combination application for non-small cell lung cancer, data readouts and potential regulatory filings for our hematology bispecifics, as well as initial data readouts from our bispecific antibodies for solid tumors. In hematology, Odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific has the potential for best-in-class efficacy in both follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and was recently granted fast track designation from the FDA for these indications. Detailed results of our first in human study were recently published in Lancet Hematology and our registration in 10 programs in late stage follicular lymphoma and DLBCL are expected to complete enrollment soon. Based on the safety profile we are observing from our updated step-up dosing regimen, we believe Odronextamab has the potential to be administered entirely within the outpatient setting. We look forward to filing with this updated data set later this year, pending regulatory feedback from the FDA. Development of REGN5458, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific investigated for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, remains on track and pending regulatory feedback, we are planning to submit regulatory approval in the first half of 2023. Studies in earlier lines of the disease as well as an umbrella study in multiple myeloma investigating 5458 in combination with various standard of care products and investigational candidates will begin enrollment shortly.  The second half of the year, we anticipate initial clinical data disclosures for three first-in-class bispecifics: our MUC16xCD3 monotherapy for late stage ovarian cancer, our METxMET bispecific antibody for met-altered non-small cell lung cancer, as well as our PSMAxCD28 costim bispecific in combination with Libtayo in late stage prostate cancer. For these late stage cancers, patients have limited options, and showing any durable response would be a promising early sign to be confirmed with additional clinical studies also involving combinations.  We continue to progress our strategic approach to oncology which starts with Libtayo as our foundational anti-PD1 therapy and is augmented by logical combinations utilizing our broad oncology pipeline, whether it involves combining Libtayo with a second checkpoint inhibitor, as we are doing with our LAG-3 antibody in melanoma and other settings, with different combinations of bispecifics or with other agents in our portfolio. Briefly turning to our antibodies against COVID-19, as we recently announced, the FDA extended its review of our REGEN-COV BLA for COVID-19 treatment and prophylaxis with a new action date of July 13. This extension was due to ongoing discussions with additional data provided to the FDA on pre-exposure prophylaxis use of REGEN-COV. As this regulatory process continues, we are advancing next-generation COVID-19 antibodies and initiated a first in human trial with a new candidate in April. We continue to believe that a major unmet need for COVID antibodies is in chronic disease prevention for immunocompromised patients and future development efforts will be addressing this population. Concluding with our Regeneron genetics medicine, where we in collaboration are continuing to advance our pipeline. For our siRNA collaboration with Alnylam, we are very excited about our first-in-class approach to combining siRNA with antibody therapeutics designed to maximize effect as well as duration of target blockade. The first of these is our C5 siRNA antibody combination, cemdisiran plus pozelimab. Phase III studies of the combination treatment for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH, and myasthenia gravis are underway and we\u2019ll be dosing patients shortly. In PNH, we are planning to test our combo in both na\u00efve and switch patients tested against standard of care therapies, including ravulizumab and eculizumab. Beyond C5, several additional combination programs are in our pre-clinical pipeline. We continue to work with Alnylam as leaders in the use of siRNA therapeutics to address non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, with several programs addressing novel targets discovered by the Regeneron Genetic Center. First data in NASH patients for ALN-HSD are anticipated mid-2022. We are progressing a second target, PNPLA3 into the clinic later this year and have recently identified an additional novel promising target that has been validated by RGC and is awaiting peer review publication.  We are also pleased to report a novel milestone, that we and Alnylam initiated our first CNS target siRNA clinical program targeting amyloid precursor protein, or APP, in development for both cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Showing that this siRNA approach can reduce levels of the target protein in the CNS has the potential to open the door for using this approach in multiple genetically defined neurodegenerative diseases.  In the first quarter, we and Intellia provided an update on our joint CRISPR-based knockout program for transthyretin amyloidosis. Just to remind you, this is the first example of achieving CRISPR-based genomic editing in human beings. Our recent update demonstrated greater than 90% reduction of transthyretin durably achieved for the follow-up observation period in patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, as well as acceptable safety observed so far. Our genetics medicine portfolio now includes a diverse pipeline of siRNA candidates that we are working on with Alnylam targeting diseases of the liver, the brain and the eye, as well as our CRISPR-based approaches in collaboration with Intellia and our bio-targeted gene delivery programs, such as with Decibel addressing congenital forms of hearing loss and other internal programs. While still early, we think these groundbreaking approaches have the potential to change the practice of medicine. With that, I will turn the call over to Marion.\nMarion McCourt: Thank you George. Our commercial performance in the first quarter reflects strong execution and the competitive strength of our diversified and growing portfolio. Starting with EYLEA, first quarter global net sales grew 11% year-over-year to nearly $2.4 billion. Over the same period, U.S. net product sales grew 13% to $1.52 billion as EYLEA continues to strengthen its leadership position. Across approved indications, EYLEA is the preferred anti-VEGF treatment based on its differentiated efficacy and safety profile, as well as extensive real world patient and physician experience. As Len mentioned we are incredibly proud that EYLEA helped improve or save the vision of patients around the world with more than 50 million treatments since launch. Category growth and EYLEA market share continued to increase across all approved indications. In diabetic eye disease, we have seen notable increases across the patient continuum from initial patient diagnosis through to receiving ongoing EYLEA treatment. We believe diabetic eye disease will remain an important source of future growth for EYLEA as, unfortunately, most patients remain under-diagnosed and under-treated. Beyond EYLEA, our investigational aflibercept 8 milligram clinical program continues to generate excitement and a high level of interest within the retinal community. If supported by Phase III results, aflibercept 8 milligram has the potential to be a major enhancement to the anti-VEGF treatment paradigm. In summary, we are confident in Regeneron\u2019s ability to maintain leadership over the long term based on our current EYLEA performance and future potential of aflibercept 8 milligram.  Turning now to Libtayo, with first quarter global net sales of $125 million, in the U.S. net sales were $79 million based on steadily improving demand across FDA-approved non-melanoma skin cancer indications. The number of prescribers has increased in our non-small cell lung cancer monotherapy indication based on growing brand awareness, positive prescriber feedback, and an increasing number of institutions and networks that have included Libtayo in protocols and pathways. We are working to build on this momentum ahead of the potential chemotherapy combination approval expected later this year that would dramatically expand the patient opportunity for Libtayo in lung cancer. Finally onto Dupixent, which again achieved remarkable growth for the quarter, demonstrated by a 43% increase in global net sales to over $1.8 billion. Our performance was fueled by robust uptake across all approved indications as well as an expanding geographic footprint and potential future indications, including use in younger patients. Dupixent is a transformational medicine for patients and prescribers with significant growth potential ahead. In the U.S., net product sales grew 38% to $1.3 billion. In atopic dermatitis, Dupixent is the first line systemic treatment in patients with moderate to severe disease. Healthcare specialists recognize Dupixent\u2019s differentiated profile, which includes dual anti-IL4 and IL13 mechanism of action compelling efficacy, rapid symptom relief, and well established safety profile. More than 430,000 patients worldwide are currently on treatment across all indications and launch preparations are underway for the June potential label expansion for children as young as six months of age with atopic dermatitis. We estimate approximately 75,000 biologic eligible children in the U.S. could benefit from Dupixent in this younger age group. We also look forward to potentially extending Dupixent\u2019s label to include additional dermatology conditions, including prurigo nodularis where patients have no currently FDA-approved medicines. Approximately 75,000 U.S. patients with PN are in need of new treatment options and may benefit from Dupixent. In the highly competitive biologic asthma indication, Dupixent continues to grow based on its compelling differentiation for healthcare professionals based on its unique dual mechanism action, ease of administration, demonstrated safety, broad label, and use in both steroid-dependent patients and pediatric patients. There are positive prescribing trends from the recently pediatric asthma launch. In nasal polyps, Dupixent remains the preferred choice for both ENTs and allergists with rapid growth even three years after initial launch. Many patients with Type 2 or allergic disease suffer from another concomitant Type 2 disease. For example, in our atopic dermatitis clinical program, 40% of patients also had asthma. Dupixent is differentiated not only by its efficacy and safety profile in individual FDA-approved Type 2 indications but also its potential to simultaneously address multiple Type 2 diseases in the same patient. We look forward to expanding Dupixent into even more Type 2 diseases. Launch preparations are underway for eosinophilic esophagitis, where there are no FDA-approved medicines and significant unmet need. Importantly in our EOE clinical program, approximately 45% of patients also had atopic dermatitis or asthma. If approved in EOE, we estimate at least 50,000 patients in the U.S. could benefit from Dupixent in this indication. Key opinion leaders continue to provide positive feedback on our clinical data, especially given the lack of effective approved treatment alternatives for their patients who suffer from multiple EOE symptoms. Turning briefly now to Dupixent in markets outside the U.S., in the first quarter net product sales grew 61% to $485 million. Over the past year, Regeneron has expanded our commercial presence in several key markets outside the United States, and we are encouraged with progress so far integrating our sales efforts with Sanofi. In summary, we see significant potential for Dupixent to continue to change the lives of patients and their families, and we will continue to advance initiatives that bring Dupixent to those in need.  In conclusion, we are pleased with performance across our portfolio. We continue to advance our inline brands and are on track to deliver on future launches, positioning Regeneron for sustained and long term growth. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bob.\nRobert Landry: Thank you Marion. My comments today on Regeneron\u2019s financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron is off to a strong start in 2022 with double-digit top and bottom line growth in the first quarter, driven by execution across the business. First quarter total revenues grew 17% year-over-year to $2.97 billion. Excluding global revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, total revenues grew 25%, demonstrating continued strength of our core business. First quarter total diluted net income per share grew 16% to $11.49 on net income of $1.3 billion.  Beginning with collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer, first quarter 2022 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $869 million, growing 7% on a reported basis and 13% on a constant currency basis versus first quarter 2021. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $385 million, of which we recorded $338 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S.  Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $631 million in the first quarter of 2022 and grew 73% from the prior year, driven by Dupixent. In this quarter, we recognized the $50 million sales milestone upon achieving $2 billion of aggregate ex-U.S. sales for antibody collaboration products on a rolling 12-month basis.  Finally, we recorded Roche collaboration revenue of $216 million related to Roche\u2019s sales of Ronapreve outside the U.S. We do expect additional revenue from this collaboration primarily in the second half of 2022. Regarding REGEN-COV in the U.S., consistent with our commentary from earlier this year, we did not record any U.S. sales for REGEN-COV in the first quarter of 2022. Absent the execution and fulfillment of an additional government contract, we do not expect to record any U.S. sales for REGEN-COV this year. Other revenue in the first quarter of 2022 was $94 million. This includes a $30 million upfront payment from our collaborator, Ultragenyx to market Evkeeza outside of the U.S.  Moving now to our operating expenses, R&D increased 12% to $751 million driven by higher headcount and clinical manufacturing costs, including for next-gen COVID antibodies, partially offset by lower clinical trial costs for REGEN-COV. Starting in the first quarter of 2022, we are changing the presentation of our non-GAAP results to include in-process R&D acquired in connection with asset acquisitions, as well as upfront and opt-in payments related to license and collaboration agreements. Going forward, we will now include these charges in both GAAP and non-GAAP results as a new line item called Acquired In Process Research and Development. In the first quarter of 2022, acquired IPR&D was $28 million, which includes a $20 million opt-in payment to our collaborator, Adicet. In full year 2021, there were $44 million of aggregate upfront payments excluded from non-GAAP R&D expense, all of which were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021.  SG&A expense increased 10% year-over-year to $389 million, primarily due to costs related to growth initiatives for EYLEA and higher headcount to support our expanding organization. COCM increased 58% year-over-year to $198 million due to higher sales in Dupixent and an increase in shipments of commercial supplies of Praluent for Sanofi outside the United States. Finally, the first quarter 2022 effective tax rate was 11.6% compared to 10.5% in the prior year. Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet, in the first quarter of 2022, Regeneron generated $2 billion in free cash flow, inclusive of collections from the U.S. Government for sales of REGEN-COV recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021 and ended the first quarter of 2022 with cash and marketable securities less debt of $11.4 billion.  We continue to deliver on our capital allocation priorities. Last month, we announced the agreement to acquire Checkmate Pharmaceuticals for total equity value of approximately $250 million. Earlier this week, we launched the tender offer for Checkmate shares and expect this deal to close in mid-2022 subject to receipt of regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. In addition, we repurchased $352 million of our shares in the first quarter of 2022. We continue to be opportunistic buyers where we see dislocation between our stock price and our intrinsic valuation.  I will conclude with select updates to our full year 2022 guidance and outlook. We are updating full year R&D guidance to be in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion. The increase in guidance is driven by clinical manufacturing costs for next-gen COVID antibodies, most of which were recorded in the first quarter, and advancing programs across our pipeline. We also now expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 12% to 14%. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. In conclusion, our core business is performing well and we continue to make investments in our R&D engine supported by our strong financial position, leaving Regeneron well positioned for sustainable long term growth. With that, I will pass the call back to Ryan.\nRyan Crowe: Thank you Bob.  Gigi, that concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019d now like to open the call for Q&A.  With more than 20 callers in the queue and to ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will answer only one question from each caller before moving to the next. Gigi, please go ahead.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from the line of Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nChris Raymond: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just a question maybe for Marion, if I can, on EYLEA and the competitive set. I know you guys have said feedback from the market on Vabysmo has been somewhat muted, but it\u2019s actually kind of striking how different Roche is viewing the reception of the drug. They highlight a lot of enthusiasm from docs and I know there\u2019s a lot of talk about what will happen after a permanent J-code. I know you guy have a lot of levers to pull here, not least of which is launching the high dose format of EYLEA, but can you talk a little bit about the rebates, how they are playing into your counterstrategy in the maybe near to intermediate term, and how we should be thinking about net pricing going forward? Thanks\nMarion McCourt: Chris, happy to give you some characterization of the market. First let me comment on EYLEA. As we reported today, our performance certainly with EYLEA in a very competitive marketplace is quite strong across indications, and certainly we see very strong performance not only in capturing more than our fair share of the market growth but also competitive share gains across indications. As a reminder, in the overall market we have about 50% of the VEGF category market share with EYLEA and in the branded marketplace over 75% of the branded market share.  I really do think it\u2019s probably best to let Roche comment on uptake of their new product in the marketplace. I\u2019ll share that prescribers and key opinion leaders comment to us on the importance of the demonstrated safety they see with EYLEA, the efficacious profile that we have, and certainly the extensive consideration across indications and in-market use that has been incredibly robust.  As it relates to other items around pricing and things of that sort, generally we don\u2019t comment; but I certainly will say that looking ahead, we see strong leadership with EYLEA and a profile that is certainly leading the category in terms of experience, uptake and use.\nRyan Crowe: Thank you. Next question, Gigi.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nCory Kasimov: Great, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. To follow up on EYLEA, I wanted to ask about the high dose formulation. Assuming the results read out as you anticipate, how do you think about this product potentially slotting into the treatment landscape? Is it possible this could broadly take over from your current dose, or would you expect it to be primarily used in certain segments of the market? Thank you.\nMarion McCourt: I think at this point, we\u2019ll want to wait and look at product profile as the clinical data matures and then certainly as we move into launch preparation planning, we\u2019ll be considerable of how the profile matches up against patient need and opportunity, so I think more to come on specifics on uptake. We remain optimistic, but of course we need to wait and see how the clinical data matures and the profile of product is clarified.\nRyan Crowe: Thank you. Gigi, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Siegerman from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nEvan Siegerman: Hi guys, thank you so much for taking the question. I\u2019d love if you could expand on some of the rationale behind acquiring or proposing to acquire Checkmate Pharmaceuticals. Anything in the data that was particularly notable when you were doing your diligence that piqued your interest, and do you expect to go forward combining their asset with Libtayo versus, say, nivolumab or pembro as they had on their prior trials? Thank you.\nLeonard Schleifer: I\u2019m sure--it\u2019s Len here. I\u2019m sure George would love to expand upon the thinking, but unfortunately because we just launched a tender offer, we\u2019re really not committed to have that discussion. We\u2019ll look forward to that discussion assuming that the deal closes around the middle of the year, as we anticipate.\nEvan Siegerman: Fair enough, Len. Fair enough. \nLeonard Schleifer: Sorry.\nEvan Siegerman: No, it\u2019s all right.\nLeonard Schleifer: But because we couldn\u2019t answer that question, if you get back in the queue, we\u2019ll come back to you for another question.\nEvan Siegerman: Fair enough.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks Evan. Gigi, next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nSalveen Richter: Good morning, thanks for taking my question. On these initial bispecific data sets in solid tumors in the second half, could you just speak to what exactly we\u2019re going to see initially and then what you would want to see from the data set in terms of being clinically meaningful?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Well, as I indicated in my remarks, basically we\u2019re going into late stage patients heavily pretreated. We\u2019re hoping to actually be able to report on seeing objective responses, and the number and the duration of the responses is what we\u2019re looking for. We would love to be able to see significant numbers of durable responses showing that each one of these novel agents is really making a difference in the latest stage patients. That of course would open up for each one of them, we think, very important opportunities in terms of both those late stage settings but also particularly with logical combinations going back to earlier and earlier stage patients. Each one of them could become then a significant program, not only in monotherapy but in combination with logical other agents.  So as I said, responses with duration is what we\u2019re looking for in all three of those programs. \nLeonard Schleifer: Just to amplify a little bit, to make sure nobody missed what George just said, is that it seems to be the case that with these types of reagents, much as it is the case with other anti-cancer agents, that while you start in the latest, most difficult patients, there is better activity in earlier lines with these kinds of immune reagents, so finding activity in the late heavily treated would be very encouraging. \nRyan Crowe: Thanks Len and George. Gigi, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nBrian Abrahams: Good morning, congrats on all the progress, and thanks so much for taking my question. Could you elaborate a little bit more on the safety benefit that you\u2019re seeing for Odronextamab stepped up dosing, and I guess what it means in terms of differentiating versus other bispecifics in development and ultimately CAR T, and then your confidence that you\u2019ll retain similarly strong efficacy with this dose? Thanks.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes, we actually had initiated the concept for bispecifics in general as we were very early players in the field of this concept of step-up dosing, and what seems to be confirmed by our own data and other people\u2019s data is that when you give them initially at low doses and gradually step up to your optimal dose, you are reducing the incidence of severe side effects, and particularly cytokine release syndrome.  We had actually pretty low rates with our original, so our original dosing regimen was also a step-up dosing regimen, but in collaboration with the FDA, we redefined the stepped up dosing and came up with an even more gradual program. It only extends the timing to get to maximum dose by one week and we\u2019re still obviously getting to that same dose, and what we\u2019re saying is that from the early read from the new step-up dosing, which presumably we\u2019ll give you the detailed data at some point in the future, the results are looking very promising. The already low rate of significant cytokine release syndrome that we were seeing looks like it\u2019s depressed even further down to rates where we think, as I stated, we will be able to use this regimen and this approach in the outpatient setting.  It\u2019s just very promising that we\u2019ve come up with a safe, what looks like to be a safe protocol that could be used in outpatient settings, and it\u2019s getting to the same maximum dose in a pretty short period of time as well.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks George. Gigi, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould from Barclays Capital. Your line is now open.\nCarter Gould: Great, good morning. One from me - I want to understand, I guess, how you\u2019re thinking about your broader CV effort. We\u2019ve heard from a number of larger pharma and biotech companies rededicating themselves to CV recently, and when you map out the indications and products, I\u2019d argue you have one of the broader pipelines across CV but you don\u2019t really get much credit for it and Praluent and Evkeeza remain relatively small contributors to your sales. Do you see this being a major commercially relevant area for Regeneron going forward? I\u2019d just like to understand your ambitions here a little bit better. Thank you.\nLeonard Schleifer: We have not obviously realized what we think is the full potential of our CV expertise and capabilities, and we are exploring ways on how to do that, some of which may require us to rethink combinations of both types of reagents and targets, and hopefully you\u2019ll hear more that. But we would agree - right now, it\u2019s not a major contributor to our near term performance.\nRyan Crowe: Okay, thank you. Gigi, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney from Baird. Your line is now open.\nLuke Hermann : Hi, this is Luke Hermann on for Brian Skorney. Could you talk a little bit more about 5458, maybe your confidence that the currently enrolling Phase II study will support a filing, any timeline granularity, and the combinations you\u2019re particularly excited about there? Thanks.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes, well in small numbers, we have very competitive response rates with deep responses and duration that we think for these late stage patients should be able to support registration if we can replicate it in the larger Phase II registrational possible study that we are undertaking. We continue to see a very acceptable safety and tolerability profile, and as you said, this is just the first step in the whole program. We are very excited about combinations and we\u2019re also very excited about moving to earlier lines of therapy. In terms of combinations, as we\u2019ve talked about before, it\u2019s very logical and the preclinical data are very compelling. The combinations with so-called costimulatory bispecifics that also bind to a target on the same myeloma cells but now activate what we and others refer to as single two, will be very exciting and has really the potential to enhance responsiveness and deepen responsiveness and deepen duration.  We have a series of additional next-generation candidates as well that we could layer on top of that next series of logical combinations which involve these costimulatory molecules, and we\u2019re also thinking that obviously, as Len already mentioned, going to earlier lines of therapy is only going to increase the responsiveness and the opportunities to get longer and longer responses and, dare I say, even potentially cures, so that\u2019s the basic summary of our programs - get registration in the late setting by replicating the data that we\u2019ve seen with our ongoing registration possible Phase II study, adding combinations to enhance responses, deepen responsiveness and duration, and three, going into earlier lines of therapy as well.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks George. Gigi, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brittany A. Woods from Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.\nBrittany Woods: Good morning everyone, this is Brittany on for Tyler. Congrats on another strong quarter and thanks for taking our question. A multi-part question a bit related on the REGEN-COV cocktail. For the ongoing studies of the next-gen candidates, when do you expect that you\u2019ll be able to file for approval and what will the regulatory path forward look like; and also, if we continue to be in a relatively low case period as we enter the endemic phase, what could a pivotal trial ultimately look like there?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: These are all really great questions, and we are continuing to discuss our regulatory path both for getting our hopefully full approval for our existing cocktail, but also the regulatory path going forward for next-generation cocktails with the FDA. That\u2019s an ongoing discussion that has potential to change, and obviously associated studies to support that program have the potential to change, so we are not at this point talking about the details of either, but great questions.\nLeonard Schleifer: Suffice it to say the complexities are increased when you have to start thinking about supply as well, so as George said, we\u2019re in discussions with the agency about what it would take to get an authorization, but you\u2019re always chasing the next variant and we have probably, what we think is the greatest end-to-end capabilities in this space as is out there. But still, knowing which variant to manufacture for which antibody and how to keep chasing that, it\u2019s a fairly complex situation, but we\u2019re committed to try and make monoclonals an important part of the solution, and I think they can be, but it is going to require some artful science, so to speak.\nRyan Crowe: Thank you. Gigi, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone from Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nDane Leone: Hi, thank you for taking the questions, and congratulations on all the progress across all of your programs. One question from me on the PHOTON and PULSAR outcomes. It\u2019s been interesting to hear your narrative over many years now through EYLEA, and your team\u2019s generally been right in terms of next-generation efforts that have failed to displace EYLEA as the standard of care. To that point, I\u2019m a little interested from your commentary on the CANDELA readout and how that impacts your interpretation of PHOTON and PULSAR, meaning what does your team really think ends up being a differentiated outcome for those patients that are able to treat and extend on the high dose out to Q 16-week, and does that have to be a comparison to what read out with  studies to make it a compelling drug option or a higher dose option in the market to complement EYLEA? The context for this, I guess, I\u2019d put in is you guys have generally contended that a lot of these studies comparing against per label EYLEA are not actually fair studies to be running -  obviously used an extra loading dose, but in the real world the treatment extended EYLEA versus any of these other agents is actually quite equivalent, so I\u2019d be just interested to hear how you think that the contextualization of these high dose aflibercept studies really inform who should get the higher dose, if and when it becomes available. Thank you very much.\nLeonard Schleifer: You know, that\u2019s going to be obviously a choice for clinicians to decide once they\u2019ve seen all the data, but I think an important consideration is still going to be not only the duration, because duration does matter; efficacy - efficacy matters, but safety, and I think the distinct advantage we have with high dose EYLEA is that from a molecular point of view, whether you\u2019re having immunologic reactions and those sorts of things, EYLEA is a very well known entity. If we can transition to a higher dose with the same kind of safety and allow for longer duration, I think that is a more attractive paradigm than switching to a new molecular mechanism of action with unproven safety with 50 million injections behind it. Frankly, I do think even the FDA views the--when you\u2019re changing dosing paradigms of the same molecule is different than when you\u2019re bringing in a new molecule.  We can\u2019t say, and we wouldn\u2019t dare speak for what clinicians will do once they see the data, but we do feel strongly that having the same EYLEA backbone, if we get the safety that we anticipate thus far from the small CANDELA study and we get the kind of extension of duration, perhaps with more drying, we\u2019ll look at the actual numbers, I think that sort of transition is more efficient than transitions that may occur with new reagents.\nRyan Crowe: Thank you Len. Gigi, I think we have time for two more questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Yang from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nCharlie Yang: Thanks for taking the question. This is Charlie Yang on for Matthew. I just want to follow up on the REGEN5458 BCMA bispecific. I guess my question here is given the competitor is ahead in potentially getting approval later this year, and they are already testing in combination with darsivax , for example, I\u2019m just curious about your confidence on the 5458 in terms of its outlook, and maybe you could just provide some thoughts on the competitive landscape and the commercial opportunity across different line settings. Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes, we think being marginally ahead or behind here isn\u2019t really going to mean all that much. It\u2019s how good your actual agent is, and also of course what opportunities you have for combinations. As we said, if we can reproduce the efficacy we\u2019ve seen in our initial studies, in our potentially pivotal Phase II program, that will make it a very, very competitive agent in terms of efficacy, and that\u2019s what obviously really matters.  But also in terms of combinations, we do believe that we have some of the most interesting and potentially game changing combinations with novel agents, such as these costimulatory bispecifics that are a whole different opportunity than combinations with traditional, more traditional agents. We can take the efficacy that hopefully we will see with the monotherapy, both in the late stage settings but just as, if not more importantly, in the earlier stage settings and really extend and take it to another level, so being a little bit ahead or behind here is not going to be as important as producing really good data.  Combinations, we think it\u2019s really whether you can really come up and you have in your portfolio very interesting, logical combinations that can really be game changing, and we think that we have those opportunities, which is why we\u2019re so excited about this program.\nRyan Crowe: Great, thanks George. Gigi, last question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMohit Bansal: Great, thank you for squeezing me in. Maybe a question on EYLEA, high dose EYLEA. George, would love to get your take on the design of the DME trial. It seems like there are five monthly doses in the 2 milligram arm, just like label, but only three for the 8 milligram arm. Could you please walk us through the rationale behind this difference, and wouldn\u2019t this put high dose EYLEA at a disadvantage? Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes, well certainly the whole goal of the high dose EYLEA is to deliver the same efficacy and safety, as Len said, and safety being very important, but with a reduced injection schedule. Obviously it is, as you said, more challenging to be accomplishing the results in PHOTON with less loading injections than for the 2 milligram EYLEA, but that is the goal with the high dose aflibercept. It is challenging, but it is the higher dose, that\u2019s what the goal is, and I guess the data will speak.\nLeonard Schleifer: Yes, and I think we can eliminate if we get too high of a loading dose, obviously, it might complicate some of the efficacy readouts; but as George said, I think based on what we know when we designed it, this looks like it could--we\u2019re optimistic.\nRyan Crowe: All right, thank you. I think we\u2019re done. Thanks Mohit. Gigi, can we conclude the call?\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. ",

            "name": "Marion McCourt",
            "content": "Thank you George. Our commercial performance in the first quarter reflects strong execution and the competitive strength of our diversified and growing portfolio. Starting with EYLEA, first quarter global net sales grew 11% year-over-year to nearly $2.4 billion. Over the same period, U.S. net product sales grew 13% to $1.52 billion as EYLEA continues to strengthen its leadership position. Across approved indications, EYLEA is the preferred anti-VEGF treatment based on its differentiated efficacy and safety profile, as well as extensive real world patient and physician experience. As Len mentioned we are incredibly proud that EYLEA helped improve or save the vision of patients around the world with more than 50 million treatments since launch. Category growth and EYLEA market share continued to increase across all approved indications. In diabetic eye disease, we have seen notable increases across the patient continuum from initial patient diagnosis through to receiving ongoing EYLEA treatment. We believe diabetic eye disease will remain an important source of future growth for EYLEA as, unfortunately, most patients remain under-diagnosed and under-treated. Beyond EYLEA, our investigational aflibercept 8 milligram clinical program continues to generate excitement and a high level of interest within the retinal community. If supported by Phase III results, aflibercept 8 milligram has the potential to be a major enhancement to the anti-VEGF treatment paradigm. In summary, we are confident in Regeneron's ability to maintain leadership over the long term based on our current EYLEA performance and future potential of aflibercept 8 milligram.  Turning now to Libtayo, with first quarter global net sales of $125 million, in the U.S. net sales were $79 million based on steadily improving demand across FDA-approved non-melanoma skin cancer indications. The number of prescribers has increased in our non-small cell lung cancer monotherapy indication based on growing brand awareness, positive prescriber feedback, and an increasing number of institutions and networks that have included Libtayo in protocols and pathways. We are working to build on this momentum ahead of the potential chemotherapy combination approval expected later this year that would dramatically expand the patient opportunity for Libtayo in lung cancer. Finally onto Dupixent, which again achieved remarkable growth for the quarter, demonstrated by a 43% increase in global net sales to over $1.8 billion. Our performance was fueled by robust uptake across all approved indications as well as an expanding geographic footprint and potential future indications, including use in younger patients. Dupixent is a transformational medicine for patients and prescribers with significant growth potential ahead. In the U.S., net product sales grew 38% to $1.3 billion. In atopic dermatitis, Dupixent is the first line systemic treatment in patients with moderate to severe disease. Healthcare specialists recognize Dupixent's differentiated profile, which includes dual anti-IL4 and IL13 mechanism of action compelling efficacy, rapid symptom relief, and well established safety profile. More than 430,000 patients worldwide are currently on treatment across all indications and launch preparations are underway for the June potential label expansion for children as young as six months of age with atopic dermatitis. We estimate approximately 75,000 biologic eligible children in the U.S. could benefit from Dupixent in this younger age group. We also look forward to potentially extending Dupixent's label to include additional dermatology conditions, including prurigo nodularis where patients have no currently FDA-approved medicines. Approximately 75,000 U.S. patients with PN are in need of new treatment options and may benefit from Dupixent. In the highly competitive biologic asthma indication, Dupixent continues to grow based on its compelling differentiation for healthcare professionals based on its unique dual mechanism action, ease of administration, demonstrated safety, broad label, and use in both steroid-dependent patients and pediatric patients. There are positive prescribing trends from the recently pediatric asthma launch. In nasal polyps, Dupixent remains the preferred choice for both ENTs and allergists with rapid growth even three years after initial launch. Many patients with Type 2 or allergic disease suffer from another concomitant Type 2 disease. For example, in our atopic dermatitis clinical program, 40% of patients also had asthma. Dupixent is differentiated not only by its efficacy and safety profile in individual FDA-approved Type 2 indications but also its potential to simultaneously address multiple Type 2 diseases in the same patient. We look forward to expanding Dupixent into even more Type 2 diseases. Launch preparations are underway for eosinophilic esophagitis, where there are no FDA-approved medicines and significant unmet need. Importantly in our EOE clinical program, approximately 45% of patients also had atopic dermatitis or asthma. If approved in EOE, we estimate at least 50,000 patients in the U.S. could benefit from Dupixent in this indication. Key opinion leaders continue to provide positive feedback on our clinical data, especially given the lack of effective approved treatment alternatives for their patients who suffer from multiple EOE symptoms. Turning briefly now to Dupixent in markets outside the U.S., in the first quarter net product sales grew 61% to $485 million. Over the past year, Regeneron has expanded our commercial presence in several key markets outside the United States, and we are encouraged with progress so far integrating our sales efforts with Sanofi. In summary, we see significant potential for Dupixent to continue to change the lives of patients and their families, and we will continue to advance initiatives that bring Dupixent to those in need.  In conclusion, we are pleased with performance across our portfolio. We continue to advance our inline brands and are on track to deliver on future launches, positioning Regeneron for sustained and long term growth. Now I'll turn the call over to Bob. Chris, happy to give you some characterization of the market. First let me comment on EYLEA. As we reported today, our performance certainly with EYLEA in a very competitive marketplace is quite strong across indications, and certainly we see very strong performance not only in capturing more than our fair share of the market growth but also competitive share gains across indications. As a reminder, in the overall market we have about 50% of the VEGF category market share with EYLEA and in the branded marketplace over 75% of the branded market share.  I really do think it's probably best to let Roche comment on uptake of their new product in the marketplace. I'll share that prescribers and key opinion leaders comment to us on the importance of the demonstrated safety they see with EYLEA, the efficacious profile that we have, and certainly the extensive consideration across indications and in-market use that has been incredibly robust.  As it relates to other items around pricing and things of that sort, generally we don't comment; but I certainly will say that looking ahead, we see strong leadership with EYLEA and a profile that is certainly leading the category in terms of experience, uptake and use. I think at this point, we'll want to wait and look at product profile as the clinical data matures and then certainly as we move into launch preparation planning, we'll be considerable of how the profile matches up against patient need and opportunity, so I think more to come on specifics on uptake. We remain optimistic, but of course we need to wait and see how the clinical data matures and the profile of product is clarified."

            "name": "Leonard Schleifer",
            "content": "Thank you Ryan. Welcome to your first earnings call. I hope all of us stakeholders will join me in giving you a warm welcome to the Regeneron team. Thanks for everyone joining the call as well. Following an exceptional 2021, Regeneron is off to a strong start in 2022. Our first quarter results were driven by execution across the entire company as we continued to realize the benefits of our sustained investment in differentiated research and development along with our focus on commercial performance. We also continued to drive shareholder value through proven capital allocation, including approximately $350 million of share repurchases in the first three months of this year. Regarding our financial performance, we delivered strong double-digit revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share growth. Excluding revenue contributions from our investigation of COVID antibody cocktails, revenues grew 25%, reflecting our increasingly diversified core business which continues to thrive. For EYLEA, global net sales grew 11% to nearly $2.4 billion in the first quarter, including $1.5 billion of revenues in the United States, up 13% versus last year which outpaced the U.S. anti-VEGF category. In yet another milestone for EYLEA after more than 10 years, we recently surpassed 50 million EYLEA injections globally, a testament to its well-established efficacy and safety profile. We believe EYLEA continues to represent a significant long term growth opportunity primarily driven by an aging population, increasing utilization among the rapidly growing diabetic population, as well as the potential for our investigational aflibercept 8 milligrams to complement and enhance our retinal franchise.  For Dupixent in quarter one, global revenues for the quarter exceeded $1.8 billion, an increase of 43% to last year as we continued to redefine the treatment of Type 2 inflammatory diseases. A significant opportunity remains to reach even more patients in already approved indications and we look forward to potentially launching Dupixent in seven new indications in the U.S. later this year and in early 2023, including pediatric atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, and prurigo nodularis. Collectively, approximately 200,000 U.S. patients are suffering from these three indications today but currently have no FDA-approved systemic treatment options. In oncology, Libtayo continues to capture significant share in FDA-approved non-melanoma skin cancer indications, where it is considered the standard of care. Beyond dermato-oncology, we're beginning to generate momentum in monotherapy non-small cell lung cancer in the United States, helping to build a foundation for potential launch of Libtayo post-chemotherapy later this year, which would allow Libtayo to address a much larger population of non-small cell lung cancer patients.  As we have said before, we continue to consider Libtayo to be foundation to our immune-oncology development strategy and expect it to serve as the backbone for our investigation of clinical programs in combination with various antibodies, bispecifics and co-stimulatory bispecifics in our pipeline, as well as other pipeline candidates including those from our collaborations.  In April, we announced our agreement to acquire Checkmate Pharmaceuticals, Regeneron's first-ever acquisition of a company. Upon closing we expect Checkmate's differentiated toll receptor 9 agonist, vidutolimod will add a promising new modality to Regeneron's pipeline of potential approaches for difficult to treat cancers.  Looking ahead, we remain on track for the second half of this year to share data in difficult to treat solid tumors, such as ovarian and prostate cancers, to submit a BLA for Odronextamab, our potentially best-in-class CD20xCD3 bispecific for refractory B-cell lymphomas, and to advance Regeneron 5458, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific.  Finally regarding our ongoing COVID-19 response, Regeneron remains committed to combating the virus as we head toward the likely endemic stage. We firmly believe that monoclonal antibodies will continue to play an important role, particularly to protect immunocompromised individuals who do not respond adequately to COVID-19 vaccines as well as to treat infected patients for whom an oral antiviral therapy is not well tolerated or might trigger serious drug-drug interactions. We are progressing next-generation antibodies that are designed to be active against multiple variants, including those of omicron lineage, and initiated a first in human study last month concurrently as the FDA continues their review of our REGEN-COV BLA for COVID-19 treatment and prophylaxis. We're working closely and collaboratively with them and other global regulatory authorities to establish clinical and regulatory pathways to bring additional safe and effective monoclonal treatment options to patients as quickly as possible. In closing, we are excited about the strong commercial momentum for our inline portfolio and the progress we have made advancing our pipeline so far this year. For the remainder of 2022, we anticipate up to eight additional U.S. and EU regulatory approvals, up to four additional U.S. or EU regulatory filings, pivotal data for aflibercept 8 milligrams, as well as various other data read-outs from other pipeline programs, which George will discuss.  We remain confident in the long term outlook for our business and our pipeline continues to be highly productive, and we are in a strong financial position, all of which positions Regeneron to deliver sustainable growth and long term value creation.  Now I will turn the call over to George. I'm sure--it's Len here. I'm sure George would love to expand upon the thinking, but unfortunately because we just launched a tender offer, we're really not committed to have that discussion. We'll look forward to that discussion assuming that the deal closes around the middle of the year, as we anticipate. Sorry. But because we couldn't answer that question, if you get back in the queue, we'll come back to you for another question. Just to amplify a little bit, to make sure nobody missed what George just said, is that it seems to be the case that with these types of reagents, much as it is the case with other anti-cancer agents, that while you start in the latest, most difficult patients, there is better activity in earlier lines with these kinds of immune reagents, so finding activity in the late heavily treated would be very encouraging.

Yes, and I think we can eliminate if we get too high of a loading dose, obviously, it might complicate some of the efficacy readouts; but as George said, I think based on what we know when we designed it, this looks like it could--we're optimistic."

            "content": "Thank you Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron is off to a strong start in 2022 with double-digit top and bottom line growth in the first quarter, driven by execution across the business. First quarter total revenues grew 17% year-over-year to $2.97 billion. Excluding global revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, total revenues grew 25%, demonstrating continued strength of our core business. First quarter total diluted net income per share grew 16% to $11.49 on net income of $1.3 billion.  Beginning with collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer, first quarter 2022 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $869 million, growing 7% on a reported basis and 13% on a constant currency basis versus first quarter 2021. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $385 million, of which we recorded $338 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S.  Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $631 million in the first quarter of 2022 and grew 73% from the prior year, driven by Dupixent. In this quarter, we recognized the $50 million sales milestone upon achieving $2 billion of aggregate ex-U.S. sales for antibody collaboration products on a rolling 12-month basis.  Finally, we recorded Roche collaboration revenue of $216 million related to Roche's sales of Ronapreve outside the U.S. We do expect additional revenue from this collaboration primarily in the second half of 2022. Regarding REGEN-COV in the U.S., consistent with our commentary from earlier this year, we did not record any U.S. sales for REGEN-COV in the first quarter of 2022. Absent the execution and fulfillment of an additional government contract, we do not expect to record any U.S. sales for REGEN-COV this year. Other revenue in the first quarter of 2022 was $94 million. This includes a $30 million upfront payment from our collaborator, Ultragenyx to market Evkeeza outside of the U.S.  Moving now to our operating expenses, R&D increased 12% to $751 million driven by higher headcount and clinical manufacturing costs, including for next-gen COVID antibodies, partially offset by lower clinical trial costs for REGEN-COV. Starting in the first quarter of 2022, we are changing the presentation of our non-GAAP results to include in-process R&D acquired in connection with asset acquisitions, as well as upfront and opt-in payments related to license and collaboration agreements. Going forward, we will now include these charges in both GAAP and non-GAAP results as a new line item called Acquired In Process Research and Development. In the first quarter of 2022, acquired IPR&D was $28 million, which includes a $20 million opt-in payment to our collaborator, Adicet. In full year 2021, there were $44 million of aggregate upfront payments excluded from non-GAAP R&D expense, all of which were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021.  SG&A expense increased 10% year-over-year to $389 million, primarily due to costs related to growth initiatives for EYLEA and higher headcount to support our expanding organization. COCM increased 58% year-over-year to $198 million due to higher sales in Dupixent and an increase in shipments of commercial supplies of Praluent for Sanofi outside the United States. Finally, the first quarter 2022 effective tax rate was 11.6% compared to 10.5% in the prior year. Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet, in the first quarter of 2022, Regeneron generated $2 billion in free cash flow, inclusive of collections from the U.S. Government for sales of REGEN-COV recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021 and ended the first quarter of 2022 with cash and marketable securities less debt of $11.4 billion.  We continue to deliver on our capital allocation priorities. Last month, we announced the agreement to acquire Checkmate Pharmaceuticals for total equity value of approximately $250 million. Earlier this week, we launched the tender offer for Checkmate shares and expect this deal to close in mid-2022 subject to receipt of regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. In addition, we repurchased $352 million of our shares in the first quarter of 2022. We continue to be opportunistic buyers where we see dislocation between our stock price and our intrinsic valuation.  I will conclude with select updates to our full year 2022 guidance and outlook. We are updating full year R&D guidance to be in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion. The increase in guidance is driven by clinical manufacturing costs for next-gen COVID antibodies, most of which were recorded in the first quarter, and advancing programs across our pipeline. We also now expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 12% to 14%. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. In conclusion, our core business is performing well and we continue to make investments in our R&D engine supported by our strong financial position, leaving Regeneron well positioned for sustainable long term growth. With that, I will pass the call back to Ryan."

            "name": "George Yancopoulos",
            "content": "Thank you Len. I will start with ophthalmology today.  At the recent Angiogenesis meeting, we presented encouraging results for the Phase II CANDELA study of aflibercept 8 milligrams in patients with wet AMD  primary safety end points with no new safety signals observed through week 44 and efficacy end points numerically favored aflibercept 8 milligrams in visual acuity, drying, and other anatomical measures through week 44. Phase III studies, PHOTON in DME and PULSAR in wet AMD are ongoing. The primary objective of the Phase III studies is to determine whether aflibercept 8 milligram dosing can allow for more extended dosing intervals while maintaining efficacy and safety.  Regarding Phase III design in both PHOTON and the PULSAR study, patients are randomized at baseline to three groups: an every 8 week EYLEA 2 milligram arm, an every 12 week 8 milligram aflibercept arm, and an every 16 week aflibercept 8 milligram arm following loading doses. The primary end point of both these studies is mean change in best corrected visual acuity, or BCVA at week 48. The primary end point will be met if 8 milligram aflibercept is not inferior to 2 milligram EYLEA while being dosed less frequently. We anticipate results of both PHOTON and PULSAR in the second half of this year and if positive, to file for regulatory approvals in the U.S. and EU by early 2023. Moving to Dupixent, which had a remarkable quarter in terms of clinical updates and regulatory progress, in January we announced our second positive Phase III study in prurigo nodularis, a disease with high unmet need. At the AAAAI and AAD meetings this year, we presented detailed data from the first positive Phase III study in prurigo nodularis and we also presented detailed data from our positive Phase III studies in eosinophilic esophagitis and in chronic spontaneous urticaria, or CSU, in biologic nai\u0308ve patients. The second Phase III CSU study in patients refractory to omalizumab did not reach statistical significance in an interim analysis, and as announced in March, we have completed enrollment in the first of the two Phase III Dupixent studies in COPD and anticipate data from this first study to read out in the first half of next year. In terms of regulatory progress, we expect an FDA decision for Dupixent in children aged six months to five years with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis by the new June 9 PDUFA date. We are also excited about an upcoming trial in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or the NIAID, to assess efficacy and safety of Dupixent for asthma in underserved populations, including Black and Hispanic children in the United States. Additionally, we are expecting an FDA decision for our supplementary BLA in eosinophilic esophagitis in patients 12 years and older by August 3, and we completed our regulatory submission for prurigo nodularis indication with FDA acceptance of this application anticipated shortly. Moving to Libtayo and oncology, we are excited about the upcoming milestones in our oncology pipeline, including the FDA decision on our Libtayo chemo combination application for non-small cell lung cancer, data readouts and potential regulatory filings for our hematology bispecifics, as well as initial data readouts from our bispecific antibodies for solid tumors. In hematology, Odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific has the potential for best-in-class efficacy in both follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and was recently granted fast track designation from the FDA for these indications. Detailed results of our first in human study were recently published in Lancet Hematology and our registration in 10 programs in late stage follicular lymphoma and DLBCL are expected to complete enrollment soon. Based on the safety profile we are observing from our updated step-up dosing regimen, we believe Odronextamab has the potential to be administered entirely within the outpatient setting. We look forward to filing with this updated data set later this year, pending regulatory feedback from the FDA. Development of REGN5458, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific investigated for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, remains on track and pending regulatory feedback, we are planning to submit regulatory approval in the first half of 2023. Studies in earlier lines of the disease as well as an umbrella study in multiple myeloma investigating 5458 in combination with various standard of care products and investigational candidates will begin enrollment shortly.  The second half of the year, we anticipate initial clinical data disclosures for three first-in-class bispecifics: our MUC16xCD3 monotherapy for late stage ovarian cancer, our METxMET bispecific antibody for met-altered non-small cell lung cancer, as well as our PSMAxCD28 costim bispecific in combination with Libtayo in late stage prostate cancer. For these late stage cancers, patients have limited options, and showing any durable response would be a promising early sign to be confirmed with additional clinical studies also involving combinations.  We continue to progress our strategic approach to oncology which starts with Libtayo as our foundational anti-PD1 therapy and is augmented by logical combinations utilizing our broad oncology pipeline, whether it involves combining Libtayo with a second checkpoint inhibitor, as we are doing with our LAG-3 antibody in melanoma and other settings, with different combinations of bispecifics or with other agents in our portfolio. Briefly turning to our antibodies against COVID-19, as we recently announced, the FDA extended its review of our REGEN-COV BLA for COVID-19 treatment and prophylaxis with a new action date of July 13. This extension was due to ongoing discussions with additional data provided to the FDA on pre-exposure prophylaxis use of REGEN-COV. As this regulatory process continues, we are advancing next-generation COVID-19 antibodies and initiated a first in human trial with a new candidate in April. We continue to believe that a major unmet need for COVID antibodies is in chronic disease prevention for immunocompromised patients and future development efforts will be addressing this population. Concluding with our Regeneron genetics medicine, where we in collaboration are continuing to advance our pipeline. For our siRNA collaboration with Alnylam, we are very excited about our first-in-class approach to combining siRNA with antibody therapeutics designed to maximize effect as well as duration of target blockade. The first of these is our C5 siRNA antibody combination, cemdisiran plus pozelimab. Phase III studies of the combination treatment for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH, and myasthenia gravis are underway and we'll be dosing patients shortly. In PNH, we are planning to test our combo in both nai\u0308ve and switch patients tested against standard of care therapies, including ravulizumab and eculizumab. Beyond C5, several additional combination programs are in our pre-clinical pipeline. We continue to work with Alnylam as leaders in the use of siRNA therapeutics to address non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, with several programs addressing novel targets discovered by the Regeneron Genetic Center. First data in NASH patients for ALN-HSD are anticipated mid-2022. We are progressing a second target, PNPLA3 into the clinic later this year and have recently identified an additional novel promising target that has been validated by RGC and is awaiting peer review publication.  We are also pleased to report a novel milestone, that we and Alnylam initiated our first CNS target siRNA clinical program targeting amyloid precursor protein, or APP, in development for both cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer's disease. Showing that this siRNA approach can reduce levels of the target protein in the CNS has the potential to open the door for using this approach in multiple genetically defined neurodegenerative diseases.  In the first quarter, we and Intellia provided an update on our joint CRISPR-based knockout program for transthyretin amyloidosis. Just to remind you, this is the first example of achieving CRISPR-based genomic editing in human beings. Our recent update demonstrated greater than 90% reduction of transthyretin durably achieved for the follow-up observation period in patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, as well as acceptable safety observed so far. Our genetics medicine portfolio now includes a diverse pipeline of siRNA candidates that we are working on with Alnylam targeting diseases of the liver, the brain and the eye, as well as our CRISPR-based approaches in collaboration with Intellia and our bio-targeted gene delivery programs, such as with Decibel addressing congenital forms of hearing loss and other internal programs. While still early, we think these groundbreaking approaches have the potential to change the practice of medicine. With that, I will turn the call over to Marion. Well, as I indicated in my remarks, basically we're going into late stage patients heavily pretreated. We're hoping to actually be able to report on seeing objective responses, and the number and the duration of the responses is what we're looking for. We would love to be able to see significant numbers of durable responses showing that each one of these novel agents is really making a difference in the latest stage patients. That of course would open up for each one of them, we think, very important opportunities in terms of both those late stage settings but also particularly with logical combinations going back to earlier and earlier stage patients. Each one of them could become then a significant program, not only in monotherapy but in combination with logical other agents.  So as I said, responses with duration is what we're looking for in all three of those programs. Yes, we actually had initiated the concept for bispecifics in general as we were very early players in the field of this concept of step-up dosing, and what seems to be confirmed by our own data and other people's data is that when you give them initially at low doses and gradually step up to your optimal dose, you are reducing the incidence of severe side effects, and particularly cytokine release syndrome.  We had actually pretty low rates with our original, so our original dosing regimen was also a step-up dosing regimen, but in collaboration with the FDA, we redefined the stepped up dosing and came up with an even more gradual program. It only extends the timing to get to maximum dose by one week and we're still obviously getting to that same dose, and what we're saying is that from the early read from the new step-up dosing, which presumably we'll give you the detailed data at some point in the future, the results are looking very promising. The already low rate of significant cytokine release syndrome that we were seeing looks like it's depressed even further down to rates where we think, as I stated, we will be able to use this regimen and this approach in the outpatient setting.  It's just very promising that we've come up with a safe, what looks like to be a safe protocol that could be used in outpatient settings, and it's getting to the same maximum dose in a pretty short period of time as well. Yes, well in small numbers, we have very competitive response rates with deep responses and duration that we think for these late stage patients should be able to support registration if we can replicate it in the larger Phase II registrational possible study that we are undertaking. We continue to see a very acceptable safety and tolerability profile, and as you said, this is just the first step in the whole program. We are very excited about combinations and we're also very excited about moving to earlier lines of therapy. In terms of combinations, as we've talked about before, it's very logical and the preclinical data are very compelling. The combinations with so-called costimulatory bispecifics that also bind to a target on the same myeloma cells but now activate what we and others refer to as single two, will be very exciting and has really the potential to enhance responsiveness and deepen responsiveness and deepen duration.  We have a series of additional next-generation candidates as well that we could layer on top of that next series of logical combinations which involve these costimulatory molecules, and we're also thinking that obviously, as Len already mentioned, going to earlier lines of therapy is only going to increase the responsiveness and the opportunities to get longer and longer responses and, dare I say, even potentially cures, so that's the basic summary of our programs - get registration in the late setting by replicating the data that we've seen with our ongoing registration possible Phase II study, adding combinations to enhance responses, deepen responsiveness and duration, and three, going into earlier lines of therapy as well. These are all really great questions, and we are continuing to discuss our regulatory path both for getting our hopefully full approval for our existing cocktail, but also the regulatory path going forward for next-generation cocktails with the FDA. That's an ongoing discussion that has potential to change, and obviously associated studies to support that program have the potential to change, so we are not at this point talking about the details of either, but great questions. Yes, we think being marginally ahead or behind here isn't really going to mean all that much. It's how good your actual agent is, and also of course what opportunities you have for combinations. As we said, if we can reproduce the efficacy we've seen in our initial studies, in our potentially pivotal Phase II program, that will make it a very, very competitive agent in terms of efficacy, and that's what obviously really matters.  But also in terms of combinations, we do believe that we have some of the most interesting and potentially game changing combinations with novel agents, such as these costimulatory bispecifics that are a whole different opportunity than combinations with traditional, more traditional agents. We can take the efficacy that hopefully we will see with the monotherapy, both in the late stage settings but just as, if not more importantly, in the earlier stage settings and really extend and take it to another level, so being a little bit ahead or behind here is not going to be as important as producing really good data.  Combinations, we think it's really whether you can really come up and you have in your portfolio very interesting, logical combinations that can really be game changing, and we think that we have those opportunities, which is why we're so excited about this program. Yes, well certainly the whole goal of the high dose EYLEA is to deliver the same efficacy and safety, as Len said, and safety being very important, but with a reduced injection schedule. Obviously it is, as you said, more challenging to be accomplishing the results in PHOTON with less loading injections than for the 2 milligram EYLEA, but that is the goal with the high dose aflibercept. It is challenging, but it is the higher dose, that's what the goal is, and I guess the data will speak."

Len?\nLeonard Schleifer: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone joining today's call. Fourth quarter 2023 capped another strong year for Regeneron and Bob will walk you through our financial results. For my remarks today, I'd like to briefly look back at 2023 and then discuss what's to come in the year ahead. 2023 was another remarkable year for Regeneron highlighted by several significant achievements that better position the company to deliver sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value. At the start of the year, we identified five key strategic imperatives: First, obtaining FDA approval and successfully launching EYLEA HD. We did encounter a minor delay when we received a complete response letter in late June due to an issue at a third-party filler, but this was quickly remedied and EYLEA HD was granted approval in mid-August. With what we believe to be a best-in-class potential clinical profile, EYLEA HD is poised to become the new standard-of-care for patients with wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic eye diseases. The launch is off to a great start, which Marion will discuss in a few minutes. Second, we had to defend our intellectual property related to EYLEA. We presented our best case and prevailed in the District Court, which found that one of EYLEA's formulation patents was both valid and infringed by a biosimilar aflibercept manufacturer. This favorable decision may have broad implications and could result in a delay to biosimilar aflibercept launches. Third, we and our collaborator, Sanofi, needed to continue driving Dupixent growth not only by further penetrating previously approved indications, but also reaching even more patients suffering from other diseases driven by type 2 inflammation. In 2023, we did both. Dupixent global net product sales grew by 34% on a constant currency basis to $11.6 billion. Dupixent lead in new to brand prescription share in the United States across all five of its approved indications. We also had a major breakthrough in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD. In March, we reported strong data from the BOREAS study, which enrolled COPD patients with uncontrolled moderate to severe disease and evidence of type 2 inflammation. The FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation during the summer, but required additional evidence of efficacy to support a regulatory filing. Based on this feedback, we and Sanofi decided to conduct an interim analysis on the replicate noticed study, which read out similarly compelling results enabling our December sBLA submission and a potential U.S. launch for this indication as early as mid-2024. Fourth, we continued making progress toward our long-term goal of becoming a global leader in oncology. 2023 was highlighted by our regulatory submissions for linvoseltamab, our BCMA by CD3 bispecific in myeloma and odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific in lymphoma, while continuing to advance other opportunities in solid tumors. And finally, we needed to advance our early-stage pipeline and over the course of 2023, we presented intriguing proof of mechanism or proof of concept data across hematology and genetic medicines as well, as well as other areas including obesity with data from non-human primates. Many of these early programs which George will run through in a few minutes represent first or best-in-class opportunities that we believe can drive long-term growth for Regeneron. Our accomplishments in 2023 have put us in a position of strength entering 2024. For this year, one of our strategic imperatives is to continue driving commercial execution, especially the ongoing launch of EYLEA HD with the goal of accelerating the pace of conversion from other anti-VEGF agents. Another important launch milestone was achieved last month when the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services assigned a permanent J-code for EYLEA HD that will go into effect on April 1, 2024, at which point a potential reimbursement concern for physicians will be removed. We also need to continue to drive Dupixent growth and its currently improved indications as well as from the potential FDA approval and launch in COPD with an eosinophilic phenotype. If approved, Dupixent would represent the first meaningful advance in over a decade for the 300,000 patients in the United States suffering from this form of COPD and would be the first-ever biologic approved for COPD. In oncology this year, aside from continuing to build on the success of Libtayo in non-melanoma skin cancers and then in small cell lung cancer, we're excited about the potential launches of odronextamab and linvoseltamab, the latter of which has the potential to be the best-in-class bispecific for myeloma. We also expect to make significant advances across our pipeline in 2024 with key readouts for fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody in combination with Libtayo in metastatic melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Libtayo in adjuvant cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and our Factor XI antibodies in thrombosis, which may inform pivotal studies. We also plan to initiate clinical trials in obesity, geographic atrophy, hemophilia B and severe food allergies in addition to expanding early studies of our CD28 costimulatory bispecific programs in solid and hematologic malignancies. In closing, we had a strong 2023 and are poised to deliver in 2024 and beyond. Our pipeline of over 30 clinical programs is delivering important and differentiated innovations. Our commercial team is executing well and we continue to look at ways to efficiently deploy capital to drive shareholder returns over time. Before I hand it over to George, I want to take a moment to thank Bob Landry for his many contributions to Regeneron over his 10-years as our Chief Financial Officer. In addition to helping fortify Regeneron's financial strength and discipline, Bob has been an incredible mentor to many of Regeneron's current and future leaders, helped drive our financial results over the past decade and worked tirelessly to ensure we have the resources needed to help improve the lives of patients around the world. Bob, on behalf of the entire Regeneron family, thank you and we wish you continued good health and happiness. As we first announced back in September upon Bob's retirement next week, Chris Fenimore will become the CFO of Regeneron. We all look forward to working closely with Chris in his new role knowing he brings a similar rigor and depth of financial knowledge that will ensure continuity and collaboration across the organization. With that, I'll now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Thanks, Len. That was really impressive overview I have to say. 2023 was another year of first delivered by Regeneron as well as together with our collaborators, all of which have the potential to change the practice of medicine. Starting with inflammation and immunology. As you heard from Len, we are planning yet another launch for Dupixent, this time in eosinophilic COPD, which would represent the sixth disease if this remarkable medicine is approved to treat and the fifth for which it would be first-in-class. Dupixent\u2019s transformative potential in COPD is based on the unprecedented results from our first Phase 3 trial BOREAS, which would then confirm our second Phase 3 trial notice demonstrating that Dupixent treated patients had a 34% reduction in the annualized rate of moderate to severe COPD exacerbations [Technical Issues] IL-33 blocking antibody. The pivotal AERIFY-1 and 2 studies passed an interim futility analysis last year. The studies are now on track to complete enrollment in 2024 with an anticipated readout in 2025. If the Phase 3 results from these studies even approach the Phase 2 data reported in former smokers where a 42% reduction in annualized exacerbation rate was observed, itepekimab has the potential to further transform the treatment paradigm for COPD. Later this year, we are planning on testing an innovative new treatment approach for severe food allergies using a combination of transient BCMAxCD3 bispecific intervention in patients receiving Dupixent therapy. As many of you know, allergic responses are driven by pathologically high levels of Immunoglobulin E or IgE. This is why many say the E in IgE stands for evil. About 40-years ago, it was discovered that interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 were the switch factors required for switching to IgE production. Based on exciting preclinical data including in non-human primates as well as human data, our innovative approach has the potential to reverse severe allergies by first eliminating the long lived plasma cells that serve as an IgE reservoir with the BCMAxCD3 followed by blocking of de novo immunoglobulin class switching to IgE with Dupixent. We are looking forward to starting a small proof-of-concept study, which will inform next steps for this program. We believe this approach has the potential to benefit the millions of people suffering from severe allergies, who are at constant risk. As tragically highlighted just last week by the widely reported death of yet another young person unknowingly exposed to food a allergen. Moving to Oncology. Libtayo is the leading PD-1 antibody for non-melanoma skin cancers, including metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or CSCC and basal cell carcinoma. We are looking forward to potentially expanding the currently approved CSCC indication to include adjuvant CSCC and we expect results from potentially pivotal interim analysis in this setting in the second-half of the year. Regarding Libtayo combinations, our most advanced is the combination with a LAG-3 antibody fianlimab. As a reminder, our early clinical data in three separate first line metastatic melanoma cohorts demonstrated potential for best-in-class efficacy when compared cross trial with the approved anti-LAG-3 PD-1 combination product, highlighted by objective response rates greater than 60% and estimated median progression-free survival of longer than 15 months. These early clinical data suggested that the Libtayo fianlimab combination maybe one of the most exciting examples of a checkpoint inhibitor combination with clinically meaningful benefit and with the safety profile that is similar to that seen with anti PD-1 monotherapy. We are expecting a potentially pivotal initial readout from our first line metastatic melanoma trial by the end of this year. We also anticipate Phase 2 data in non-small cell lung cancer in late 2024. Onto by specifics, starting with solid tumors. In the dose escalation trial of our EGFR by CD28 costimulatory bispecific combined with Libtayo, we have observed promising activity in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer with higher doses of the costim. In terms of safety, so far, we have not seen an increase in immune related adverse events with this costim. Based on these encouraging early data, which will be presented at a scientific forum later this year, we will be initiating expansion cohorts across several solid tumors in the first-half of the year. In 2024, we are also planning to provide updates for our MUC16xCD3 and MUC16xCD28 programs in advanced ovarian cancer. Next, a bispecific for hematology oncology. For linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific for multiple myeloma, FDA acceptance of our BLA submission is expected later this month and the EMA recently accepted our MAA submission. These submissions were supported by potentially best-in-class profile in late line myeloma in terms of efficacy, safety, dosing, as well as convenience. The confirmatory Phase 3 study, as well as studies in earlier stages of myeloma and pre-malignant disease are enrolling or will soon begin enrolling patients. For odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the FDA decision for our BLA is expected by its March 31 PDUFA date and the new decision is expected in the second half of the year. In terms of additional recent news for our oncology and immunology pipeline, this week, we announced the formation of Regeneron Cell Medicines unit and that we are acquiring full development and commercialization rights for 2Seventy Bio's pipeline of investigational immune cell therapies. We have worked with 2Seventy since 2018 on many of these programs and are excited about the opportunity to continue advancing our collective efforts. After deal closing, certain 2Seventy employees will join Regeneron Cell Medicines and continue to work on addressing cancer and other serious diseases in novel ways including by combining Regeneron's antibody capabilities with CAR-T therapies. Moving from immunology and oncology to obesity and metabolic diseases. Despite all the enthusiasm surrounding GLP-1 agonist for obesity, it has been increasingly recognized that the profound weight loss is accompanied by substantial muscle loss accounting for up to as much as 40% of the weight loss. This potentially irretrievable muscle loss can be catastrophic for patients and may even lead to major public health concerns in the future. We have previously shown that our antibodies targeting myostatin in Activin A have the potential to preserve and grow muscle in human trials. Based on these data as well as additional data in obese non-human primates, we believe that inhibiting these pathways on top of GLP-1 receptor agonism has the potential to achieve comparable overall reductions in body weight, but with improved quality of weight loss resulting in more fat loss, while preserving or actually increasing muscle mass. In mid-2024, we plan to start our first clinical trial to evaluate the combination of our muscle preservation antibodies in combination with semaglutide. Also in 2024, we are anticipating proof-of-concept data for our Factor XI antibodies in the setting of prevention of venous thromboembolism after knee replacement surgery. Based on preclinical and healthy volunteer data, our antibody approach demonstrated more complete Factor XI blockade, compared to competing approaches in development for coagulation disorders and the program is on rapid path to a registrational trial starting late this year or early next year. We will now conclude with our efforts in genetic medicines. Our siRNA collaboration with Alnylam has demonstrated successful silencing of genes in the liver and for the first time for siRNA in the brain. Proof of principle was achieved for and ALN-APP last year and we are anticipating additional data from that program this year, including from patients who have received multiple doses. Based on this success, we are looking forward to new siRNA programs targeting CNS diseases entering the clinic this year such as ALN-SOD for ALS patients with SOD1 mutations. Our collaboration with Intellia on CRISPR gene editing continues to advance, where we together produced the first example of CRISPR-based gene editing of a pathological gene in human beings. This initial program for our lead indication of TTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy is now in the first in-vivo CRISPR program clear to enter Phase 3 studies in the United States. Together with Intellia, we also hope to be the first to use CRISPR technology to insert a corrective gene for deficiency disease. We recently achieved IND clearance for our CRISPR-based gene insertion programs for Factor IX and initiated the leading portion of the clinical trial to evaluate it as a potential cure for hemophilia B. Moving to genetic hearing loss, we were the first U.S.-based company to announce hearing restoration in a young child suffering from genetic hearing loss after treatment with our novel gene therapy approach. We're excited by these early results for this ultra-rare disease and look forward to advancing to the clinic additional programs to potentially address more common forms of monogenic hearing loss. These data represent validation of our viral-based gene therapy program, in this case, locally delivered to the cells of the inner ear. Beyond these efforts, we have made significant investments in leveraging our monoclonal and bispecific antibody expertise to use these agents to systematically deliver virally based genetic based payloads directly to specific tissues in the body non-amenable to local delivery, such as to muscle and the central nervous system. Based on encouraging preclinical data, we will be progressing these approaches to the clinic in the coming years. Finally, concluding with another notable first-in-class program involving a combination of an siRNA with an antibody, in this case to block the C5 complement target. Normally, one needs very high levels of infused antibody to achieve sufficient efficacy because of high target levels regarding C5, but our siRNA co-treatment dramatically lowers C5 target burden allowing lower and more convenient antibody dosing. We recently shared encouraging initial data from a Phase 3 study in patients with PNH, which supported our hypothesis that this combination approach could provide better efficacy and control of breakthrough hemolysis with more convenient dosing, and building on these data we continue to enroll our Phase 3 studies in PNH and myasthenia gravis. We are also planning to extend this combination approach to geographic atrophy and dry AMD. While this combination is expected to have manageable systemic toxicities, including elevated risk of infections, we believe that our approach has several potential advantages over recently approved complement inhibiting agents for GA, which are delivered directly into the eye and have resulted in rare but serious cases of retinal vasculitis, sometimes resulting in permanently impaired vision. In conclusion, Regeneron's R&D engine continues to grow and deliver many firsts, including differentiated early, mid, and late-stage opportunities and we're looking forward to additional progress in 2024. Before I turn the call over Marion, I would like to add my thanks and appreciation to Bob for his many years of devoted efforts and leadership, and welcoming and look forward to adding Chris Fenimore to our leadership team. With that, I will turn it over to Marion.\nMarion McCourt: Thanks, George. Our business delivered strong results in the fourth quarter and for the year. Over the course of 2023, we successfully launched EYLEA HD, grew Dupixent across approved Type 2 inflammatory diseases, and expanded Libtayo's presence in lung and non-melanoma skin cancers. We look forward to several potential approvals this year in new therapeutic categories, including in COPD with Dupixent and in hematologic oncology using new treatment modalities. I'll start with our Retinal franchise. In January, we announced fourth quarter combined U.S. EYLEA HD and EYLEA net product sales of $1.46 billion. In its first full quarter, EYLEA HD net product sales were $123 million based on growing demand and positive early physician experience. EYLEA HD is already being used across a broad range of patient types, including those switching from EYLEA, other branded agents or Avastin as well as modest but increasing use in treatment-naive patients. In the fourth quarter, EYLEA HD and EYLEA together secured 49% of the anti-VEGF category share despite increasing competition and changing market dynamics. This share gain was driven by the differentiated efficacy and safety profile of our medicine, as well as a short-term disruption in compounded Avastin due to a quality issue in a large supplier that has since been resolved. Since launch, we've made significant progress in securing access and reimbursement for EYLEA HD. More than two-thirds of eligible lives are now covered with the vast majority having first-line or single-step edit access. Medicare fee-for-service, which represents approximately 45% of total category use claims are being paid across 100% of jurisdictions, using a miscellaneous J-code. Looking ahead in 2024, we remind you that the first quarter is typically impacted by payer re-authorizations and that EYLEA HD will remain subject to a miscellaneous J-code. However, in late January, we achieved another important launch milestone with CMS' assignment of a permanent J-code for EYLEA HD, that will go into effect on April 1. This will provide additional reimbursement confidence for those physicians hesitant to prescribe before a permanent J-code based on their negative experiences with other new eye disease medicines. Overall, we are very excited about the future of our Retinal franchise. We continued to see physicians prescribe EYLEA HD in both treatment-experienced and treatment-naive settings as EYLEA HD is increasingly recognized as the new standard of care. Now to Dupixent, fourth quarter 2023 global net sales grew 31% on a constant-currency basis to $3.2 billion and US net sales grew 28% to $2.5 billion with more than 800,000 patients on therapy worldwide, Dupixent is one of the most important biologic medicines for patients across a spectrum of diseases. Additionally, it continues to have significant growth potential based on new and upcoming indications. In U.S., Dupixent leads new-to-brand prescription share across all five approved indications, an important leading indicator for future growth. In addition, Dupixent already leads total prescription share in four or five approved indications and we are approaching share leadership in biologic asthma. In atopic dermatitis, Dupixent's largest Indication, physicians continue to prescribe Dupixent as the therapy of choice. Despite increased competition over the course of 2023, fourth quarter Dupixent new-to-brand prescription share in AD modestly increased sequentially compared to the third quarter 2023, driven by its differentiated mechanism of action, clinical results and trusted safety profile, including approval in patients as young as six months of age Dupixent's U.S. label was recently updated with efficacy and safety data for patients with moderate-to-severe hand or foot atopic dermatitis. Dupixent is the only biologic medicine data in the label supporting use for the subset of patients with this hard-to-treat disease. Beyond atopic dermatitis, growth also continues in asthma and nasal polyps, both of which are already blockbuster indications. The recent launches for eosinophilic esophagitis noticed EoE and prurigo nodularis further contributed to Dupixent's performance and represent indications of significant growth potential. In EoE, which prior to Dupixent's approval had no FDA-approved treatments. Nearly 25,000 patients in the US alone have already initiated therapy on Dupixent. The FDA's recent approval of Dupixent in pediatric EoE extends this indication to patients as young as one year of age where approximately 20,000 children in the U.S. being treated for EoE with unapproved therapies. Patient initiations also continue to accelerate in prurigo nodularis solidifying Dupixent as the standard-of-care for multiple dermatologic conditions. In summary, Dupixent is delivering on its potential as one of the most important biologic medicines of our generation was significant remaining opportunity for growth. We anticipate bringing Dupixent to many more patients this year across approved indications. The pediatric EoE launch is already underway and we are actively preparing to launch Dupixent in eosinophilic COPD pending potential FDA approval later this year. And finally to Libtayo, fourth quarter global net sales grew 43% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis to $244 million with U.S. net sales of $155 million, Libtayo continues to lead the category in non-melanoma skin cancers and we've made progress in penetrating the non-small cell lung cancer market In 2024, we expect continued growth across all indications, advancing our goal to exceed $1 billion in annual Libtayo net sales. In conclusion, 2024 provides the opportunity to further build Regeneron's market-leading positions with our medicines across even more therapeutic areas. Now, I will turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Landry: Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron ended 2023 with strong performance in the fourth quarter. Excluding contributions from Ronapreve, total revenues increased 14% year-over-year to $3.4 billion, primarily driven by sales growth and margin expansion from Dupixent, the launch of EYLEA HD and strong sales growth from Libtayo. Fourth-quarter diluted net income per share was $11.86 on net income of $1.4 billion. Moving to collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. Fourth quarter 2023 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $890 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $377 million, of which $345 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue grew 19% in the fourth quarter of 2023 to $993 million. Excluding a $50 million sales milestone recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022, Sanofi collaboration revenue grew 26%. Our share of collaboration profits was $886 million, an increase of 43% versus the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by Dupixent's continued volume growth and improving margins. Reimbursements from manufacturing of commercial supply, a component of Sanofi collaboration revenues declined 36% versus the prior year due to the implementation of a new higher-yielding manufacturing process. At the end of 2023, the Sanofi development balance was $2.33 billion reflecting a net decrease of $534 million, compared to the balance as of December 31, 2022. Recall, this decrease is primarily recorded as a reduction to our share of collaboration profits. We continue to expect this balance to be fully reimbursed in the next few years, which would result in a significant step-up in our Sanofi collaboration profits. Other revenue was $213 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, up 66% versus the prior year, primarily driven by higher royalties from Novartis on sales of Ilaris and an increase in our share of ARCALYST profit from Kiniksa. The increase in other revenue also reflects higher reimbursements for increased shipment volumes of ex-U.S. commercial supplies of Praluent to Sanofi. Moving now to our operating expenses. Fourth quarter 2023 R&D expense grew 13% year-over-year to $1.03 billion, which reflects continued investment in our growing pipeline. R&D growth was primarily driven by higher headcount and related costs, funding of our advancing late-stage programs and increased clinical manufacturing activity. SG&A grew 7% from the prior year to $622 million in the fourth quarter reflecting higher headcount and related costs and higher commercialization expenses, including costs to support the launch of EYLEA HD in pre-launch activities for anticipated 2024 hem-onc product launches. Fourth quarter COCM declined 12% from the prior year quarter to $210 million. Recall that we are reimbursed for these costs. Now to cash flow in the balance sheet. In 2023, Regeneron generated $3.9 billion in free cash flow ending the year with cash and marketable securities, less debt of approximately $13.5 billion. In 2023, we repurchased over $2.2 billion of our shares with approximately $1.5 billion remaining authorized for repurchase as of December 31, 2023. Since we began repurchasing our shares in 2019, we have bought back approximately $12 billion worth and plan to continue to make opportunistic repurchases. Now moving to our financial guidance for 2024. Note that these guidance ranges do not assume the completion of any business development transactions that were not completed as of today, including our recently announced agreement to acquire preclinical and clinical programs from 2seventy Bio. Starting with R&D expense in 2024, which is anticipated to be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion, as George just discussed and as we highlighted at the J.P. Morgan Conference, our pipeline continues to expand with a growing number of registration-enabling studies ongoing or expected to initiate this year. These include potentially pivotal studies for Fianlimab, Phase 3 studies in earlier lines of odronextamab and linvoseltamab in our C5 programs. In addition, we expect to bring 8 to 10 new molecules into the clinic in 2024. We expect 2024 SG&A spending to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.65 billion. This reflects increased promotional activities for the ongoing launch of EYLEA HD, investments to support two anticipated hem-onc product launches and higher headcount to support our growing organization inclusive of our ongoing international expansion. COCM is expected to be in the range of $850 million to $910 million. This range reflects lower drug substance manufacturing cost for Dupixent, offset by higher Dupixent volumes and higher production costs for other collaboration products including EYLEA HD for Bayer. Recall, we are reimbursed for COCM expenses, and as a result, we expect reimbursement from Sanofi, which are recorded as a component of Sanofi collaboration revenue to be slightly lower in 2024, as compared to 2023. We expect the 2024 gross margin on-net product sales to be in the range of 89% to 91%. We also expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 10% to 12%. Finally, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $825 million to $950 million, which reflects the expansion of our R&D facilities at our Tarrytown, New York headquarters as well as the continued expansion of our manufacturing capabilities, including ongoing construction of our fill-finish facility in Rensselaer, New York. In addition to our full-year guidance, we expect U.S. net product sales of Praluent to be lower in 2024, as compared to 2023 due to changes in payer coverage. We also expect 2024 net product sales for Inmazeb to be in line with 2023 revenues with nearly all 2024 revenues expected to be recorded in the fourth quarter. Finally, we anticipate other revenue in 2024 to be in line with 2023, with the second half expected to be higher than our first half. Overall, Regeneron performed well in 2023 and our continued investments position the company to drive long-term shareholder value. Before I conclude, I'd like to sincerely thank Len and George for their kind words. It has been an honor to serve as Regeneron's CFO for these past 10-years and I have appreciated all of my interactions with each of you in the investment community. I wish Chris Fenimore much success in this role and have the utmost confidence that he and the rest of the management team will continue to deliver breakthrough medicines for patients and value to shareholders. Thank you and I wish you all continued success. With that, I will pass the call back to Ryan.\nRyan Crowe: Thank you, Bob, and congratulations again. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for Q&A. To ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. Shannon, can we go to the first question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nTyler Van Buren: Great, thanks guys, good morning. And I'd like to say congratulations to you as well, Bob, wish you well during your retirement. It's been a privilege to work with you. And Chris, I look forward to working with you as well. So in the opening, Len mentioned accelerating the rate of conversion of patients from other agents to EYLEA HD. So, can you discuss the different factors at play that will accelerate the rate over the year, which I assume, includes the permanent J-code and also the robust sampling effort that is impacting to make sales.\nMarion McCourt: Sure, Tyler. I'm happy to answer. So, as I mentioned, we're very encouraged by the early performance of EYLEA HD in the market and a number of factors early are driving that success. First, it's the clinical data, which is now showing in the actual market real-world setting the efficacy, safety, and durability of EYLEA HD, all very important factors. As we look to the future, physicians will build upon their early experience, and as I mentioned that experience is coming from conversion patients from branded agents broadly, Avastin and also in some cases naive patients but going forward, I would share that in addition to ongoing experience and confidence, the reimbursement consideration is very, very important for physicians, and some are hesitant to prescribe a product that doesn't have a permanent J-code. So we do look forward to that occurring April 1 and beyond based on CMS's recent update. And then in addition to reimbursement confidence, we've made progress certainly in payer coverage. We anticipate making more. And certainly, the experience in market to date with EYLEA HD has been very favorable for physicians. And that is the, probably, the most important, those differentiating characteristics of the product.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks, Marion. Shannon, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nBrian Abrahams: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats to both Bob and Chris. I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about the differentiation of the emerging obesity portfolio as you move into the next wave of studies. I know a patent filing revealed that the antibody tethered GLP-1 shows very competitive weight loss in animal models. So I'm wondering where you see that differentiating most. Is it tolerability in distribution or dose frequency or somewhere else? And then I know others are pursuing myostatin as well on top of GLP-1s. Just curious where you see your biggest competitive advantage there.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Okay. Well, let me start with the latter first, in terms of muscle preservation. Other people have related approaches, but we're the only ones, we're the ones who discovered that there are two key ligands or growth factors that control muscle size: myostatin, myostatin 1, we call it, and myostatin 2 or ActiveNA. And we're the only ones that have specific blocking antibodies for those two. And we are testing them together and individually. And the reason why that's important is it's going to be a combination of both efficacy and safety that matters here. So we're going to see which approach does the best in terms of the muscle preservation in the face of the profound muscle loss that you can see with GLP-1 agonist treatment. But we're also going to see the safety profiles. And I think that that's going to be so critical because safety is so important here. Other people are just testing one of these agents alone. I believe, the myostatin, and others are testing very broad approaches such as trying to block the receptors for these factors. The problem with the receptor blockade approach is that the receptors that are used by these factors are also used by over a dozen other ligands that have very diverse biologic functions. And you can easily imagine that by blocking so many diverse functions, you might end up having all sorts of safety issues, which you're not going to want to be able to be dealing with in the setting of a treatment that's intended to optimize obesity and body weight loss and give benefit to the patients. So our programs are very different in that we discovered the 2 key regulators, the 2 key growth factors. We have separate antibodies blocking them both. And we're evaluating them separately and together in the setting of GLP-1 receptor agonist, to see what gives us the best benefit vis-a-vis muscle preservation as well as safety profile. While we're doing that, as we said, we're initiating those trials this year, we are also developing unimolecular solutions. So whichever approach works best, we hope to have the possibility of having a tethered GLP-1, as you put it, associated with the right set of antibody molecules. So they will have the advantage of having a unimolecular solution that can provide all-in-one benefit in terms of providing, hopefully, the best convenience profile and potentially once-a-month dosing, together with providing not only the weight loss, the profound weight loss that one is seen with GLP-1 receptor agonist, but now complemented by providing muscle preservation, but with the safest possible approach. So we think that we have the most unique program in terms of addressing all these possibilities. And we're very, very excited about these programs.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks, George. Shannon, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question and thank you, Bob, for all your help over the years. Maybe one question for Marion. Can you just comment on the trends in the anti-VEGF market, underlying trends? I mean, is the market growing or you are growing fast, as fast as it's been in the past, or is it slowing down a little bit? And in that context, how do you see the outlook for Hydro EYLEA plus EYLEA going forward, with the underlying demand out there? Thank you.\nMarion McCourt: Sure, Mohit. So there is variation between quarters and years as it relates to anti-VEGF category growth. Overall, though, the category is healthy from a growth standpoint, unfortunately, based on the number of individuals with diabetes or diagnosed with diabetes. On a brighter note, aging population is good. So overall, we see it as healthy category growth. But there is variability. And as an example, there has been some decline by a couple of points between last year and this year overall.\nRyan Crowe: Okay, next question, please, Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Raymond with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nChristopher Raymond: Thanks. Maybe just another EYLEA question. I know you guys don't want to get sort of too granular on your pricing strategy, but we've been struck that, even with the 2-milligram format revenue contracting in the last couple of quarters, our checks show that it's really not a market share issue. In fact, share of that format remains up around an all-time high. So one would think that that's been price erosion that's been driving that. Just understand this may be a strategy to maximize the HD launch, in broad stroke, can you talk about what we should be expecting in 2024? Do you expect further price erosion for that 2-milligram format? Or have things sort of leveled off?\nLeonard Schleifer: Yes. I'm not sure we want Marion to get into the details of our strategies, pricing, rebates, things like that. But we can say, Marion, you could add thoughts, that we view it as a very competitive marketplace. There has been some price erosion on some of the products in the marketplace. We're starting at a new point with EYLEA HD. We think we priced it well. It was received well. It was intended to match on a yearly basis. And so we think the actual price point was fine. I don't know if Marion wants to add anything at all, but we don't like to comment specifically on those competitive dynamics.\nMarion McCourt: Yes. Chris, really nothing in everyone to add to that.\nRyan Crowe: Okay, all right next question please Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow with UBS. Your line is now open.\nColin Bristow: Hey, good morning and thanks for taking the question. And all the best in the future, Bob. Maybe a couple more on the muscle sparing myostatin program. I'm curious, George, what are your thoughts around the potential concerns of myostatin targeting, increases or preserves muscle volume, but the muscle is less functional. And then any thoughts on the regulatory pathway that you would utilize for these muscle sparing assets? Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Regulatory. Okay, so o first of all, we've done extensive work in preclinical models. And these antibodies have already been in humans. We believe that our studies are actually showing that this muscle is functional and certainly very important from both the metabolic and energy expenditure point of view. So, so far, those studies are very supportive of this whole approach. I should also say there's a variety of regulatory pathways that we're pursuing here. Obviously, the easiest, which would come from the possible results that we're seeing in the animal studies, is if there's incrementally more weight loss, that might suffice as a regulatory strategy. Alternatively, if it's just the quality of the white loss, then we would have to show functional outcomes in terms of strength and so forth and so on. So those are still early in the thinking. We have to see from these initial studies. But as I said, if we simply see increased weight loss, that would be the simplest way forward. And then you have more weight loss but better body composition data, and may also -- may be better metabolic benefits, which we also see in muscle, which could also provide additional pass-through approval. So it depends on those results that we're going to get from the initial studies. I should also mention, in terms of additional programs that we have, obesity. I mean, these are things that are here and now that we're doing these clinical trials and we hope to be getting results over the course of the next year, 1.5 years that could really inform in terms of all these questions that you have and really validate that there's real promise here. But remember, we're doing a lot of other things as well in obesity that are in earlier stages. So for example, as you probably know, we discovered a brand-new promising target in obesity using our Regeneron Genetics Center, the largest big data set on the planet in terms of human sequence linked to electronic health records, and identified, in some ways, one of the most exciting new targets in obesity that's been ever discovered. And we have a variety, it's called GPR75, it was published in a prominent paper in Science about a year or so ago. And we have a variety of promising and not-that-far-away approaches from the clinic in terms of blocking this target for weight loss. And I think that we presented at JPMorgan early preclinical data using siRNA approaches that look very exciting. I should also mention that, in terms of smaller programs and so forth, we have things like a very exciting leptin receptor-activating antibody that have had very promising human data as well. So there's a lot of things going on, but I think the muscle preservation program and how it goes forward is going to be very interesting to look at over the next year, 1.5 years.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks, George. Shannon, next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi guys, I have one final question for Bob. So Bob, you've done an outstanding job managing the financials of the business and helping drive shareholder returns over the past decade. Looking ahead, how do you believe Regeneron can best use its rapidly growing cash balance to further drive investor returns in the next decade of Regeneron? And thanks for everything, Bob.\nBob Landry: Evan, thanks for the question, and thanks for the video that we were able to show at my retirement party. It was great. On that question, George just laid out earlier today, we have so many opportunities with regards to our kind of research and development. And again, I mean I'm going to hand the mantle over to Chris, but his number one priority within capital allocation is to make sure that that is kind of fully funded. Len and George do a great job with regards to making sure what we're bringing into the clinic as opportunities, and they're going to continue to do that, and there's just a lot coming, particularly when I said kind of 8 to 10 INDs. Proud on buybacks. Maybe I've kind of circled the victory too much on that with regards to how much we bought back and at what price. But we have a good methodology here that Chris is ingrained with, and he'll continue to do that. And with regards to business development, I mean, just because we can doesn't mean we're going to force something. It has to be right, it has to be a franchise, has to be modalities. You've heard George mention that has to be kind of incremental to what we currently have in the clinic here with regards to RGC and the targets we develop, and all of that. So we will remain prudent on that. Continue to be proud of the free cash flow that we're generating. And I trust that Chris, George, Len and the Board will optimize it and put it to great use.\nRyan Crowe: Thank you, Bob. Next question, please, Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nSalveen Richter: Thank you. Good morning. And Bob, you truly will be missed, and enjoy the next stage of life here. With regard to your GA program, can you outline what's contributing to your confidence in the systemic approach here, and what data you've seen to support it given the move from animal models to Phase III?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Okay, geographic atrophy. So basically, the excitement is that, as we show data from our combination approach, we believe that we have the most effective way of blocking the body's C5 activity. The C5, which is active in the eye, is essentially all coming from the liver. And we've shown now in our PNH studies, when we revealed the data from the first portion of our Phase III program, that it looked like we had the best-in-class activity in terms of decreasing the C5 activity. So if you block it at the source, then you don't have to block it in the eye. And if you block it at the source, then you don't suffer from all the concerns and side effects and so forth that you have from having to block it in the eye. So you block it where it's coming from, then you don't have to treat local in the eye. You can avoid the local side effects. The concern with systemic blockade is it comes with increased risks of infections and so forth. So we will have to come up with a strategy, which we're working on, to try to mitigate that in the elderly population that suffers from GA. We believe that we may need for that an approach to identify the patients who might be at risk in those settings. Because we certainly know that, for example, patients with PNH and myasthenia gravis who are immunosuppressed and so forth, not only with our agent, but certainly with this whole class of agents, can suffer from serious systemic infections when you block C5. So we are coming up with a way to mitigate that, in part by probably selecting out the patients who are at the highest risk. But in terms of efficacy, the fact that you block it at the source should make it much more effective than trying to block it indirectly in the eye, while avoiding all of the serious local side effect, you can get in the eye, including this horrific retinal vasculitis, which is associated with sudden and permanent blindness.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks, George. I think we have time for two more questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.\nDavid Risinger: Yes, thanks very much. And first, I wanted to offer my congrats as well and best wishes to you, both Bob and Chris. So I have a commercial question on linvoseltamab, please. It's clearly generated best-in-class results and a more attractive profile for patients. But Regeneron has to displace the incumbents. So could you discuss your plans to convert prescribers to linvoseltamab?\nMarion McCourt: I'm anxious to answer, but Len will, of course, go first.\nLeonard Schleifer: No, I just wanted to give a little history, David. You actually were around. You may even have asked the exact question, I'm not sure. when we were launching EYLEA and we had to displace Lucentis by the behemoth Roche. There are some lessons in there that it can be done with starting with a really good molecule, as you described, one that is potentially be best-in-class and then strong execution at the commercial front. We've done it. We're not afraid of the 800-pound gorilla. We hope to put that gorilla on perhaps a weight loss program and get in there and show them what we can do, Marion, any comments. I just want to put that historical perspective out there.\nMarion McCourt: Thank you, David, for the question. And I'm going to be a bit redundant, so I'll be short. But my comment was to say it always starts with the best-in-class molecule. It's about the science. And certainly, you've seen us across therapeutic areas launch into competitive categories, both in the anti-VEGF category and then, more recently, bringing great products into the marketplace. So we do look forward to this opportunity. And it fits quite beautifully with our oncology team, our onc -- will be onc/hem team. And certainly, we will be very ready for that launch and look forward to helping patients with linvo.\nRyan Crowe: Okay. Thanks, Len and Marion. Shannon, last question, please.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nCarter Gould: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'll echo all the prior comments about Bob, and best of luck. Maybe just on the 2seventy deal, Len and George. How should we think about this? Was this more about sort of protecting the rights of the assets that you already kind of partnered on, or really around sort of getting access to that manufacturing facility? And does that have implications then as we think about your business development going forward and maybe change kind of your willingness to move further down that path of cellular therapies?\nLeonard Schleifer: I'll let George comment on the scientific rationale, which drives pretty much everything we do. Just to mention from a business development point of view, we have been a long-standing partner with 2seventy when they were still part of bluebird. We've invested in them, both in equity and, frankly, in development. So this was something that was well known. George can comment how we see this fitting in.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. We're excited about the existing programs. But what we're even more excited about is as we know that the history of many diseases, but cancer in particular, is about combination approaches. And thus far, even in the setting of this collaboration, the CAR T space has been separate from the biologics space. And even though we were working together as separate companies, it was a little harder to really move forward in an expedited fashion the incredible opportunities that I believe that we have to combine what we think is the largest and most exciting portfolio of biologics in immunotherapy, together with cell therapy approaches. Nobody else has really tried that. Nobody else has really led that. Now that we're really together all in with our new selected colleagues from 2seventy and their capabilities, we believe that we will now have the first opportunity to really try this new set of combination approaches against cancer. That is, combining our large portfolio of biologics in the immunotherapy space with their cell therapy capabilities and expertise, that brings a whole new level of combinations to the immunotherapy field. We believe we will be alone in that capability until somebody else tries to copy us and do what we're doing here. And that's what we're really excited about, in addition to just moving forward the existing cell therapy programs that we've been working on them for five years or more.\nRyan Crowe: All right. Thanks, Len and George, and thanks to everyone who dialed in today for your interest in Regeneron. We apologize to those remaining in the queue that we did not have a chance to hear from. As always, the Investor Relations team here at Regeneron is available to answer any remaining questions you may have. Thank you once again, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, George. Our business delivered strong results in the fourth quarter and for the year. Over the course of 2023, we successfully launched EYLEA HD, grew Dupixent across approved Type 2 inflammatory diseases, and expanded Libtayo's presence in lung and non-melanoma skin cancers. We look forward to several potential approvals this year in new therapeutic categories, including in COPD with Dupixent and in hematologic oncology using new treatment modalities. I'll start with our Retinal franchise. In January, we announced fourth quarter combined U.S. EYLEA HD and EYLEA net product sales of $1.46 billion. In its first full quarter, EYLEA HD net product sales were $123 million based on growing demand and positive early physician experience. EYLEA HD is already being used across a broad range of patient types, including those switching from EYLEA, other branded agents or Avastin as well as modest but increasing use in treatment-naive patients. In the fourth quarter, EYLEA HD and EYLEA together secured 49% of the anti-VEGF category share despite increasing competition and changing market dynamics. This share gain was driven by the differentiated efficacy and safety profile of our medicine, as well as a short-term disruption in compounded Avastin due to a quality issue in a large supplier that has since been resolved. Since launch, we've made significant progress in securing access and reimbursement for EYLEA HD. More than two-thirds of eligible lives are now covered with the vast majority having first-line or single-step edit access. Medicare fee-for-service, which represents approximately 45% of total category use claims are being paid across 100% of jurisdictions, using a miscellaneous J-code. Looking ahead in 2024, we remind you that the first quarter is typically impacted by payer re-authorizations and that EYLEA HD will remain subject to a miscellaneous J-code. However, in late January, we achieved another important launch milestone with CMS' assignment of a permanent J-code for EYLEA HD, that will go into effect on April 1. This will provide additional reimbursement confidence for those physicians hesitant to prescribe before a permanent J-code based on their negative experiences with other new eye disease medicines. Overall, we are very excited about the future of our Retinal franchise. We continued to see physicians prescribe EYLEA HD in both treatment-experienced and treatment-naive settings as EYLEA HD is increasingly recognized as the new standard of care. Now to Dupixent, fourth quarter 2023 global net sales grew 31% on a constant-currency basis to $3.2 billion and US net sales grew 28% to $2.5 billion with more than 800,000 patients on therapy worldwide, Dupixent is one of the most important biologic medicines for patients across a spectrum of diseases. Additionally, it continues to have significant growth potential based on new and upcoming indications. In U.S., Dupixent leads new-to-brand prescription share across all five approved indications, an important leading indicator for future growth. In addition, Dupixent already leads total prescription share in four or five approved indications and we are approaching share leadership in biologic asthma. In atopic dermatitis, Dupixent's largest Indication, physicians continue to prescribe Dupixent as the therapy of choice. Despite increased competition over the course of 2023, fourth quarter Dupixent new-to-brand prescription share in AD modestly increased sequentially compared to the third quarter 2023, driven by its differentiated mechanism of action, clinical results and trusted safety profile, including approval in patients as young as six months of age Dupixent's U.S. label was recently updated with efficacy and safety data for patients with moderate-to-severe hand or foot atopic dermatitis. Dupixent is the only biologic medicine data in the label supporting use for the subset of patients with this hard-to-treat disease. Beyond atopic dermatitis, growth also continues in asthma and nasal polyps, both of which are already blockbuster indications. The recent launches for eosinophilic esophagitis noticed EoE and prurigo nodularis further contributed to Dupixent's performance and represent indications of significant growth potential. In EoE, which prior to Dupixent's approval had no FDA-approved treatments. Nearly 25,000 patients in the US alone have already initiated therapy on Dupixent. The FDA's recent approval of Dupixent in pediatric EoE extends this indication to patients as young as one year of age where approximately 20,000 children in the U.S. being treated for EoE with unapproved therapies. Patient initiations also continue to accelerate in prurigo nodularis solidifying Dupixent as the standard-of-care for multiple dermatologic conditions. In summary, Dupixent is delivering on its potential as one of the most important biologic medicines of our generation was significant remaining opportunity for growth. We anticipate bringing Dupixent to many more patients this year across approved indications. The pediatric EoE launch is already underway and we are actively preparing to launch Dupixent in eosinophilic COPD pending potential FDA approval later this year. And finally to Libtayo, fourth quarter global net sales grew 43% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis to $244 million with U.S. net sales of $155 million, Libtayo continues to lead the category in non-melanoma skin cancers and we've made progress in penetrating the non-small cell lung cancer market In 2024, we expect continued growth across all indications, advancing our goal to exceed $1 billion in annual Libtayo net sales. In conclusion, 2024 provides the opportunity to further build Regeneron's market-leading positions with our medicines across even more therapeutic areas. Now, I will turn the call over to Bob. Sure, Tyler. I'm happy to answer. So, as I mentioned, we're very encouraged by the early performance of EYLEA HD in the market and a number of factors early are driving that success. First, it's the clinical data, which is now showing in the actual market real-world setting the efficacy, safety, and durability of EYLEA HD, all very important factors. As we look to the future, physicians will build upon their early experience, and as I mentioned that experience is coming from conversion patients from branded agents broadly, Avastin and also in some cases naive patients but going forward, I would share that in addition to ongoing experience and confidence, the reimbursement consideration is very, very important for physicians, and some are hesitant to prescribe a product that doesn't have a permanent J-code. So we do look forward to that occurring April 1 and beyond based on CMS's recent update. And then in addition to reimbursement confidence, we've made progress certainly in payer coverage. We anticipate making more. And certainly, the experience in market to date with EYLEA HD has been very favorable for physicians. And that is the, probably, the most important, those differentiating characteristics of the product. Sure, Mohit. So there is variation between quarters and years as it relates to anti-VEGF category growth. Overall, though, the category is healthy from a growth standpoint, unfortunately, based on the number of individuals with diabetes or diagnosed with diabetes. On a brighter note, aging population is good. So overall, we see it as healthy category growth. But there is variability. And as an example, there has been some decline by a couple of points between last year and this year overall. Yes. Chris, really nothing in everyone to add to that. I'm anxious to answer, but Len will, of course, go first. Thank you, David, for the question. And I'm going to be a bit redundant, so I'll be short. But my comment was to say it always starts with the best-in-class molecule. It's about the science. And certainly, you've seen us across therapeutic areas launch into competitive categories, both in the anti-VEGF category and then, more recently, bringing great products into the marketplace. So we do look forward to this opportunity. And it fits quite beautifully with our oncology team, our onc -- will be onc/hem team. And certainly, we will be very ready for that launch and look forward to helping patients with linvo."

            "name": "Leonard Schleifer",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone joining today's call. Fourth quarter 2023 capped another strong year for Regeneron and Bob will walk you through our financial results. For my remarks today, I'd like to briefly look back at 2023 and then discuss what's to come in the year ahead. 2023 was another remarkable year for Regeneron highlighted by several significant achievements that better position the company to deliver sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value. At the start of the year, we identified five key strategic imperatives: First, obtaining FDA approval and successfully launching EYLEA HD. We did encounter a minor delay when we received a complete response letter in late June due to an issue at a third-party filler, but this was quickly remedied and EYLEA HD was granted approval in mid-August. With what we believe to be a best-in-class potential clinical profile, EYLEA HD is poised to become the new standard-of-care for patients with wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic eye diseases. The launch is off to a great start, which Marion will discuss in a few minutes. Second, we had to defend our intellectual property related to EYLEA. We presented our best case and prevailed in the District Court, which found that one of EYLEA's formulation patents was both valid and infringed by a biosimilar aflibercept manufacturer. This favorable decision may have broad implications and could result in a delay to biosimilar aflibercept launches. Third, we and our collaborator, Sanofi, needed to continue driving Dupixent growth not only by further penetrating previously approved indications, but also reaching even more patients suffering from other diseases driven by type 2 inflammation. In 2023, we did both. Dupixent global net product sales grew by 34% on a constant currency basis to $11.6 billion. Dupixent lead in new to brand prescription share in the United States across all five of its approved indications. We also had a major breakthrough in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD. In March, we reported strong data from the BOREAS study, which enrolled COPD patients with uncontrolled moderate to severe disease and evidence of type 2 inflammation. The FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation during the summer, but required additional evidence of efficacy to support a regulatory filing. Based on this feedback, we and Sanofi decided to conduct an interim analysis on the replicate noticed study, which read out similarly compelling results enabling our December sBLA submission and a potential U.S. launch for this indication as early as mid-2024. Fourth, we continued making progress toward our long-term goal of becoming a global leader in oncology. 2023 was highlighted by our regulatory submissions for linvoseltamab, our BCMA by CD3 bispecific in myeloma and odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific in lymphoma, while continuing to advance other opportunities in solid tumors. And finally, we needed to advance our early-stage pipeline and over the course of 2023, we presented intriguing proof of mechanism or proof of concept data across hematology and genetic medicines as well, as well as other areas including obesity with data from non-human primates. Many of these early programs which George will run through in a few minutes represent first or best-in-class opportunities that we believe can drive long-term growth for Regeneron. Our accomplishments in 2023 have put us in a position of strength entering 2024. For this year, one of our strategic imperatives is to continue driving commercial execution, especially the ongoing launch of EYLEA HD with the goal of accelerating the pace of conversion from other anti-VEGF agents. Another important launch milestone was achieved last month when the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services assigned a permanent J-code for EYLEA HD that will go into effect on April 1, 2024, at which point a potential reimbursement concern for physicians will be removed. We also need to continue to drive Dupixent growth and its currently improved indications as well as from the potential FDA approval and launch in COPD with an eosinophilic phenotype. If approved, Dupixent would represent the first meaningful advance in over a decade for the 300,000 patients in the United States suffering from this form of COPD and would be the first-ever biologic approved for COPD. In oncology this year, aside from continuing to build on the success of Libtayo in non-melanoma skin cancers and then in small cell lung cancer, we're excited about the potential launches of odronextamab and linvoseltamab, the latter of which has the potential to be the best-in-class bispecific for myeloma. We also expect to make significant advances across our pipeline in 2024 with key readouts for fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody in combination with Libtayo in metastatic melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Libtayo in adjuvant cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and our Factor XI antibodies in thrombosis, which may inform pivotal studies. We also plan to initiate clinical trials in obesity, geographic atrophy, hemophilia B and severe food allergies in addition to expanding early studies of our CD28 costimulatory bispecific programs in solid and hematologic malignancies. In closing, we had a strong 2023 and are poised to deliver in 2024 and beyond. Our pipeline of over 30 clinical programs is delivering important and differentiated innovations. Our commercial team is executing well and we continue to look at ways to efficiently deploy capital to drive shareholder returns over time. Before I hand it over to George, I want to take a moment to thank Bob Landry for his many contributions to Regeneron over his 10-years as our Chief Financial Officer. In addition to helping fortify Regeneron's financial strength and discipline, Bob has been an incredible mentor to many of Regeneron's current and future leaders, helped drive our financial results over the past decade and worked tirelessly to ensure we have the resources needed to help improve the lives of patients around the world. Bob, on behalf of the entire Regeneron family, thank you and we wish you continued good health and happiness. As we first announced back in September upon Bob's retirement next week, Chris Fenimore will become the CFO of Regeneron. We all look forward to working closely with Chris in his new role knowing he brings a similar rigor and depth of financial knowledge that will ensure continuity and collaboration across the organization. With that, I'll now turn the call over to George. Yes. I'm not sure we want Marion to get into the details of our strategies, pricing, rebates, things like that. But we can say, Marion, you could add thoughts, that we view it as a very competitive marketplace. There has been some price erosion on some of the products in the marketplace. We're starting at a new point with EYLEA HD. We think we priced it well. It was received well. It was intended to match on a yearly basis. And so we think the actual price point was fine. I don't know if Marion wants to add anything at all, but we don't like to comment specifically on those competitive dynamics. No, I just wanted to give a little history, David. You actually were around. You may even have asked the exact question, I'm not sure. when we were launching EYLEA and we had to displace Lucentis by the behemoth Roche. There are some lessons in there that it can be done with starting with a really good molecule, as you described, one that is potentially be best-in-class and then strong execution at the commercial front. We've done it. We're not afraid of the 800-pound gorilla. We hope to put that gorilla on perhaps a weight loss program and get in there and show them what we can do, Marion, any comments. I just want to put that historical perspective out there. I'll let George comment on the scientific rationale, which drives pretty much everything we do. Just to mention from a business development point of view, we have been a long-standing partner with 2seventy when they were still part of bluebird. We've invested in them, both in equity and, frankly, in development. So this was something that was well known. George can comment how we see this fitting in."

            "content": "Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron ended 2023 with strong performance in the fourth quarter. Excluding contributions from Ronapreve, total revenues increased 14% year-over-year to $3.4 billion, primarily driven by sales growth and margin expansion from Dupixent, the launch of EYLEA HD and strong sales growth from Libtayo. Fourth-quarter diluted net income per share was $11.86 on net income of $1.4 billion. Moving to collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. Fourth quarter 2023 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $890 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $377 million, of which $345 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue grew 19% in the fourth quarter of 2023 to $993 million. Excluding a $50 million sales milestone recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022, Sanofi collaboration revenue grew 26%. Our share of collaboration profits was $886 million, an increase of 43% versus the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by Dupixent's continued volume growth and improving margins. Reimbursements from manufacturing of commercial supply, a component of Sanofi collaboration revenues declined 36% versus the prior year due to the implementation of a new higher-yielding manufacturing process. At the end of 2023, the Sanofi development balance was $2.33 billion reflecting a net decrease of $534 million, compared to the balance as of December 31, 2022. Recall, this decrease is primarily recorded as a reduction to our share of collaboration profits. We continue to expect this balance to be fully reimbursed in the next few years, which would result in a significant step-up in our Sanofi collaboration profits. Other revenue was $213 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, up 66% versus the prior year, primarily driven by higher royalties from Novartis on sales of Ilaris and an increase in our share of ARCALYST profit from Kiniksa. The increase in other revenue also reflects higher reimbursements for increased shipment volumes of ex-U.S. commercial supplies of Praluent to Sanofi. Moving now to our operating expenses. Fourth quarter 2023 R&D expense grew 13% year-over-year to $1.03 billion, which reflects continued investment in our growing pipeline. R&D growth was primarily driven by higher headcount and related costs, funding of our advancing late-stage programs and increased clinical manufacturing activity. SG&A grew 7% from the prior year to $622 million in the fourth quarter reflecting higher headcount and related costs and higher commercialization expenses, including costs to support the launch of EYLEA HD in pre-launch activities for anticipated 2024 hem-onc product launches. Fourth quarter COCM declined 12% from the prior year quarter to $210 million. Recall that we are reimbursed for these costs. Now to cash flow in the balance sheet. In 2023, Regeneron generated $3.9 billion in free cash flow ending the year with cash and marketable securities, less debt of approximately $13.5 billion. In 2023, we repurchased over $2.2 billion of our shares with approximately $1.5 billion remaining authorized for repurchase as of December 31, 2023. Since we began repurchasing our shares in 2019, we have bought back approximately $12 billion worth and plan to continue to make opportunistic repurchases. Now moving to our financial guidance for 2024. Note that these guidance ranges do not assume the completion of any business development transactions that were not completed as of today, including our recently announced agreement to acquire preclinical and clinical programs from 2seventy Bio. Starting with R&D expense in 2024, which is anticipated to be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion, as George just discussed and as we highlighted at the J.P. Morgan Conference, our pipeline continues to expand with a growing number of registration-enabling studies ongoing or expected to initiate this year. These include potentially pivotal studies for Fianlimab, Phase 3 studies in earlier lines of odronextamab and linvoseltamab in our C5 programs. In addition, we expect to bring 8 to 10 new molecules into the clinic in 2024. We expect 2024 SG&A spending to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.65 billion. This reflects increased promotional activities for the ongoing launch of EYLEA HD, investments to support two anticipated hem-onc product launches and higher headcount to support our growing organization inclusive of our ongoing international expansion. COCM is expected to be in the range of $850 million to $910 million. This range reflects lower drug substance manufacturing cost for Dupixent, offset by higher Dupixent volumes and higher production costs for other collaboration products including EYLEA HD for Bayer. Recall, we are reimbursed for COCM expenses, and as a result, we expect reimbursement from Sanofi, which are recorded as a component of Sanofi collaboration revenue to be slightly lower in 2024, as compared to 2023. We expect the 2024 gross margin on-net product sales to be in the range of 89% to 91%. We also expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 10% to 12%. Finally, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $825 million to $950 million, which reflects the expansion of our R&D facilities at our Tarrytown, New York headquarters as well as the continued expansion of our manufacturing capabilities, including ongoing construction of our fill-finish facility in Rensselaer, New York. In addition to our full-year guidance, we expect U.S. net product sales of Praluent to be lower in 2024, as compared to 2023 due to changes in payer coverage. We also expect 2024 net product sales for Inmazeb to be in line with 2023 revenues with nearly all 2024 revenues expected to be recorded in the fourth quarter. Finally, we anticipate other revenue in 2024 to be in line with 2023, with the second half expected to be higher than our first half. Overall, Regeneron performed well in 2023 and our continued investments position the company to drive long-term shareholder value. Before I conclude, I'd like to sincerely thank Len and George for their kind words. It has been an honor to serve as Regeneron's CFO for these past 10-years and I have appreciated all of my interactions with each of you in the investment community. I wish Chris Fenimore much success in this role and have the utmost confidence that he and the rest of the management team will continue to deliver breakthrough medicines for patients and value to shareholders. Thank you and I wish you all continued success. With that, I will pass the call back to Ryan. Evan, thanks for the question, and thanks for the video that we were able to show at my retirement party. It was great. On that question, George just laid out earlier today, we have so many opportunities with regards to our kind of research and development. And again, I mean I'm going to hand the mantle over to Chris, but his number one priority within capital allocation is to make sure that that is kind of fully funded. Len and George do a great job with regards to making sure what we're bringing into the clinic as opportunities, and they're going to continue to do that, and there's just a lot coming, particularly when I said kind of 8 to 10 INDs. Proud on buybacks. Maybe I've kind of circled the victory too much on that with regards to how much we bought back and at what price. But we have a good methodology here that Chris is ingrained with, and he'll continue to do that. And with regards to business development, I mean, just because we can doesn't mean we're going to force something. It has to be right, it has to be a franchise, has to be modalities. You've heard George mention that has to be kind of incremental to what we currently have in the clinic here with regards to RGC and the targets we develop, and all of that. So we will remain prudent on that. Continue to be proud of the free cash flow that we're generating. And I trust that Chris, George, Len and the Board will optimize it and put it to great use."

            "content": "Thanks, Len. That was really impressive overview I have to say. 2023 was another year of first delivered by Regeneron as well as together with our collaborators, all of which have the potential to change the practice of medicine. Starting with inflammation and immunology. As you heard from Len, we are planning yet another launch for Dupixent, this time in eosinophilic COPD, which would represent the sixth disease if this remarkable medicine is approved to treat and the fifth for which it would be first-in-class. Dupixent's transformative potential in COPD is based on the unprecedented results from our first Phase 3 trial BOREAS, which would then confirm our second Phase 3 trial notice demonstrating that Dupixent treated patients had a 34% reduction in the annualized rate of moderate to severe COPD exacerbations [Technical Issues] IL-33 blocking antibody. The pivotal AERIFY-1 and 2 studies passed an interim futility analysis last year. The studies are now on track to complete enrollment in 2024 with an anticipated readout in 2025. If the Phase 3 results from these studies even approach the Phase 2 data reported in former smokers where a 42% reduction in annualized exacerbation rate was observed, itepekimab has the potential to further transform the treatment paradigm for COPD. Later this year, we are planning on testing an innovative new treatment approach for severe food allergies using a combination of transient BCMAxCD3 bispecific intervention in patients receiving Dupixent therapy. As many of you know, allergic responses are driven by pathologically high levels of Immunoglobulin E or IgE. This is why many say the E in IgE stands for evil. About 40-years ago, it was discovered that interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 were the switch factors required for switching to IgE production. Based on exciting preclinical data including in non-human primates as well as human data, our innovative approach has the potential to reverse severe allergies by first eliminating the long lived plasma cells that serve as an IgE reservoir with the BCMAxCD3 followed by blocking of de novo immunoglobulin class switching to IgE with Dupixent. We are looking forward to starting a small proof-of-concept study, which will inform next steps for this program. We believe this approach has the potential to benefit the millions of people suffering from severe allergies, who are at constant risk. As tragically highlighted just last week by the widely reported death of yet another young person unknowingly exposed to food a allergen. Moving to Oncology. Libtayo is the leading PD-1 antibody for non-melanoma skin cancers, including metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or CSCC and basal cell carcinoma. We are looking forward to potentially expanding the currently approved CSCC indication to include adjuvant CSCC and we expect results from potentially pivotal interim analysis in this setting in the second-half of the year. Regarding Libtayo combinations, our most advanced is the combination with a LAG-3 antibody fianlimab. As a reminder, our early clinical data in three separate first line metastatic melanoma cohorts demonstrated potential for best-in-class efficacy when compared cross trial with the approved anti-LAG-3 PD-1 combination product, highlighted by objective response rates greater than 60% and estimated median progression-free survival of longer than 15 months. These early clinical data suggested that the Libtayo fianlimab combination maybe one of the most exciting examples of a checkpoint inhibitor combination with clinically meaningful benefit and with the safety profile that is similar to that seen with anti PD-1 monotherapy. We are expecting a potentially pivotal initial readout from our first line metastatic melanoma trial by the end of this year. We also anticipate Phase 2 data in non-small cell lung cancer in late 2024. Onto by specifics, starting with solid tumors. In the dose escalation trial of our EGFR by CD28 costimulatory bispecific combined with Libtayo, we have observed promising activity in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer with higher doses of the costim. In terms of safety, so far, we have not seen an increase in immune related adverse events with this costim. Based on these encouraging early data, which will be presented at a scientific forum later this year, we will be initiating expansion cohorts across several solid tumors in the first-half of the year. In 2024, we are also planning to provide updates for our MUC16xCD3 and MUC16xCD28 programs in advanced ovarian cancer. Next, a bispecific for hematology oncology. For linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific for multiple myeloma, FDA acceptance of our BLA submission is expected later this month and the EMA recently accepted our MAA submission. These submissions were supported by potentially best-in-class profile in late line myeloma in terms of efficacy, safety, dosing, as well as convenience. The confirmatory Phase 3 study, as well as studies in earlier stages of myeloma and pre-malignant disease are enrolling or will soon begin enrolling patients. For odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the FDA decision for our BLA is expected by its March 31 PDUFA date and the new decision is expected in the second half of the year. In terms of additional recent news for our oncology and immunology pipeline, this week, we announced the formation of Regeneron Cell Medicines unit and that we are acquiring full development and commercialization rights for 2Seventy Bio's pipeline of investigational immune cell therapies. We have worked with 2Seventy since 2018 on many of these programs and are excited about the opportunity to continue advancing our collective efforts. After deal closing, certain 2Seventy employees will join Regeneron Cell Medicines and continue to work on addressing cancer and other serious diseases in novel ways including by combining Regeneron's antibody capabilities with CAR-T therapies. Moving from immunology and oncology to obesity and metabolic diseases. Despite all the enthusiasm surrounding GLP-1 agonist for obesity, it has been increasingly recognized that the profound weight loss is accompanied by substantial muscle loss accounting for up to as much as 40% of the weight loss. This potentially irretrievable muscle loss can be catastrophic for patients and may even lead to major public health concerns in the future. We have previously shown that our antibodies targeting myostatin in Activin A have the potential to preserve and grow muscle in human trials. Based on these data as well as additional data in obese non-human primates, we believe that inhibiting these pathways on top of GLP-1 receptor agonism has the potential to achieve comparable overall reductions in body weight, but with improved quality of weight loss resulting in more fat loss, while preserving or actually increasing muscle mass. In mid-2024, we plan to start our first clinical trial to evaluate the combination of our muscle preservation antibodies in combination with semaglutide. Also in 2024, we are anticipating proof-of-concept data for our Factor XI antibodies in the setting of prevention of venous thromboembolism after knee replacement surgery. Based on preclinical and healthy volunteer data, our antibody approach demonstrated more complete Factor XI blockade, compared to competing approaches in development for coagulation disorders and the program is on rapid path to a registrational trial starting late this year or early next year. We will now conclude with our efforts in genetic medicines. Our siRNA collaboration with Alnylam has demonstrated successful silencing of genes in the liver and for the first time for siRNA in the brain. Proof of principle was achieved for and ALN-APP last year and we are anticipating additional data from that program this year, including from patients who have received multiple doses. Based on this success, we are looking forward to new siRNA programs targeting CNS diseases entering the clinic this year such as ALN-SOD for ALS patients with SOD1 mutations. Our collaboration with Intellia on CRISPR gene editing continues to advance, where we together produced the first example of CRISPR-based gene editing of a pathological gene in human beings. This initial program for our lead indication of TTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy is now in the first in-vivo CRISPR program clear to enter Phase 3 studies in the United States. Together with Intellia, we also hope to be the first to use CRISPR technology to insert a corrective gene for deficiency disease. We recently achieved IND clearance for our CRISPR-based gene insertion programs for Factor IX and initiated the leading portion of the clinical trial to evaluate it as a potential cure for hemophilia B. Moving to genetic hearing loss, we were the first U.S.-based company to announce hearing restoration in a young child suffering from genetic hearing loss after treatment with our novel gene therapy approach. We're excited by these early results for this ultra-rare disease and look forward to advancing to the clinic additional programs to potentially address more common forms of monogenic hearing loss. These data represent validation of our viral-based gene therapy program, in this case, locally delivered to the cells of the inner ear. Beyond these efforts, we have made significant investments in leveraging our monoclonal and bispecific antibody expertise to use these agents to systematically deliver virally based genetic based payloads directly to specific tissues in the body non-amenable to local delivery, such as to muscle and the central nervous system. Based on encouraging preclinical data, we will be progressing these approaches to the clinic in the coming years. Finally, concluding with another notable first-in-class program involving a combination of an siRNA with an antibody, in this case to block the C5 complement target. Normally, one needs very high levels of infused antibody to achieve sufficient efficacy because of high target levels regarding C5, but our siRNA co-treatment dramatically lowers C5 target burden allowing lower and more convenient antibody dosing. We recently shared encouraging initial data from a Phase 3 study in patients with PNH, which supported our hypothesis that this combination approach could provide better efficacy and control of breakthrough hemolysis with more convenient dosing, and building on these data we continue to enroll our Phase 3 studies in PNH and myasthenia gravis. We are also planning to extend this combination approach to geographic atrophy and dry AMD. While this combination is expected to have manageable systemic toxicities, including elevated risk of infections, we believe that our approach has several potential advantages over recently approved complement inhibiting agents for GA, which are delivered directly into the eye and have resulted in rare but serious cases of retinal vasculitis, sometimes resulting in permanently impaired vision. In conclusion, Regeneron's R&D engine continues to grow and deliver many firsts, including differentiated early, mid, and late-stage opportunities and we're looking forward to additional progress in 2024. Before I turn the call over Marion, I would like to add my thanks and appreciation to Bob for his many years of devoted efforts and leadership, and welcoming and look forward to adding Chris Fenimore to our leadership team. With that, I will turn it over to Marion. Okay. Well, let me start with the latter first, in terms of muscle preservation. Other people have related approaches, but we're the only ones, we're the ones who discovered that there are two key ligands or growth factors that control muscle size: myostatin, myostatin 1, we call it, and myostatin 2 or ActiveNA. And we're the only ones that have specific blocking antibodies for those two. And we are testing them together and individually. And the reason why that's important is it's going to be a combination of both efficacy and safety that matters here. So we're going to see which approach does the best in terms of the muscle preservation in the face of the profound muscle loss that you can see with GLP-1 agonist treatment. But we're also going to see the safety profiles. And I think that that's going to be so critical because safety is so important here. Other people are just testing one of these agents alone. I believe, the myostatin, and others are testing very broad approaches such as trying to block the receptors for these factors. The problem with the receptor blockade approach is that the receptors that are used by these factors are also used by over a dozen other ligands that have very diverse biologic functions. And you can easily imagine that by blocking so many diverse functions, you might end up having all sorts of safety issues, which you're not going to want to be able to be dealing with in the setting of a treatment that's intended to optimize obesity and body weight loss and give benefit to the patients. So our programs are very different in that we discovered the 2 key regulators, the 2 key growth factors. We have separate antibodies blocking them both. And we're evaluating them separately and together in the setting of GLP-1 receptor agonist, to see what gives us the best benefit vis-a-vis muscle preservation as well as safety profile. While we're doing that, as we said, we're initiating those trials this year, we are also developing unimolecular solutions. So whichever approach works best, we hope to have the possibility of having a tethered GLP-1, as you put it, associated with the right set of antibody molecules. So they will have the advantage of having a unimolecular solution that can provide all-in-one benefit in terms of providing, hopefully, the best convenience profile and potentially once-a-month dosing, together with providing not only the weight loss, the profound weight loss that one is seen with GLP-1 receptor agonist, but now complemented by providing muscle preservation, but with the safest possible approach. So we think that we have the most unique program in terms of addressing all these possibilities. And we're very, very excited about these programs. Regulatory. Okay, so o first of all, we've done extensive work in preclinical models. And these antibodies have already been in humans. We believe that our studies are actually showing that this muscle is functional and certainly very important from both the metabolic and energy expenditure point of view. So, so far, those studies are very supportive of this whole approach. I should also say there's a variety of regulatory pathways that we're pursuing here. Obviously, the easiest, which would come from the possible results that we're seeing in the animal studies, is if there's incrementally more weight loss, that might suffice as a regulatory strategy. Alternatively, if it's just the quality of the white loss, then we would have to show functional outcomes in terms of strength and so forth and so on. So those are still early in the thinking. We have to see from these initial studies. But as I said, if we simply see increased weight loss, that would be the simplest way forward. And then you have more weight loss but better body composition data, and may also -- may be better metabolic benefits, which we also see in muscle, which could also provide additional pass-through approval. So it depends on those results that we're going to get from the initial studies. I should also mention, in terms of additional programs that we have, obesity. I mean, these are things that are here and now that we're doing these clinical trials and we hope to be getting results over the course of the next year, 1.5 years that could really inform in terms of all these questions that you have and really validate that there's real promise here. But remember, we're doing a lot of other things as well in obesity that are in earlier stages. So for example, as you probably know, we discovered a brand-new promising target in obesity using our Regeneron Genetics Center, the largest big data set on the planet in terms of human sequence linked to electronic health records, and identified, in some ways, one of the most exciting new targets in obesity that's been ever discovered. And we have a variety, it's called GPR75, it was published in a prominent paper in Science about a year or so ago. And we have a variety of promising and not-that-far-away approaches from the clinic in terms of blocking this target for weight loss. And I think that we presented at JPMorgan early preclinical data using siRNA approaches that look very exciting. I should also mention that, in terms of smaller programs and so forth, we have things like a very exciting leptin receptor-activating antibody that have had very promising human data as well. So there's a lot of things going on, but I think the muscle preservation program and how it goes forward is going to be very interesting to look at over the next year, 1.5 years. Okay, geographic atrophy. So basically, the excitement is that, as we show data from our combination approach, we believe that we have the most effective way of blocking the body's C5 activity. The C5, which is active in the eye, is essentially all coming from the liver. And we've shown now in our PNH studies, when we revealed the data from the first portion of our Phase III program, that it looked like we had the best-in-class activity in terms of decreasing the C5 activity. So if you block it at the source, then you don't have to block it in the eye. And if you block it at the source, then you don't suffer from all the concerns and side effects and so forth that you have from having to block it in the eye. So you block it where it's coming from, then you don't have to treat local in the eye. You can avoid the local side effects. The concern with systemic blockade is it comes with increased risks of infections and so forth. So we will have to come up with a strategy, which we're working on, to try to mitigate that in the elderly population that suffers from GA. We believe that we may need for that an approach to identify the patients who might be at risk in those settings. Because we certainly know that, for example, patients with PNH and myasthenia gravis who are immunosuppressed and so forth, not only with our agent, but certainly with this whole class of agents, can suffer from serious systemic infections when you block C5. So we are coming up with a way to mitigate that, in part by probably selecting out the patients who are at the highest risk. But in terms of efficacy, the fact that you block it at the source should make it much more effective than trying to block it indirectly in the eye, while avoiding all of the serious local side effect, you can get in the eye, including this horrific retinal vasculitis, which is associated with sudden and permanent blindness. Yes. We're excited about the existing programs. But what we're even more excited about is as we know that the history of many diseases, but cancer in particular, is about combination approaches. And thus far, even in the setting of this collaboration, the CAR T space has been separate from the biologics space. And even though we were working together as separate companies, it was a little harder to really move forward in an expedited fashion the incredible opportunities that I believe that we have to combine what we think is the largest and most exciting portfolio of biologics in immunotherapy, together with cell therapy approaches. Nobody else has really tried that. Nobody else has really led that. Now that we're really together all in with our new selected colleagues from 2seventy and their capabilities, we believe that we will now have the first opportunity to really try this new set of combination approaches against cancer. That is, combining our large portfolio of biologics in the immunotherapy space with their cell therapy capabilities and expertise, that brings a whole new level of combinations to the immunotherapy field. We believe we will be alone in that capability until somebody else tries to copy us and do what we're doing here. And that's what we're really excited about, in addition to just moving forward the existing cell therapy programs that we've been working on them for five years or more."

With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Leonard Schleifer. Len?\nLeonard Schleifer: Thanks, Ryan, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. Regeneron delivered another strong quarter marked by continued execution across the company, which drove double-digit top line growth and notable progress across our innovative R&D pipeline. Total revenues increased by 15% on a reported basis compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by Sanofi collaboration revenues and Libtayo global net product sales, which grew by 50% and 62%, respectively. Dupixent global net product sales were $3.1 billion, up 33%, reflecting strong growth across all approved indications. Non-GAAP net income per share -- diluted share increased by 4%, including an unfavorable $0.77 impact from acquired IP R&D. Today, I will briefly discuss the launch of EYLEA HD, the progress we continue to make across our pipeline, and our latest thinking on capital allocation. I will then hand the call over to George, Marion and Bob, who will provide additional commentary on our pipeline, developments, commercial execution and our financial results for the quarter. Starting with EYLEA HD, which is off to a great start. We launched in late August shortly following FDA approval, and recorded $43 million of net product sales in the final six weeks of the quarter, which compares favorably to recent launches in the retinal disease category. Importantly, revenues were driven by strong initial demand with multiple reorders by distributors before the end of the quarter. In addition, samples for EYLEA HD were made available shortly after the launch, enabling prescribers and patients to trial the product. Early EYLEA HD utilization has come from across the spectrum of wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema patients, and momentum continues to build as positive real-world clinical experiences accumulate. We have also made significant progress establishing access and reimbursement, and we will continue to work on positioning EYLEA HD, the highest dose anti-VEGF therapy approved by the FDA, as a new standard of care in these retinal diseases. Moving on to the recent progress we have made advancing our pipeline. Within hematology oncology, in our CD3 bispecific platform, the BLA for odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific in certain lymphomas, was accepted by the FDA and granted priority review, which are -- with a March 31 PDUFA data assigned. We also remain on track to submit a BLA next month for linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific for multiple myeloma, with pivotal trials now underway for both programs to support potential accelerated approvals, we are preparing for two commercial launches next year. Last week, we reported a potential breakthrough for patients with profound congenital hearing loss. The first patient enrolled in the Phase 1/2 cohort clinical trial of DB-OTO, an investigational cell selective adenovirus-associated viral gene therapy designed to provide durable physiological hearing to individuals with profound congenital hearing loss caused by mutations in the otoferlin gene, experienced hearing improvement six weeks after treatment compared to baseline. We are looking forward to continued follow-up with this patient as well as enrollment of additional patients to further validate this gene therapy approach. While otoferlin gene deficiency is an ultra-rare condition, we are hopeful that we can expand our approach to gene therapy in the year to more common genetic causes of profound hearing loss. Finally, regarding capital allocation. While we continue to prioritize internal R&D investment, given the strength of our balance sheet and anticipated future cash flows, we believe we have the flexibility to take additional actions to drive shareholder value. Beyond our ongoing share repurchase program, we continue to actively pursue emerging science and innovative platforms that complement our core R&D strengths. In addition to the Decibel acquisition, we announced last month an expanded research collaboration with Intellia combining our proprietary antibody targeted viral vector delivery technologies with Intellia's CRISPR platform to jointly explore in vivo programs outside of the liver for neurological and muscular diseases. We have always managed Regeneron with a focus on generating long-term returns, and we will continue to think carefully about how to strategically deploy our capital, with the goal of delivering breakthroughs to patients and value to shareholders. In closing, we had a strong third quarter, the EYLEA HD launch is progressing well, our pipeline is delivering important innovations, and we continue to look at ways to efficiently allocate capital. With that, let me turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Thanks, Len. I'd like to start with our recent data update for EYLEA HD. At the EU Retina Meeting last month, we presented the two-year results from the PULSAR study in wet AMD, which demonstrated that the vast majority of EYLEA HD patients randomized to 12 and 16 week dosing intervals continue to sustain vision and anatomic improvements through 96 weeks. 78% of all EYLEA HD patients were able to maintain at least every 12-week dosing intervals for the entire two-year period, with 88% assigned to at least every 12-week dosing by the end of the two-year period. Similarly, 70% of patients randomized to every 16-week dosing at baseline were able to maintain at least that interval through two years with 78% assigned to at least every 16-week dosing at week 96. Moreover, during the second year, many patients met the criteria for extension to even longer dosing intervals, with 47% meeting the criteria for at least 20-week dosing intervals, including 28% who were eligible for 24-week dosing intervals. The safety profile of EYLEA HD remain consistent with EYLEA, sustaining vision and anatomic improvements while maintaining such extended dosing intervals over two years in both wet AMD and DME is a remarkable advancement for the patients and their physicians. We believe that these results give EYLEA HD the potential to become the new standard of care for these retinal diseases. Moving to our immunology and inflammation pipeline. On Dupixent in COPD, our first pivotal study BOREAS met the primary and all two secondary endpoints in a previously unprecedented success for a biologic in a Phase 3 study in patients with uncontrolled COPD and evidence of Type 2 inflammation. Based on recent feedback from the FDA, in addition to the positive results from the BOREAS study, a positive interim analysis of the replicate Phase 3 NOTUS study would enable an sBLA submission. The independent data monitoring committee will conduct an interim analysis of the NOTUS study later this year. Itepekimab, our anti-IL-33 antibody, the Phase 3 AERIFY-1 and 2 studies remain on track for readout and potential regulatory submissions in 2025, both itepekimab and Dupixent could transform the treatment paradigm for COPD by leveraging their distinct mechanisms of actions in reducing different types of inflammation that contribute to COPD disease progression, and we look forward to the results of these studies. Moving to oncology and combination with Libtayo. We remain on target and are currently enrolling our pivotal study of Libtayo combined with our LAG-3 antibody, fianlimab, in first-line metastatic melanoma. We believe this combination may provide a significant advance for patients in this setting based on our encouraging earlier-stage studies. At the annual ESMO meeting, we presented data from the Phase 2 trial of neoadjuvant Libtayo treatment for resectable cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or CSCC, which demonstrated event-free survival for the vast majority, 89% of the patients at one year. It is also noteworthy that of the 51% of patients who had a pathological complete response, none have since experienced disease recurrence. These results add to the growing body of evidence of Libtayo and other checkpoint inhibitors may have utility in earlier stages of CSCC and other malignancies. To further explore this, we are conducting a Libtayo trial in adjuvant CSCC for patients at heightened risk. We're also evaluating the combination of the Libtayo and fianlimab in adjuvant melanoma, and plan to initiate a study of this combination in the perioperative melanoma setting as well. On to bispecifics. First in hematology oncology. We are pleased that odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific, was recently accepted for review by both the FDA and European regulatory authorities in relapsed/refractory follicular bone and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Based on the pivotal Phase 2 data from the ELM-2 study, we have initiated a robust OLYMPIA Phase 3 development program, investigating odronextamab as monotherapy as well as in combination with current standards of care in earlier lines of follicular lymphoma and DLBCL. We are looking forward to the pivotal data presentations from ELM-2 later this year. We're also on track to submit our regulatory application for linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 antibody for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma by the end of the year. This bispecific may potentially offer best-in-class efficacy and convenience. The LINKER-MM3 confirmatory Phase 3 study evaluated linvoseltamab monotherapy compared to a standard of care regimen is enrolling and studies in earlier lines of multiple myeloma and other plasma cell diseases will be enrolling soon. Finally, in addition to the ongoing Phase 1 combination study of odronextamab in our CD22xCD20 co-stimulatory bispecific, we're also on track to initiate a study of linvoseltamab with a corresponding co-stimulatory bispecific next year. Next, on to bispecifics for solid tumors, which are being investigated in combination with Libtayo and other modalities. At ESMO, we shared initial clinical data for the combination of ubamatamab, our MUC16xCD3 bispecific with Libtayo in advanced ovarian cancer. In these early data, promising durable responses were observed with ubamatamab monotherapy as well as encouraging combination activity with Libtayo with evidence of turnaround responses after initial progression on monotherapy leading in multiple patients upon addition of the Libtayo. A randomized Phase 2 expansion study is ongoing to evaluate two active monotherapy doses of ubamatamab, with the lower dose also tested in combination with Libtayo in order to optimize dosing and evaluate the potential added activity of Libtayo. In addition, we're exploring ubamatamab in multiple rare cancers that are known to express high levels of MUC16. In terms of our co-stimulatory bispecifics for solid tumors, we are currently exploring multiple different CD28 co-stimulatory bispecific antibodies in early clinical trials in a variety of tumor settings in combination with Libtayo with corresponding CD3 bispecifics. We are continuing development of our PSMAxCD28 co-stimulatory bispecific in advanced prostate cancer, focusing and identifying the window of opportunity for maintaining the remarkable antitumor activity observed with this treatment so far while minimizing serious toxicity. In order to explore this, we have expanded enrollment in the PSMAxCD28 monotherapy cohort, and we'll soon initiate cohorts in which investigators will have an option of adding a low dose of cemiplimab to the PSMAxCD28 treatment in certain patients. Moreover, we plan to initiate a trial combining PSMA/CD28 with PSMA/CD3 since, based on preclinical data CD28 costims with appropriate CD3 bispecifics may yield antitumor activity without severe immune-mediated adverse events. We also hope to progress an additional prostate specific CD3 bispecific toward the clinic in the next year, which we may also combine with our PSMA costimulatory biospecific. In terms of our MUC16xCD28 costim in combination with LIBTAYO in ovarian cancer, we are planning on presenting initial data by the end of the year. Regarding our EGFRxCD28 costim in combination LIBTAYO, we are planning on presenting updated dose escalation data in 2024. We will soon commence enrollment across eight tumor specific expansion cohorts in the study, including colorectal cancer with or without liver metastases, as well as EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer. Now, to genetic medicines. We and Intellia recently announced expansion of our research collaboration to include Regeneron\u2019s proprietary antibody target delivery technology with the goal of expanding the reach of in vivo gene editing to neurological and muscle diseases. The aim of this expanded collaboration is to address a current bottleneck in genetic medicines, the inability to deliver a genetic payload beyond the liver. Our proprietary pre-clinically validated antibody directed AAV approach will initially test two in vivo non-liver targets. Additionally, we and Intellia announced FDA clearance to start a pivotal Phase 3 trial of NTLA-2001 for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, the first time an investigational in vivo CRISPR-based gene therapy editing is clear to enter late stage clinical development in the United States. The trial is expected to initiate by year end 2023. Moving to our Alnylam collaboration. Alnylam recently presented updated interim ALN-APPI data in early onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Updated data show that single doses of ALN-APPI achieved sustained robust reduction in APP-alpha and APP-beta measured in the CSF up to 10 months after administration, as well as reduction of amyloidogenic peptides implicated in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and in cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Alnylam has also announced that a first patient has been redosed with ALN-APPI in the multi-dose portion of the study currently proceeding outside of the United States. We and Alnylam plan to initiate additional clinical programs for neurodegenerative diseases, including for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, next year. Finally, I would like to highlight DB-OTO, our otoferlin gene therapy Regeneron\u2019s first clinical program for genetic hearing loss, which we developed over the last few years in collaboration with Decibel Therapeutics, a company we recently acquired. Last week, we announced the first preliminary results from this trial. A child who received an intraocular injection of DB-OTO in one ear experienced improvements in hearing tests in that ear through week six compared to baseline, including both auditory brainstem responses as well as behavioral audiometry. We are looking forward to continuing evaluation of this innovative approach in the ongoing trial for the ultra-rare otoferlin and gene related hearing loss, as well as in other planned clinical programs which include more common forms of genetic hearing loss. In conclusion, Regeneron\u2019s R&D engine continues to grow and deliver differentiated late and early stage opportunities, and we are looking forward to progress in the remainder of this year and looking ahead to 2024. With that, I will turn it over to Marion.\nMarion McCourt: Thank you, George. I\u2019m delighted to share details of our commercial performance in the third quarter, including very encouraging early signals for EYLEA HD as well as ongoing results from our inline brands. Starting with our anti-VEGF retinal franchise. Regeneron achieved $1.49 billion in total net sales for the quarter in the U.S. We were excited to rapidly launch EYLEA HD in late August following its U.S. approval, and total net sales for the quarter were $43 million. Early launch indicators have been very positive. Physician enthusiasm was extremely high prior to EYLEA HD launch, and that interest has translated into early use in a broad range of patient types across wet AMD and diabetic eye disease. It is noteworthy that physicians are prescribing EYLEA HD in recalcitrant, switch and naive patients. We are already hearing anecdotal case reports from physicians whose recalcitrant patients are returning. Many of these patients have now been able to achieve drying that they were unable to obtain with other products. To accelerate this early launch momentum, our highly experienced team is rapidly advancing reimbursement and market access. We have confirmed paid claims from 100% of Medicare jurisdictions, and many large payers have recently published coverage policies for EYLEA HD. This includes both Medicare Advantage and commercial plans. While early, the speed of EYLEA HD coverage is significantly outpacing recent competitive launches. In addition, we continue to be on track to have a permanent J-Code by April 1, 2024, which we anticipate will drive additional uptake. These early reimbursement successes and positive physician experiences are being shared by prescribers with our team and more broadly with the retina community. These initial results bode well for the future of EYLEA HD and substantiate our belief that EYLEA HD will rapidly become the new standard of care across its approved indications. EYLEA HD\u2019s unsurpassed safety and durability demonstrated in clinical trials, coupled with prescriber confidence in EYLEA\u2019s efficacy and safety record is expected to drive continued category leadership. In summary, while the launch is still in early days, we are pleased with our progress and look forward to providing future updates. EYLEA remains the category leader with 45% anti-VEGF share for the quarter in an increasingly competitive market. With over 70 million injections worldwide since launch, EYLEA continues to demonstrate a strong and consistent safety profile, a key differentiator given retinal vasculitis and intraocular inflammation events with certain new products introduced in the retinal category. With both EYLEA HD and EYLEA, our formidable retina franchise is poured for sustained leadership. Next to Dupixent. Global net sales grew 33% year-over-year to $3.1 billion, and U.S. net sales grew 30% to $2.4 billion. This impressive third quarter performance demonstrates Dupixent\u2019s clinical and safety differentiation across all approved indications, as well as its continued growth potential. In the third quarter more than 50,000 new patients are taking Dupixent in the U.S. alone, and there are now more than 750,000 patients on Dupixent worldwide. In atopic dermatitis, Dupixent\u2019s largest indication, we continue to see more than 20% growth six years post-launch. Physicians have great confidence from the combination of efficacy, safety and ease of use across all age groups, including as young as six months. Not only is their remarkable adherence once patients begin therapy, we also see Dupixent as being the clear treatment of choice for new patients with moderate to severe disease with significant growth opportunity. In asthma, Dupixent is differentiated from all other medicines in the category based on its rapid and sustained effect on lung function, reduced exacerbations and reduced corticosteroid use. In the U.S., Dupixent continues to lead new patient prescriptions, and we are quickly approaching our goal of being the number one prescribed medicine for asthma. Together with our partner, Sanofi, Regeneron continues to advance recent launches in eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis, which are already meaningfully contributing to Dupixent\u2019s growth. Since FDA approval, approximately 20,000 new patients with eosinophilic esophagitis have been initiated, and demand is also robust for prurigo nodularis, where Dupixent is rapidly becoming the standard of care within a year of approval. We also look forward to offering Dupixent to even more patients in the future with anticipated regulatory approvals of pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis, as well as multiple near-term Phase 3 data readouts on COPD, chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid. In summary, Dupixent continues to be a key driver of our growth, and we look forward to seeing its transformational benefits extending to even more patients with type 2 inflammatory diseases across indications, demographics and geographies. And finally to LIBTAYO. Third quarter global net sales grew 59% year-over-year on a constant currency basis to $232 million, with U.S. net sales up 52% to $144 million. Global growth was driven by our non-melanoma skin indications coupled with increased utilization in both monotherapy and chemotherapy combination settings in lung cancer. We\u2019re working to expand access and use in many additional countries following recent regulatory approvals. We continue to see a growing number of prescribers choosing LIBTAYO when treating their patients. In conclusion, Regeneron\u2019s performance in the third quarter continues to deliver growth and value for patients and shareholders with opportunity for sustained growth. We\u2019re encouraged by favorable early indicators from the EYLEA HD launch and continue to deliver compelling performance from our inline brands, including EYLEA, Dupixent and LIBTAYO. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Landry: Thanks, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron\u2019s financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron performed well in the third quarter, with execution across the business continuing to drive strong top and bottom line growth. Third quarter 2023 total revenues increased 15% year-over-year to $3.4 billion, primarily driven by sales growth for Dupixent, coupled with improving margins within the Sanofi collaboration as well as continued growth from LIBTAYO. Third quarter diluted net income per share grew 4% to $11.59 on net income of $1.3 billion. This included a $100 million acquired IP R&D charge incurred in the third quarter of 2023, which decreased growth by approximately 7 percentage points. Moving to collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. Third quarter 2023 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $872 million, up 6% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $377 million, of which $350 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $1.1 billion in the third quarter, up 50% versus the prior year, which included the final $50 million sales based milestone. Our share of profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and KEVZARA was $863 million, an increase of 57% versus the third quarter of 2022, driven by Dupixent\u2019s continued volume growth and improving margins. As we guided last quarter third quarter reimbursements for the manufacturing of commercial supplies from Sanofi, a component of Sanofi collaboration revenues declined sequentially, primarily due to the ongoing phase in of a new higher yielding manufacturing process. In the fourth quarter, we expect a continuation of this trend with reimbursements for manufacturing of commercial supplies expected to be sequentially lower by approximately $40 million. Other revenues were $138 million in the third quarter of 2023, up 62% versus the prior year, and inclusive of $34 million of reimbursements from BARDA for ongoing development of our next-gen COVID antibody as per the agreement announced in August 2023. Moving now to our operating expenses. Third quarter 2023 R&D expense grew 17% year-over-year to $954 million, representing continued investment in our expanding pipeline. R&D growth was primarily driven by higher headcount and related costs in funding our advancing late stage pipeline as well as increased clinical manufacturing activity. SG&A grew 14% from the prior year to $534 million in the third quarter, reflecting higher headcount and related costs and higher contributions to an independent not-for-profit patient assistance organization. In the third quarter, we recorded acquired IP R&D of $100 million, reflecting the payment of a development milestone to our collaborator Alnylam, related to the Phase 1 ALN-APPI program in early onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This impacted both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.77. Third quarter COCM was $212 million, up 20% versus the prior year, driven by manufacturing costs associated with higher sales volumes from collaboration products, partially offset by lower Dupixent manufacturing costs. Fourth quarter COCM is expected to be the lowest quarter of the year as we continue to transition to the higher yielding manufacturing process for Dupixent. Now to cash flow and the balance sheet. Through the third quarter of 2023, Regeneron generated approximately $3 billion in free cash flow and ended the third quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $13 billion. We continue to deliver on our capital allocation priorities, buying back $507 million and $1.9 billion of our shares in the third quarter in the first nine months of 2023, respectively, with $1.8 billion remaining authorized under our existing share repurchase program. Additionally, in the third quarter, we also announced and completed the acquisition of Decibel Therapeutics for approximately $100 million to strengthen our genetics medicine portfolio. As Len mentioned, we continue to evaluate opportunities to utilize our strong financial position and build upon our core competencies with the goal of delivering long-term shareholder value. Finally, we\u2019ve made some minor changes to our full year 2023 financial guidance based on our year-to-date results and our latest outlook, updating the guidance ranges for SG&A, R&D, gross margin, COCM and capital expenditures. A complete summary of our latest full year 2023 guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. As we approach the end of 2023, I\u2019d like to provide some commentary on the preliminary outlook for 2024. We expect continued improvements in profitability from the Sanofi collaboration, which will continue to accelerate the paydown of the antibody development balance, which as of September 30, 2023 was approximately $2.5 billion. Once this balance is fully repaid in the next few years, we expect a meaningful step up in our share of Sanofi collaboration profits. Separately for PRALUENT, we expect significant category and competitive pressures to negatively impact U.S. sales in 2024. Moving to our operating expenses. Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, we continue to invest in our growing internal R&D pipeline to drive long-term growth. As you just heard from George, our pipeline continues to broaden, while our infrastructure to support that growth continues to expand. R&D investment in 2024 will be driven by advancing strategically important late stage programs such as our fianlimab and Libtayo combination confirmatory hem/onc studies, including an earlier lines of therapy, our expanding collaboration in genetic medicines, as well as higher clinical manufacturing costs, and the continued expansion of our R&D organization. With this in mind, we expect year-on-year R&D growth in 2024 to be in the mid-teens compared to our anticipated 2023 spend. We also expect to make additional investments in our commercial business and G&A functions to support the launch of EYLEA HD, our planned hem/onc launches and our international expansion. In conclusion, Regeneron continues to deliver strong results, and our robust financial position allows us to make strategic investments to drive this growth over time. With that, I will now pass the call back to Ryan.\nRyan Crowe: Thank you, Bob. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for Q&A. To ensure that we are able to address as many questions as possible. We will answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. Shannon, can we please go to the first question?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thank you for giving me the question, and congrats on all the progress. So you have over $15 billion of cash and marketable securities on your balance sheet. Maybe, Bob, you could talk about how you think about capital allocation? I know interest rates are high, but how else can you spend that money to drive even higher returns for Regeneron shareholders?\nBob Landry: Yes. Thanks, Evan. I mean, I know having dealt with you and certainly many of our investors, this is certainly an issue that we\u2019ve been tasked to solve. Now obviously interest rates are a lot higher. So obviously what we\u2019re returning on that is certainly much better than the kind of days of 2020 and 2021. But we kind of stick to our knitting here with regards to our capital allocations. I mean George just went through a plethora of obviously pipeline progress that we\u2019re making. Again, first and foremost, we\u2019re going to make sure that is fully funded to the extent possible on that. And then with regards to acquisitions, you heard with Len\u2019s intro, I mean, we continue to look at a lot of opportunities. Certainly, the market that is out there on the biotech space is not in the greatest shape, as you know. So again, we think there are opportunities out there, but just because we have the means doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re going to kind of push into something that may not give us an optimal result. It may not be kind of we like franchises, as you\u2019ve heard me say that before. So we need to make sure that it\u2019s the right fit with George and the team with regards to that. So we\u2019ll continue to do that. And you\u2019ve seen our share repurchases of which we\u2019re $1.9 billion through nine months. We\u2019ve done that at a very good price with regards to how we\u2019re buying that back. We\u2019re very kind of scientific in our approach on that. We do think that the stock continues to be undervalued given all the pipeline progress and the catalyst that we have. So we\u2019re going to continue to push that button going forward. So we\u2019re going to stick to our knitting. But again, as Len kind of alluded to, we are looking at a lot of opportunities that are out there. And if the right one makes the necessary fit, then we\u2019ll move forward. And again, you kind of saw that with Checkmate and Decibel, albeit those were smaller, but again, those were nice kind of franchise fits into the business.\nRyan Crowe: Next question, please, Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thank you for taking my question. And congrats on all the progress. My question is regarding the ulcerative colitis trial you are doing with Dupixent. Could you talk a little bit about the rationale behind that? And are you enriching this trial in any way on the basis of eosinophil counts or any other marker there? Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. So as you sort of hinted at, what we have realized is that all of the diseases that we are treating with Dupixent really are interrelated diseases that reflect a systemic disorder that is upregulation of so called Type 2 inflammation. And in some cases it manifests in the lungs, in some cases in the skin, in some cases in the gut, and so forth all over the body, and in many cases in most patients, actually in more than one location. And so in every disease that we\u2019re going after, including now, as you mentioned, in ulcerative colitis, we believe that there are a subset of patients who may be marked with Type 2 inflammation in their gut. We are, as you say, indicating, utilizing biomarkers that might select out these patients. And so we\u2019re going to see whether a subset of ulcerative colitis patients are driven by this Type 2 inflammation that\u2019s driving all the other related manifestations of this systemic disorder.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks, George. Let\u2019s move to the next question, please, Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nChris Raymond: Yes, thank you. Just maybe Dupixent in [ph] COPD, I think the last time we talked to you guys on this, you were talking about the risk reward on taking an interim look on notice, just given the alpha hit. Looks like you\u2019ve decided to take that step here. But can you give us a sense of the alpha hit [ph] you are taking by doing this interim look? Just looking at BOREAS, with the 30% reduction in exacerbations, it would seem you\u2019d have a decent amount of room here if notice is tracking similarly. But if you can give us any more color on how you\u2019re thinking about this risk reward of this decision and assume you\u2019re going to press release that result of that if it\u2019s going to be the end of the year? Thanks.\nLeonard Schleifer: Yes. We\u2019re not going to get into the details of the statistical niceties on how you do this. An alpha sparing approach is what\u2019s typical for an interim analysis. We\u2019ll work closely with Sanofi on how to do this in the most efficient manner possible and get to the information as appropriate when it appears.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks, Len. Next question, please, Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow of UBS. Your line is now open.\nColin Bristow: Good morning and congrats on the quarter. Not surprisingly, we\u2019ve been getting an increasing number of questions on your obesity assets. And I was wondering if you could just talk to your strategy and level of enthusiasm here and maybe frame out some of the timelines, GPR75 [ph], the leptin receptor antagonist. I think you shared some pretty provocative data at ADA on the myostatin blocker and the Activin A blocker. Maybe you could just tell us your level enthusiasm is this something that you\u2019re going to go full force and plan to have a major presence in down the road? Just some color there would be helpful. Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. As you said, we\u2019re very excited about, I guess, two of the approaches that we\u2019ve been taking in obesity. One is our unique collection of targets that we\u2019ve either been the first to discover, like the GPR75 genetically identified target that came from our Regeneron Genetics Center, which is a very exciting new target for obesity, as well as our new approaches such as our leptin receptor agonistic antibody. But one thing we\u2019re doing is moving those programs forward and understanding exactly what their potential is in the field of obesity. But as you said, right now, the field which is dominated by these GLP-1 agonists also is recognizing increasing problems with this type of weight loss, meaning that about 40% of the weight loss is due to muscle loss. That means if you lose 20 pounds, eight pounds of that approximately on average, will be muscle. Most patients will never get that muscle back. This can, over time, especially if patients go off these drugs and regain the weight as fat can create potentially a very large public health problem and dilemma. So we also have been, as you pointed out, very active in the field of muscle preservation and muscle growth agents. We\u2019ve developed some, I think, some of the most exciting candidates in the field that have the ability to do this. And we are certainly considering how to study these muscle preservation and muscle growth agents in combination with existing weight loss agents to see whether we can maintain or even grow muscle in the setting of weight loss. Hopefully, perhaps increasing the quality of the weight loss, maybe even resulting in greater weight loss. But most importantly, making sure that the patients, in terms of their muscle and so forth, do a lot better. And we will be talking about our clinical trials in this area, we hope, very shortly.\nRyan Crowe: Okay. Thanks, George. Next question, please, Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren of TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nTyler Van Buren: Great. Thanks guys. And congrats on the tremendous quarterly results. It\u2019s great to see the early EYLEA HD sales, of course, and you mentioned that naive and switch patients are being treated. But are you seeing switches from VABYSMO specifically, and to what extent are you guys sending samples out as we think about assessing additional demand beyond sales?\nMarion McCourt: Thanks, Tyler. So let me address the first part and the positive anecdotal case reports we\u2019re getting back really carry across the theme of better vision, better drying than they\u2019ve seen with other anti-VEGF products. They also comment on very frequently the tremendous confidence that they have in the safety of EYLEA and the experience over many, many years. In terms of the switches, it\u2019s early days. We are seeing switches from EYLEA, as you would expect, and of course, we\u2019re the category leaders. So there are more potential patients to consider as well. But we are also hearing switches from faricimab. We\u2019re hearing also switches from Avastin and other products in the category. And the early reports have been quite encouraging. To your other part of your question related to sampling. We do have a sampling program for EYLEA HD. It\u2019s intended to give physicians experience with EYLEA HD in an appropriate way. The program is constructed on an on demand basis. We don\u2019t disclose the number of samples or things of that sort. And certainly that\u2019s not what you were asking. But I can share with you that we have seen a high conversion rate from practices ordering EYLEA HD samples and then subsequently placing orders of commercial product through commercial channels.\nRyan Crowe: Thank you, Marion. Next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you. This is [indiscernible] on for Terence Flynn. Thank you for taking our question. Quick one from us. Could you provide an update on the timing or relative implications of the biosimilar EYLEA litigation with Mylan? Thank you.\nLeonard Schleifer: Yes. So we had a trial in West Virginia, a bench trial, and we are waiting for a decision from the Judge. It\u2019s out of our control, and as soon as it comes, it\u2019ll come. It\u2019s been several months. So it could come soon or not. It\u2019s one of those things where it\u2019s really beyond our ability to predict and control.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks, Len. Next question, Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nCarter Gould: Great. Good morning and congrats on all the progress. Maybe a follow up for Marion. Thanks for all the color on the commercial dynamics for high dose EYLEA. One thing you didn\u2019t touch on as much, though, is sort of how maybe some of the step edit language has evolved. Is that sort of tracking in line with what you were seeing with standard dose EYLEA or any broader commentary on how that\u2019s tracking relative to your expectations? Thank you.\nMarion McCourt: Sure. So, as a quick reminder, as we get into payer mix, I\u2019ll remind everybody that these are approximates based on typical patterns in the category. It\u2019s a little bit different when you look at a product that just launched, but about 45% of our overall business is in Medicare fee for service. And as I mentioned to you in the call today, we\u2019ve made great progress there, not only in coverage, which is the first step to get coverage, but then taking the extra step to make sure that claims are being paid. So we\u2019re seeing now that 100% of Medicare fee for service jurisdictions have coverage and demonstrated paid claims. When we go over to Medicare Advantage, which is roughly about 25% of anti-VEGF category business, and commercial, which is about 20, what we\u2019re seeing so far. And we are making good progress with payers. We\u2019re seeing that EYLEA HD is being positioned consistently with EYLEA and other brands in the category. And there are plans, as you know, that have a step edit or utilization management. The good news is that EYLEA HD is being positioned consistently with EYLEA and other brands. We don\u2019t see a differentiation there. \nRyan Crowe: Okay, Marion. Thank you. Next question, Shannon, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities. Your line is now open.\nRobyn Karnauskas: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. Question on CSU. I know it\u2019s a big opportunity. Many patients are not controlled well with antihistamines, and you have a CRL. Is Study C sufficient anything in particular you think the FDA is looking for? Is there a disconnect or they\u2019re changing what they view for the bar for approval? What\u2019s your thoughts there? Thanks.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. Well, as you know, we had one very positive study. We had a second study that actually had a P of 0.049, but for various statistical purposes, just missed meeting its predetermined statistical hurdle. But it\u2019s certainly all the indicators were going in the right direction. And what the FDA indicated that they wanted to see the results of our ongoing Study C, as we call it, to make their decision. And so what we\u2019re hoping is that that study, which is in the same population of the very positive initial study, remember the second study was in these recalcitrant patients who had failed [indiscernible], among other therapies. But Study C is in the same population as our very first Study A, the very positive study. And we're hoping that if we get consistent data in that study, that the FDA will consider and look favorably upon it.\nRyan Crowe: Okay. Thanks George. Next question Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nSalveen Richter: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. With regard to your cancer portfolio, as we look to additional data coming out at ASH and the proof of concept we've seen so far, but combination data that we're looking to with Libtayo. Can you just talk to us about the optimization still required here and how you're thinking about positioning it in the context of emerging targets and competitive dynamics? Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. We have a very large collection of combination opportunities that we're very excited about. The first one that we hope has a chance of really crossing the finish line in a very significant way, in a very seen population, is our combination of Libtayo in combination with fianlimab, putting together these two checkpoints, the anti-PD-1 and the anti-LAG-3. And I think in this case, we believe we have evidence that we have the best-in-class type of activity with both agents separately. And as you've hopefully seen in our earlier stage clinical trials, the data suggests that when we put them together, we really can make a remarkable advance for patients in terms of the number of patients who respond and the extent of their progression-free survival. And we're now, as we announced in a pivotal trial where we hope that we will in the \u2013 within the next year, perhaps be able to provide the results from that trial, which might confirm this remarkable advance for patients. If it works in this first-line melanoma setting, it really opens up the door to a whole series of other opportunities both in related melanoma settings, such as an even earlier stage melanoma setting such as the adjuvant and perioperative settings, but we could be moving to other cancers as well with that proof of principle. So that's the nearest term Libtayo checkpoint combination approach. As you know, with our bispecifics, the combination opportunities there are also very exciting, either with Libtayo or with each other. And we have, in that space shown that our individual agents, the important thing is we have now validated so many of our individual agents as having once again the potential for best-in-class type of activity, whether it's our agent for myeloma or our CD20 bispecific in, for example, follicular lymphoma and so forth and so on. But we're also excited about our costim bispecifics. We've released the data about the incredible efficacy in, at early stages that we see in combination with Libtayo. But that one \u2013 that one is countered by concerns with immune-mediated adverse events that we're seeing in these patients. It is hard to dramatically increase the extent of immunotherapy benefit without having it associated with increased autoimmune type reactions. We're working very hard on that, and we think, based on preclinical data that the trick may be combining our costims with our CD3 bispecifics where we don't see these dramatic potential increases in the mechanisms that may lead to immune adverse events. So in summary, our checkpoint combinations are very near-term. Our bispecifics are single agents have been validated and hopefully will be being considered by the FDA for approval in the relatively near future. And the combinations are beginning to demonstrate exciting opportunity, and we're trying to tune that in order to try to present the best efficacy safety profile for patients.\nRyan Crowe: Alright. Thank you, George. Shannon, please the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nBrian Abrahams: Hey, guys. Congrats on the good launch so far. And thanks for taking my question. You mentioned in the press release some impact of price on EYLEA. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on this, when you think this might stabilize; any extent that this might affect high-dose EYLEA as well? Thanks.\nMarion McCourt: Sure, Brian. So I would comment that in an increasingly competitive category, there of course, there's been some pressure on EYLEA. I'd also reflect that in 12 years in the market, it's really modest rebating and discounting if you look at the history of the brand. And of course, that on a brand that has never taken a price increase. But we will continue to be very much watching uptake of EYLEA HD, taking very responsible and appropriate and thoughtful measures on pricing. And certainly, as I reported to early days, we're making some very strong progress in the marketplace in terms of making sure that physicians gain confidence in reimbursement of EYLEA HD as they initiate patients.\nRyan Crowe: Okay. Thanks Marion. Please the next question, Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Yatin Suneja with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.\nYatin Suneja: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Question on Dupixent. Could you maybe share your views on the newer mechanism? For example, OX40 or perhaps a longer-acting version of Dupixent on the franchise; maybe if you can talk about your efforts in terms of life cycle management of Dupixent? Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. Maybe getting back to some of the comments that I made before. The collection of so-called allergic or Type 2 conditions, which Dupixent addresses, are all characterized by a systemic inflammatory problem increase in the so-called Type 2 inflammation, which if you look at the science and literature is really of this digital pathway that largely evolved and was one of the most active parts of the immune system to fight things like fecal parasites, which are really not an issue now in the developed world. This part of the immune system should essentially in the modern world be entirely quiescent. It serves almost no role. The problem is it becomes unleashed abnormally to do things that it shouldn't be doing, like fighting allergens or attacking the skin or the gut in atopic dermatitis or eosinophilic esophagitis. What Dupixent does uniquely is that it controls, and the data now demonstrate this, the incredible effect that it puts this useless angry tiger back in the cage where it belongs. And that is why it has this incredible profile of not only efficacy but safety. Because what's shutting down is it's shutting down a pathway that should be vestigial in the modern world that becomes unleashed and attacks all different parts of the body. We believe that any of this current competition that's ongoing doesn't share these remarkable features that give Dupixent its incredible broad efficacy across the spectrum of diseases with its unique safety profile. Because all of these other approaches, including, for example, the OX40 approach and so forth, are addressing different fundamental immune pathways that are important in the immune system's function to do a lot of actual useful things in the modern world, like, for example, fighting viral infections in cancer and so forth. So Dupixent really has a very unique profile, which if we can help explain and if all physicians and patients can understand it, make it the perfect drug for this condition. It uniquely blocks this digital pathway that gets out of control and appropriately and causes disease all over the body. Dupixent shuts down this what should be a vestigial pathway, and it helps disease, whether in the same patients, it could be manifesting in the skin in the lungs, in the nodes, in the gut and so forth, it shuts it down without really untoward effects with regards to the ability of the body to actually fight infections and so forth. In fact, if you look at our clinical studies and some of the data that we published, in many, if not most cases, you actually see unbelievably reduced infections in the setting of the Dupixent treatment. Because what you're doing is you're putting the bad part of the immune system back under control and you're allowing the rest of immune system to do its function. All of these other approaches are trying to attack critical parts of the immune system that have important other functions, and they don't address the widespread problem that occurs systemically and causes all of these diseases. So as you've seen already with various agents, they may work in one of Dupixent indications, but they don't work, they failed in other indications. And if they work, they also often come with the concerns about safety because they're designed to be immunosuppressive, which Dupixent is not.\nLeonard Schleifer: So just to add a small point to what George's eloquent explanation of why Dupixent is such a special drug and the prediction that it would be safe because it's attacking this vestigial part of the immune system, you're looking at somewhere in the neighborhood of three-quarters of million people on the drug, many more than that so that have demonstrated the safety that is predicted by the science.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Including in children, as we know, as young as six months is approved there where it's been demonstrating not only incredible safety but incredible efficacy.\nRyan Crowe: Great points. Thank you. Shannon, I think we have time for two more questions, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nDane Leone: Thanks for taking the questions, and congratulations on a strong quarter. Just actually really two quick ones for me. First one being, can you just comment whether you saw any impact from increased utilization of biosimilar ranibizumab during the quarter on EYLEA sales. A number of high-volume clinics had highlighted favorable margin opportunities from using more biosimilar ranibizumab, which seems to be potentially a transient impact and use of some of the brands, but it would be interested in your commentary there. And then we've gotten just a lot of inbounds in terms of ongoing patent litigation of EYLEA. Could you just maybe state for us what your current expectation is for EYLEA patent life? And just any thoughts you have on how the ruling that we're awaiting could actually impact your base case? Thank you.\nLeonard Schleifer: Yes. So I'll cover the patents and then Marion can cover any additional insight into the marketplace. On the patents, we're involved in litigation. There's a couple of key patents that have evolved in this case that both relate to formulation as well as dosing. On the base case is that, for us, assuming that the exclusivity will expire in May, but we will see what happens in the litigation, which could be an upside, obviously, for the franchise.\nMarion McCourt: All right. And on the ranibizumab impact, it's relatively early in their launches, and \u2013 but there hasn't been a notable impact to the category. The Lucentis biosimilar shares in the low single-digit area in the third quarter, and certainly the impact has been seen more relative to Lucentis, which has declining share. But certainly, this is not extended to EYLEA HD.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks Marion. We'll just take our last question, please, Shannon.\nOperator: Our last question is from the line of Brian Skorney with Baird. Your line is now open.\nBrian Skorney: Hey, thanks for taking my question. It looks like J&J had a really good first quarter of their myeloma bispecific. So it definitely seems like there's a good demand there. But also an element of them having control of a lot of offerings for myeloma. So obviously, [indiscernible] would always dominate each in oncology, but with the initial launch of your bispecific next year. I'm just wondering what your strategy is for competing in the initial late line as a third to market? Do you think that there is differentiated enough data here to kind of take share? Or is the focus really on generating data in earlier line of combos to kind of move up market share? Thanks.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Well, of course, it's both. We do believe that data rules, the best, both efficacy, safety profile, but also convenience profile. And we will be continuing to show our evolving and maturing data, which we believe could result in best-in-class in terms of efficacy, in terms of response rates and complete response rates in terms of safety, in terms of the frequency of Cytokine Release Syndrome and so forth, and in terms of differentiation in terms of mandated hospitalization. So we will be continuing to present our data. Of course, we'll see exactly ultimately what gets in the label and what the FDA supports but there's the potential here for best-in-class differentiation in terms of efficacy, safety and convenience and schedule. And of course, as you said we're also moving with, we think, an exciting program in earlier lines of therapy. And all of this is also going to be combined with the opportunities for our future combinations. We have a variety of costim bispecifics that we're excited about combining specifically with this agent in the Plasma Cell Dyscrasias setting. So we think it's a very exciting opportunity. As you said, unfortunately there's a large opportunity out there because there's a lot of patients that are still in need. I think that if you have the best agent for late-stage patients. A lot of people want to use it. And then if we figure out the best program to demonstrate how it can be utilized in earlier-stage patients that can certainly enhance that opportunity let alone if we come up with one of our magic combos that really takes it to the whole next level.\nRyan Crowe: Okay. Thanks George, and thanks to everyone who dialed in today and for your interest in Regeneron. We apologize to those remaining in the queue that we do not have a chance to hear from. But as always, the Investor Relations team here is available to answer any remaining questions you may have. Thank you once again, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Marion McCourt",
            "content": "Thank you, George. I'm delighted to share details of our commercial performance in the third quarter, including very encouraging early signals for EYLEA HD as well as ongoing results from our inline brands. Starting with our anti-VEGF retinal franchise. Regeneron achieved $1.49 billion in total net sales for the quarter in the U.S. We were excited to rapidly launch EYLEA HD in late August following its U.S. approval, and total net sales for the quarter were $43 million. Early launch indicators have been very positive. Physician enthusiasm was extremely high prior to EYLEA HD launch, and that interest has translated into early use in a broad range of patient types across wet AMD and diabetic eye disease. It is noteworthy that physicians are prescribing EYLEA HD in recalcitrant, switch and naive patients. We are already hearing anecdotal case reports from physicians whose recalcitrant patients are returning. Many of these patients have now been able to achieve drying that they were unable to obtain with other products. To accelerate this early launch momentum, our highly experienced team is rapidly advancing reimbursement and market access. We have confirmed paid claims from 100% of Medicare jurisdictions, and many large payers have recently published coverage policies for EYLEA HD. This includes both Medicare Advantage and commercial plans. While early, the speed of EYLEA HD coverage is significantly outpacing recent competitive launches. In addition, we continue to be on track to have a permanent J-Code by April 1, 2024, which we anticipate will drive additional uptake. These early reimbursement successes and positive physician experiences are being shared by prescribers with our team and more broadly with the retina community. These initial results bode well for the future of EYLEA HD and substantiate our belief that EYLEA HD will rapidly become the new standard of care across its approved indications. EYLEA HD's unsurpassed safety and durability demonstrated in clinical trials, coupled with prescriber confidence in EYLEA's efficacy and safety record is expected to drive continued category leadership. In summary, while the launch is still in early days, we are pleased with our progress and look forward to providing future updates. EYLEA remains the category leader with 45% anti-VEGF share for the quarter in an increasingly competitive market. With over 70 million injections worldwide since launch, EYLEA continues to demonstrate a strong and consistent safety profile, a key differentiator given retinal vasculitis and intraocular inflammation events with certain new products introduced in the retinal category. With both EYLEA HD and EYLEA, our formidable retina franchise is poured for sustained leadership. Next to Dupixent. Global net sales grew 33% year-over-year to $3.1 billion, and U.S. net sales grew 30% to $2.4 billion. This impressive third quarter performance demonstrates Dupixent's clinical and safety differentiation across all approved indications, as well as its continued growth potential. In the third quarter more than 50,000 new patients are taking Dupixent in the U.S. alone, and there are now more than 750,000 patients on Dupixent worldwide. In atopic dermatitis, Dupixent's largest indication, we continue to see more than 20% growth six years post-launch. Physicians have great confidence from the combination of efficacy, safety and ease of use across all age groups, including as young as six months. Not only is their remarkable adherence once patients begin therapy, we also see Dupixent as being the clear treatment of choice for new patients with moderate to severe disease with significant growth opportunity. In asthma, Dupixent is differentiated from all other medicines in the category based on its rapid and sustained effect on lung function, reduced exacerbations and reduced corticosteroid use. In the U.S., Dupixent continues to lead new patient prescriptions, and we are quickly approaching our goal of being the number one prescribed medicine for asthma. Together with our partner, Sanofi, Regeneron continues to advance recent launches in eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis, which are already meaningfully contributing to Dupixent's growth. Since FDA approval, approximately 20,000 new patients with eosinophilic esophagitis have been initiated, and demand is also robust for prurigo nodularis, where Dupixent is rapidly becoming the standard of care within a year of approval. We also look forward to offering Dupixent to even more patients in the future with anticipated regulatory approvals of pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis, as well as multiple near-term Phase 3 data readouts on COPD, chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid. In summary, Dupixent continues to be a key driver of our growth, and we look forward to seeing its transformational benefits extending to even more patients with type 2 inflammatory diseases across indications, demographics and geographies. And finally to LIBTAYO. Third quarter global net sales grew 59% year-over-year on a constant currency basis to $232 million, with U.S. net sales up 52% to $144 million. Global growth was driven by our non-melanoma skin indications coupled with increased utilization in both monotherapy and chemotherapy combination settings in lung cancer. We're working to expand access and use in many additional countries following recent regulatory approvals. We continue to see a growing number of prescribers choosing LIBTAYO when treating their patients. In conclusion, Regeneron's performance in the third quarter continues to deliver growth and value for patients and shareholders with opportunity for sustained growth. We're encouraged by favorable early indicators from the EYLEA HD launch and continue to deliver compelling performance from our inline brands, including EYLEA, Dupixent and LIBTAYO. Now I'll turn the call over to Bob. Thanks, Tyler. So let me address the first part and the positive anecdotal case reports we're getting back really carry across the theme of better vision, better drying than they've seen with other anti-VEGF products. They also comment on very frequently the tremendous confidence that they have in the safety of EYLEA and the experience over many, many years. In terms of the switches, it's early days. We are seeing switches from EYLEA, as you would expect, and of course, we're the category leaders. So there are more potential patients to consider as well. But we are also hearing switches from faricimab. We're hearing also switches from Avastin and other products in the category. And the early reports have been quite encouraging. To your other part of your question related to sampling. We do have a sampling program for EYLEA HD. It's intended to give physicians experience with EYLEA HD in an appropriate way. The program is constructed on an on demand basis. We don't disclose the number of samples or things of that sort. And certainly that's not what you were asking. But I can share with you that we have seen a high conversion rate from practices ordering EYLEA HD samples and then subsequently placing orders of commercial product through commercial channels. Sure. So, as a quick reminder, as we get into payer mix, I'll remind everybody that these are approximates based on typical patterns in the category. It's a little bit different when you look at a product that just launched, but about 45% of our overall business is in Medicare fee for service. And as I mentioned to you in the call today, we've made great progress there, not only in coverage, which is the first step to get coverage, but then taking the extra step to make sure that claims are being paid. So we're seeing now that 100% of Medicare fee for service jurisdictions have coverage and demonstrated paid claims. When we go over to Medicare Advantage, which is roughly about 25% of anti-VEGF category business, and commercial, which is about 20, what we're seeing so far. And we are making good progress with payers. We're seeing that EYLEA HD is being positioned consistently with EYLEA and other brands in the category. And there are plans, as you know, that have a step edit or utilization management. The good news is that EYLEA HD is being positioned consistently with EYLEA and other brands. We don't see a differentiation there. Sure, Brian. So I would comment that in an increasingly competitive category, there of course, there's been some pressure on EYLEA. I'd also reflect that in 12 years in the market, it's really modest rebating and discounting if you look at the history of the brand. And of course, that on a brand that has never taken a price increase. But we will continue to be very much watching uptake of EYLEA HD, taking very responsible and appropriate and thoughtful measures on pricing. And certainly, as I reported to early days, we're making some very strong progress in the marketplace in terms of making sure that physicians gain confidence in reimbursement of EYLEA HD as they initiate patients. All right. And on the ranibizumab impact, it's relatively early in their launches, and \u2013 but there hasn't been a notable impact to the category. The Lucentis biosimilar shares in the low single-digit area in the third quarter, and certainly the impact has been seen more relative to Lucentis, which has declining share. But certainly, this is not extended to EYLEA HD."

            "content": "Thanks, Ryan, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. Regeneron delivered another strong quarter marked by continued execution across the company, which drove double-digit top line growth and notable progress across our innovative R&D pipeline. Total revenues increased by 15% on a reported basis compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by Sanofi collaboration revenues and Libtayo global net product sales, which grew by 50% and 62%, respectively. Dupixent global net product sales were $3.1 billion, up 33%, reflecting strong growth across all approved indications. Non-GAAP net income per share -- diluted share increased by 4%, including an unfavorable $0.77 impact from acquired IP R&D. Today, I will briefly discuss the launch of EYLEA HD, the progress we continue to make across our pipeline, and our latest thinking on capital allocation. I will then hand the call over to George, Marion and Bob, who will provide additional commentary on our pipeline, developments, commercial execution and our financial results for the quarter. Starting with EYLEA HD, which is off to a great start. We launched in late August shortly following FDA approval, and recorded $43 million of net product sales in the final six weeks of the quarter, which compares favorably to recent launches in the retinal disease category. Importantly, revenues were driven by strong initial demand with multiple reorders by distributors before the end of the quarter. In addition, samples for EYLEA HD were made available shortly after the launch, enabling prescribers and patients to trial the product. Early EYLEA HD utilization has come from across the spectrum of wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema patients, and momentum continues to build as positive real-world clinical experiences accumulate. We have also made significant progress establishing access and reimbursement, and we will continue to work on positioning EYLEA HD, the highest dose anti-VEGF therapy approved by the FDA, as a new standard of care in these retinal diseases. Moving on to the recent progress we have made advancing our pipeline. Within hematology oncology, in our CD3 bispecific platform, the BLA for odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific in certain lymphomas, was accepted by the FDA and granted priority review, which are -- with a March 31 PDUFA data assigned. We also remain on track to submit a BLA next month for linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific for multiple myeloma, with pivotal trials now underway for both programs to support potential accelerated approvals, we are preparing for two commercial launches next year. Last week, we reported a potential breakthrough for patients with profound congenital hearing loss. The first patient enrolled in the Phase 1/2 cohort clinical trial of DB-OTO, an investigational cell selective adenovirus-associated viral gene therapy designed to provide durable physiological hearing to individuals with profound congenital hearing loss caused by mutations in the otoferlin gene, experienced hearing improvement six weeks after treatment compared to baseline. We are looking forward to continued follow-up with this patient as well as enrollment of additional patients to further validate this gene therapy approach. While otoferlin gene deficiency is an ultra-rare condition, we are hopeful that we can expand our approach to gene therapy in the year to more common genetic causes of profound hearing loss. Finally, regarding capital allocation. While we continue to prioritize internal R&D investment, given the strength of our balance sheet and anticipated future cash flows, we believe we have the flexibility to take additional actions to drive shareholder value. Beyond our ongoing share repurchase program, we continue to actively pursue emerging science and innovative platforms that complement our core R&D strengths. In addition to the Decibel acquisition, we announced last month an expanded research collaboration with Intellia combining our proprietary antibody targeted viral vector delivery technologies with Intellia's CRISPR platform to jointly explore in vivo programs outside of the liver for neurological and muscular diseases. We have always managed Regeneron with a focus on generating long-term returns, and we will continue to think carefully about how to strategically deploy our capital, with the goal of delivering breakthroughs to patients and value to shareholders. In closing, we had a strong third quarter, the EYLEA HD launch is progressing well, our pipeline is delivering important innovations, and we continue to look at ways to efficiently allocate capital. With that, let me turn the call over to George. Yes. We're not going to get into the details of the statistical niceties on how you do this. An alpha sparing approach is what's typical for an interim analysis. We'll work closely with Sanofi on how to do this in the most efficient manner possible and get to the information as appropriate when it appears. Yes. So we had a trial in West Virginia, a bench trial, and we are waiting for a decision from the Judge. It's out of our control, and as soon as it comes, it'll come. It's been several months. So it could come soon or not. It's one of those things where it's really beyond our ability to predict and control. So just to add a small point to what George's eloquent explanation of why Dupixent is such a special drug and the prediction that it would be safe because it's attacking this vestigial part of the immune system, you're looking at somewhere in the neighborhood of three-quarters of million people on the drug, many more than that so that have demonstrated the safety that is predicted by the science. Yes. So I'll cover the patents and then Marion can cover any additional insight into the marketplace. On the patents, we're involved in litigation. There's a couple of key patents that have evolved in this case that both relate to formulation as well as dosing. On the base case is that, for us, assuming that the exclusivity will expire in May, but we will see what happens in the litigation, which could be an upside, obviously, for the franchise."

            "name": "Bob Landry",
            "content": "Thanks, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron performed well in the third quarter, with execution across the business continuing to drive strong top and bottom line growth. Third quarter 2023 total revenues increased 15% year-over-year to $3.4 billion, primarily driven by sales growth for Dupixent, coupled with improving margins within the Sanofi collaboration as well as continued growth from LIBTAYO. Third quarter diluted net income per share grew 4% to $11.59 on net income of $1.3 billion. This included a $100 million acquired IP R&D charge incurred in the third quarter of 2023, which decreased growth by approximately 7 percentage points. Moving to collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. Third quarter 2023 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $872 million, up 6% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $377 million, of which $350 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $1.1 billion in the third quarter, up 50% versus the prior year, which included the final $50 million sales based milestone. Our share of profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and KEVZARA was $863 million, an increase of 57% versus the third quarter of 2022, driven by Dupixent's continued volume growth and improving margins. As we guided last quarter third quarter reimbursements for the manufacturing of commercial supplies from Sanofi, a component of Sanofi collaboration revenues declined sequentially, primarily due to the ongoing phase in of a new higher yielding manufacturing process. In the fourth quarter, we expect a continuation of this trend with reimbursements for manufacturing of commercial supplies expected to be sequentially lower by approximately $40 million. Other revenues were $138 million in the third quarter of 2023, up 62% versus the prior year, and inclusive of $34 million of reimbursements from BARDA for ongoing development of our next-gen COVID antibody as per the agreement announced in August 2023. Moving now to our operating expenses. Third quarter 2023 R&D expense grew 17% year-over-year to $954 million, representing continued investment in our expanding pipeline. R&D growth was primarily driven by higher headcount and related costs in funding our advancing late stage pipeline as well as increased clinical manufacturing activity. SG&A grew 14% from the prior year to $534 million in the third quarter, reflecting higher headcount and related costs and higher contributions to an independent not-for-profit patient assistance organization. In the third quarter, we recorded acquired IP R&D of $100 million, reflecting the payment of a development milestone to our collaborator Alnylam, related to the Phase 1 ALN-APPI program in early onset Alzheimer's disease. This impacted both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.77. Third quarter COCM was $212 million, up 20% versus the prior year, driven by manufacturing costs associated with higher sales volumes from collaboration products, partially offset by lower Dupixent manufacturing costs. Fourth quarter COCM is expected to be the lowest quarter of the year as we continue to transition to the higher yielding manufacturing process for Dupixent. Now to cash flow and the balance sheet. Through the third quarter of 2023, Regeneron generated approximately $3 billion in free cash flow and ended the third quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $13 billion. We continue to deliver on our capital allocation priorities, buying back $507 million and $1.9 billion of our shares in the third quarter in the first nine months of 2023, respectively, with $1.8 billion remaining authorized under our existing share repurchase program. Additionally, in the third quarter, we also announced and completed the acquisition of Decibel Therapeutics for approximately $100 million to strengthen our genetics medicine portfolio. As Len mentioned, we continue to evaluate opportunities to utilize our strong financial position and build upon our core competencies with the goal of delivering long-term shareholder value. Finally, we've made some minor changes to our full year 2023 financial guidance based on our year-to-date results and our latest outlook, updating the guidance ranges for SG&A, R&D, gross margin, COCM and capital expenditures. A complete summary of our latest full year 2023 guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. As we approach the end of 2023, I'd like to provide some commentary on the preliminary outlook for 2024. We expect continued improvements in profitability from the Sanofi collaboration, which will continue to accelerate the paydown of the antibody development balance, which as of September 30, 2023 was approximately $2.5 billion. Once this balance is fully repaid in the next few years, we expect a meaningful step up in our share of Sanofi collaboration profits. Separately for PRALUENT, we expect significant category and competitive pressures to negatively impact U.S. sales in 2024. Moving to our operating expenses. Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, we continue to invest in our growing internal R&D pipeline to drive long-term growth. As you just heard from George, our pipeline continues to broaden, while our infrastructure to support that growth continues to expand. R&D investment in 2024 will be driven by advancing strategically important late stage programs such as our fianlimab and Libtayo combination confirmatory hem/onc studies, including an earlier lines of therapy, our expanding collaboration in genetic medicines, as well as higher clinical manufacturing costs, and the continued expansion of our R&D organization. With this in mind, we expect year-on-year R&D growth in 2024 to be in the mid-teens compared to our anticipated 2023 spend. We also expect to make additional investments in our commercial business and G&A functions to support the launch of EYLEA HD, our planned hem/onc launches and our international expansion. In conclusion, Regeneron continues to deliver strong results, and our robust financial position allows us to make strategic investments to drive this growth over time. With that, I will now pass the call back to Ryan. Yes. Thanks, Evan. I mean, I know having dealt with you and certainly many of our investors, this is certainly an issue that we've been tasked to solve. Now obviously interest rates are a lot higher. So obviously what we're returning on that is certainly much better than the kind of days of 2020 and 2021. But we kind of stick to our knitting here with regards to our capital allocations. I mean George just went through a plethora of obviously pipeline progress that we're making. Again, first and foremost, we're going to make sure that is fully funded to the extent possible on that. And then with regards to acquisitions, you heard with Len's intro, I mean, we continue to look at a lot of opportunities. Certainly, the market that is out there on the biotech space is not in the greatest shape, as you know. So again, we think there are opportunities out there, but just because we have the means doesn't mean that we're going to kind of push into something that may not give us an optimal result. It may not be kind of we like franchises, as you've heard me say that before. So we need to make sure that it's the right fit with George and the team with regards to that. So we'll continue to do that. And you've seen our share repurchases of which we're $1.9 billion through nine months. We've done that at a very good price with regards to how we're buying that back. We're very kind of scientific in our approach on that. We do think that the stock continues to be undervalued given all the pipeline progress and the catalyst that we have. So we're going to continue to push that button going forward. So we're going to stick to our knitting. But again, as Len kind of alluded to, we are looking at a lot of opportunities that are out there. And if the right one makes the necessary fit, then we'll move forward. And again, you kind of saw that with Checkmate and Decibel, albeit those were smaller, but again, those were nice kind of franchise fits into the business."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "George Yancopoulos",
            "content": "Thanks, Len. I'd like to start with our recent data update for EYLEA HD. At the EU Retina Meeting last month, we presented the two-year results from the PULSAR study in wet AMD, which demonstrated that the vast majority of EYLEA HD patients randomized to 12 and 16 week dosing intervals continue to sustain vision and anatomic improvements through 96 weeks. 78% of all EYLEA HD patients were able to maintain at least every 12-week dosing intervals for the entire two-year period, with 88% assigned to at least every 12-week dosing by the end of the two-year period. Similarly, 70% of patients randomized to every 16-week dosing at baseline were able to maintain at least that interval through two years with 78% assigned to at least every 16-week dosing at week 96. Moreover, during the second year, many patients met the criteria for extension to even longer dosing intervals, with 47% meeting the criteria for at least 20-week dosing intervals, including 28% who were eligible for 24-week dosing intervals. The safety profile of EYLEA HD remain consistent with EYLEA, sustaining vision and anatomic improvements while maintaining such extended dosing intervals over two years in both wet AMD and DME is a remarkable advancement for the patients and their physicians. We believe that these results give EYLEA HD the potential to become the new standard of care for these retinal diseases. Moving to our immunology and inflammation pipeline. On Dupixent in COPD, our first pivotal study BOREAS met the primary and all two secondary endpoints in a previously unprecedented success for a biologic in a Phase 3 study in patients with uncontrolled COPD and evidence of Type 2 inflammation. Based on recent feedback from the FDA, in addition to the positive results from the BOREAS study, a positive interim analysis of the replicate Phase 3 NOTUS study would enable an sBLA submission. The independent data monitoring committee will conduct an interim analysis of the NOTUS study later this year. Itepekimab, our anti-IL-33 antibody, the Phase 3 AERIFY-1 and 2 studies remain on track for readout and potential regulatory submissions in 2025, both itepekimab and Dupixent could transform the treatment paradigm for COPD by leveraging their distinct mechanisms of actions in reducing different types of inflammation that contribute to COPD disease progression, and we look forward to the results of these studies. Moving to oncology and combination with Libtayo. We remain on target and are currently enrolling our pivotal study of Libtayo combined with our LAG-3 antibody, fianlimab, in first-line metastatic melanoma. We believe this combination may provide a significant advance for patients in this setting based on our encouraging earlier-stage studies. At the annual ESMO meeting, we presented data from the Phase 2 trial of neoadjuvant Libtayo treatment for resectable cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or CSCC, which demonstrated event-free survival for the vast majority, 89% of the patients at one year. It is also noteworthy that of the 51% of patients who had a pathological complete response, none have since experienced disease recurrence. These results add to the growing body of evidence of Libtayo and other checkpoint inhibitors may have utility in earlier stages of CSCC and other malignancies. To further explore this, we are conducting a Libtayo trial in adjuvant CSCC for patients at heightened risk. We're also evaluating the combination of the Libtayo and fianlimab in adjuvant melanoma, and plan to initiate a study of this combination in the perioperative melanoma setting as well. On to bispecifics. First in hematology oncology. We are pleased that odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific, was recently accepted for review by both the FDA and European regulatory authorities in relapsed/refractory follicular bone and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Based on the pivotal Phase 2 data from the ELM-2 study, we have initiated a robust OLYMPIA Phase 3 development program, investigating odronextamab as monotherapy as well as in combination with current standards of care in earlier lines of follicular lymphoma and DLBCL. We are looking forward to the pivotal data presentations from ELM-2 later this year. We're also on track to submit our regulatory application for linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 antibody for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma by the end of the year. This bispecific may potentially offer best-in-class efficacy and convenience. The LINKER-MM3 confirmatory Phase 3 study evaluated linvoseltamab monotherapy compared to a standard of care regimen is enrolling and studies in earlier lines of multiple myeloma and other plasma cell diseases will be enrolling soon. Finally, in addition to the ongoing Phase 1 combination study of odronextamab in our CD22xCD20 co-stimulatory bispecific, we're also on track to initiate a study of linvoseltamab with a corresponding co-stimulatory bispecific next year. Next, on to bispecifics for solid tumors, which are being investigated in combination with Libtayo and other modalities. At ESMO, we shared initial clinical data for the combination of ubamatamab, our MUC16xCD3 bispecific with Libtayo in advanced ovarian cancer. In these early data, promising durable responses were observed with ubamatamab monotherapy as well as encouraging combination activity with Libtayo with evidence of turnaround responses after initial progression on monotherapy leading in multiple patients upon addition of the Libtayo. A randomized Phase 2 expansion study is ongoing to evaluate two active monotherapy doses of ubamatamab, with the lower dose also tested in combination with Libtayo in order to optimize dosing and evaluate the potential added activity of Libtayo. In addition, we're exploring ubamatamab in multiple rare cancers that are known to express high levels of MUC16. In terms of our co-stimulatory bispecifics for solid tumors, we are currently exploring multiple different CD28 co-stimulatory bispecific antibodies in early clinical trials in a variety of tumor settings in combination with Libtayo with corresponding CD3 bispecifics. We are continuing development of our PSMAxCD28 co-stimulatory bispecific in advanced prostate cancer, focusing and identifying the window of opportunity for maintaining the remarkable antitumor activity observed with this treatment so far while minimizing serious toxicity. In order to explore this, we have expanded enrollment in the PSMAxCD28 monotherapy cohort, and we'll soon initiate cohorts in which investigators will have an option of adding a low dose of cemiplimab to the PSMAxCD28 treatment in certain patients. Moreover, we plan to initiate a trial combining PSMA/CD28 with PSMA/CD3 since, based on preclinical data CD28 costims with appropriate CD3 bispecifics may yield antitumor activity without severe immune-mediated adverse events. We also hope to progress an additional prostate specific CD3 bispecific toward the clinic in the next year, which we may also combine with our PSMA costimulatory biospecific. In terms of our MUC16xCD28 costim in combination with LIBTAYO in ovarian cancer, we are planning on presenting initial data by the end of the year. Regarding our EGFRxCD28 costim in combination LIBTAYO, we are planning on presenting updated dose escalation data in 2024. We will soon commence enrollment across eight tumor specific expansion cohorts in the study, including colorectal cancer with or without liver metastases, as well as EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer. Now, to genetic medicines. We and Intellia recently announced expansion of our research collaboration to include Regeneron's proprietary antibody target delivery technology with the goal of expanding the reach of in vivo gene editing to neurological and muscle diseases. The aim of this expanded collaboration is to address a current bottleneck in genetic medicines, the inability to deliver a genetic payload beyond the liver. Our proprietary pre-clinically validated antibody directed AAV approach will initially test two in vivo non-liver targets. Additionally, we and Intellia announced FDA clearance to start a pivotal Phase 3 trial of NTLA-2001 for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, the first time an investigational in vivo CRISPR-based gene therapy editing is clear to enter late stage clinical development in the United States. The trial is expected to initiate by year end 2023. Moving to our Alnylam collaboration. Alnylam recently presented updated interim ALN-APPI data in early onset Alzheimer's disease. Updated data show that single doses of ALN-APPI achieved sustained robust reduction in APP-alpha and APP-beta measured in the CSF up to 10 months after administration, as well as reduction of amyloidogenic peptides implicated in Alzheimer's disease and in cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Alnylam has also announced that a first patient has been redosed with ALN-APPI in the multi-dose portion of the study currently proceeding outside of the United States. We and Alnylam plan to initiate additional clinical programs for neurodegenerative diseases, including for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, next year. Finally, I would like to highlight DB-OTO, our otoferlin gene therapy Regeneron's first clinical program for genetic hearing loss, which we developed over the last few years in collaboration with Decibel Therapeutics, a company we recently acquired. Last week, we announced the first preliminary results from this trial. A child who received an intraocular injection of DB-OTO in one ear experienced improvements in hearing tests in that ear through week six compared to baseline, including both auditory brainstem responses as well as behavioral audiometry. We are looking forward to continuing evaluation of this innovative approach in the ongoing trial for the ultra-rare otoferlin and gene related hearing loss, as well as in other planned clinical programs which include more common forms of genetic hearing loss. In conclusion, Regeneron's R&D engine continues to grow and deliver differentiated late and early stage opportunities, and we are looking forward to progress in the remainder of this year and looking ahead to 2024. With that, I will turn it over to Marion. Yes. So as you sort of hinted at, what we have realized is that all of the diseases that we are treating with Dupixent really are interrelated diseases that reflect a systemic disorder that is upregulation of so called Type 2 inflammation. And in some cases it manifests in the lungs, in some cases in the skin, in some cases in the gut, and so forth all over the body, and in many cases in most patients, actually in more than one location. And so in every disease that we're going after, including now, as you mentioned, in ulcerative colitis, we believe that there are a subset of patients who may be marked with Type 2 inflammation in their gut. We are, as you say, indicating, utilizing biomarkers that might select out these patients. And so we're going to see whether a subset of ulcerative colitis patients are driven by this Type 2 inflammation that's driving all the other related manifestations of this systemic disorder. Yes. As you said, we're very excited about, I guess, two of the approaches that we've been taking in obesity. One is our unique collection of targets that we've either been the first to discover, like the GPR75 genetically identified target that came from our Regeneron Genetics Center, which is a very exciting new target for obesity, as well as our new approaches such as our leptin receptor agonistic antibody. But one thing we're doing is moving those programs forward and understanding exactly what their potential is in the field of obesity. But as you said, right now, the field which is dominated by these GLP-1 agonists also is recognizing increasing problems with this type of weight loss, meaning that about 40% of the weight loss is due to muscle loss. That means if you lose 20 pounds, eight pounds of that approximately on average, will be muscle. Most patients will never get that muscle back. This can, over time, especially if patients go off these drugs and regain the weight as fat can create potentially a very large public health problem and dilemma. So we also have been, as you pointed out, very active in the field of muscle preservation and muscle growth agents. We've developed some, I think, some of the most exciting candidates in the field that have the ability to do this. And we are certainly considering how to study these muscle preservation and muscle growth agents in combination with existing weight loss agents to see whether we can maintain or even grow muscle in the setting of weight loss. Hopefully, perhaps increasing the quality of the weight loss, maybe even resulting in greater weight loss. But most importantly, making sure that the patients, in terms of their muscle and so forth, do a lot better. And we will be talking about our clinical trials in this area, we hope, very shortly. Yes. Well, as you know, we had one very positive study. We had a second study that actually had a P of 0.049, but for various statistical purposes, just missed meeting its predetermined statistical hurdle. But it's certainly all the indicators were going in the right direction. And what the FDA indicated that they wanted to see the results of our ongoing Study C, as we call it, to make their decision. And so what we're hoping is that that study, which is in the same population of the very positive initial study, remember the second study was in these recalcitrant patients who had failed [indiscernible], among other therapies. But Study C is in the same population as our very first Study A, the very positive study. And we're hoping that if we get consistent data in that study, that the FDA will consider and look favorably upon it. Yes. We have a very large collection of combination opportunities that we're very excited about. The first one that we hope has a chance of really crossing the finish line in a very significant way, in a very seen population, is our combination of Libtayo in combination with fianlimab, putting together these two checkpoints, the anti-PD-1 and the anti-LAG-3. And I think in this case, we believe we have evidence that we have the best-in-class type of activity with both agents separately. And as you've hopefully seen in our earlier stage clinical trials, the data suggests that when we put them together, we really can make a remarkable advance for patients in terms of the number of patients who respond and the extent of their progression-free survival. And we're now, as we announced in a pivotal trial where we hope that we will in the \u2013 within the next year, perhaps be able to provide the results from that trial, which might confirm this remarkable advance for patients. If it works in this first-line melanoma setting, it really opens up the door to a whole series of other opportunities both in related melanoma settings, such as an even earlier stage melanoma setting such as the adjuvant and perioperative settings, but we could be moving to other cancers as well with that proof of principle. So that's the nearest term Libtayo checkpoint combination approach. As you know, with our bispecifics, the combination opportunities there are also very exciting, either with Libtayo or with each other. And we have, in that space shown that our individual agents, the important thing is we have now validated so many of our individual agents as having once again the potential for best-in-class type of activity, whether it's our agent for myeloma or our CD20 bispecific in, for example, follicular lymphoma and so forth and so on. But we're also excited about our costim bispecifics. We've released the data about the incredible efficacy in, at early stages that we see in combination with Libtayo. But that one \u2013 that one is countered by concerns with immune-mediated adverse events that we're seeing in these patients. It is hard to dramatically increase the extent of immunotherapy benefit without having it associated with increased autoimmune type reactions. We're working very hard on that, and we think, based on preclinical data that the trick may be combining our costims with our CD3 bispecifics where we don't see these dramatic potential increases in the mechanisms that may lead to immune adverse events. So in summary, our checkpoint combinations are very near-term. Our bispecifics are single agents have been validated and hopefully will be being considered by the FDA for approval in the relatively near future. And the combinations are beginning to demonstrate exciting opportunity, and we're trying to tune that in order to try to present the best efficacy safety profile for patients. Yes. Maybe getting back to some of the comments that I made before. The collection of so-called allergic or Type 2 conditions, which Dupixent addresses, are all characterized by a systemic inflammatory problem increase in the so-called Type 2 inflammation, which if you look at the science and literature is really of this digital pathway that largely evolved and was one of the most active parts of the immune system to fight things like fecal parasites, which are really not an issue now in the developed world. This part of the immune system should essentially in the modern world be entirely quiescent. It serves almost no role. The problem is it becomes unleashed abnormally to do things that it shouldn't be doing, like fighting allergens or attacking the skin or the gut in atopic dermatitis or eosinophilic esophagitis. What Dupixent does uniquely is that it controls, and the data now demonstrate this, the incredible effect that it puts this useless angry tiger back in the cage where it belongs. And that is why it has this incredible profile of not only efficacy but safety. Because what's shutting down is it's shutting down a pathway that should be vestigial in the modern world that becomes unleashed and attacks all different parts of the body. We believe that any of this current competition that's ongoing doesn't share these remarkable features that give Dupixent its incredible broad efficacy across the spectrum of diseases with its unique safety profile. Because all of these other approaches, including, for example, the OX40 approach and so forth, are addressing different fundamental immune pathways that are important in the immune system's function to do a lot of actual useful things in the modern world, like, for example, fighting viral infections in cancer and so forth. So Dupixent really has a very unique profile, which if we can help explain and if all physicians and patients can understand it, make it the perfect drug for this condition. It uniquely blocks this digital pathway that gets out of control and appropriately and causes disease all over the body. Dupixent shuts down this what should be a vestigial pathway, and it helps disease, whether in the same patients, it could be manifesting in the skin in the lungs, in the nodes, in the gut and so forth, it shuts it down without really untoward effects with regards to the ability of the body to actually fight infections and so forth. In fact, if you look at our clinical studies and some of the data that we published, in many, if not most cases, you actually see unbelievably reduced infections in the setting of the Dupixent treatment. Because what you're doing is you're putting the bad part of the immune system back under control and you're allowing the rest of immune system to do its function. All of these other approaches are trying to attack critical parts of the immune system that have important other functions, and they don't address the widespread problem that occurs systemically and causes all of these diseases. So as you've seen already with various agents, they may work in one of Dupixent indications, but they don't work, they failed in other indications. And if they work, they also often come with the concerns about safety because they're designed to be immunosuppressive, which Dupixent is not. Including in children, as we know, as young as six months is approved there where it's been demonstrating not only incredible safety but incredible efficacy. Well, of course, it's both. We do believe that data rules, the best, both efficacy, safety profile, but also convenience profile. And we will be continuing to show our evolving and maturing data, which we believe could result in best-in-class in terms of efficacy, in terms of response rates and complete response rates in terms of safety, in terms of the frequency of Cytokine Release Syndrome and so forth, and in terms of differentiation in terms of mandated hospitalization. So we will be continuing to present our data. Of course, we'll see exactly ultimately what gets in the label and what the FDA supports but there's the potential here for best-in-class differentiation in terms of efficacy, safety and convenience and schedule. And of course, as you said we're also moving with, we think, an exciting program in earlier lines of therapy. And all of this is also going to be combined with the opportunities for our future combinations. We have a variety of costim bispecifics that we're excited about combining specifically with this agent in the Plasma Cell Dyscrasias setting. So we think it's a very exciting opportunity. As you said, unfortunately there's a large opportunity out there because there's a lot of patients that are still in need. I think that if you have the best agent for late-stage patients. A lot of people want to use it. And then if we figure out the best program to demonstrate how it can be utilized in earlier-stage patients that can certainly enhance that opportunity let alone if we come up with one of our magic combos that really takes it to the whole next level."

With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer. Len?\nLeonard Schleifer: Thanks, Ryan, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. Regeneron delivered strong results across the organization in the second quarter of 2023, while continuing to make progress toward our long-term objective of growing the business while simultaneously diversifying its revenue and earning streams. Total revenues increased by 11% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by Sanofi collaboration revenues and Libtayo net product sales, which grew by 39% and 49% respectively. Non-EYLEA revenue contributions were 41% of total revenues, the highest proportion for any quarter in the last 10 years excluding those with COVID antibody revenue contributions. Overall, we were pleased with the trajectory of the business and believe the company continues to be well-positioned to deliver long-term growth. In a few minutes George, Marion, and Bob will provide commentary on pipeline developments, commercial execution, and financial results that we achieved during the second quarter. For the remainder of my remarks today, I will focus on aflibercept 8 milligrams. We are very excited about the emerging clinical profile including the compelling two-year data from the pivotal PHOTON study in patients with diabetic macular edema which George will discuss in more detail. Now I will summarize the progress that has been made toward getting this important product candidate approved by the FDA. As we announced in late June, the Complete Response Letter or CRL that we received from the FDA regarding our Biologics License Application for aflibercept 8 milligrams for the treatment of patients with wet age-related macular degeneration, DME, and diabetic retinopathy did not identify any issues related to aflibercept 8 milligrams clinical efficacy, safety profile, trial design, labelling or drug substance manufacturing nor has the FDA requested any additional clinical data. The CRL was entirely based on unresolved observations, resulting from the May 2023 FDA pre-approval inspection of a third-party contract manufacturing organization, Catalent, that Regeneron engaged to complete vial-filling for aflibercept 8 milligrams. The inspection observations were noted in a Form 483 and related to a manufacturing line in Catalent's facility that is used to fill vials with aflibercept 8 milligrams, as well as our C5 antibody pozelimab for the ultra-rare CHAPLE disease, which has a PDUFA date of August 20th. The inspection was conducted as part of the FDA review process for both the aflibercept 8 milligrams BLA and the pozelimab BLA. Broadly speaking, the observation cited production and process control procedures, equipment validation, and facility maintenance. We, Catalent, and the FDA have had multiple discussions since the aflibercept 8 milligrams CRL. There is a clear understanding of the remediation work that is required to allow the FDA to assume approving BLAs that involve manufacturing on this line. Catalent has already provided data and information to the FDA that could satisfy some of these requirements and expects to be able to provide the remaining required data and information by mid-August. The FDA said they will strive to complete their review expeditiously prior to the August 20th PDUFA date for pozelimab. However, if they are unable to complete their review before this date, the FDA said that they may need to extend their review by up to three months. If they do extend the review, FDA has stated that they will continue to prioritize the review and complete it as early as possible. Importantly, the FDA has also stated that their review of the Catalent manufacturing data in the context of the pozelimab BLA will support actions for both the pozelimab BLA and the aflibercept 8 milligrams BLA resubmission, which has already been submitted. In summary, we and Catalent expect to submit by mid-August all of the Catalent manufacturing data and information required to address the observations resulting from the pre-approval inspection. The FDA has stated that they will strive to complete their review expeditiously, prior to August 20th. If not, we anticipate the FDA will act on pozelimab and aflibercept 8 milligram BLAs before the end of the third quarter. In closing, we remain confident in our strategy of focusing investments on our internal R&D capabilities while exploring potential external collaborations as well as in our ability to deliver breakthroughs to patients and value to shareholders. With that, let me turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len. I would like to start with our recent update on aflibercept 8 milligram data in DME that Len referred to. At the Annual American Society of Retina Specialists meeting, we presented the two-year results from our PHOTON study. These data demonstrated that the vast majority of aflibercept 8 milligram patients were randomized to the 12-week and 16-week dosing intervals continued to sustain vision and anatomic improvements through 96 weeks. 89% of all aflibercept 8 milligram patients were able to maintain at least every 12-week dosing intervals for the entire two-year period, while 84% of patients assigned to every 16-week dosing at baseline, were able to maintain that interval or extend beyond it. On that point, many patients met the criteria for extension to longer intervals, with 44% meeting the criteria for greater than 20-week dosing intervals, including 27% who were eligible for 24-week dosing intervals. The safety profile of aflibercept 8 milligram remained consistent with EYLEA. Sustaining vision and anatomic improvements while maintaining such extended dosing intervals over two years is unprecedented in the field. Our results further strengthen the clinical profile of aflibercept 8 milligram and position this investigational medicine to become the future standard of care retinal diseases. Later in the third quarter, we and Bayer are planning to share initial results from the second year analysis of the PULSAR study in patients with wet AMD. Moving to our immunology and inflammation pipeline on Dupixent. We look forward to the FDA decision for our sBLA in chronic spontaneous urticaria by October 22nd, 2023, in terms of Dupixent in patients with COPD. We and Sanofi are pleased to announce that Dupixent was granted breakthrough designation for uncontrolled COPD with an eosiniphilic phenotype based on the positive results of the Phase 3 BOREAS study. Based on ongoing discussions with the FDA, we expect that in addition to the BOREAS study results, we will need to provide data from the replicate Phase 3 NOTUS study to support a BLA and such data requirements remain under discussion with the FDA. We continue to expect final results for the NOTUS study by mid-2024. Moving to Itepekimab, our anti-IL-33 antibody, which is being evaluated for COPD in former smokers. In May, Sanofi announced that the Phase 3 AERIFY-1 and 2 studies had passed an interim futility analysis. These studies remain on track for readout and regulatory submissions in 2025. Both the Itepekimab and Dupixent could transform the treatment paradigm for COPD by levering their distinct mechanism of action in reducing different types of inflammation that contribute to COPD. Moving to oncology and combinations with Libtayo. In June, in an oral presentation at the ASCO conference, we presented data for the combination of fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody plus Libtayo, which showed consistent response rates ranging from 56% to 63% across three independent cohorts of advanced melanoma patients, including a new cohort of patients who had received prior anti-PD-1 therapy in the adjuvant melanoma setting. These response rates represent about double the rate historically seen with anti-PD-1 monotherapy in similar settings and clinically meaningful responses were observed in Post Hoc analysis of various populations of interest, including patients with poor prognosis factors and varying tumor PD-L1 expression levels. The safety profile of fianlimab and Libtayo combination in these cohorts appears to be generally consistent with the safety profile of Libtayo monotherapy and other anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 agents, except for the higher rates of adrenal insufficiency, which were Grade 2 or lower in the majority of cases, with all cases successfully managed with steroid replacement. Our fianlimab plus Libtayo Phase 3 studies in metastatic and adjuvant melanoma are enrolling patients as are the Phase 2 portions of the Phase 2/3 studies in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Next on to bispecifics for solid tumors, which are being investigated in combination with Libtayo and other modalities. Later this year, we are planning to share initial clinical data for the combination of ubamatamab, our MUC16xCD28 bispecific plus Libtayo in advanced ovarian cancer. Last year we showed encouraging ubamatamab monotherapy data in advanced ovarian cancer and we believe that combining it with Libtayo may lead to enhanced anti-tumor activity. Moving to costimulatory bispecifics. We are currently exploring multiple different CD28 costimulatory bispecific antibodies in early clinical trials in a variety of tumor settings, in combination with Libtayo well with corresponding CD3 bispecifics in our Phase 1 study of REGN5678, our PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecifics in advanced prostate cancer in combination with Libtayo, which has demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity. The safety profile of this combination continues to pose a challenge, highlighted by the recently observed second Grade 5 adverse event or death. Although serious immune-mediated adverse events continued to be highly correlated to patients who experience profound responses, we have decided to discontinue enrollment of new patients with the full dose Libtayo combination and explore PSMAxCD28 combination with lower doses of Libtayo. We also will continue to explore PSMAxCD28 as a monotherapy, where we have seen anti-tumor activity in some patients and we will explore PSMAxCD28 in combination with other immunotherapy modalities. We believe our prostate cancer data support the exciting potential of costimulatory bispecifics both the challenge of focusing the response solely to the tumor. Our preclinical studies and mechanistic insights suggest the degree of immune-related adverse events seen when combining costims with PD1 blockade may depend on the particular costim target and tumor types. Moreover, combining costims with CD3 bispecifics may not result in these types of severe immune-mediated adverse events. Along these lines, our other costimulatory bispecific programs continue, including our MUC16xCD28 costim with Libtayo and MUC16xCD28 costim with ubamatamab both in ovarian cancer as well as our EGFRxCD28 costim with Libtayo in colorectal and other cancers. In these early dose-escalation studies, we have observed limited immune-mediated toxicities to-date. We are also excited about combining our costimulatory bispecifics with our CD3 bispecifics in our hem/onc programs, which continue to progress. We have initiated dosing of our CD22xCD28 costimulatory bispecifics with odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific in relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which we hope can improve on the impressive efficacy demonstrated by odronextamab alone in that setting. In terms of odronextamab monotherapy, US and EU regulatory submissions for both relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma remain on track. Regarding linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific, we recently presented updated data at the ASCO Annual Meeting demonstrating early deep and durable responses in patients with heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma, with 71% objective response rate and 59% of patients achieving a very good partial response or better at the recommended 200-milligram dose with a median follow-up of only six months, with the data potentially improving as they mature. We believe these data support linvoseltamab's best-in-class potential with differentiated efficacy, safety, hospital requirements, and favorable dosing schedule. In the fourth quarter this year, we are planning to present additional data with longer follow up and to submit regulatory applications for linvoseltamab. We also plan to start combination studies with myeloma-specific costim next year. Next to genetic medicines. In the second quarter, we and Alnylam jointly announced the first human data suggesting that a siRNA can be used to silence pathological genes in the brain, which may open up an entirely new approach to fighting back against neurodegenerative and other central nervous system diseases. We plan to initiate additional clinical programs for CNS diseases next year. As announced by our collaboration with Intellia, we plan to initiate the first in-vivo CRISPR-based Phase 3 clinical program by year-end, subject to regulatory feedback in patients with transthyretin amyloidosis cardiomyopathy. And in terms of our targeted gene delivery pipeline, we hope to initiate our first clinical program in 2024 for Hemophilia B. In conclusion, Regeneron's R&D engine continues to grow and deliver differentiated late and early-stage opportunities and we are looking forward to several important clinical milestones in the second half of this year. With that, I will turn the call over to Marion.\nMarion McCourt: Thank you, George. In the second quarter, Regeneron delivered impressive results across our commercial portfolio, notably Regeneron medicines currently lead multiple disease categories and our future is promising with short and longer-term scientific innovations on the horizon. As Len mentioned, we eagerly await the anticipated approval of aflibercept 8 milligram for retinal diseases, beyond that our robust late-stage pipeline supports additional commercial opportunities that we anticipate will continue to drive growth. Starting with EYLEA, the anti-VEGF category leader in retinal diseases. US EYLEA net sales were $1.5 billion, down 7% year-over-year and up 5% quarter-over-quarter. EYLEA total category share remained stable at 46% over the last two quarters and at approximately 70% for branded share. At the end of the second quarter, there was minimal sequential change in wholesaler inventory levels compared to the levels at the end of the first quarter. Our strategic focus is to maintain and grow Regeneron's anti-VEGF leadership and we're well-positioned to deliver on the score in an increasingly competitive category. Last week at ASRS, we presented our two-year data in diabetic macular edema which further confirmed the unprecedented durability of aflibercept 8 milligrams, with 44% of patients assigned intervals of at least 20 weeks at the end of their second year. Market enthusiasm remains high for this important innovation and our commercial team is ready and excited to launch aflibercept 8 milligram upon approval. Moving now to Libtayo. Global net sales were $210 million, up 49% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. In the US, net sales were $130 million, up 43% driven by steady growth in non-melanoma skin cancer and strong growth in lung cancer. In lung cancer, Libtayo use in new patients share is accelerating, both monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy with an expanding base of prescribers in the community and academic settings. Outside the US Libtayo, net sales were at $80 million, a 58% increase on a constant-currency basis. Growth was driven by demand in the non-melanoma skin cancer indications and initial launches in lung cancer. We expect to drive accelerated performance as we build Regeneron's presence in key international markets and secure access and reimbursement for lung cancer indications. And lastly to Dupixent, which continues to revolutionize the lives of patients with type 2 diseases. Global net sales were approximately $2.8 billion, up 34% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and up 12% compared to the first quarter of 2023. In the US, net sales grew 33% year-over-year to $2.1 billion driven by growth across all indications and age groups. Once again, Dupixent is the number one prescribed biologic medicine for new-to-brand patients across all approved indications and is the category leader in total prescriptions in four out of five indications. We see impressive uptake across our recent US launches with significant opportunity for future growth. In eosinophilic esophagitis, well over 15,000 patients have been initiated since launch and we are actively investing in disease awareness initiatives to empower patients to seek diagnosis and treatment for this debilitating disease. Our prurigo nodularis launch is off to a fast start with physicians rapidly recognizing Dupixent as the go-to treatment for this often underdiagnosed dermatologic condition. Additionally, we look forward to our October 22nd PDUFA date in chronic spontaneous urticaria, where we estimate Dupixent could benefit up to 300,000 US patients. We also continue to generate impressive growth across atopic dermatitis, asthma, and nasal polyps, Dupixent's three largest indications. There is robust demand among all indicated age groups with a significant opportunity for future growth beyond the hundreds of thousands of patients around the world, whose lives have already been transformed by Dupixent. In summary, we delivered a strong commercial performance in the second quarter with Regeneron's medicines positioned for sustained growth. We continue to demonstrate industry-leading execution across our current portfolio and we are prepared to maximize opportunities from our robust pipeline, with the goal of extending Regeneron's scientific innovations to even more patients. Now I will turn the call over to Bob.\nRobert Landry: Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron's second quarter results demonstrate continued growth and strong financial performance across the organization. Second quarter 2023 total revenues increased 11% year-over-year to $3.2 billion, driven by strong Dupixent sales growth coupled with improving profitability within our Sanofi collaboration and continued momentum from Libtayo. Second quarter diluted net income per share was $10.24 on net income of $1.2 billion. Moving to collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. Second quarter 2023 ex-US EYLEA net product sales were $886 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis versus second quarter 2022. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $377 million, of which $350 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the US. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $944 million in the second quarter and grew 39% versus the prior year. Our share of profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and Kevzara was $751 million, an increase of 51% from the second quarter of 2022, reflecting higher volumes and an improving margin profile for Dupixent. We expect further margin expansion from the collaboration driven by continued Dupixent global sales growth coupled with higher gross margins due to significant drug substance yield improvements resulting from dupilumab manufacturing process enhancements. These factors are also contributing to a gradual increase in the rate in which we are repaying the antibody development balance to Sanofi. Once this balance is fully repaid in the next few years, we expect a meaningful step up in our share of Sanofi collaboration profits. Recall that a portion of our Sanofi collaboration revenue was related to the manufacturing of commercial supplies, for which we are reimbursed by Sanofi. As we continue to face in the higher yield manufacturing process for Dupixent, we expect these second half reimbursements to be approximately 25% lower than the first half of 2023, with the fourth quarter expected to be the lowest of the year. Other revenues were $69 million in the second quarter, up 17% versus the prior year. We continue to expect other revenue to be higher in the second half of 2023 as compared to the first half. Recall that other revenue primarily includes reimbursements for the manufacturing of certain Regeneron discovered products commercialized by other companies, including ex-US Praluent, ARCALYST, and ZALTRAP, as well as royalties for Alaris and our share of global profits for ARCALYST. Moving now to our operating expenses. Second quarter 2023 R&D expense was $974 million, representing continued investment in our robust pipeline. Year-over-year R&D growth was primarily driven by higher headcount and related costs and funding of the company's pipeline which encompasses approximately 20 late-stage or potentially registrational studies including our ongoing aflibercept 8 mg studies. Phase 3 studies in earlier lines of therapy for our hem/onc product candidates and our advancing fianlimab development program. The increase in R&D expense was also driven in part by the impact of the 2022 amendments to the Sanofi collaboration agreements and increased manufacturing activity associated with the company's earlier-stage product candidates. SG&A was $562 million in the second quarter, reflecting the ongoing build-out of our ex-US operations following the acquisition of global rights to Libtayo last year, higher headcount and related costs, and higher contributions to an independent not-for-profit patient assistance organization. Second quarter 2023 COCM was $213 million up 44% versus the prior year driven by manufacturing costs associated with higher Dupixent volumes. As we progress the phasing of the improved manufacturing process for Dupixent, we expect COCM in the second half of this year to decline versus the first half as our unchanged 2023 COCM guidance reflects with the fourth quarter expected to be the lowest of the year. Now to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the first half of 2023, Regeneron generated approximately $2.1 billion in free cash flow. We ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $12.6 billion. We continue to opportunistically deploy cash towards share repurchases throughout the second quarter, buying back $723 million of our shares. At current levels, we remain buyers of our shares, and as of June 30th, approximately $2.3 billion remained available for repurchases under our existing authorization. Finally, we've made some minor changes to our full year 2023 guidance ranges based on our first half results and our latest outlook for the remainder of the year. We have tightened guidance ranges for 2023 SG&A and R&D spend and provided updated guidance ranges for our effective tax rate. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. In conclusion, Regeneron delivered positive financial results in the second quarter of 2023 and we remain excited for the potential upcoming launch of aflibercept 8 mg in the third quarter. With that I will now pass the call back to Ryan.\nRyan Crowe: Thank you, Bob. This concludes our prepared remarks, we will now open the call for Q&A. To ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will only be able to answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. Shannon, can we go to the first question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman with BMO. Your line is now open.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my questions and on all the updates today. So on the 8 milligrams CRL, do you have any idea if it's a Class 1 or Class 2 resubmission? And you say that FDA is going to take action in the third quarter or could take action. What does that mean? Are they going to provide an approval decision or is that just going to be acceptance of a refiling? Thank you.\nLeonard Schleifer: Hi, Evan. It's Len. Thanks for your question. So just to clarify, the FDA has not classified the resubmission as Class 1 or Class 2 because they have said that the timeline for pozelimab will be governing what happens with our 8 milligrams. So let me remind you what happened, it was a pre-approval inspection for both products. The pozelimab is for our ultra-rare disease -- CHAPLE disease and it has a PDUFA date of the 20th. What the FDA has said is that they will review the remediation efforts in the context of the pozelimab BLA and therefore, whatever happens there will govern the timeline and results. And when we say we expect them to take action, we mean, we expect them to make an approval or not decision. If they find the manufacturing remediation acceptable for the pozelimab, then we think they will be in a position to promptly make a decision on approval for the 8 milligrams. Does that answer your question?\nRyan Crowe: He is off the line. We will move to the next question Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nTyler Van Buren: Hi, there. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So the timeline to the FDA potentially taking action by the end of this quarter and high-dose EYLEA is very encouraging and investors are clearly surprised by the short lines. So kudos to you all for executing. But as we think about the data submission in a couple of weeks, what additional detail can you provide regarding the manufacturing data and other information that are required from Catalent? And how feasible it is to review this in a few days prior to the pozelimab decision date on August 20th?\nLeonard Schleifer: Right. Great question. So we've been in very close contact with Catalent and the FDA, multiple meetings, oral, written, and so forth, and we have a clear understanding of what's required from an information point of view and from a data point of view. The submissions have been on a rolling basis that as Catalent has completed work, they've submitted data and information already to the FDA. There is very little that will be left for the last submission at the middle of August, and that's why the FDA has told us and they know what's coming that they will strive to expeditiously review that. And if they can't get that done by the few days before the pozelimab PDUFA date, they have told us that they will prioritize our review and do that as soon as possible. That's why we have confidence about this getting done in this quarter. So to summarize the data has been coming in on a rolling basis. We have everything we need, the last piece of information that we'll be rolling in and submitted by the middle of the month, the FDA will strive expeditiously to review that in time for the August 20th PDUFA date. But if not, there will be a clock extension for up to three months, but they have told us that they will prioritize our review. And that's why we believe it will get done, if not in time for the pozelimab PDUFA date in the near future thereafter.\nRyan Crowe: Okay. Thanks, Len. Next question, please Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. And really thank you very much for providing all the clarity on the filing situation right now. Maybe taking -- so just trying to understand this a little bit more. So is it fair to say you have already submitted everything for pozelimab and the remaining part is related to high-dose EYLEA only? Is that fair?\nLeonard Schleifer: Actually, the way you should think about it, we've submitted everything we need for pozelimab except for the final remediation of the pre-approval inspection, which applies both to pozelimab and to the 8 milligram EYLEA. So it's a single pre-approval inspection same data and information required for both. Once that is in then we will have completed everything necessary for pozelimab and for the EYLEA 8 milligrams. They are linked together. The FDA has clearly stated to us that the review of this remediation in the context of the pozelimab BLA will govern what happens to the 8-milligram remediation.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: And I think there is nothing specific to either pozelimab or aflibercept about the data. This has to do as Len said with general manufacturing processes and operations at the Catalent manufacturing facility, particularly with this one manufacturing line.\nLeonard Schleifer: Hey, that's a very good point, George. So that's why the single pre-approval inspection applies to both products. It wasn't the product specifically, it was the processes and validation on the line that fills the two products. So one remediation satisfies both, all the data and information that is being submitted on a rolling basis, the last piece comes in, in the middle of August, the FDA is aware of this. They've told us in writing that they will strive to do that as expeditiously. If they get it done before the end of the PDUFA, an original PDUFA clock, that's great. If they don't, they'll consider an amendment that will set the clock back three months. But notwithstanding that three months, they've told us that they will continue to prioritize our review. So we're very pleased and we're working very hard. Catalent is working very hard, the FDA is working very hard, everybody wants this done properly and finished and properly remediated.\nRyan Crowe: Okay. Next question please, Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nTim Anderson: Thank you very much. I have a question on the Vabysmo. So Roche at Q3 said they're capturing 30% of treatment-naive patients which seems like a quite high figure frankly. And then they said afterward, that it's not the extended dosing that's driving this as much as it is the better drawing that they say docs or seeing with their product. I'm wondering how those comments kind of line up with what you're seeing play out in the US market. Thank you.\nMarion McCourt: Sure. So, Tom, I will comment on our EYLEA performance. And as I just shared with you the performance in the quarter was strong, certainly we see EYLEA steadily as the standard-of-care in the anti-VEGF category. We continue to capture not only na\u00efve-patients, but also another big source of business is switch patients from Avastin. Obviously, the other branded competitors are smaller in market today. But I would say that beyond your comment, probably best to get more clarification from the individuals who are commercializing faricimab in the market. But certainly, I do want you to know that we are seeing continued strength in EYLEA performance and obviously very much look forward to having the potentially game-changing opportunity of bringing aflibercept 8 milligrams into the marketplace and where the profile of efficacy, safety and durability has so many KOLs and prescribers excited based on what they've seen recently in the clinical data presented at ASRS.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks, Marion. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nChris Raymond: Thanks. Just maybe another market-related question. So I know these extended dose therapies have benefits in and of themselves on the face of them. But there's been some decent level of market chatter around docs, looking to free up injection capacity specifically to make room for geographic atrophy patients and specifically with the Apellis drug. Just maybe curious how widespread was that notion before the Syfovre safety issue. And now with the issue have you noticed a discernible shift among docs who we're talking about that? And then maybe a related question, you guys have talked I think about an early effort of your own in geographic atrophy. Clearly, the market is sizable, when could we expect to hear more about that effort?\nMarion McCourt: So let me share first in terms of the market dynamic. I think the most exciting thing and most important thing about aflibercept 8 milligram is it gives prescribers for all of their patients whether a na\u00efve-patient, a patient currently on EYLEA or a patient on another anti-VEGF category product, the opportunity to decide if that patient is a candidate when we launch and when we have an FDA approval, is the patient is a candidate for aflibercept 8 milligram, that does have benefit to the patient and prescriber and potentially to the office capacity and patient flow. I think it's premature to comment on the category that we're not directly involved in. We are though very focused on making sure that we are ready for launch and certainly at the proper time, educating all stakeholders on aflibercept 8 milligram once we have an approval.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: And in terms of our own efforts, as I'm sure many are aware we've been very active with what we feel are very innovative approaches in the complement blockade field. And we believe that we may have an approach that may allow potential treatment in these retinal diseases. While avoiding some of the very concerning adverse events having to do with issues like inclusive vasculitis and so forth, and you'll be hearing much more about those efforts in the short-term.\nRyan Crowe: Okay. Thanks, Marion and George. Shannon, please move to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nCarter Gould: Great, good morning. And thanks for all the transparency. Maybe switching gears a bit, in terms of the update on your costim and report of the death and the change in the dosing paradigm with 5678 in combination with Libtayo. George maybe you can speak about the implications for other combination efforts of CD28 with Libtayo, it's going to require lower dosing with those efforts with Libtayo portion and just the broader implications there and just fill your level of confidence you can kind of thread that needle in terms of the dosing levels? Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Great question. Obviously, as you know, in cancer, the biggest hurdle is actually coming up with approaches and new classes of agents that have the ability to really change the efficacy paradigm to really bring new ability to address cancers that have previously been untreatable or refractory to treatment. So I think that, that excitement continues with the costim platform in terms of all of the signs and the preclinical modeling and predictions have really delivered in terms of showing that this new class does seemingly has the ability to really change the efficacy paradigm. But now we have to balance that as you said with the safety, because with more efficacy, which is often seen in the cancer field comes more safety concerns to what you just said, what we've seen preclinically and we're now beginning to see it in the clinic that the amount of associated immune adverse events is related to the particular costim target. So what you see for one costim doesn't necessarily apply to the other costim. So we are, as you said for our PSMA costim moving out of lower doses of the Libtayo because the full dose combination, while it seems like it has the potential to be very efficacious, but also has in some cases these associated only, remember only in the patients who are having deep responses, these associated in some cases, it can be very serious even resulting in death associated immune adverse events. So we're moving away from full dose combinations there and we're going and hoping that we can maintain some level of the efficacy, but avoiding these very serious immune-related adverse events. We're not doing that yet, because we're not seeing these sort of immune-related adverse events with our other costims. And the other very, very important thing just to remind you from our preclinical modeling, these types of immune-related adverse events that we're seeing with the PSMA in combination costim in combination with Libtayo are not seeing preclinically when you combine with the CD3 bispecific. And so we are very aggressively trying to move forward those programs as well, where we hope we may have a better efficacy, safety profile. So it's both a -- very exciting time to have these very active molecules, remember or remind you, we have three classes now, three independent classes of very active molecules that have been individually validated in our portfolio. We have the checkpoint inhibitors, in particular, our PD1 and our LAG-3 checkpoint inhibitors, which are validated. We have our CD3 bispecifics which are validated and we now have our costims which are validated from the efficacy perspective, very exciting time to be mixing and matching them. The challenge is to mix-and-match them appropriately to maximize the signal-to-noise, the therapeutic benefits relative to the potential adverse events we see in the patients.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks, George. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nSalveen Richter: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and nice updates this morning. Clearly the possibility of a permanent J-code now has moved to April and it shortens the runway for patients switching from EYLEA ahead of potentially loss of exclusivity in May. So kind of a two-part question here. What are the dynamics around this and how do you, on one hand kind of maintain and grow the switch population from EYLEA? But secondly, how should we think about the uptake of high-dose EYLEA without a permanent J-code? Thank you.\nMarion McCourt: Hi Salveen. So I'll get started. Certainly, we're conscious of the dates and the requirement for submissions to CMS that occur at the start of a quarter. So we would estimate potentially the time frame that you're referencing, if we have an approval in the third quarter. What I would share is that we anticipate use of aflibercept 8 milligram after approval and launch before we have the permanent J-code. Retina specialists are sophisticated in their reimbursement capabilities at the office level. They are experienced with newer products coming into the marketplace on a fairly regular basis and how to make certain that they validate reimbursement for products prior to having the permanent J-code under a temporary J-code. So obviously, we want to have the permanent J-code that will be a positive. But certainly, we do see the opportunity for uptake across patient types prior to that situation with CMS.\nRyan Crowe: Okay. Thanks, Marion. Shannon, please move to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Len, I know we've talked about this before, but the company has been somewhat non-traditional on pricing decisions historically. You guys priced EYLEA at a discount to Lucentis. You worked with ICER on Dupixent pricing. So just wondering why we shouldn't expect it similar approach here with high-dose EYLEA. Thank you.\nLeonard Schleifer: Thanks, Terrence. If your comments referencing similar, I mean, thoughtful and appropriate, we would agree.\nRyan Crowe: Okay. Next question please Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nBrian Abrahams: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on all the progress and appreciate all the details. Maybe just another clarification on 8 milligram aflibercept. Can you characterize your level of confidence that a re-inspection would not be required? Have you had any interactions or feedback with the agency around this? And is there a defined period of time where the FDA would need to wait re-inspection or not to ensure that the remediations are sustainable before proving to BLAs? Thanks.\nLeonard Schleifer: Great. Thanks for your question. Look, we've tried to be 1,000% transparent as usual Regeneron. And this is really, let me just see if I can summarize it, again, what we know. We've been in close contact with the FDA as has Catalent. We know what the remediations required are and we've been submitting them on a rolling basis. We expect to submit the last requirement by the middle of August and that will be several days before the PDUFA date for the pozelimab BLA. The FDA has been very clear that they will strive to expeditiously review that. If they can, great. They can't, they said there would be a three-month clock extension. But even with a three-month clock extension, they've been very categorical in saying that they would prioritize our review and try and get it done as soon as possible. Those facts are what led us to believe it would be done during the third quarter. In all of this, is the fact that there has been no need, no discussion, no indication whatsoever that a re-inspection would be necessary. The FDA of course is free to make those decisions, but we have not seen any indication of that in our very detailed and close contact. So we've given you our best estimate at this point.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks, Len. Let's move to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. Can you just come back to the CD28 PSMA update? Maybe just elaborate a little bit more in terms of the approach of lowering the PD-1 exposure to address the safety issues here and taking that approach versus trying to work to further adjust the dosing of the bispecific piece of the equation? Thanks so much.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Well, we should say that we are adjusting both doses. We have been already exploring a variety of doses from very low doses to the highest active doses on the costim side. But we've been doing all of them in the context of the full dose Libtayo. So now what we're doing is we're exploring some of the doses that are active, particularly ones are active as monotherapy, as I mentioned, there is monotherapy activity with the PSMA costim. And now we are -- to try to decrease these immune-related adverse events. Let me remind you, they are on the same sort of class of immune-related adverse events that you do see with checkpoint inhibitors in general. We're just seeing them in some patients, the one with the biggest responses in some cases to a greater extent. So we're hoping that lowering the checkpoint inhibition may allow us to adjust the therapeutic window there. But we are as you are saying dealing with a couple different doses of the costim, but now we're incorporating lower doses of the Libtayo into the program as well.\nLeonard Schleifer: I think what George said earlier, just maybe it bears repeating, is that he said that we're starting with the good position of having very impressive efficacy, one. And two side effects that for the most part in the patients who are benefiting with the efficacy, that's a very good position to begin to explore and how to get the therapeutic index or signal to noise as George calls it right.\nRyan Crowe: Okay. Let's move to the next question, Shannon. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nDane Leone: Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. Congratulations on the updates and best of luck with the resolution of the reviews for pozelimab and 8 mg aflibercept. I actually want to ask you to expand a bit on your discussions with the FDA and potential filing or early filing on Dupixent for COPD. The point I'd like a little bit more clarity on specifically what you may be able to have from NOTUS before the final readout of that study that you could potentially include in a package with the BOREAS results to get the FDA comfortable with an accelerated review for that indication. Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yeah. What we know right now is that we're going to need data from NOTUS. And right now, as we said, we are still in discussions on what that data could be. And so right now, we don't have any details to give you.\nRyan Crowe: Okay. Thanks, George. Hopefully an update and next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow with UBS. Your line is now open.\nColin Bristow: Hey, good morning, and congrats on the quarter and the progress. Just maybe one on the itepekimab interim. Can you share anything on the utility threshold? And if not, specifically, could you say how the sort of Fed relative to BOREAS? Thanks.\nLeonard Schleifer: I don't think we have anything specific. This was handled by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee sort of a standard approach. We're pleased that we passed it. And we will look forward to further data at the end of the study.\nRyan Crowe: And both we and Sanofi are blinded to that. We only got the go-decision from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee. So we will proceed to a final readout for both of those studies. Let's go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney with Baird. Your line is now open.\nLuke Junk: Hey, this is Luke on for Brian. Thanks for taking the question. Can you just provide a little bit more color on what drove the Libtayo growth this quarter? Was there any stocking or was it largely demand-based? Thanks.\nMarion McCourt: Thank you, Luke. And I'm pleased to share it is demand growth. Certainly, we see continued and steady performance across our skin indications both cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma. In addition to that, it is exciting that we are seeing not only an increase in the number of prescribers for our lung cancer indications, but the depth of prescribing is improving and increasing in both the community and also academic settings. But that is demand based, it is not stocking based.\nRyan Crowe: And I think Shannon we have time for two more questions, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.\nDavid Risinger: Yes, thanks very much. So my question is for George, on the costims, please. You mentioned that you haven't seen the immune age with respect to your other costim trials. Could you please comment on whether the dosing step-ups at this point are close to the higher dosing levels that you're stepping back from in the PSMA trial? I'm just trying to contextualize whether you really have advanced those other trials to the point to really know whether you're going to have similar problems in your other costim trials? Thanks very much.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: That's a very good and fair question. And those programs are at earlier stages, so we won't know until we are more advanced, whether when we get to the same sort of efficacy type levels, do we have the same sort of immune-related adverse events associations or not. What I was referring to is in the preclinical studies, the amount of this associated T-Cell activation that can lead to these sorts of immune-related adverse events varies depending on the tumor class and on the costim itself. So based on that we would expect to see different ratios of immune-related adverse events. Those other programs though right now are all-in stages where they are in with full dose Libtayo combinations at this point.\nRyan Crowe: Okay. Thanks, Shannon. We have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our last question is from Akash Tewari with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nAkash Tewari: Hey, thanks so much. I'll switch it up. I guess maybe for your obesity program, you had data at the ADA showing synergy with your myostatin inhibition program when combined with the GLP-1. I guess the natural observation here is Regeneron doesn't currently have a program in development. Is there any interest in acquiring one externally via BD or partnership at this time? Thanks.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Well, what we would say is, we do think that obviously, there's a lot of focus on obesity and particularly these new agents that are causing a large amount of weight loss. But as you described is being increasingly recognized that the quality of this weight loss may prove challenging that many patients are actually losing muscle or lean body mass which is -- can be very detrimental particularly if they stay on these therapies or yoyo on and off them, that can really lead to substantial changes over-time and body composition can be very debilitating for patients. And as you said, we've had long investment in programs that can maintain muscle mass in various settings and we've shown that they can maintain or even grow muscle mass in the setting of these types of obesity treatments in our preclinical modeling. So obviously it is a very exciting opportunity to think about which is, can we combine some of our muscle preservation or growth strategies and biologics to prevent these concerning side effects that are being seen with the new class of profound weight loss agents. And so we are very actively pursuing everything that we can imagine. And hopefully, we'll be providing updates on our approaches as time goes along.\nRyan Crowe: Okay. Thanks, George, and thanks for everyone who dialed in today and for your interest in Regeneron. We apologize to those remaining in the queue that we did not have a chance to hear from. As always, the Investor Relations team is available to answer any remaining questions. Thank you once again and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Marion McCourt",
            "content": "Thank you, George. In the second quarter, Regeneron delivered impressive results across our commercial portfolio, notably Regeneron medicines currently lead multiple disease categories and our future is promising with short and longer-term scientific innovations on the horizon. As Len mentioned, we eagerly await the anticipated approval of aflibercept 8 milligram for retinal diseases, beyond that our robust late-stage pipeline supports additional commercial opportunities that we anticipate will continue to drive growth. Starting with EYLEA, the anti-VEGF category leader in retinal diseases. US EYLEA net sales were $1.5 billion, down 7% year-over-year and up 5% quarter-over-quarter. EYLEA total category share remained stable at 46% over the last two quarters and at approximately 70% for branded share. At the end of the second quarter, there was minimal sequential change in wholesaler inventory levels compared to the levels at the end of the first quarter. Our strategic focus is to maintain and grow Regeneron's anti-VEGF leadership and we're well-positioned to deliver on the score in an increasingly competitive category. Last week at ASRS, we presented our two-year data in diabetic macular edema which further confirmed the unprecedented durability of aflibercept 8 milligrams, with 44% of patients assigned intervals of at least 20 weeks at the end of their second year. Market enthusiasm remains high for this important innovation and our commercial team is ready and excited to launch aflibercept 8 milligram upon approval. Moving now to Libtayo. Global net sales were $210 million, up 49% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. In the US, net sales were $130 million, up 43% driven by steady growth in non-melanoma skin cancer and strong growth in lung cancer. In lung cancer, Libtayo use in new patients share is accelerating, both monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy with an expanding base of prescribers in the community and academic settings. Outside the US Libtayo, net sales were at $80 million, a 58% increase on a constant-currency basis. Growth was driven by demand in the non-melanoma skin cancer indications and initial launches in lung cancer. We expect to drive accelerated performance as we build Regeneron's presence in key international markets and secure access and reimbursement for lung cancer indications. And lastly to Dupixent, which continues to revolutionize the lives of patients with type 2 diseases. Global net sales were approximately $2.8 billion, up 34% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and up 12% compared to the first quarter of 2023. In the US, net sales grew 33% year-over-year to $2.1 billion driven by growth across all indications and age groups. Once again, Dupixent is the number one prescribed biologic medicine for new-to-brand patients across all approved indications and is the category leader in total prescriptions in four out of five indications. We see impressive uptake across our recent US launches with significant opportunity for future growth. In eosinophilic esophagitis, well over 15,000 patients have been initiated since launch and we are actively investing in disease awareness initiatives to empower patients to seek diagnosis and treatment for this debilitating disease. Our prurigo nodularis launch is off to a fast start with physicians rapidly recognizing Dupixent as the go-to treatment for this often underdiagnosed dermatologic condition. Additionally, we look forward to our October 22nd PDUFA date in chronic spontaneous urticaria, where we estimate Dupixent could benefit up to 300,000 US patients. We also continue to generate impressive growth across atopic dermatitis, asthma, and nasal polyps, Dupixent's three largest indications. There is robust demand among all indicated age groups with a significant opportunity for future growth beyond the hundreds of thousands of patients around the world, whose lives have already been transformed by Dupixent. In summary, we delivered a strong commercial performance in the second quarter with Regeneron's medicines positioned for sustained growth. We continue to demonstrate industry-leading execution across our current portfolio and we are prepared to maximize opportunities from our robust pipeline, with the goal of extending Regeneron's scientific innovations to even more patients. Now I will turn the call over to Bob. Sure. So, Tom, I will comment on our EYLEA performance. And as I just shared with you the performance in the quarter was strong, certainly we see EYLEA steadily as the standard-of-care in the anti-VEGF category. We continue to capture not only nai\u0308ve-patients, but also another big source of business is switch patients from Avastin. Obviously, the other branded competitors are smaller in market today. But I would say that beyond your comment, probably best to get more clarification from the individuals who are commercializing faricimab in the market. But certainly, I do want you to know that we are seeing continued strength in EYLEA performance and obviously very much look forward to having the potentially game-changing opportunity of bringing aflibercept 8 milligrams into the marketplace and where the profile of efficacy, safety and durability has so many KOLs and prescribers excited based on what they've seen recently in the clinical data presented at ASRS. So let me share first in terms of the market dynamic. I think the most exciting thing and most important thing about aflibercept 8 milligram is it gives prescribers for all of their patients whether a nai\u0308ve-patient, a patient currently on EYLEA or a patient on another anti-VEGF category product, the opportunity to decide if that patient is a candidate when we launch and when we have an FDA approval, is the patient is a candidate for aflibercept 8 milligram, that does have benefit to the patient and prescriber and potentially to the office capacity and patient flow. I think it's premature to comment on the category that we're not directly involved in. We are though very focused on making sure that we are ready for launch and certainly at the proper time, educating all stakeholders on aflibercept 8 milligram once we have an approval. Hi Salveen. So I'll get started. Certainly, we're conscious of the dates and the requirement for submissions to CMS that occur at the start of a quarter. So we would estimate potentially the time frame that you're referencing, if we have an approval in the third quarter. What I would share is that we anticipate use of aflibercept 8 milligram after approval and launch before we have the permanent J-code. Retina specialists are sophisticated in their reimbursement capabilities at the office level. They are experienced with newer products coming into the marketplace on a fairly regular basis and how to make certain that they validate reimbursement for products prior to having the permanent J-code under a temporary J-code. So obviously, we want to have the permanent J-code that will be a positive. But certainly, we do see the opportunity for uptake across patient types prior to that situation with CMS. Thank you, Luke. And I'm pleased to share it is demand growth. Certainly, we see continued and steady performance across our skin indications both cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma. In addition to that, it is exciting that we are seeing not only an increase in the number of prescribers for our lung cancer indications, but the depth of prescribing is improving and increasing in both the community and also academic settings. But that is demand based, it is not stocking based."

            "content": "Thanks, Ryan, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. Regeneron delivered strong results across the organization in the second quarter of 2023, while continuing to make progress toward our long-term objective of growing the business while simultaneously diversifying its revenue and earning streams. Total revenues increased by 11% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by Sanofi collaboration revenues and Libtayo net product sales, which grew by 39% and 49% respectively. Non-EYLEA revenue contributions were 41% of total revenues, the highest proportion for any quarter in the last 10 years excluding those with COVID antibody revenue contributions. Overall, we were pleased with the trajectory of the business and believe the company continues to be well-positioned to deliver long-term growth. In a few minutes George, Marion, and Bob will provide commentary on pipeline developments, commercial execution, and financial results that we achieved during the second quarter. For the remainder of my remarks today, I will focus on aflibercept 8 milligrams. We are very excited about the emerging clinical profile including the compelling two-year data from the pivotal PHOTON study in patients with diabetic macular edema which George will discuss in more detail. Now I will summarize the progress that has been made toward getting this important product candidate approved by the FDA. As we announced in late June, the Complete Response Letter or CRL that we received from the FDA regarding our Biologics License Application for aflibercept 8 milligrams for the treatment of patients with wet age-related macular degeneration, DME, and diabetic retinopathy did not identify any issues related to aflibercept 8 milligrams clinical efficacy, safety profile, trial design, labelling or drug substance manufacturing nor has the FDA requested any additional clinical data. The CRL was entirely based on unresolved observations, resulting from the May 2023 FDA pre-approval inspection of a third-party contract manufacturing organization, Catalent, that Regeneron engaged to complete vial-filling for aflibercept 8 milligrams. The inspection observations were noted in a Form 483 and related to a manufacturing line in Catalent's facility that is used to fill vials with aflibercept 8 milligrams, as well as our C5 antibody pozelimab for the ultra-rare CHAPLE disease, which has a PDUFA date of August 20th. The inspection was conducted as part of the FDA review process for both the aflibercept 8 milligrams BLA and the pozelimab BLA. Broadly speaking, the observation cited production and process control procedures, equipment validation, and facility maintenance. We, Catalent, and the FDA have had multiple discussions since the aflibercept 8 milligrams CRL. There is a clear understanding of the remediation work that is required to allow the FDA to assume approving BLAs that involve manufacturing on this line. Catalent has already provided data and information to the FDA that could satisfy some of these requirements and expects to be able to provide the remaining required data and information by mid-August. The FDA said they will strive to complete their review expeditiously prior to the August 20th PDUFA date for pozelimab. However, if they are unable to complete their review before this date, the FDA said that they may need to extend their review by up to three months. If they do extend the review, FDA has stated that they will continue to prioritize the review and complete it as early as possible. Importantly, the FDA has also stated that their review of the Catalent manufacturing data in the context of the pozelimab BLA will support actions for both the pozelimab BLA and the aflibercept 8 milligrams BLA resubmission, which has already been submitted. In summary, we and Catalent expect to submit by mid-August all of the Catalent manufacturing data and information required to address the observations resulting from the pre-approval inspection. The FDA has stated that they will strive to complete their review expeditiously, prior to August 20th. If not, we anticipate the FDA will act on pozelimab and aflibercept 8 milligram BLAs before the end of the third quarter. In closing, we remain confident in our strategy of focusing investments on our internal R&D capabilities while exploring potential external collaborations as well as in our ability to deliver breakthroughs to patients and value to shareholders. With that, let me turn the call over to George. Hi, Evan. It's Len. Thanks for your question. So just to clarify, the FDA has not classified the resubmission as Class 1 or Class 2 because they have said that the timeline for pozelimab will be governing what happens with our 8 milligrams. So let me remind you what happened, it was a pre-approval inspection for both products. The pozelimab is for our ultra-rare disease -- CHAPLE disease and it has a PDUFA date of the 20th. What the FDA has said is that they will review the remediation efforts in the context of the pozelimab BLA and therefore, whatever happens there will govern the timeline and results. And when we say we expect them to take action, we mean, we expect them to make an approval or not decision. If they find the manufacturing remediation acceptable for the pozelimab, then we think they will be in a position to promptly make a decision on approval for the 8 milligrams. Does that answer your question? Right. Great question. So we've been in very close contact with Catalent and the FDA, multiple meetings, oral, written, and so forth, and we have a clear understanding of what's required from an information point of view and from a data point of view. The submissions have been on a rolling basis that as Catalent has completed work, they've submitted data and information already to the FDA. There is very little that will be left for the last submission at the middle of August, and that's why the FDA has told us and they know what's coming that they will strive to expeditiously review that. And if they can't get that done by the few days before the pozelimab PDUFA date, they have told us that they will prioritize our review and do that as soon as possible. That's why we have confidence about this getting done in this quarter. So to summarize the data has been coming in on a rolling basis. We have everything we need, the last piece of information that we'll be rolling in and submitted by the middle of the month, the FDA will strive expeditiously to review that in time for the August 20th PDUFA date. But if not, there will be a clock extension for up to three months, but they have told us that they will prioritize our review. And that's why we believe it will get done, if not in time for the pozelimab PDUFA date in the near future thereafter. Actually, the way you should think about it, we've submitted everything we need for pozelimab except for the final remediation of the pre-approval inspection, which applies both to pozelimab and to the 8 milligram EYLEA. So it's a single pre-approval inspection same data and information required for both. Once that is in then we will have completed everything necessary for pozelimab and for the EYLEA 8 milligrams. They are linked together. The FDA has clearly stated to us that the review of this remediation in the context of the pozelimab BLA will govern what happens to the 8-milligram remediation. Hey, that's a very good point, George. So that's why the single pre-approval inspection applies to both products. It wasn't the product specifically, it was the processes and validation on the line that fills the two products. So one remediation satisfies both, all the data and information that is being submitted on a rolling basis, the last piece comes in, in the middle of August, the FDA is aware of this. They've told us in writing that they will strive to do that as expeditiously. If they get it done before the end of the PDUFA, an original PDUFA clock, that's great. If they don't, they'll consider an amendment that will set the clock back three months. But notwithstanding that three months, they've told us that they will continue to prioritize our review. So we're very pleased and we're working very hard. Catalent is working very hard, the FDA is working very hard, everybody wants this done properly and finished and properly remediated. Thanks, Terrence. If your comments referencing similar, I mean, thoughtful and appropriate, we would agree. Great. Thanks for your question. Look, we've tried to be 1,000% transparent as usual Regeneron. And this is really, let me just see if I can summarize it, again, what we know. We've been in close contact with the FDA as has Catalent. We know what the remediations required are and we've been submitting them on a rolling basis. We expect to submit the last requirement by the middle of August and that will be several days before the PDUFA date for the pozelimab BLA. The FDA has been very clear that they will strive to expeditiously review that. If they can, great. They can't, they said there would be a three-month clock extension. But even with a three-month clock extension, they've been very categorical in saying that they would prioritize our review and try and get it done as soon as possible. Those facts are what led us to believe it would be done during the third quarter. In all of this, is the fact that there has been no need, no discussion, no indication whatsoever that a re-inspection would be necessary. The FDA of course is free to make those decisions, but we have not seen any indication of that in our very detailed and close contact. So we've given you our best estimate at this point. I think what George said earlier, just maybe it bears repeating, is that he said that we're starting with the good position of having very impressive efficacy, one. And two side effects that for the most part in the patients who are benefiting with the efficacy, that's a very good position to begin to explore and how to get the therapeutic index or signal to noise as George calls it right. I don't think we have anything specific. This was handled by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee sort of a standard approach. We're pleased that we passed it. And we will look forward to further data at the end of the study."

            "content": "Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron's second quarter results demonstrate continued growth and strong financial performance across the organization. Second quarter 2023 total revenues increased 11% year-over-year to $3.2 billion, driven by strong Dupixent sales growth coupled with improving profitability within our Sanofi collaboration and continued momentum from Libtayo. Second quarter diluted net income per share was $10.24 on net income of $1.2 billion. Moving to collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. Second quarter 2023 ex-US EYLEA net product sales were $886 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis versus second quarter 2022. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $377 million, of which $350 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the US. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $944 million in the second quarter and grew 39% versus the prior year. Our share of profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and Kevzara was $751 million, an increase of 51% from the second quarter of 2022, reflecting higher volumes and an improving margin profile for Dupixent. We expect further margin expansion from the collaboration driven by continued Dupixent global sales growth coupled with higher gross margins due to significant drug substance yield improvements resulting from dupilumab manufacturing process enhancements. These factors are also contributing to a gradual increase in the rate in which we are repaying the antibody development balance to Sanofi. Once this balance is fully repaid in the next few years, we expect a meaningful step up in our share of Sanofi collaboration profits. Recall that a portion of our Sanofi collaboration revenue was related to the manufacturing of commercial supplies, for which we are reimbursed by Sanofi. As we continue to face in the higher yield manufacturing process for Dupixent, we expect these second half reimbursements to be approximately 25% lower than the first half of 2023, with the fourth quarter expected to be the lowest of the year. Other revenues were $69 million in the second quarter, up 17% versus the prior year. We continue to expect other revenue to be higher in the second half of 2023 as compared to the first half. Recall that other revenue primarily includes reimbursements for the manufacturing of certain Regeneron discovered products commercialized by other companies, including ex-US Praluent, ARCALYST, and ZALTRAP, as well as royalties for Alaris and our share of global profits for ARCALYST. Moving now to our operating expenses. Second quarter 2023 R&D expense was $974 million, representing continued investment in our robust pipeline. Year-over-year R&D growth was primarily driven by higher headcount and related costs and funding of the company's pipeline which encompasses approximately 20 late-stage or potentially registrational studies including our ongoing aflibercept 8 mg studies. Phase 3 studies in earlier lines of therapy for our hem/onc product candidates and our advancing fianlimab development program. The increase in R&D expense was also driven in part by the impact of the 2022 amendments to the Sanofi collaboration agreements and increased manufacturing activity associated with the company's earlier-stage product candidates. SG&A was $562 million in the second quarter, reflecting the ongoing build-out of our ex-US operations following the acquisition of global rights to Libtayo last year, higher headcount and related costs, and higher contributions to an independent not-for-profit patient assistance organization. Second quarter 2023 COCM was $213 million up 44% versus the prior year driven by manufacturing costs associated with higher Dupixent volumes. As we progress the phasing of the improved manufacturing process for Dupixent, we expect COCM in the second half of this year to decline versus the first half as our unchanged 2023 COCM guidance reflects with the fourth quarter expected to be the lowest of the year. Now to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the first half of 2023, Regeneron generated approximately $2.1 billion in free cash flow. We ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $12.6 billion. We continue to opportunistically deploy cash towards share repurchases throughout the second quarter, buying back $723 million of our shares. At current levels, we remain buyers of our shares, and as of June 30th, approximately $2.3 billion remained available for repurchases under our existing authorization. Finally, we've made some minor changes to our full year 2023 guidance ranges based on our first half results and our latest outlook for the remainder of the year. We have tightened guidance ranges for 2023 SG&A and R&D spend and provided updated guidance ranges for our effective tax rate. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. In conclusion, Regeneron delivered positive financial results in the second quarter of 2023 and we remain excited for the potential upcoming launch of aflibercept 8 mg in the third quarter. With that I will now pass the call back to Ryan."

            "name": "George Yancopoulos",
            "content": "Thank you, Len. I would like to start with our recent update on aflibercept 8 milligram data in DME that Len referred to. At the Annual American Society of Retina Specialists meeting, we presented the two-year results from our PHOTON study. These data demonstrated that the vast majority of aflibercept 8 milligram patients were randomized to the 12-week and 16-week dosing intervals continued to sustain vision and anatomic improvements through 96 weeks. 89% of all aflibercept 8 milligram patients were able to maintain at least every 12-week dosing intervals for the entire two-year period, while 84% of patients assigned to every 16-week dosing at baseline, were able to maintain that interval or extend beyond it. On that point, many patients met the criteria for extension to longer intervals, with 44% meeting the criteria for greater than 20-week dosing intervals, including 27% who were eligible for 24-week dosing intervals. The safety profile of aflibercept 8 milligram remained consistent with EYLEA. Sustaining vision and anatomic improvements while maintaining such extended dosing intervals over two years is unprecedented in the field. Our results further strengthen the clinical profile of aflibercept 8 milligram and position this investigational medicine to become the future standard of care retinal diseases. Later in the third quarter, we and Bayer are planning to share initial results from the second year analysis of the PULSAR study in patients with wet AMD. Moving to our immunology and inflammation pipeline on Dupixent. We look forward to the FDA decision for our sBLA in chronic spontaneous urticaria by October 22nd, 2023, in terms of Dupixent in patients with COPD. We and Sanofi are pleased to announce that Dupixent was granted breakthrough designation for uncontrolled COPD with an eosiniphilic phenotype based on the positive results of the Phase 3 BOREAS study. Based on ongoing discussions with the FDA, we expect that in addition to the BOREAS study results, we will need to provide data from the replicate Phase 3 NOTUS study to support a BLA and such data requirements remain under discussion with the FDA. We continue to expect final results for the NOTUS study by mid-2024. Moving to Itepekimab, our anti-IL-33 antibody, which is being evaluated for COPD in former smokers. In May, Sanofi announced that the Phase 3 AERIFY-1 and 2 studies had passed an interim futility analysis. These studies remain on track for readout and regulatory submissions in 2025. Both the Itepekimab and Dupixent could transform the treatment paradigm for COPD by levering their distinct mechanism of action in reducing different types of inflammation that contribute to COPD. Moving to oncology and combinations with Libtayo. In June, in an oral presentation at the ASCO conference, we presented data for the combination of fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody plus Libtayo, which showed consistent response rates ranging from 56% to 63% across three independent cohorts of advanced melanoma patients, including a new cohort of patients who had received prior anti-PD-1 therapy in the adjuvant melanoma setting. These response rates represent about double the rate historically seen with anti-PD-1 monotherapy in similar settings and clinically meaningful responses were observed in Post Hoc analysis of various populations of interest, including patients with poor prognosis factors and varying tumor PD-L1 expression levels. The safety profile of fianlimab and Libtayo combination in these cohorts appears to be generally consistent with the safety profile of Libtayo monotherapy and other anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 agents, except for the higher rates of adrenal insufficiency, which were Grade 2 or lower in the majority of cases, with all cases successfully managed with steroid replacement. Our fianlimab plus Libtayo Phase 3 studies in metastatic and adjuvant melanoma are enrolling patients as are the Phase 2 portions of the Phase 2/3 studies in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Next on to bispecifics for solid tumors, which are being investigated in combination with Libtayo and other modalities. Later this year, we are planning to share initial clinical data for the combination of ubamatamab, our MUC16xCD28 bispecific plus Libtayo in advanced ovarian cancer. Last year we showed encouraging ubamatamab monotherapy data in advanced ovarian cancer and we believe that combining it with Libtayo may lead to enhanced anti-tumor activity. Moving to costimulatory bispecifics. We are currently exploring multiple different CD28 costimulatory bispecific antibodies in early clinical trials in a variety of tumor settings, in combination with Libtayo well with corresponding CD3 bispecifics in our Phase 1 study of REGN5678, our PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecifics in advanced prostate cancer in combination with Libtayo, which has demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity. The safety profile of this combination continues to pose a challenge, highlighted by the recently observed second Grade 5 adverse event or death. Although serious immune-mediated adverse events continued to be highly correlated to patients who experience profound responses, we have decided to discontinue enrollment of new patients with the full dose Libtayo combination and explore PSMAxCD28 combination with lower doses of Libtayo. We also will continue to explore PSMAxCD28 as a monotherapy, where we have seen anti-tumor activity in some patients and we will explore PSMAxCD28 in combination with other immunotherapy modalities. We believe our prostate cancer data support the exciting potential of costimulatory bispecifics both the challenge of focusing the response solely to the tumor. Our preclinical studies and mechanistic insights suggest the degree of immune-related adverse events seen when combining costims with PD1 blockade may depend on the particular costim target and tumor types. Moreover, combining costims with CD3 bispecifics may not result in these types of severe immune-mediated adverse events. Along these lines, our other costimulatory bispecific programs continue, including our MUC16xCD28 costim with Libtayo and MUC16xCD28 costim with ubamatamab both in ovarian cancer as well as our EGFRxCD28 costim with Libtayo in colorectal and other cancers. In these early dose-escalation studies, we have observed limited immune-mediated toxicities to-date. We are also excited about combining our costimulatory bispecifics with our CD3 bispecifics in our hem/onc programs, which continue to progress. We have initiated dosing of our CD22xCD28 costimulatory bispecifics with odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific in relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which we hope can improve on the impressive efficacy demonstrated by odronextamab alone in that setting. In terms of odronextamab monotherapy, US and EU regulatory submissions for both relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma remain on track. Regarding linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific, we recently presented updated data at the ASCO Annual Meeting demonstrating early deep and durable responses in patients with heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma, with 71% objective response rate and 59% of patients achieving a very good partial response or better at the recommended 200-milligram dose with a median follow-up of only six months, with the data potentially improving as they mature. We believe these data support linvoseltamab's best-in-class potential with differentiated efficacy, safety, hospital requirements, and favorable dosing schedule. In the fourth quarter this year, we are planning to present additional data with longer follow up and to submit regulatory applications for linvoseltamab. We also plan to start combination studies with myeloma-specific costim next year. Next to genetic medicines. In the second quarter, we and Alnylam jointly announced the first human data suggesting that a siRNA can be used to silence pathological genes in the brain, which may open up an entirely new approach to fighting back against neurodegenerative and other central nervous system diseases. We plan to initiate additional clinical programs for CNS diseases next year. As announced by our collaboration with Intellia, we plan to initiate the first in-vivo CRISPR-based Phase 3 clinical program by year-end, subject to regulatory feedback in patients with transthyretin amyloidosis cardiomyopathy. And in terms of our targeted gene delivery pipeline, we hope to initiate our first clinical program in 2024 for Hemophilia B. In conclusion, Regeneron's R&D engine continues to grow and deliver differentiated late and early-stage opportunities and we are looking forward to several important clinical milestones in the second half of this year. With that, I will turn the call over to Marion. And I think there is nothing specific to either pozelimab or aflibercept about the data. This has to do as Len said with general manufacturing processes and operations at the Catalent manufacturing facility, particularly with this one manufacturing line. And in terms of our own efforts, as I'm sure many are aware we've been very active with what we feel are very innovative approaches in the complement blockade field. And we believe that we may have an approach that may allow potential treatment in these retinal diseases. While avoiding some of the very concerning adverse events having to do with issues like inclusive vasculitis and so forth, and you'll be hearing much more about those efforts in the short-term. Great question. Obviously, as you know, in cancer, the biggest hurdle is actually coming up with approaches and new classes of agents that have the ability to really change the efficacy paradigm to really bring new ability to address cancers that have previously been untreatable or refractory to treatment. So I think that, that excitement continues with the costim platform in terms of all of the signs and the preclinical modeling and predictions have really delivered in terms of showing that this new class does seemingly has the ability to really change the efficacy paradigm. But now we have to balance that as you said with the safety, because with more efficacy, which is often seen in the cancer field comes more safety concerns to what you just said, what we've seen preclinically and we're now beginning to see it in the clinic that the amount of associated immune adverse events is related to the particular costim target. So what you see for one costim doesn't necessarily apply to the other costim. So we are, as you said for our PSMA costim moving out of lower doses of the Libtayo because the full dose combination, while it seems like it has the potential to be very efficacious, but also has in some cases these associated only, remember only in the patients who are having deep responses, these associated in some cases, it can be very serious even resulting in death associated immune adverse events. So we're moving away from full dose combinations there and we're going and hoping that we can maintain some level of the efficacy, but avoiding these very serious immune-related adverse events. We're not doing that yet, because we're not seeing these sort of immune-related adverse events with our other costims. And the other very, very important thing just to remind you from our preclinical modeling, these types of immune-related adverse events that we're seeing with the PSMA in combination costim in combination with Libtayo are not seeing preclinically when you combine with the CD3 bispecific. And so we are very aggressively trying to move forward those programs as well, where we hope we may have a better efficacy, safety profile. So it's both a -- very exciting time to have these very active molecules, remember or remind you, we have three classes now, three independent classes of very active molecules that have been individually validated in our portfolio. We have the checkpoint inhibitors, in particular, our PD1 and our LAG-3 checkpoint inhibitors, which are validated. We have our CD3 bispecifics which are validated and we now have our costims which are validated from the efficacy perspective, very exciting time to be mixing and matching them. The challenge is to mix-and-match them appropriately to maximize the signal-to-noise, the therapeutic benefits relative to the potential adverse events we see in the patients. Well, we should say that we are adjusting both doses. We have been already exploring a variety of doses from very low doses to the highest active doses on the costim side. But we've been doing all of them in the context of the full dose Libtayo. So now what we're doing is we're exploring some of the doses that are active, particularly ones are active as monotherapy, as I mentioned, there is monotherapy activity with the PSMA costim. And now we are -- to try to decrease these immune-related adverse events. Let me remind you, they are on the same sort of class of immune-related adverse events that you do see with checkpoint inhibitors in general. We're just seeing them in some patients, the one with the biggest responses in some cases to a greater extent. So we're hoping that lowering the checkpoint inhibition may allow us to adjust the therapeutic window there. But we are as you are saying dealing with a couple different doses of the costim, but now we're incorporating lower doses of the Libtayo into the program as well. Yeah. What we know right now is that we're going to need data from NOTUS. And right now, as we said, we are still in discussions on what that data could be. And so right now, we don't have any details to give you. That's a very good and fair question. And those programs are at earlier stages, so we won't know until we are more advanced, whether when we get to the same sort of efficacy type levels, do we have the same sort of immune-related adverse events associations or not. What I was referring to is in the preclinical studies, the amount of this associated T-Cell activation that can lead to these sorts of immune-related adverse events varies depending on the tumor class and on the costim itself. So based on that we would expect to see different ratios of immune-related adverse events. Those other programs though right now are all-in stages where they are in with full dose Libtayo combinations at this point. Well, what we would say is, we do think that obviously, there's a lot of focus on obesity and particularly these new agents that are causing a large amount of weight loss. But as you described is being increasingly recognized that the quality of this weight loss may prove challenging that many patients are actually losing muscle or lean body mass which is -- can be very detrimental particularly if they stay on these therapies or yoyo on and off them, that can really lead to substantial changes over-time and body composition can be very debilitating for patients. And as you said, we've had long investment in programs that can maintain muscle mass in various settings and we've shown that they can maintain or even grow muscle mass in the setting of these types of obesity treatments in our preclinical modeling. So obviously it is a very exciting opportunity to think about which is, can we combine some of our muscle preservation or growth strategies and biologics to prevent these concerning side effects that are being seen with the new class of profound weight loss agents. And so we are very actively pursuing everything that we can imagine. And hopefully, we'll be providing updates on our approaches as time goes along."

Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected in that statement. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC this morning. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In addition, please note that GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed in today's call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP is available in our financial results press release and our corporate presentation, which can be accessed on our website. Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer. Len?\nLeonard Schleifer: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone joining today's call. Following our significant achievements in 2022, Regeneron is off to a good start in 2023, highlighted by important regulatory and pipeline advances, commercial execution and prudent capital allocation, all of which position better the company to deliver sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value over time. George, Mary and Bob will cover details of our first quarter performance in a few moments. In the meantime, I would provide an update on our goal of continuing to grow our business while simultaneously diversifying our revenue and earnings streams, which is part of our long-term vision for Regeneron. We have made substantial progress toward achieving that goal. Over the past four years, while total revenues have nearly doubled, EYLEA accounted for only 57% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 88% of total revenues for the year 2019. Driven primarily by the growth of DUPIXENT, our Sanofi collaboration accounted for 25% of our total revenues in the first quarter of 2023 compared to only 6% of our total revenues in 2019. We expect this trend of revenue growth, along with diversification to continue. For example, assuming the approval and successful launch of aflibercept 8 milligrams, which has a June 27 PDUFA date, EYLEA 2 milligrams is expected to become a smaller share of our revenues, while aflibercept 8 milligrams is expected to contribute to overall revenue growth. In addition, DUPIXENT remains in a high-growth mode, with global net product sales up 40% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year quarter, driven by growth across all 5 approved indications. We believe the positive Phase III results for DUPIXENT in the subpopulation of COPD patients with evidence of type 2 inflammation, as well as the promising results for our IL-33 antibody itepekimab in former smokers represent additional significant opportunities to accelerate revenue growth as well as diversification. Our oncology portfolio is also starting to make a meaningful contribution to our top line, with last year's acquisition of full global rights to Libtayo and the recent launch of Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Moreover, we believe that fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody, in combination with Libtayo, has the potential to become an important therapy in both melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, where we have already advanced to pivotal studies. We are also quite excited about the emerging clinical profile for linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific. Updated data for which will be presented at the upcoming ASCO Annual Meeting. We remain on track to submit a BLA seeking accelerated approval in late-stage myeloma later this year. We continue to invest in our research and development engine and expect it will deliver new differentiated medicines that will drive organic growth over time. Our broad development pipeline of nearly 3 dozen programs spans many different therapeutic areas and modalities, notably: Our co-stimulatory bispecifics in cancer; our early pipeline in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; as well as our collaborations with Alnylam, Intellia, Decibel and others are expected to drive medium- and long-term revenue growth, profitability and diversification. Before handing over to George, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the contributions that Dr. Roy Vagelos has made to Regeneron over the nearly three decades that he has served as our Board Chair. Over the years, he has provided invaluable guidance and he continues to inspire us as we work to turn world-class science into medicines. Roy will retire from the Board after his current term ends next month. At that time, in addition to our current roles in the company, George and I will be appointed by the Board to serve as co-Chairs, and Christine Poon, a member of Regeneron board since 2010, will be appointed as the board's Lead Independent Director. With that, let me turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len. The first quarter of 2023 delivered multiple significant milestones for Regeneron and for our collaborations, from the positive DUPIXENT Phase III COPD data to progress in our oncology pipeline, as well as exciting new landmarks from our genetic medicines programs. Starting with DUPIXENT. In March, together with our Sanofi collaborators, we announced that DUPIXENT was the first immune mechanism of action treatment to produce statistically significant and clinically meaningful results in a Phase III trial for COPD in over a decade.  Our BOREAS trial enrolled COPD patients with moderate to severe disease and evidence of type 2 inflammation. DUPIXENT-treated patients demonstrated a clinically meaningful 30% reduction in exacerbations, a significant improvement in lung function as well as quality of life benefits: an impressive trifecta in a potential paradigm-changing treatment for this deadly disease. We are looking forward to presenting the detailed BOREAS results in a late-breaking presentation at the upcoming American Thoracic Society Meeting later this month. We also plan to discuss these exciting results with regulatory authorities and expect to report results mid next year for the replicate Phase III NOTUS study. I would remind you that we are also trying to address an overlapping COPD population with our IL-33 antibody, which is in Phase III studies based on positive Phase II proof-of-concept data. This approach is further supported by genetic analysis from our Regeneron Genetics Center, which demonstrated association of loss of function in IL-33 with reduced COPD risk. Similar genetic analysis supported the role for a DUPIXENT benefit in COPD. The BOREAS COPD data indicates that DUPIXENT can help even more patients beyond the 5 current FDA-approved indications and diseases caused or exacerbated by type 2 inflammation, including atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis. We are also expecting an FDA decision for DUPIXENT for chronic spontaneous urticaria on October 22, 2023, and we are continuing to tailor DUPIXENT development to patients with other type 2 inflammatory diseases, most likely to be responsive to this method. Moving to oncology. With the progress of our late and early stage pipeline, we are looking forward to several important milestones this year. Starting with Libtayo. In addition to expanded use in lung cancer, Libtayo was recently added to the NCCN guidelines for neoadjuvant treatment of CSCC. The Libtayo U.S. label was also recently updated with more mature CSCC and BCC data, supporting its differentiated clinical profile in these tumor settings and satisfying all post-marketing commitments that require full approval in these indications. Regarding our exciting new combinations with Libtayo. Starting with fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibodies, for which we are planning a broad pivotal program spanning several cancer indications. These efforts were triggered by our robust and confirmed data in first-line metastatic melanoma patients, which will be presented in further detail at ASCO, suggesting that the fianlimab-Libtayo combination could produce about double the response rates with longer progression-free survival, the anti-PD monotherapy standard. Based on this, we have already initiated pivotal trials in metastatic and adjuvant melanoma, and we will start a study in perioperative melanoma in the second half of the year. In addition, based on promising data in small patient cohorts, we started a seamless Phase II/III pivotal study for treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, and we will soon start a Phase II study in the perioperative setting. Next, the bispecifics for solid tumors, which are being investigated in combination with Libtayo. Earlier this year, ASCO's GU represented initial positive first-in-human data for our PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with Libtayo in advanced prostate cancer, the tumor type considered immunologically cold and largely unresponsive to anti-PD-1 therapy alone. Over the next 12 months we plan to present updated PSMAxCD28 data in more patients, some of which will have been prophylactically treated with our anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, sarilumab, to potentially reduce the severity of immune-mediated side effects while maintaining or improving antitumor activity. Also during this time frame, we plan to present data in advanced ovarian cancer for both our MUC16xCD3 bispecific in our MUC16xCD3 co-stimulatory bispecific as well as data in several tumor types from our EGFRxCD28 costimulatory bispecific, or in combination with Libtayo. Our hematology oncology pipeline continues to advance. In an oral presentation at the upcoming ASCO Annual Meeting, we will present updated data for linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific tested in late-line multiple myeloma. We believe these data will show that linvoseltamab has the best-in-class potential with differentiated efficacy, safety and a favorable dosing schedule in the competitive environment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma treatment candidates. We remain on track for a regulatory submission in the United States in the second half of this year for linvoseltamab. For odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific, we are on track to complete U.S. and EU regulatory submissions for both relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in the second half of this year. Odronextamab in late-line relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma has a potential best-in-class efficacy profile, and our optimized step-up dosing regimen has improved our generic safety profile without impacting efficacy. Also, we have initiated a first-in-human study of our CD20xCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with odronextamab in relapsed/refractory DLBCL, which we hope could further improve upon the anticancer benefit for these patients. Now to genetics medicines. Starting with our collaboration with Alnylam, and siRNA therapeutics. Just last week, we and Alnylam announced an important update for our Alnylam APP program in early onset Alzheimer's disease. For the first time, an siRNA therapeutic demonstrates sustained silencing of a pathological gene in the central nerve system in a clinical trial. In the earnings call this morning, our Alnylam collaborators provided additional details on these results. Our siRNA approach aims to prevent production of amyloid precursor protein as opposed to clearing existing amyloid plaques after they have already formed, providing a new way to potentially address Alzheimer's disease, which will still have a devastating impact on patients and their families even with the emergence of amyloid-clearing antibodies. Patients treated with single dose of ALN-APP experienced dose-dependent, rapid and sustained reduction of up to 90% in APP production as assessed by biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid. The safety and tolerability profile with single dosing is encouraging so far. While the multi-dose Part B portion of the study is on partial clinical hold in the United States due to finding reserved in prior nonclinical chronic toxicology studies, Part B has already received regulatory approval to proceed in Canada, where the majority of the part A clinical trial patients had been enrolled. Detailed results from the study will be presented in an upcoming medical meeting. We are looking forward to advancing additional development candidates for the many other neurodegenerative diseases that currently have few or no therapeutic options such as other targets for Alzheimer's as well as for ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, Parkinson's and Huntington's. In addition to these exciting developments in central nervous system diseases, we are continuing our progress with liver targeted medicines, including our broad and multipronged approach to develop treatments for NASH, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. We're enrolling a Phase II study of ALN-HSD in NASH patients with genetic risk factors, continuing in development of ALN-PNP, and we are planning to progress additional more recently genetically validated NASH targets as well. Finally, I would like to highlight our recently announced collaboration with Sonoma Biotherapeutics' discover, develop and commercialize regulatory T cell therapies for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. This collaboration will bring together our industry-leading technologies for the discovery and characterization of fully human antibodies and T cell receptors, as well as our additional biologics candidates with Sonoma's pioneering approach to developing and manufacturing gene modified T reg cell therapies. In conclusion, Regeneron's R&D engine truly continues its productivity in both late and early-stage pipeline. Before turning the call over to Marion, I would also like to thank Roy Vagelos for serving as a role model for all of us at Regeneron as well as for so many others across the industry. I hope that we can continue to live up to the high stage that Roy has set over his distinguished career. With that, I will turn the call over to Marion.\nMarion McCourt: Thank you, George. Our first quarter performance demonstrates ongoing leadership across multiple therapeutic categories. Taken together, our in-market brands anticipated near-term launches and extensive development pipeline uniquely position Regeneron to expand our leadership across multiple disease areas. First quarter EYLEA U.S. net product sales declined 6% year-over-year to $1.43 billion. On a sequential quarter basis, EYLEA U.S. net product sales decreased 4%, reflecting the favorable impact of higher demand volume, offset by lower sequential wholesaler inventory levels, higher sales-related deductions and increasing competitive pressure. EYLEA captured approximately 70% branded share in the first quarter. Based on presentations at scientific meetings, the retina community has expressed increasing enthusiasm about Regeneron's portfolio with the aflibercept 8-milligram PDUFA date, now 7 weeks away. EYLEA is the well-established gold standard anti-VEGF treatment and aflibercept 8-milligram has the potential to be as paradigm changing as EYLEA when it was introduced more than a decade ago. In clinical trials of aflibercept 8-milligram demonstrated improvements in visual acuity with less frequent injections and a safety profile comparable to EYLEA, exactly what retina specialists have told us they need in a next-generation medicine. Launch preparations are well underway, and we look forward to bringing this important treatment option to patients following FDA approval. On Libtayo, which is foundational to Regeneron's oncology portfolio, first quarter global net product sales grew 49% on a constant currency basis, reaching $183 million, which includes $6 million from Sanofi transition sales in international markets. In the U.S., net sales grew 39% to $110 million. Libtayo continues to lead the market in both advanced CSCC and advanced BCC as demand volume increases. Following last November's FDA approval of Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy for first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer, new patient starts have accelerated as physicians of Libtayo has an important new treatment option, initiatives to raise brand awareness and improve access have driven share gains in both the academic and community settings. Outside the U.S., Libtayo net sales grew 67% on a constant currency basis to $73 million, driven by steadily increasing demand and additional country launches. The European Commission recently approved Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy for PD-L1 positive lung cancer, and we are in the process of securing access and reimbursement for this new indication. Turning to DUPIXENT. First quarter global net sales grew 40% on a constant currency basis to $2.49 billion. In the U.S., net sales grew 43% to $1.9 billion, with notable volume growth across all approved indications. Driven by its outstanding efficacy and safety profile, DUPIXENT is the number one prescribed biologic for new patients in all 5 of its approved indications. In atopic dermatitis, DUPIXENT is the leading systemic treatment based on its unique mechanism of action, clinical profile and real world experience. Strong prescribing trends continue across moderate and severe disease and across approved age ranges. There's also significant opportunity to further increase market penetration as DUPIXENT is uniquely positioned to provide an effective, safe and convenient treatment for patients 6 months and older. In prurigo nodularis, DUPIXENT is the only FDA-approved systemic treatment. Launch update is progressing well, and we anticipate ongoing growth as we leverage our dermatology commercialization capabilities for patients in need. Across the competitive asthma space, DUPIXENT continues to gain market share as naive and biologic switch patients are initiated on treatment. DUPIXENT also continues to capture the majority of market demand in nasal polyps with increased prescribing from allergists and ENTs. Our cytosolic esophagitis launch is exceeding expectations. In the first year following U.S. approval, more than 11,000 patients have initiated therapy, demonstrating extensive unmet patient need and our strong launch execution and collaboration with Sanofi. Both gastroenterologist and analogists have embraced DUPIXENTas the new standard of care setting meaningful improvements in disease symptoms and quality of life for those now on therapy. A new patient campaign is underway to raise awareness of the scientific advancements in treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis. Outside the U.S., DUPIXENTnet sales were $587 million, growing 30% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across approved indications and launches in new geographies. Recent European approvals of eosinophilic esophagitis, prurigo nodularis and atopic dermatitis in young children are expected to contribute to DUPIXENT\u2019s ongoing growth. In summary, our commercial portfolio continues to diversify across many serious medical conditions and delivered solid results in the quarter. Moving forward, we are well positioned to serve even more patients driven by the strength of our existing portfolio, coupled with anticipated launches that have the potential to advance standards of care. With that, I'll turn the call to Bob.\nBob Landry: Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron performed well in the first quarter of 2023 with solid financial results. First quarter total revenues increased 7% year-over-year to $3.2 billion as DUPIXENT and Libtayo contribute to increasingly diversified revenue and earning streams. First quarter diluted net income per share was $10.09 on net income of $1.2 billion, which included a previously announced $0.42 impact of acquired IPR&D. Beginning with collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. First quarter 2023 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $847 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis versus first quarter 2022. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $357 million, of which $332 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $798 million in the first quarter and grew 26% versus last year's first quarter, which included a $50 million sales milestone that did not recur this year. Our share of profits from the commercialization of DUPIXENT and KEVZARA was $637 million, an increase of 53% versus the prior year. We continue to see increasing profitability from our antibody collaboration and expect further margin expansion as we begin to realize drug substance yield improvements from a new Regeneron developed manufacturing process for DUPIXENT. Finally, we recorded Roche collaboration revenue of $222 million in the first quarter for our share of gross profits from ex U.S. sales of Ronapreve related to a previously signed contract. We do not expect to record any additional revenue from Ronapreve in 2023, absent a new contract. Moving now to operating expenses. First quarter 2023 R&D expense increased 28% year-over-year to $960 million as we continue to invest in our pipeline to drive organic growth. The increase in R&D was primarily driven by higher headcount and related costs and funding of the company's growing pipeline, which now encompasses approximately 35 programs in clinical development in more than 15 ongoing late-stage studies with additional study starts expected this year. These late-stage programs include our expanding fianlimab development program, upcoming Phase III studies and early reliance for our hem/onc assets, as well as ongoing development programs for DUPIXENT and itepekimab for which we now record our full 50% share of development costs as a result of the Libtayo transaction. SG&A expense increased 32% year-over-year to $515 million due to higher contributions to an independent, not-for-profit patient assistance organization, higher headcount and related costs, and the impact of the Libtayo transaction. First quarter 2023 COCM was $249 million, up 26% versus last year, due to increases in shipments of ex-U.S. commercial supplies of Praluent to Sanofi and manufacturing costs for Dupixent. Reimbursements for these production costs are recorded as part of other revenue in Sanofi collaboration revenue respectively. Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the first quarter of 2023, Regeneron generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities, less debt, of $12.3 billion. We have continued to strategically deploy our cash to deliver on our capital allocation priorities, which are focused on investing in innovation, both internal and external, as well as returning capital to shareholders. We purchased nearly $700 million of our shares in the first quarter with $3.1 billion remaining under our existing authorization as of March 31. Additionally, as George discussed, we announced the collaboration with Sonoma Biotherapeutics, investing $75 million through an upfront payment and equity investment to add a new approach to our scientific capabilities. I'd like to conclude with some select updates to our financial guidance and outlook for 2023. We are updating 2023 COCM guidance to be in the range of $820 million to $880 million, an increase of $90 million at the midpoint, reflecting increased shipments of ex-U.S. commercial supplies for Praluent and DUPIXENT to Sanofi. Importantly, these anticipated incremental expenses will be reimbursed by Sanofi, generally resulting in a neutral impact to Regeneron's 2023 operating profit. Approximately half of the incremental $90 million of reimbursements from Sanofi are expected to be recorded as Sanofi collaboration revenue, with the balance recorded as other revenue. As a result, we now expect 2023 other revenue to be higher than 2022 other revenue. For modeling purposes, second quarter 2023 other revenue is expected to be the lowest of the 2023 quarters, with the vast majority of the remaining other revenue to be recorded in the second half of this year. We are also updating our 2023 gross margin to be between 89% to 91%. The change in expected gross margin is primarily driven by an unfavorable change in product mix, as well as an increase in the start-up costs associated with our new fill/finish facility located in upstate New York. Finally, we are lowering our guidance for our effective tax rate to 10% to 12%, reflecting the benefit of higher than previously anticipated stock-based compensation deductions. In conclusion, Regeneron continued to deliver robust financial results in the first quarter of 2023, and the company remains well positioned to drive further growth in the remainder of the year and beyond. With that, I will now pass the call back to Ryan.\nRyan Crowe: Thank you, Bob. Josh, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. To ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. Please go ahead, Josh.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.\nMohit Bansal: Maybe, Marion, if you could elaborate a little bit on the EYLEA, over this more dynamic at this point a little bit. Given the weakness in the quarter, you did mention that Decibel is taking some share. So if you could elaborate on where the share is coming from? Is it more of a switch? Or do you think it is also some new patient starts? And your confidence level in terms of flipping this situation once high-dose EYLEA comes along.\nMarion McCourt: Sure, very happy to comment. And as I noted, as we're reporting on the quarter performance on a sequential basis, we did see with EYLEA, if I look at a sequential quarterly basis, we did see with EYLEA a net product sales decrease of 4%. As I mentioned, it was driven by a number of factors. Certainly, competitive pressure is one, but we also reflected on while we had slightly higher demand volume. It was offset by lower sequential wholesaler inventory levels and overall tire sales-related deductions. Specifically as it relates to competitive pressure, I would say that this is overall competitive dynamic in the anti-VEGF category, not something that we would necessarily identify with a particular product, more the totality of competition. I will comment that in the quarter, we certainly maintained a 70% branded share and over at approximately, I believe it was a 46% share in the overall anti-VEGF category. So certainly standard of care with EYLEA. And very importantly, we look forward to launching aflibercept 8 milligram, as I mentioned now, is about 7 weeks away.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist. You may proceed.\nRobyn Karnauskas: Just some questions on LAG-3, and thinking about the first-line melanoma market and you're going to be having data relatively soon. So what -- I guess it's a multipart question. What is the bar for success, do you think, for the combination to be competitive? And when you think about penetrating into the nivo and checkpoint monotherapy buckets for first-line melanoma, can you help us understand how big these buckets are to actually model this opportunity better?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Well, as we've already reported, based on our two country cohorts, we are seeing remarkable overall response rate increases over the PD-1 standard alone, almost doubling with much longer PFS. If we get anywhere near these numbers along with a satisfactory safety profile, which we had seen a favorable safety profile in the small studies, but if we reproduce or come anywhere close to reproducing these results, we believe that this will establish an entirely new standard of care for this disease. And as we all know, the first-line melanoma opportunity is very large, but we're also moving laterally and earlier and so forth into many additional applications within the melanoma opportunity itself. We're going -- we're already now in adjuvant and entering neoadjuvant studies. We'll also be going to other cancer settings, including lung cancer and so forth. So we consider this a major opportunity, and we can only help to -- if we approach the data that we've already seen in our earlier studies, it really has a chance to make a huge difference for these patients.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tyler Van Buren with Cowen. You may proceed. \nTyler Van Buren: For high-dose EYLEA, is there anything left to do on the regulatory front? And have you guys started labeling discussions yet? And forgive me for the follow-up, but just briefly for housekeeping and related to your response to the first question in prepared remarks, Marion, can you quantify the impact of the lower EYLEA inventory for the quarter?\nLeonard Schleifer: So on the regulatory update, we don't comment on ongoing stuff. I'd like to say we're looking forward, hopefully, to the action of the FDA on June 27 and the launch promptly thereafter. Marion, you can comment on the inventories.\nMarion McCourt: Sure, Tyler. I can give you the detail there. So while still within the normal range of inventory related to your question on EYLEA in the quarter in the normal range is 5 to 10 days, our inventory levels were approximately three days lower at the end of the first quarter of 2023 compared to the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. And when you do the calculation on that, as I'm sure you all will do, that's a negative impact in the first quarter net sales of approximately $70 million.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.\nTerence Flynn: I was just wondering on the commercial footprint for DUPIXEN, there, given the potential for another indication with COPD. If you could talk about any additional footprint or spend that's required there. And again, maybe just how to think about leverage on the forward.\nMarion McCourt: Sure, very happy to comment. And as we think of DUPIXENT and all the different therapeutic disease areas and specialists that we cover with some indications, there certainly is an amazing and wonderful synergy. And you give an example with COPD launch potentially. And obviously, today, we're in market with our asthma indication and with nasal polyps. As we look forward with COPD, it's a really important launch, an indication to help patients in a way potentially that, as George described, hasn't been achieved ever for this population. So we have the opportunity to use our existing footprint, specifically in covering respiratory specialists, pulmonologists. But we'll also evaluate very closely with Sanofi, as you've seen us done in dermatology indications, where we might need some additional coverage and where the synergy is adequate, and we'll be very disciplined and very thoughtful about that. But you can be assured that we'll make certain that we appropriately give commercialization effort to such an important indication of COPD.\nLeonard Schleifer: And it's interesting, just to add a little bit to that, Marion, that the allergists seem to have really understood the concept of type 2 inflammation. And the fact that type 2 inflammation is not a collection of individual unrelated diseases, it's a collection of related diseases. And I was speaking to an allergist the other day and said when you take an asthma patient, if you look carefully, many of them will have nasal polyps. And if you talk to dermatologists, they're beginning to understand that when they're treating atopic dermatitis, people who have concomitant asthma, for example, they get a benefit there. So I think DUPIXENT really is kind of unique. And we are talking to the main doctors, including the allergists, the dermatologists and the pulmonologists, with some of the ENT, as Marion said. We're covering them all, and many of them are covering multiple diseases.\nMarion McCourt: I'll add to the enthusiasm here too in COPD, the potential to have a second product following DUPIXENT as well. So this will be a very important future area for helping patients.\nBob Landry: So with regards to your question on leverage, first off, welcome back. Nice to have you back on the team. You'll see with the issuance of our 10-Q this morning with regards to our share of the antibody alliance, we're going to pick up quarter year-over-year for the quarter, roughly 300 basis points. And again, that's half the economics on the transaction. So we're beginning to see really great leverage in to Marion's comment that should continue on with the COPD indication.\nLeonard Schleifer: Obviously, we work very closely with Sanofi and all of these. And I believe it's fair to say we're equally excited about the potential for the future of DUPIXENT in all the current and, hopefully, future indications.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christopher Raymond with Piper Sandler.\nChristopher Raymond: Maybe another DUPIXENT question, if you don't mind. Leonard, I know you don't talk about regulatory interactions. But when you had the COPD data, I think the signal that I got from you guys that seemed to be pretty strong was that you were hoping to have some discussions with the agency on BOREAS alone. Just kind of -- maybe can you map out how you anticipate communicating the results of that discussion with FDA once it happens? And then maybe a second part of that question is, our KOL checks have been pretty consistent when we asked them about this data. They're very impressed. But one of the things we've heard consistently is that this cutoff or clinical is greater than 300 as sort of arbitrary and that this drug would see -- maybe add value to patients with clinical accounts as low as 200 to 250. Just maybe your thoughts on this, and how you anticipate to sort of take advantage of that.\nLeonard Schleifer: Yes. Well, let me start with the regulatory aspect. The -- obviously, what we're all staring at is an incredibly positive state -- I mean a Phase III setting, where, as we've mentioned, that we not only improve people's exacerbations, but we also improved their lung functions and the lung function and their quality of life, and all these other measures that were part of the statistical hierarchy. So when you have a very robust study like that, and you have -- I don't know how many patients we currently have, but it's a huge number, a very large patient commercial database and so many indications, I think Sanofi and Regeneron concur, that this is something that we should be discussing with the FDA to see how they feel about whether or not there is a potential filing. We don't have any update for you, if it's something once we have that meeting, if it's something definitive, I'm sure Sanofi and Regeneron will figure out a way to properly communicate that. In terms of cutoffs and what have you, I think it's a little bit premature to talk about that, other than to say you stick with what you brought to the trial, which is a cutoff of 300. And that's where you commercialize. But the future work one can look at in other studies, that's something obviously we'll think about. But I remind you as George and both Marion mentioned, our IL-33 antibody gives a larger, although somewhat overlapping population potentially. So we really could have cover many, many, many patients, a great opportunity to help people with what has been really a very unfortunate progressive loss of lung function.\nMarion McCourt: Len to your comment, you were talking about numbers of patients. I can fill in there that as of March worldwide, we had over 600,000 patients on DUPIXENT in 57 countries.\nLeonard Schleifer: Right. So that speaks a lot to the post-marketing experience of the product.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.\nBrian Abrahams: Shifting gears, you recently reported with your partner, APP data in Alzheimer's. I'm curious what this proof of principle potentially opens up beyond this indication? How quickly you can expand into some of the other neurodegenerative diseases that you mentioned, and your level of confidence overall in the safety of the program.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Well, we think that the data were really game changing. I mean this is the first time in human history that one has been able to use this very exciting siRNA technology within the brain and silence, to a very high degree, higher-than-expected levels an important pathological gene. Obviously, this could have important implications for Alzheimer's itself. But as you point out, the application goes way beyond that. To every neurodegenerative disease, there are also other types of CNS diseases as well. We have a number of programs that we're working with Alnylam. We have exclusive relationship with them on all of these CNS targets. And we're trying to expedite a lot of them based on the exciting results from this initial clinical work into the clinic. And we're also trying to expedite many of our programs that are behind as well. So we really think this opens up an entirely new way of addressing a whole assortment of brain diseases and neuropsychiatric diseases, not just neurodegenerative diseases. We're in exciting times. We have to go cautiously. We have to hope that the initial results, in terms of the safety profile and so forth, hold up. We're all in the early days, and we don't know for sure. But the low doses with which we saw this very marked reduction in the target give us a lot of hope that we can have a sufficient therapeutic window that will be applicable to these large variety of disease that could potentially be addressable by this modality.\nLeonard Schleifer: So I just wanted to add to that, two things: streaming on a different channel, I think you might find some further data being discussed by our friends at Alnylam, which will speak to not only impressive result, but the durability of the effect. And one of the other things I want to comment is really to echo something George said. The recent amyloid plaque clearing antibody results by Lilly previously, by Biogen, are really quite important. But as George said, even with the adjuvant, there's still going to be a tremendous burden of Alzheimer's disease. But what the data seem to be speaking towards is that the process is ongoing, is that the pathologic role of amyloid is not over. And as George said, having another way, perhaps upstream, stopping the production of amyloid, maybe even a more advantageous way to deal with the ongoing process that amyloid seems to be generating, which is what the antibody data, I think, seems to be speaking to us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\nSalveen Richter: So with regard to EYLEA high-dose becoming the larger share of revenue on the forward here, can you give us any color here on discussions with payers and how to think about formulary fit?\nMarion McCourt: So Salveen, we are actively involved in all aspects of launch preparation. And certainly, that includes all elements and levers associated with premarket activities and then getting ready for the launch activities. We do have in place a very sophisticated market access, payer and pricing team. And at the appropriate times, they most definitely will be involved with payers and other organized customers that will be important in our launch efforts. Additionally, this is a customer base that we know very well from our over a decade experience with EYLEA, so we look forward to potential FDA approval and launch activities and working with all of our customer stakeholders. I'll also mention again the importance in the retinal space of the key opinion leaders and prescribers and the enthusiasm they have for a product that really can be a game changer for their patients in terms of visual acuity, duration and the safety profile they've come to know with EYLEA. So we're very enthusiastic and look forward to the launch opportunity, and we'll be ready.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Akash Tewari with Jefferies. You may proceed.\nAkash Tewari: So just to clarify the moving parts on U.S. EYLEA, there was a 5% market share loss, a $70 million inventory impact and then lower price. Any color on what the net price impact was on the quarter, and how it should evolve in the back half of '23? And additionally, should we expect EYLEA market share to hold at 70% going forward, or potentially start to grow again as high-dose EYLEA launches?\nMarion McCourt: So let me take some of the items, and others may want to jump in here, too. But first, I would say that some of the calculation related to market share shift is not exactly correct. There was some decline in the quarter, but not to the height that you mentioned. When I look at market shares through the entirety of the first quarter period, then as described, it is a more competitive market, a variety of, obviously, competitors, very low cost and others. And overall, EYLEA performance is in a very strong situation as we look today to planning for our future portfolio and the aflibercept 8-milligram launch. As to the specifics of pricing and calculation to the net, I can't give you specifics on that number. But I do think that we gave you some transparency on the overall item related to inventory, overall competitive pressures and then our preparation for our next launch in the category coming up shortly, we hope, following FDA approval.\nLeonard Schleifer: Obviously, as Marion mentioned, on a sequential basis, demand was modestly up. So obviously, we were offset by the factors that Marion referred to.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nChris Schott: I just had a question on the IL-33 in COPD. I guess just the success you've had with your kind of study design and results with DUPIXENT increase at all your confidence in that program. And just, I guess, maybe just elaborate little bit on, how you see kind of those 2 agents kind of interacting as we think about the space overall?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. We are more optimistic, obviously, that all of our decisions, all of the data that led us to do the particular study and the particular population of patients in COPD with DUPIXENT was made based on a lot of factors. And we also had, from our Regeneron Genetics Center, very strong human genetic evidence suggesting that it would have activity particularly where we actually saw activity. And so all of that gives us confidence -- since we use the same criteria, the same approaches and so forth to plan and design our IL-33 study, certainly, the fact that everything that went into one and it all worked so remarkably well gives us confidence that the same approaches will lead to success with the IL-33. The results with DUPIXENT were really outstanding, as we've already mentioned. Not only a clinically meaningful reduction in exacerbations, but we hit all these other important endpoints, most importantly, improvement in lung function, as well as you rarely hit these quality of life improvements unless you have a really active agent that the patients can really feel the difference for their function and for their quality of life. With IL-33, the genetics is very strong. We have a Phase II study in the subgroup that we're doing the Phase III study in. It was in that group. We have demonstrated a 42% reduction in exacerbations in the Phase II study. This will be an overlapping population with our DUPIXENT population. We think we already have a chance to really make a huge difference for this high unmet need population that really has had no new mechanism of action of drugs brought to help these patients for a very, very long time. We have one with Dupixent, and we're hoping to hit another one with IL-33. And this could make such a huge difference for these patients who have been suffering for so long without much hope. It could really make a big difference for this population.\nLeonard Schleifer: I just wanted to repeat, maybe George said it probably 2 or 3 times, but maybe it's worth saying a fourth time. And yesteryear, the way you did drug development is you identified a target based on some biology or what have you, you did your Phase I and Phase II, and you hope that Phase II was an indicator for how your Phase III was going to turn out. And obviously, that's how it is still done today. But what George mentioned is that we can layer on top of it in sort of a unique way our genetic insights and look and validate and say, is it reasonable to expect that if you block a certain target that you're going to have a beneficial effect? Is that target associated with the disease you're treating? And I know George said it 3 times, but I think it's worth saying a fourth time. That really gives you added confidence that's uniquely Regeneron in many respects, how we can get this genetic information. People ask us a lot, if you think about the number of people that have been sequenced in the world, George can comment when I'm done, I know we've sequenced a large part of them and coupled that with all this medical, anonymized medical information. We use that in so many ways, not only to identify targets, but to validate the work we're doing in specific targets, specific diseases. George, how much have we done?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: We've seen about half of all the humans who have been sequenced.\nLeonard Schleifer: So I mean, that's a large database of millions. And I think that, that is what you're hearing is that that's why we had more confidence perhaps than others did with DUPIXENT and now with anti-IL-33.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Since [Indiscernible] expand it a little bit, just let you know how it works. What we do is we identify genetic variations that mimic the blocking of a drug or exacerbation of this type 2 pathway. And what we showed for DUPIXENT, for the genetic variations that mimic DUPIXENT, those people were protected from COPD, particularly the type 2 COPD patients. Whereas increased activity of the IL-4/13 path was associated with more disease. And obviously, that turned out to be the case. I mean it's human genetics. It's a very, very powerful predictor. And we've done the same thing, as Len said, with IL-33, where we have genetic variation at mimics blocking the pathway or exacerbating the pathway. And as I've said, this is one of the secrets to our ability to have high success rates in our studies is we use that as a criteria to make our decisions going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Yatin Suneja with Guggenheim Securities. You may proceed.\nEddie Hickman: This is Eddie Hickman on for Yatin. I was wondering if you could talk about the draft guidance from the FDA on the anti-VEGF trial designs? And if that impacts your outlook on the high-dose program at all?\nLeonard Schleifer: I don't think that has any impact on us, on our program.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Risinger with SVB Securities.\nDavid Risinger: I guess I'll just go straight to the question. Len, you had mentioned in your opening remarks the ongoing diversification of the company's revenues away from EYLEA. Could you please discuss your expectations for EYLEA U.S. sales growth in the near term, including the total EYLEA franchise prospects after Regeneron launches the HD? Thank you.\nLeonard Schleifer: Let me go right to the answer since you ran right to the question. We don't give future guidance on specific quantitative measures of our sales. On a qualitative basis, Marion has said, that we're anticipating that the combination of EYLEA and 8 milligrams aflibercept will be a growth franchise over time for the company.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hartaj Singh with Oppenheimer. You may proceed.\nHartaj Singh: Just a quick question on linvoseltamab. At ASH, you presented a Phase I data, and these were your dose ranging, I guess, data. Really interesting data you present at ASH. At ASCO, what should we expect to see? Will it be dose expansion data? And then any duration also on the patients from ASH? And then what would FDA like to see before you can go ahead and submit the application?\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Well, I think you're going to actually see an update on our pivotal Phase II data, the actual data that was a little bit more maturing, with a further update we will be hoping to submit to the to the FDA for our BLA. So the data will be very close. We think the data will even get better as it matures. Because as we all know, response rates and so forth get better with time as you follow these patients. But these data are going to show what we believe are the potential to have best-in-class efficacy, as well as safety in the favorable dosing schedule based on the results that we'll show from our pivotal study at the upcoming ASCO.\nRyan Crowe: I think we have time for two more questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. You may proceed.\nCarter Gould: Sorry to belabor EYLEA. I guess just simply, what's the pricing pressure that you guys highlighted in Q1. Was that a seasonal dynamic? Or would you characterize it as that? Or something more permanent around that market landscape going forward?\nLeonard Schleifer: Before Marion answers that, I just want to come back to the BCMA story a little bit, because it's one that I'm particularly excited about. The bispecific field, which was initiated by Regeneron in terms of using bispecifics, I think we were the first to put the biospecific into patients, has obviously become a very clouded space. and it's sometimes hard to differentiate what you've got compared to what the competition has and you look at somebody claiming one thing and you're claiming another and so on and so forth. But if you take a dispassionate view, I think for the BCMAxCD3 program, you could really see a differentiated molecules and the potential to be best-in-class. Antibodies are not all created equal. Bispecifics are not all created equally. You do see differences. Clinical trial programs and not all created equally. This is one I'd really encourage you to think a very careful look at and compare. Now there was some question on EYLEA. Marion, you're going to answer that.\nMarion McCourt: Sure. And Carter, getting back to your question on the competitive dynamic and pricing pressure. I think if you look at the anti-VEGF category and look at it over time, go back multiple quarters, there has been increasing competitive pressure. And that does then have a corollary to some extent on pricing dynamic, and that would go forward. But I just want to share and remind all that in the category in the VEGF category, what really is rewarded is product profile. And as we look at a product like EYLEA that launched and was a game changer in the category, that was profile not being the least costly, right? There's been a low-cost alternative, very low-cost alternative for a very, very long time, but it was the product profile that made the difference for prescribers and patients. So that will always be a very important dynamic to look at going forward, and certainly has strong interest for prescribers as we bring a new product into the marketplace following FDA approval with aflibercept 8 milligram. But to your point, pricing pressure will continue in this category. But what's most important is product profile and the clinical attributes that the patient experiences.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO. You may proceed.\nEvan Seigerman: I'd love to have you expand on some of the feedback you've been hearing from physicians regarding the 8-milligram dose. Maybe some color as to how they plan on using it and assuming approval comes June.\nMarion McCourt: So of course, the updates on actual prescribing will be even more important as the product comes into the marketplace and physicians have an opportunity to use it and select patients. We obviously have done a lot of work with our medical team, looked at the clinical data with specialists. And to give you an early answer to your question, I think there's opportunity for a variety of patients that are deemed to be appropriate candidates. And there's a range. Certainly, when physicians are considering new patient starts, it's very attractive. We obviously have a strong portion of patients that are naive to EYLEA today, but in the future, the question becomes, why wouldn't you start a new patient with a product that gives you all the visual acuity benefits and safety of EYLEA, but it also gives you that durability and duration? Because obviously, physicians know their patients are anxious and don't like to have more injections in the eye than they need to. Similarly, you might have a patient that's very well controlled on another product, maybe EYLEA, maybe another product in the anti-VEGF category. But you'd like to give them that opportunity for duration and, maybe in some cases, if the product is in another area of the anti-VEGF category, improved visual acuity and duration. So I would say it's the combination of interest for patients who might be broadly anti-VEGF category switch patients, or the potential for new patients as well. I hope that helps, and I look forward to the day when we can give you specifics for market experience.\nRyan Crowe: Thank you, Marion, and thanks to everybody who dialed in, and for your interest in Regeneron. We apologize to those remaining in the queue that we did not have a chance to get to. As always, the IR team is available to answer any remaining questions that anyone may have. Thank you once again, and have a great day, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Marion McCourt",
            "content": "Thank you, George. Our first quarter performance demonstrates ongoing leadership across multiple therapeutic categories. Taken together, our in-market brands anticipated near-term launches and extensive development pipeline uniquely position Regeneron to expand our leadership across multiple disease areas. First quarter EYLEA U.S. net product sales declined 6% year-over-year to $1.43 billion. On a sequential quarter basis, EYLEA U.S. net product sales decreased 4%, reflecting the favorable impact of higher demand volume, offset by lower sequential wholesaler inventory levels, higher sales-related deductions and increasing competitive pressure. EYLEA captured approximately 70% branded share in the first quarter. Based on presentations at scientific meetings, the retina community has expressed increasing enthusiasm about Regeneron's portfolio with the aflibercept 8-milligram PDUFA date, now 7 weeks away. EYLEA is the well-established gold standard anti-VEGF treatment and aflibercept 8-milligram has the potential to be as paradigm changing as EYLEA when it was introduced more than a decade ago. In clinical trials of aflibercept 8-milligram demonstrated improvements in visual acuity with less frequent injections and a safety profile comparable to EYLEA, exactly what retina specialists have told us they need in a next-generation medicine. Launch preparations are well underway, and we look forward to bringing this important treatment option to patients following FDA approval. On Libtayo, which is foundational to Regeneron's oncology portfolio, first quarter global net product sales grew 49% on a constant currency basis, reaching $183 million, which includes $6 million from Sanofi transition sales in international markets. In the U.S., net sales grew 39% to $110 million. Libtayo continues to lead the market in both advanced CSCC and advanced BCC as demand volume increases. Following last November's FDA approval of Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy for first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer, new patient starts have accelerated as physicians of Libtayo has an important new treatment option, initiatives to raise brand awareness and improve access have driven share gains in both the academic and community settings. Outside the U.S., Libtayo net sales grew 67% on a constant currency basis to $73 million, driven by steadily increasing demand and additional country launches. The European Commission recently approved Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy for PD-L1 positive lung cancer, and we are in the process of securing access and reimbursement for this new indication. Turning to DUPIXENT. First quarter global net sales grew 40% on a constant currency basis to $2.49 billion. In the U.S., net sales grew 43% to $1.9 billion, with notable volume growth across all approved indications. Driven by its outstanding efficacy and safety profile, DUPIXENT is the number one prescribed biologic for new patients in all 5 of its approved indications. In atopic dermatitis, DUPIXENT is the leading systemic treatment based on its unique mechanism of action, clinical profile and real world experience. Strong prescribing trends continue across moderate and severe disease and across approved age ranges. There's also significant opportunity to further increase market penetration as DUPIXENT is uniquely positioned to provide an effective, safe and convenient treatment for patients 6 months and older. In prurigo nodularis, DUPIXENT is the only FDA-approved systemic treatment. Launch update is progressing well, and we anticipate ongoing growth as we leverage our dermatology commercialization capabilities for patients in need. Across the competitive asthma space, DUPIXENT continues to gain market share as naive and biologic switch patients are initiated on treatment. DUPIXENT also continues to capture the majority of market demand in nasal polyps with increased prescribing from allergists and ENTs. Our cytosolic esophagitis launch is exceeding expectations. In the first year following U.S. approval, more than 11,000 patients have initiated therapy, demonstrating extensive unmet patient need and our strong launch execution and collaboration with Sanofi. Both gastroenterologist and analogists have embraced DUPIXENTas the new standard of care setting meaningful improvements in disease symptoms and quality of life for those now on therapy. A new patient campaign is underway to raise awareness of the scientific advancements in treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis. Outside the U.S., DUPIXENTnet sales were $587 million, growing 30% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across approved indications and launches in new geographies. Recent European approvals of eosinophilic esophagitis, prurigo nodularis and atopic dermatitis in young children are expected to contribute to DUPIXENT's ongoing growth. In summary, our commercial portfolio continues to diversify across many serious medical conditions and delivered solid results in the quarter. Moving forward, we are well positioned to serve even more patients driven by the strength of our existing portfolio, coupled with anticipated launches that have the potential to advance standards of care. With that, I'll turn the call to Bob. Sure, very happy to comment. And as I noted, as we're reporting on the quarter performance on a sequential basis, we did see with EYLEA, if I look at a sequential quarterly basis, we did see with EYLEA a net product sales decrease of 4%. As I mentioned, it was driven by a number of factors. Certainly, competitive pressure is one, but we also reflected on while we had slightly higher demand volume. It was offset by lower sequential wholesaler inventory levels and overall tire sales-related deductions. Specifically as it relates to competitive pressure, I would say that this is overall competitive dynamic in the anti-VEGF category, not something that we would necessarily identify with a particular product, more the totality of competition. I will comment that in the quarter, we certainly maintained a 70% branded share and over at approximately, I believe it was a 46% share in the overall anti-VEGF category. So certainly standard of care with EYLEA. And very importantly, we look forward to launching aflibercept 8 milligram, as I mentioned now, is about 7 weeks away. Sure, Tyler. I can give you the detail there. So while still within the normal range of inventory related to your question on EYLEA in the quarter in the normal range is 5 to 10 days, our inventory levels were approximately three days lower at the end of the first quarter of 2023 compared to the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. And when you do the calculation on that, as I'm sure you all will do, that's a negative impact in the first quarter net sales of approximately $70 million. Sure, very happy to comment. And as we think of DUPIXENT and all the different therapeutic disease areas and specialists that we cover with some indications, there certainly is an amazing and wonderful synergy. And you give an example with COPD launch potentially. And obviously, today, we're in market with our asthma indication and with nasal polyps. As we look forward with COPD, it's a really important launch, an indication to help patients in a way potentially that, as George described, hasn't been achieved ever for this population. So we have the opportunity to use our existing footprint, specifically in covering respiratory specialists, pulmonologists. But we'll also evaluate very closely with Sanofi, as you've seen us done in dermatology indications, where we might need some additional coverage and where the synergy is adequate, and we'll be very disciplined and very thoughtful about that. But you can be assured that we'll make certain that we appropriately give commercialization effort to such an important indication of COPD. I'll add to the enthusiasm here too in COPD, the potential to have a second product following DUPIXENT as well. So this will be a very important future area for helping patients. Len to your comment, you were talking about numbers of patients. I can fill in there that as of March worldwide, we had over 600,000 patients on DUPIXENT in 57 countries. So Salveen, we are actively involved in all aspects of launch preparation. And certainly, that includes all elements and levers associated with premarket activities and then getting ready for the launch activities. We do have in place a very sophisticated market access, payer and pricing team. And at the appropriate times, they most definitely will be involved with payers and other organized customers that will be important in our launch efforts. Additionally, this is a customer base that we know very well from our over a decade experience with EYLEA, so we look forward to potential FDA approval and launch activities and working with all of our customer stakeholders. I'll also mention again the importance in the retinal space of the key opinion leaders and prescribers and the enthusiasm they have for a product that really can be a game changer for their patients in terms of visual acuity, duration and the safety profile they've come to know with EYLEA. So we're very enthusiastic and look forward to the launch opportunity, and we'll be ready. So let me take some of the items, and others may want to jump in here, too. But first, I would say that some of the calculation related to market share shift is not exactly correct. There was some decline in the quarter, but not to the height that you mentioned. When I look at market shares through the entirety of the first quarter period, then as described, it is a more competitive market, a variety of, obviously, competitors, very low cost and others. And overall, EYLEA performance is in a very strong situation as we look today to planning for our future portfolio and the aflibercept 8-milligram launch. As to the specifics of pricing and calculation to the net, I can't give you specifics on that number. But I do think that we gave you some transparency on the overall item related to inventory, overall competitive pressures and then our preparation for our next launch in the category coming up shortly, we hope, following FDA approval. Sure. And Carter, getting back to your question on the competitive dynamic and pricing pressure. I think if you look at the anti-VEGF category and look at it over time, go back multiple quarters, there has been increasing competitive pressure. And that does then have a corollary to some extent on pricing dynamic, and that would go forward. But I just want to share and remind all that in the category in the VEGF category, what really is rewarded is product profile. And as we look at a product like EYLEA that launched and was a game changer in the category, that was profile not being the least costly, right?

            "name": "Leonard Schleifer",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone joining today's call. Following our significant achievements in 2022, Regeneron is off to a good start in 2023, highlighted by important regulatory and pipeline advances, commercial execution and prudent capital allocation, all of which position better the company to deliver sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value over time. George, Mary and Bob will cover details of our first quarter performance in a few moments. In the meantime, I would provide an update on our goal of continuing to grow our business while simultaneously diversifying our revenue and earnings streams, which is part of our long-term vision for Regeneron. We have made substantial progress toward achieving that goal. Over the past four years, while total revenues have nearly doubled, EYLEA accounted for only 57% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 88% of total revenues for the year 2019. Driven primarily by the growth of DUPIXENT, our Sanofi collaboration accounted for 25% of our total revenues in the first quarter of 2023 compared to only 6% of our total revenues in 2019. We expect this trend of revenue growth, along with diversification to continue. For example, assuming the approval and successful launch of aflibercept 8 milligrams, which has a June 27 PDUFA date, EYLEA 2 milligrams is expected to become a smaller share of our revenues, while aflibercept 8 milligrams is expected to contribute to overall revenue growth. In addition, DUPIXENT remains in a high-growth mode, with global net product sales up 40% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year quarter, driven by growth across all 5 approved indications. We believe the positive Phase III results for DUPIXENT in the subpopulation of COPD patients with evidence of type 2 inflammation, as well as the promising results for our IL-33 antibody itepekimab in former smokers represent additional significant opportunities to accelerate revenue growth as well as diversification. Our oncology portfolio is also starting to make a meaningful contribution to our top line, with last year's acquisition of full global rights to Libtayo and the recent launch of Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Moreover, we believe that fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody, in combination with Libtayo, has the potential to become an important therapy in both melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, where we have already advanced to pivotal studies. We are also quite excited about the emerging clinical profile for linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific. Updated data for which will be presented at the upcoming ASCO Annual Meeting. We remain on track to submit a BLA seeking accelerated approval in late-stage myeloma later this year. We continue to invest in our research and development engine and expect it will deliver new differentiated medicines that will drive organic growth over time. Our broad development pipeline of nearly 3 dozen programs spans many different therapeutic areas and modalities, notably: Our co-stimulatory bispecifics in cancer; our early pipeline in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; as well as our collaborations with Alnylam, Intellia, Decibel and others are expected to drive medium- and long-term revenue growth, profitability and diversification. Before handing over to George, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the contributions that Dr. Roy Vagelos has made to Regeneron over the nearly three decades that he has served as our Board Chair. Over the years, he has provided invaluable guidance and he continues to inspire us as we work to turn world-class science into medicines. Roy will retire from the Board after his current term ends next month. At that time, in addition to our current roles in the company, George and I will be appointed by the Board to serve as co-Chairs, and Christine Poon, a member of Regeneron board since 2010, will be appointed as the board's Lead Independent Director. With that, let me turn the call over to George. So on the regulatory update, we don't comment on ongoing stuff. I'd like to say we're looking forward, hopefully, to the action of the FDA on June 27 and the launch promptly thereafter. Marion, you can comment on the inventories. And it's interesting, just to add a little bit to that, Marion, that the allergists seem to have really understood the concept of type 2 inflammation. And the fact that type 2 inflammation is not a collection of individual unrelated diseases, it's a collection of related diseases. And I was speaking to an allergist the other day and said when you take an asthma patient, if you look carefully, many of them will have nasal polyps. And if you talk to dermatologists, they're beginning to understand that when they're treating atopic dermatitis, people who have concomitant asthma, for example, they get a benefit there. So I think DUPIXENT really is kind of unique. And we are talking to the main doctors, including the allergists, the dermatologists and the pulmonologists, with some of the ENT, as Marion said. We're covering them all, and many of them are covering multiple diseases. Obviously, we work very closely with Sanofi and all of these. And I believe it's fair to say we're equally excited about the potential for the future of DUPIXENT in all the current and, hopefully, future indications. Yes. Well, let me start with the regulatory aspect. The -- obviously, what we're all staring at is an incredibly positive state -- I mean a Phase III setting, where, as we've mentioned, that we not only improve people's exacerbations, but we also improved their lung functions and the lung function and their quality of life, and all these other measures that were part of the statistical hierarchy. So when you have a very robust study like that, and you have -- I don't know how many patients we currently have, but it's a huge number, a very large patient commercial database and so many indications, I think Sanofi and Regeneron concur, that this is something that we should be discussing with the FDA to see how they feel about whether or not there is a potential filing. We don't have any update for you, if it's something once we have that meeting, if it's something definitive, I'm sure Sanofi and Regeneron will figure out a way to properly communicate that. In terms of cutoffs and what have you, I think it's a little bit premature to talk about that, other than to say you stick with what you brought to the trial, which is a cutoff of 300. And that's where you commercialize. But the future work one can look at in other studies, that's something obviously we'll think about. But I remind you as George and both Marion mentioned, our IL-33 antibody gives a larger, although somewhat overlapping population potentially. So we really could have cover many, many, many patients, a great opportunity to help people with what has been really a very unfortunate progressive loss of lung function. Right. So that speaks a lot to the post-marketing experience of the product. So I just wanted to add to that, two things: streaming on a different channel, I think you might find some further data being discussed by our friends at Alnylam, which will speak to not only impressive result, but the durability of the effect. And one of the other things I want to comment is really to echo something George said. The recent amyloid plaque clearing antibody results by Lilly previously, by Biogen, are really quite important. But as George said, even with the adjuvant, there's still going to be a tremendous burden of Alzheimer's disease. But what the data seem to be speaking towards is that the process is ongoing, is that the pathologic role of amyloid is not over. And as George said, having another way, perhaps upstream, stopping the production of amyloid, maybe even a more advantageous way to deal with the ongoing process that amyloid seems to be generating, which is what the antibody data, I think, seems to be speaking to us. Obviously, as Marion mentioned, on a sequential basis, demand was modestly up. So obviously, we were offset by the factors that Marion referred to. I just wanted to repeat, maybe George said it probably 2 or 3 times, but maybe it's worth saying a fourth time. And yesteryear, the way you did drug development is you identified a target based on some biology or what have you, you did your Phase I and Phase II, and you hope that Phase II was an indicator for how your Phase III was going to turn out. And obviously, that's how it is still done today. But what George mentioned is that we can layer on top of it in sort of a unique way our genetic insights and look and validate and say, is it reasonable to expect that if you block a certain target that you're going to have a beneficial effect? Is that target associated with the disease you're treating? And I know George said it 3 times, but I think it's worth saying a fourth time. That really gives you added confidence that's uniquely Regeneron in many respects, how we can get this genetic information. People ask us a lot, if you think about the number of people that have been sequenced in the world, George can comment when I'm done, I know we've sequenced a large part of them and coupled that with all this medical, anonymized medical information. We use that in so many ways, not only to identify targets, but to validate the work we're doing in specific targets, specific diseases. George, how much have we done? So I mean, that's a large database of millions. And I think that, that is what you're hearing is that that's why we had more confidence perhaps than others did with DUPIXENT and now with anti-IL-33. I don't think that has any impact on us, on our program. Let me go right to the answer since you ran right to the question. We don't give future guidance on specific quantitative measures of our sales. On a qualitative basis, Marion has said, that we're anticipating that the combination of EYLEA and 8 milligrams aflibercept will be a growth franchise over time for the company. Before Marion answers that, I just want to come back to the BCMA story a little bit, because it's one that I'm particularly excited about. The bispecific field, which was initiated by Regeneron in terms of using bispecifics, I think we were the first to put the biospecific into patients, has obviously become a very clouded space. and it's sometimes hard to differentiate what you've got compared to what the competition has and you look at somebody claiming one thing and you're claiming another and so on and so forth. But if you take a dispassionate view, I think for the BCMAxCD3 program, you could really see a differentiated molecules and the potential to be best-in-class. Antibodies are not all created equal. Bispecifics are not all created equally. You do see differences. Clinical trial programs and not all created equally. This is one I'd really encourage you to think a very careful look at and compare. Now there was some question on EYLEA. Marion, you're going to answer that."

            "content": "Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron performed well in the first quarter of 2023 with solid financial results. First quarter total revenues increased 7% year-over-year to $3.2 billion as DUPIXENT and Libtayo contribute to increasingly diversified revenue and earning streams. First quarter diluted net income per share was $10.09 on net income of $1.2 billion, which included a previously announced $0.42 impact of acquired IPR&D. Beginning with collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. First quarter 2023 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $847 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis versus first quarter 2022. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $357 million, of which $332 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $798 million in the first quarter and grew 26% versus last year's first quarter, which included a $50 million sales milestone that did not recur this year. Our share of profits from the commercialization of DUPIXENT and KEVZARA was $637 million, an increase of 53% versus the prior year. We continue to see increasing profitability from our antibody collaboration and expect further margin expansion as we begin to realize drug substance yield improvements from a new Regeneron developed manufacturing process for DUPIXENT. Finally, we recorded Roche collaboration revenue of $222 million in the first quarter for our share of gross profits from ex U.S. sales of Ronapreve related to a previously signed contract. We do not expect to record any additional revenue from Ronapreve in 2023, absent a new contract. Moving now to operating expenses. First quarter 2023 R&D expense increased 28% year-over-year to $960 million as we continue to invest in our pipeline to drive organic growth. The increase in R&D was primarily driven by higher headcount and related costs and funding of the company's growing pipeline, which now encompasses approximately 35 programs in clinical development in more than 15 ongoing late-stage studies with additional study starts expected this year. These late-stage programs include our expanding fianlimab development program, upcoming Phase III studies and early reliance for our hem/onc assets, as well as ongoing development programs for DUPIXENT and itepekimab for which we now record our full 50% share of development costs as a result of the Libtayo transaction. SG&A expense increased 32% year-over-year to $515 million due to higher contributions to an independent, not-for-profit patient assistance organization, higher headcount and related costs, and the impact of the Libtayo transaction. First quarter 2023 COCM was $249 million, up 26% versus last year, due to increases in shipments of ex-U.S. commercial supplies of Praluent to Sanofi and manufacturing costs for Dupixent. Reimbursements for these production costs are recorded as part of other revenue in Sanofi collaboration revenue respectively. Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the first quarter of 2023, Regeneron generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities, less debt, of $12.3 billion. We have continued to strategically deploy our cash to deliver on our capital allocation priorities, which are focused on investing in innovation, both internal and external, as well as returning capital to shareholders. We purchased nearly $700 million of our shares in the first quarter with $3.1 billion remaining under our existing authorization as of March 31. Additionally, as George discussed, we announced the collaboration with Sonoma Biotherapeutics, investing $75 million through an upfront payment and equity investment to add a new approach to our scientific capabilities. I'd like to conclude with some select updates to our financial guidance and outlook for 2023. We are updating 2023 COCM guidance to be in the range of $820 million to $880 million, an increase of $90 million at the midpoint, reflecting increased shipments of ex-U.S. commercial supplies for Praluent and DUPIXENT to Sanofi. Importantly, these anticipated incremental expenses will be reimbursed by Sanofi, generally resulting in a neutral impact to Regeneron's 2023 operating profit. Approximately half of the incremental $90 million of reimbursements from Sanofi are expected to be recorded as Sanofi collaboration revenue, with the balance recorded as other revenue. As a result, we now expect 2023 other revenue to be higher than 2022 other revenue. For modeling purposes, second quarter 2023 other revenue is expected to be the lowest of the 2023 quarters, with the vast majority of the remaining other revenue to be recorded in the second half of this year. We are also updating our 2023 gross margin to be between 89% to 91%. The change in expected gross margin is primarily driven by an unfavorable change in product mix, as well as an increase in the start-up costs associated with our new fill/finish facility located in upstate New York. Finally, we are lowering our guidance for our effective tax rate to 10% to 12%, reflecting the benefit of higher than previously anticipated stock-based compensation deductions. In conclusion, Regeneron continued to deliver robust financial results in the first quarter of 2023, and the company remains well positioned to drive further growth in the remainder of the year and beyond. With that, I will now pass the call back to Ryan. So with regards to your question on leverage, first off, welcome back. Nice to have you back on the team. You'll see with the issuance of our 10-Q this morning with regards to our share of the antibody alliance, we're going to pick up quarter year-over-year for the quarter, roughly 300 basis points. And again, that's half the economics on the transaction. So we're beginning to see really great leverage in to Marion's comment that should continue on with the COPD indication."

            "name": "George Yancopoulos",
            "content": "Thank you, Len. The first quarter of 2023 delivered multiple significant milestones for Regeneron and for our collaborations, from the positive DUPIXENT Phase III COPD data to progress in our oncology pipeline, as well as exciting new landmarks from our genetic medicines programs. Starting with DUPIXENT. In March, together with our Sanofi collaborators, we announced that DUPIXENT was the first immune mechanism of action treatment to produce statistically significant and clinically meaningful results in a Phase III trial for COPD in over a decade.  Our BOREAS trial enrolled COPD patients with moderate to severe disease and evidence of type 2 inflammation. DUPIXENT-treated patients demonstrated a clinically meaningful 30% reduction in exacerbations, a significant improvement in lung function as well as quality of life benefits: an impressive trifecta in a potential paradigm-changing treatment for this deadly disease. We are looking forward to presenting the detailed BOREAS results in a late-breaking presentation at the upcoming American Thoracic Society Meeting later this month. We also plan to discuss these exciting results with regulatory authorities and expect to report results mid next year for the replicate Phase III NOTUS study. I would remind you that we are also trying to address an overlapping COPD population with our IL-33 antibody, which is in Phase III studies based on positive Phase II proof-of-concept data. This approach is further supported by genetic analysis from our Regeneron Genetics Center, which demonstrated association of loss of function in IL-33 with reduced COPD risk. Similar genetic analysis supported the role for a DUPIXENT benefit in COPD. The BOREAS COPD data indicates that DUPIXENT can help even more patients beyond the 5 current FDA-approved indications and diseases caused or exacerbated by type 2 inflammation, including atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis. We are also expecting an FDA decision for DUPIXENT for chronic spontaneous urticaria on October 22, 2023, and we are continuing to tailor DUPIXENT development to patients with other type 2 inflammatory diseases, most likely to be responsive to this method. Moving to oncology. With the progress of our late and early stage pipeline, we are looking forward to several important milestones this year. Starting with Libtayo. In addition to expanded use in lung cancer, Libtayo was recently added to the NCCN guidelines for neoadjuvant treatment of CSCC. The Libtayo U.S. label was also recently updated with more mature CSCC and BCC data, supporting its differentiated clinical profile in these tumor settings and satisfying all post-marketing commitments that require full approval in these indications. Regarding our exciting new combinations with Libtayo. Starting with fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibodies, for which we are planning a broad pivotal program spanning several cancer indications. These efforts were triggered by our robust and confirmed data in first-line metastatic melanoma patients, which will be presented in further detail at ASCO, suggesting that the fianlimab-Libtayo combination could produce about double the response rates with longer progression-free survival, the anti-PD monotherapy standard. Based on this, we have already initiated pivotal trials in metastatic and adjuvant melanoma, and we will start a study in perioperative melanoma in the second half of the year. In addition, based on promising data in small patient cohorts, we started a seamless Phase II/III pivotal study for treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, and we will soon start a Phase II study in the perioperative setting. Next, the bispecifics for solid tumors, which are being investigated in combination with Libtayo. Earlier this year, ASCO's GU represented initial positive first-in-human data for our PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with Libtayo in advanced prostate cancer, the tumor type considered immunologically cold and largely unresponsive to anti-PD-1 therapy alone. Over the next 12 months we plan to present updated PSMAxCD28 data in more patients, some of which will have been prophylactically treated with our anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, sarilumab, to potentially reduce the severity of immune-mediated side effects while maintaining or improving antitumor activity. Also during this time frame, we plan to present data in advanced ovarian cancer for both our MUC16xCD3 bispecific in our MUC16xCD3 co-stimulatory bispecific as well as data in several tumor types from our EGFRxCD28 costimulatory bispecific, or in combination with Libtayo. Our hematology oncology pipeline continues to advance. In an oral presentation at the upcoming ASCO Annual Meeting, we will present updated data for linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific tested in late-line multiple myeloma. We believe these data will show that linvoseltamab has the best-in-class potential with differentiated efficacy, safety and a favorable dosing schedule in the competitive environment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma treatment candidates. We remain on track for a regulatory submission in the United States in the second half of this year for linvoseltamab. For odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific, we are on track to complete U.S. and EU regulatory submissions for both relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in the second half of this year. Odronextamab in late-line relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma has a potential best-in-class efficacy profile, and our optimized step-up dosing regimen has improved our generic safety profile without impacting efficacy. Also, we have initiated a first-in-human study of our CD20xCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with odronextamab in relapsed/refractory DLBCL, which we hope could further improve upon the anticancer benefit for these patients. Now to genetics medicines. Starting with our collaboration with Alnylam, and siRNA therapeutics. Just last week, we and Alnylam announced an important update for our Alnylam APP program in early onset Alzheimer's disease. For the first time, an siRNA therapeutic demonstrates sustained silencing of a pathological gene in the central nerve system in a clinical trial. In the earnings call this morning, our Alnylam collaborators provided additional details on these results. Our siRNA approach aims to prevent production of amyloid precursor protein as opposed to clearing existing amyloid plaques after they have already formed, providing a new way to potentially address Alzheimer's disease, which will still have a devastating impact on patients and their families even with the emergence of amyloid-clearing antibodies. Patients treated with single dose of ALN-APP experienced dose-dependent, rapid and sustained reduction of up to 90% in APP production as assessed by biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid. The safety and tolerability profile with single dosing is encouraging so far. While the multi-dose Part B portion of the study is on partial clinical hold in the United States due to finding reserved in prior nonclinical chronic toxicology studies, Part B has already received regulatory approval to proceed in Canada, where the majority of the part A clinical trial patients had been enrolled. Detailed results from the study will be presented in an upcoming medical meeting. We are looking forward to advancing additional development candidates for the many other neurodegenerative diseases that currently have few or no therapeutic options such as other targets for Alzheimer's as well as for ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, Parkinson's and Huntington's. In addition to these exciting developments in central nervous system diseases, we are continuing our progress with liver targeted medicines, including our broad and multipronged approach to develop treatments for NASH, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. We're enrolling a Phase II study of ALN-HSD in NASH patients with genetic risk factors, continuing in development of ALN-PNP, and we are planning to progress additional more recently genetically validated NASH targets as well. Finally, I would like to highlight our recently announced collaboration with Sonoma Biotherapeutics' discover, develop and commercialize regulatory T cell therapies for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. This collaboration will bring together our industry-leading technologies for the discovery and characterization of fully human antibodies and T cell receptors, as well as our additional biologics candidates with Sonoma's pioneering approach to developing and manufacturing gene modified T reg cell therapies. In conclusion, Regeneron's R&D engine truly continues its productivity in both late and early-stage pipeline. Before turning the call over to Marion, I would also like to thank Roy Vagelos for serving as a role model for all of us at Regeneron as well as for so many others across the industry. I hope that we can continue to live up to the high stage that Roy has set over his distinguished career. With that, I will turn the call over to Marion. Well, as we've already reported, based on our two country cohorts, we are seeing remarkable overall response rate increases over the PD-1 standard alone, almost doubling with much longer PFS. If we get anywhere near these numbers along with a satisfactory safety profile, which we had seen a favorable safety profile in the small studies, but if we reproduce or come anywhere close to reproducing these results, we believe that this will establish an entirely new standard of care for this disease. And as we all know, the first-line melanoma opportunity is very large, but we're also moving laterally and earlier and so forth into many additional applications within the melanoma opportunity itself. We're going -- we're already now in adjuvant and entering neoadjuvant studies. We'll also be going to other cancer settings, including lung cancer and so forth. So we consider this a major opportunity, and we can only help to -- if we approach the data that we've already seen in our earlier studies, it really has a chance to make a huge difference for these patients. Well, we think that the data were really game changing. I mean this is the first time in human history that one has been able to use this very exciting siRNA technology within the brain and silence, to a very high degree, higher-than-expected levels an important pathological gene. Obviously, this could have important implications for Alzheimer's itself. But as you point out, the application goes way beyond that. To every neurodegenerative disease, there are also other types of CNS diseases as well. We have a number of programs that we're working with Alnylam. We have exclusive relationship with them on all of these CNS targets. And we're trying to expedite a lot of them based on the exciting results from this initial clinical work into the clinic. And we're also trying to expedite many of our programs that are behind as well. So we really think this opens up an entirely new way of addressing a whole assortment of brain diseases and neuropsychiatric diseases, not just neurodegenerative diseases. We're in exciting times. We have to go cautiously. We have to hope that the initial results, in terms of the safety profile and so forth, hold up. We're all in the early days, and we don't know for sure. But the low doses with which we saw this very marked reduction in the target give us a lot of hope that we can have a sufficient therapeutic window that will be applicable to these large variety of disease that could potentially be addressable by this modality. Yes. We are more optimistic, obviously, that all of our decisions, all of the data that led us to do the particular study and the particular population of patients in COPD with DUPIXENT was made based on a lot of factors. And we also had, from our Regeneron Genetics Center, very strong human genetic evidence suggesting that it would have activity particularly where we actually saw activity. And so all of that gives us confidence -- since we use the same criteria, the same approaches and so forth to plan and design our IL-33 study, certainly, the fact that everything that went into one and it all worked so remarkably well gives us confidence that the same approaches will lead to success with the IL-33. The results with DUPIXENT were really outstanding, as we've already mentioned. Not only a clinically meaningful reduction in exacerbations, but we hit all these other important endpoints, most importantly, improvement in lung function, as well as you rarely hit these quality of life improvements unless you have a really active agent that the patients can really feel the difference for their function and for their quality of life. With IL-33, the genetics is very strong. We have a Phase II study in the subgroup that we're doing the Phase III study in. It was in that group. We have demonstrated a 42% reduction in exacerbations in the Phase II study. This will be an overlapping population with our DUPIXENT population. We think we already have a chance to really make a huge difference for this high unmet need population that really has had no new mechanism of action of drugs brought to help these patients for a very, very long time. We have one with Dupixent, and we're hoping to hit another one with IL-33. And this could make such a huge difference for these patients who have been suffering for so long without much hope. It could really make a big difference for this population. We've seen about half of all the humans who have been sequenced. Since [Indiscernible] expand it a little bit, just let you know how it works. What we do is we identify genetic variations that mimic the blocking of a drug or exacerbation of this type 2 pathway. And what we showed for DUPIXENT, for the genetic variations that mimic DUPIXENT, those people were protected from COPD, particularly the type 2 COPD patients. Whereas increased activity of the IL-4/13 path was associated with more disease. And obviously, that turned out to be the case. I mean it's human genetics. It's a very, very powerful predictor. And we've done the same thing, as Len said, with IL-33, where we have genetic variation at mimics blocking the pathway or exacerbating the pathway. And as I've said, this is one of the secrets to our ability to have high success rates in our studies is we use that as a criteria to make our decisions going forward. Well, I think you're going to actually see an update on our pivotal Phase II data, the actual data that was a little bit more maturing, with a further update we will be hoping to submit to the to the FDA for our BLA. So the data will be very close. We think the data will even get better as it matures. Because as we all know, response rates and so forth get better with time as you follow these patients. But these data are going to show what we believe are the potential to have best-in-class efficacy, as well as safety in the favorable dosing schedule based on the results that we'll show from our pivotal study at the upcoming ASCO."

At this time all participants are on a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Ryan Crowe, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.\nRyan Crowe : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening to everyone listening around the world. Thank you for your interest in Regeneron and welcome to our third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. An archive and transcript of this call will be available on the Regeneron investor relations website shortly after the call ends. Joining me on today's call are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, board Co-Chair, Co-Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. George Yancopoulos, Board Co-Chair Co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer; Marion McCourt, Executive Vice President of Commercial; and Chris Fenimore, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, the remaining time will be available for your questions. I would like to remind you that remarks made on today's call may include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include but are not limited to those related to Regeneron and its products and business, financial forecast and guidance, development programs and related anticipated milestones, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, payer coverage and reimbursement, intellectual property, pending litigation and other proceedings, and competition. Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected in that statement. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30th, 2024, which was filed with the SEC this morning. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. In addition, please note that GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on today's call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP is available in our quarterly results press release and our corporate presentation, both of which can be accessed on the Regeneron Investor Relations website. Once our call concludes, Chris and the IR team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Leonard Schleifer. Len.\nLeonard Schleifer : Thank you, Ryan, and thanks to everyone for joining today's call. Regeneron had a strong quarter, highlighted by 11% revenue growth and 8% non-GAAP earnings growth, along with continued investments and advances across our broad-pipeline. For my remarks today, I'd like to review some of our key performance drivers and then briefly discuss near-term pipeline opportunities. After my remarks, George will provide further updates on our pipeline. Marion will then review our commercial performance. And finally, Chris will detail our quarterly financial results. Third quarter, 2024 total revenues grew 11% to $3.72 billion, primarily driven by higher Sanofi collaboration revenues reflecting the continued strong performance of Dupixent, continued growth for Libtayo, and growth for combined EYLEA HD and EYLEA in the United States. Dupixent had another strong quarter with global revenues of 24% on a constant currency basis to $3.8 billion. With this latest quarterly result, global Dupixent revenues are annualizing at over $15 billion, with over 1 million patients currently on treatment around the world across seven approved indications in patients as young as six months. In September, the FDA and Chinese regulators both approved Dupixent for patients with uncontrolled COPD and an eosinophilic phenotype. These approvals, along with the approval in Europe in June, enabled Dupixent to address several hundred thousand patients that are currently uncontrolled on maximal inhaled triple therapy. As Marion will discuss, early launch indicators have been positive with strong physician interest and initial favorable US payer coverage decisions. As the only approved biologic for COPD, we anticipate these ongoing launches will represent a meaningful driver for depictions continued growth in 2025 and beyond. Net product sales for EYLEA HD and EYLEA combined were $1.54 billion, up 3% compared to the prior year. EYLEA HD generated $392 million in its fourth -- full quarter on the US Market. EYLEA HD and EYLEA maintained antiVEGF category leadership with combined share of approximately 44% compared to 45% in the second quarter of 2024. As Marion will discuss, we have focused on increasing EYLEA HD share, while preserving share for EYLEA in an increasingly competitive category, including a near-term biosimilar aflibercept 2-milligram launch and the recent launch of a branded pre-filled syringe. The EYLEA HD clinical profile continues to look differentiated relative to EYLEA and other antiVEGF products. As George will soon detail, results from the recently reported photon extension study in DME further underscore EYLEA HD's unprecedented durability while achieving vision gains and a safety profile typically seen with EYLEA. Moving to our pipeline, we're excited about several upcoming readouts later this year and in 2025 to further inform programs that could support significant long-term growth opportunities. By year-end, we expect to share interim Phase II lung cancer beta for the combination of fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody plus Libtayo, as well as proof-of-contact data for our Factor XI antibodies in thrombosis, both of which will inform our Phase III plans. Looking ahead to 2025, We expect to read out the results of our pivotal AERIFY studies for itepekimab our IL-33 antibody in former smokers with COPD. We will also learn more about potential opportunity to improve the quality of weight loss in obese patients on semaglutide by blocking myostatin and/or Activin A. Pivotal data for the fianlimab-libtayo combination in first-line metastatic melanoma are also anticipated which could support regulatory filings in this setting. In addition, we expect to provide periodic updates on our novel treatment approach for reversing severe food allergies, involving linvoseltamab, our BCMA by CD3 bispecific and Dupixent. In closing, our pipeline continues to generate innovative and differentiated opportunities and now had approximately 40 programs in clinical development spanning many distinct therapeutic areas. We view our pipeline as the key to driving medium and long-term shareholder value and our antibody platform technologies and the Regeneron Genetics centered database of over 2.5 million sequenced exomes linked to the de-identified health records is expected to provide an enduring competitive advantage that we will continue to invest in. With that, I'll now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Thanks, Leonard. I'll start with EYLEA HD and the data from the Photon extension study in diabetic macular edema, that were recently presented at the American Academy of Ophthalmology Annual Meeting. In addition to demonstrating that the vision gains and anatomic achievements or improvements with EYLEA HD over two years could be sustained over a third year of treatment at EYLEA HD, the results of the extension study provided the first data for patients who switched from EYLEA to EYLEA HD. For these switch patients who were dosed for 88 weeks with EYLEA every eight-weeks following five initial loading doses, retinal fluid re-accumulation was substantially slower after a single EYLEA HD injection at week 96, as compared to these patients' previous rate of fluid accumulation with our EYLEA 2 milligram. In addition, after one year of EYLEA HD treatment, 83% of these switch patients had a last assigned dosing interval of at least 12 weeks. Importantly, mean visual and anatomic achievement improvements achieved with EYLEA were sustained following the switch to longer dosing intervals with EYLEA HD. For Photon, patients assigned to EYLEA HD treatment groups at baseline, visual gains and anatomic improvements achieved in the first two years were all sustained in three years, but many of these patients were able to meaningfully extend the dosing interval. At the end of three years of treatment, nearly half were signed the final dosing interval of at least 20 weeks. In summary, EYLEA HD achieved consistently longer dosing intervals, as well as notably slower fluid re-accumulation as compared to EYLEA, a first for the category. When all other antiVEGF agents were compared to EYLEA and head-to-head studies, these agents did not demonstrate slow fluid re-accumulation. The safety profile of EYLEA HD has continued to be similar to EYLEA through three years and remain generally consistent with known safety profile of EYLEA HD in its pivotal trials. Altogether, these data support our belief that our EYLEA HD has a best-in-class profile. Now moving to Dupixent, which achieved several first and only clinical and regulatory milestones since our second quarter earnings call in early August. First, we are pleased to receive US regulatory approval for Dupixent as an add-on maintenance treatment of adult patients with inadequately controlled COPD and the eosinophilic phenotype marking the first ever biologic approved to treat this disease and represent to [Dupixent 6] (ph) indications approved in the United States. Also in COPD, as Len mentioned, we're looking forward to pivotal results in the second half of next year for Itepekimab, our interleukin-33 antibody. If approved in the United States, EU and Japan, Itepekimab could address approximately 1 million former smokers with COPD regardless of eosinophilic phenotypes. In terms of potential future indications for Dupixent, the Phase III ADEPT trial in moderate to severe bullous pemphigoid patients met the primary and all key secondary endpoints. Five time more Dupixent patients achieved sustained disease remission at 36 weeks compared to those on placebo. Dupixent patients were far less likely than patients on placebo to relapse following steroid taper or need rescue therapy during the treatment period. Based on these data, Dupixent is the first and only biologic to achieve significant improvements in disease remission and symptoms in bullous pemphigoid, and is the first medicine to show significant steroid sparing in this disease. We anticipate this Phase III ADEPT trial will support regulatory approvals around the world with the US supplementary BLA submission expected by the end of the year. We also announced results of a second Phase III study of Dupixent in biologic-naive patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria, or CSU, confirming the results of a prior Phase III study in the same population. In this most recent study, treatment with Dupixent met the primary endpoint and in addition, resulted in a nearly 50% reduction in itch and urticaria activity scores from Baseline. With 30% of Dupixent treated patients reporting a complete response or no urticaria by week 24 compared to only 18% of those on placebo. These data, along with the data generated in the first CSU study evaluating biologically naive patients supported our supplementary BLA resubmission earlier this month, and we look forward to a potential FDA approval early next year which would mark the first targeted therapy for CSU in a decade. Moving to oncology, starting with Libtayo, which provides a best-in-class foundation for combinations with our other oncology assets. At the World Conference on Lung Cancer, we announced five-year results from the final prespecified overall survival analysis of the Phase III EMPOWER Lung 1 trial, which evaluated the entire monotherapy as a first-line treatment for adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with more than 50% PD-L1 expression. The late-breaking data showed that at five years, Libtayo monotherapy nearly doubled median overall survival and reduced the risk of death by 41% compared to chemotherapy. There were also no new safety signals observed their five years among those patients. These 5-year outcomes data in advanced non-small cell lung cancer compare favorably cross trial to other PD-1 or PD-L1 antibodies and further support Libtayo's position as the anti-PD-1 backbone for Regeneron's ongoing oncology efforts. Moving on to one such Libtayo combination. At the recent ESMO meeting, we presented updated results of the [fianlimab] (ph), or LAG-3 antibody in combination with Libtayo in adults with advanced melanoma across three independent expansion cohorts of our first-in-human multi-cohort trial. With longer follow-up, these latest results showed persistent and deepening tumor responses across all cohorts. In post-hoc pooled analysis, 50% -- 57% of patients responded with 25% of these patients achieving a complete response. Median progression-free survival was 24 months. Median OS was not reaching any of the individual cohorts on when the results were pooled. These fianlimab-libtayo proof-of-concept data showed nearly double the complete response rate with more than 5 times greater median PFS than previously reported for anti-PD-1 monotherapies. The fianlimab-libtayo combination also showed robust clinical activity in subpopulations where there is currently no established standard-of-care, such as in patients previously treated with the anti-PD-1 therapy in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting. Of the 13 patients in this subgroup, six patients or 46% response to therapy. Among patients receiving any adjuvant or neoadjuvant systemic therapy 11 of 23 or 48% respond to the therapy, including six complete responses. The safety profile of the fianlimab-libtayo combination was generally consistent with the safety profile of the libtayo monotherapy and other anti-PD-1 agents, except for higher rates of treatment-related adrenal insufficiency. Ever since the exciting early data with individual checkpoint inhibitors were presented more than a decade ago, it's been widely hypothesized that combining multiple classes of checkpoint inhibitors might meaningfully enhance antitumor activity without exacerbating safety issues. [Yet] (ph) progress to-date has been broadly disappointed. We believe the results generated so far in advanced melanoma for fianlimab and Libtayo suggests it might be the first checkpoint inhibitor combination to demonstrate meaningful additive clinical benefit without significantly exacerbating safety. Our ongoing randomized Phase III trial of the fianlimab-libtayo versus Pembrolizumab monotherapy in preciously treated, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic melanoma is ongoing with pivotal data expected to readout next year. In addition to melanoma, we're exploring this combination in a variety of other cancer settings that have historically been responsive to anti-PD-1 therapy, including lung cancer, initial Phase II data for which are expected to read out under this year. Next, to our bispecifics for hematology-oncology. We are pleased that the European Commission approved Ordspono or odronextamab, or CD20xCD3 bispecific for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, marking the first regulatory approval from our bispecific antibody platform. We continue to work on enrollment of our confirmatory studies to support resubmission of our BLA for follicular lymphoma, which we now expect to achieve in the first half of 2025. linvoseltamab or BCMAxCD3 bispecific for myeloma, data from the ongoing linker MM1 study in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma continue to mature with responses continuing to do recall that 14 months of median follow-up among 117 patients, linvoseltamab continues to demonstrate a potentially best-in-class profile in terms of efficacy, safety, dosing as well as hospitalization burden with 71% of patients respond to therapy and 50% achieving a complete response or better. Perhaps the most differentiating about our clinical development program for both our odronextamab and linvoseltamab, in earlier line settings is our plan to evaluate each agent as monotherapy, as well as in limited combinations. While competing CD20 bispecifics are evaluating combinations with linvoseltamab and plus rituximab in first-line follicular lymphoma regardless of tumor burden, our Phase III OLYMPIA 1 study is evaluating odronextamab monotherapy compared to R-CHOP. Similarly, in first-line multiple myeloma, our ongoing Phase I/II LINKER MM4 study is available in linvoseltamab monotherapy. Furthermore, we are also conducting Phase II studies for [linvoseltamab monotherapy] (ph) in precursor conditions such as smoldering myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or MGUS in an attempt to prevent progression to myeloma. Now to our non-oncology hematology pipeline, starting with our C5 program, which is the first combination of an antibody and siRNA that targets the same protein. We expect to present updated results for one potential indication Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria, later this year and expect to read out pivotal results and generalize Myasthenia Gravis in the second half of next year. We also initiated our Phase III program in geographic atrophy in dry age-related macro degeneration with initial patient screening now underway. We believe that our systemic approach has several significant advantages over currently approved agents. First, it may avoid the risk of rare but severe eye inflammation irreversible vision loss that has been observed with currently approved intravitreal treatments. And our systemic approach is the potential to offer convenient treatment of bilateral disease as well. Regarding our Factor XI antibodies, we remain on track to report top-line results by year-end of our proof-of-concept studies for our A2 domain targeting and our catalytic domain targeting antibodies in the setting of prevention of venous thromboembolism following knee replacement surgery. Results of these studies will inform whether to proceed to registration-enabling studies with one or both of these antibodies with the possibility that both antibodies will advance to Phase III, but in different thrombosis indications or in different patient populations. In summary, we continue to drive forward our innovative development pipeline and anticipate reading out several pivotal and proof-of-concept data sets in oncology, immunology, obesity hematology and genetic medicines over the next 12 to 18 months while our early research engine has never been more productive with multiple novel programs potentially advancing into the clinic over the same time frame. And with that, I will turn the call over to Marion.\nMarion McCourt: Thank you, George. Our third quarter performance demonstrates Regeneron's ongoing leadership across therapeutic categories. We continue to advance the strength and diversity of our product portfolio. And as George described, our pipeline is advancing with several potential regulatory filings and approvals on the horizon, creating both near and longer-term opportunities. I'll begin with EYLEA HD and EYLEA. In the third quarter, combined US net sales were $1.54 billion, a 3% year-over-year increase. EYLEA HD and EYLEA net sales were favorably impacted by approximately $40 million, as a result of higher wholesaler inventory levels for EYLEA HD at the end of the third quarter partially offset by lower inventory levels for EYLEA. As a result, we expect fourth quarter EYLEA HD net sales to be negatively impacted as this increase in wholesaler inventory is absorbed. Together, EYLEA HD and EYLEA captured 44% of the total anti-VEGF category in the third quarter, demonstrating retina specialists experience and confidence in both brands. EYLEA HD net sales grew 29% sequentially in the quarter to $392 million, driven by ongoing adoption across treatment experienced and treatment-naive patients as treatment Experience grows, retina specialists reporting to EYLEA HD's durability, coupled with its efficacy and safety as important clinical differentiators. Recent late-breaking data presented at American Academy of Ophthalmology's annual meeting highlighted EYLEA HD's potential best-in-class profile. As George highlighted, diabetic macular edema patients who switched to EYLEA HD, consistently achieved longer dosing intervals and slower retinal fluid re-accumulation. While we anticipate the anti-VEGF category to continue to be highly competitive with both branded and biosimilar products in the marketplace, we plan to further strengthen the EYLEA HD product profile through the anticipated launch of our differentiated prefilled syringe by mid-2025 and a potential approval of the RVO indication, which is registration-enabling data are expected by the end of this year. In the first year since launch, positive physician and patient experience has propelled EYLEA HD to achieve billion-dollar brand status. With additional growth catalysts expected in 2025, our team is focused on helping even more patients benefit from EYLEA HD. Turning to Libtayo. We continue to make significant progress in the third quarter with global net sales increasing 24% year-over-year on a constant currency basis to $289 million, and the US net sales grew 35% to $195 million in non-melanoma skin cancer, our work to expand the immunotherapy market has resulted in an even greater number of Libtayo patients. And in lung cancer, we continue to gain market share. Outside the US, net sales were $94 million, which does not include $20 million in distributor purchases that shifted to the fourth quarter. We continue to see opportunities to increase Libtayo demand in 2025 with new launches in several markets. And finally, to Dupixent, which continues its remarkable growth trajectory. In addition to the positive data readouts and regulatory updates that George mentioned, we've reached an impressive milestone. Dupixent has now surpassed 1 million patients on therapy across 7 indications worldwide. In the quarter, Dupixent achieved global net sales of $3.8 billion, a 24% year-over-year increase on a constant currency basis, driven by uptake across all indications, age groups and geographies. In the US, net sales grew 19% year-over-year to $2.8 billion, and Dupixent continues to be the #1 prescribed biologic for new-to-brand patients in all of its approved indications. It's widely recognized by prescribers that Dupixent's differential dual mechanism of action targeting IL-4 and IL-13 addresses the underlying cause of these type 2 diseases. Demand is strong across the blockbuster indications of atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyps, and there is opportunity for ongoing market penetration based on unmet patient need. Uptake is also increasing across our recent US launches, new-to-brand prescriptions for prurigo nodularis are up approximately 30% compared to the prior year and EOE new-to-brand prescriptions, including the pediatric indication, are up approximately 40%. In September, Dupixent's label was expanded to include patients as young as 12 years of age who have inadequately controlled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and we estimate approximately 9,000 additional US patients can now benefit from Dupixent. In recent months, Dupixent has been approved to treat COPD in more than 30 countries. We are excited about the opportunity to extend Dupixent's leadership in respiratory KR, which we estimate may benefit more than 300,000 patients in the US alone with inadequately controlled COPD and an eosinophilic phenotype. In the first weeks of the US launch, we've been encouraged by the enthusiasm from physicians and patients for Dupixent as a treatment option in this underserved population. Educational efforts are underway to highlight the importance of type 2 inflammation in COPD and supporting patient identification by prescribers and motivating patients to speak with their physician about Dupixent. We've made significant progress in securing access and reimbursement for patients, many of whom are covered under Medicare. With Dupixent's unique clinical profile and first biologic to market advantage, we anticipate the COPD indication will drive meaningful growth for Dupixent. In summary, Dupixent continues to transform standard-of-care in lives of patients worldwide. In addition to current approvals, we look forward to future potential launches in diseases, including COPD in Japan, pediatric EoE in the EU and chronic spontaneous urticaria in US, as well as global regulatory filings for bullous pemphigoid. In conclusion, our commercial team continues to deliver on our goal to provide Regeneron medicines to an ever-expanding number of patients worldwide. There is significant growth potential within the current and future indications of our medicines and our pipeline provides meaningful opportunities for growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Fenimore: Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron delivered strong financial performance in the third quarter with continued execution driving top and bottom-line growth. Total revenues increased 11% year-over-year to $3.7 billion, primarily driven by higher Sanofi collaboration revenue, continued growth for Libtayo and US growth of total EYLEA HD and EYLEA. Third quarter net income per share grew 8% from the prior year to $12.46 on net income of $1.5 billion. Third quarter revenues from our Sanofi collaboration were $1.3 billion inclusive of $1.1 billion related to our share of collaboration profits. Regeneron's share of profits grew 26% versus the prior year driven by volume growth for Dupixent and improving collaboration margins, with collaboration profitability reaching another all-time high in the third quarter. The Sanofi development balance was approximately $1.8 billion at the end of the third quarter, reflecting a reduction of approximately $200 million from the end of the second quarter and approximately $520 million from the end of 2023. Moving to Bayer. Third quarter ex-US net sales of EYLEA and EYLEA 8 mg were $932 million, up 9% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Total buyer collaboration revenue was $391 million, of which $368 million related to our share of net profits outside the US. We recorded $35 million of sales for Inmazeb, our antibody cocktail for Ebola in the third quarter related to deliveries to the US government under our existing agreement. We still expect 2024 Inmazeb sales to be in-line with 2023 sales of approximately $70 million. Other revenue in the third quarter was $114 million. We expect other revenue will increase sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2024, but on a full year basis, is expected to be lower than 2023. Now to our operating expenses. R&D expense was $1.1 billion in the third quarter. The increase in R&D expense versus the prior year was driven by ongoing investments in our pipeline, including late-stage oncology programs and increased clinical manufacturing costs to support ongoing programs. SG&A grew 15% from the prior year to $613 million in the third quarter, primarily reflecting ongoing investment to support the launch of EYLEA HD. Third quarter 2024 gross margin on net product sales declined to 89% compared to 90% in the prior year, primarily reflecting higher start-up costs for our fill/finish manufacturing facility. Now to cash flow and the balance sheet. Regeneron generated approximately $2.6 billion in free cash flow through the first nine months of 2024 and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $15.6 billion. Through the first nine months of 2024, we have repurchased over $1.6 billion of our shares, including $738 million in the third quarter. Given our long-term growth potential, we continue to see share repurchases as an efficient use of capital and had approximately $2.9 billion available for repurchases as of the end of the third quarter. Finally, we made some minor changes to our full year 2021 financial guidance based on our year-to-date results, narrowing ranges across most guidance items. A complete summary of our latest full year 2024 guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. In summary, Regeneron delivered strong financial results in the third quarter, and our focused investments continue to position us to drive long-term growth. With that, I'll pass the call back to Ryan.\nRyan Crowe: Thank you, Chris. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions]. Shannon, can we please go into our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nTaylor Hanley: Hi. This is Taylor Hanley on for Chris Schott. We just had a question on EYLEA. So with Amgen launching their biosimilar, how are you thinking about EYLEA going forward? And what levels can you pull to potentially accelerate conversion to high-dose EYLEA? And how are you thinking about pricing for the franchise more broadly? Thank you.\nLeonard Schleifer: So [may] (ph) -- may have some extra comments on that. But look, EYLEA is a fantastic product. We have delivered probably somewhere in the neighborhood of around 100 million or more injections with EYLEA. And so the performance and safety of the product, our transparency with safety issues that may arise over the past decade, I think has given physicians and their patients, a lot of comfort with EYLEA, and you see some stickiness of that product. Nonetheless, we think that EYLEA HD is a differentiated product, and we are continuing to work on using the standard approaches of education and informing the doctors about the potential use in patients, providing them with more data, as George referred to some of the long-term data is rather striking. We know that there is a biosimilar in the market for EYLEA, not for EYLEA HD, and we know it will be competitive, but we think we'll be able to compete well.\nRyan Crowe: Okay, next question, please Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nRyan Crowe: Evan, we don\u2019t hear you. Maybe we\u2019ll come back to Evan. Shannon, why don\u2019t we go to the next.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nTyler Van Buren: Hi, guys. Good morning. Congrats on the quarterly results and all the progress. Can you reiterate your confidence in EYLEA HD quarter-over-quarter growth going into Q4 despite the negative impact due to wholesaler inventory? And are you seeing a tailwind with the overall franchise yet due to the removal of product from a major supplier of Avastin?\nMarion McCourt: So let me take both of those, Tyler. First, as I described to you the performance in the quarter showed growth for EYLEA and EYLEA HD? And then more specifically to your comment related to EYLEA HD, we have very strong confidence in the product profile, the interest of the retina community, the quality of our safety, clinical data durability are all being seen. But I did want to call out that we did see an inventory matter take place in the quarter that I wanted to comment on. We're not going to give fourth quarter guidance. But specifically, I wanted to be an awareness related to the favorable impact of approximately $40 million as a result of higher wholesaler inventory levels for EYLEA HD. At the end of the third quarter, partially offset by wholesaler inventory levels that were lower -- a bit lower on EYLEA. So we wanted to share that information, but certainly we have every confidence in EYLEA HD performance, but that inventory obviously will be used in the fourth quarter of this year.\nLeonard Schleifer: Looking forward, Tyler, to next year, I think Marion may mentioned that bringing our prefilled syringe to market around -- by the middle of the year, I think will be a nice catalyst for acceleration I think that we've taken a lot of pain to make sure that when we bring something to the market, it is going to withstand the test of millions and millions of injections our competition may have brought something forth that, for example needs a [filter needle] (ph) because they must be trying to filter something out, we presume. We are hoping to not have to have that issue and we are looking very carefully to make sure that we bring something that really will not result in inflammation. Remember that in this marketplace, products have been really killed if you have too much inflammation, which leads to potential for retinal vasculitis and even occlusive retinal vasculitis with loss of vision. So we are very sensitive to all that. I think doctors will be sensitive to that with any new launch despite biosimilars. They're going to probably want to look carefully and they know EYLEA and EYLEA is something I think they can trust in. So we will be methodical about how we do this, and we're in this for the long game.\nMarion McCourt: Tyler, I also want to cover your question related to [Pine] (ph) and they are coming away from support of Avastin in the marketplace. So we're very well aware of that. And certainly, our teams are actively involved in retina offices supporting staff and working with them on any challenges that present I would share that at this point, there still is Avastin inventory from Pine in the market. I think it's anticipated to run out within a couple of weeks. So we haven't seen a material uptake in EYLEA HD or EYLEA related to that yet, but we're staying very close to that situation and support to our customers.\nRyan Crowe: Thank you. Next question please Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nBrian Abrahams: Hi, there. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On the HD prefilled syringe, can you talk about the potential inflection in use that, that could catalyze next year, including how the differentiation of that prefilled string might resonate. And maybe also elaborate on some of the gating factors to development there, time line sounds like they've been pushed out a little bit. Thanks.\nLeonard Schleifer: Yes. As I said, we anticipate bringing that to the market by the middle of next year. I believe already or almost immediately, Bayer will be bringing the same device to the market with EYLEA HD, outside of the United States. So we have a high degree of confidence. There are some additional requirements that you have to do inside the United States, which we are working through. And as I said, we think we'll have a differentiated product opportunity there. So you're right, Brian, it's possible that there could be an inflection when that comes to market because there is a preference for the prefilled syringe.\nRyan Crowe : Okay. Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is open.\nCarter Gould: Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe for Leonard and Chris, just now in the [wake] (ph) of sort of Amgen potentially being on the market has driven any sort of change in conservative conceptually how you're thinking about the pace of R&D investments going forward or your capital allocation priorities, you're potentially leaning into buybacks or further rolling out or delaying a potential dividend? Any color on that front would be helpful.\nLeonard Schleifer: Well, we're -- they say imitation is the best form of flattery. So we're glad to be flattered by Amgen that they're spending their time imitating our products. We're spending our money trying to bring new products to market which where we think is what this industry really is built for. It's really not built -- biosimilars are fine, but we think the industry is best built and Regeneron is best built to bring innovative products to market. As I mentioned, we have over 40 products in clinical development, many of which are in Phase III. As George detailed, there are a lot of exciting programs in there with lots of data readouts. We're not going to gate spending based upon a biosimilar entry, we're going to spend what's appropriate based upon the opportunities that we see. We have a strong balance sheet. We have good earnings. We have the capability to make significant investments. And George has built, I think, the most prolific research and development organization in the industry. So it would be full hardy not to invest in that, and you'll probably see some investments to go up. The big question in this game always is, will these investments pay-off I think our past performance will not guarantee to anything in the future, the more than 10 or 12 products that George and [indiscernible] have bought market there's a good harbinger of things to come. And as I said, with more than 40 things in development, we couldn't be more excited about our future product profiles.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks Len. Next question please Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I know you have some upcoming Factor XI readouts here before the end of the year. Maybe you could just tell us what you're looking for to make the decision about whether to advance those into a Phase III program and how you're considering them versus each other and also versus the standard-of-care. Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. This is George. We're very excited about our Factor XI program because we think it's very different from anything else that's out there. we chose to take a different approach where we attack Factor XI in two different ways, what we call our A2 domain antibody or catalytic domain antibody. Our A2 domain antibody is not a complete blocker of Factor XI, it actually is more like a complete Factor XII blocker. It's expected to not have as profound effect on the coagulation pathways, but to have a much milder safety profile. In contrast, we believe that our catalytic domain antibody is the best-in-class blocker of Factor XI will come with the best ability to control coagulation among all agents that are attacking this pathway. But of course, it will also have presumably a higher safety load than our A2 domain antibody. So we think it's very exciting to have these two parallel but very distinguished approaches. We actually hope to be able to show that both of these substantially controlled thrombo formation in the clinical trials that we now have running. And we hope to then in the future, decide based on how well they each control and their expected safety profile, we expect the ability to consider multiple indications that we can evaluate each one for different potential indications for one versus the other. So these are sort of a pipeline in and of themselves able to attack, we believe, a variety of different coagulation settings, and each one of them can be used differentially and provide a different profile of efficacy versus safety as might be needed in the different clinical settings.\nLeonard Schleifer: One second. I just wanted to add to that. What George has taught me over the years is that not all antibodies are created equal. And I would not -- not all blockers of the pathway are created equal. And we have in-house pharmacodynamic data, which suggests that the antibodies that Regeneron has created and selected, we really have a competitive advantage in how we do that outperform other Factor XI antibodies or small molecule competitors. Of course, with the small molecule competitors, it's hard to get to the high dose because you have off-target problems. And with the antibodies, people can't always get the best antibodies. We think we have the technology and these things are not all created equal. So the proof of the pudding, will be in the eating, when we get the data and see how that performed.\nRyan Crowe: Okay, thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nChristopher Raymond: Thank you. Maybe just a follow-up on the last and supply issue with Pine and potentially others exiting the market. Maybe just stepping back, compounded Avastin has seen supply and quality issues before. Do you see this episode as different from prior disruptions? We had a KOL tell us that he believes this marks sort of the beginning of the end for Avastin. I'd love to hear your thoughts on that. And maybe as a follow-up, if Avastin is likely to play less of a role here, does this not provide more of an opening for a biosimilar option?\nMarion McCourt: So Chris, let me take the impact and the situation with Pine and say that I think that probably what we're hearing is that because of the prior Avastin shortages last year around this time that the same thing occurred, offices and practices are getting used to how to deal with the situation. And obviously, the confidence in Avastin goes down in the supply. So certainly, it's important. And I see -- I think the evolution that you're hearing is because it's a situation that has been dealt with before. We certainly want physicians to have choice in prescribing the anti-VEGF category product brand that they think is best for their patients. And certainly, I think it is a competitive marketplace, but as we show in growth of our franchise, this quarter, we did last quarter as well, we certainly think that both EYLEA HD and EYLEA are both positioned very well in this competitive marketplace.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks Marion. Shannon, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nSalveen Richter: Thank you. Good morning. Can you just elaborate on the drivers for the pricing pressure noted for EYLEA HD and whether these pressures are going to be ongoing on the Ford? And just in that context, maybe discuss kind of your outlook for overall growth of the branded anti-VEGF market in the context of the biosimilars. Thank you.\nMarion McCourt: So as we reflect on anti-VEGF category pricing pressure, that is something, Salveen, that has an impact on all products in the category, branded products, biosimilar products as well, and it's not inconsistent with other competitive categories. What's really important to note though is what often prevails is the product that physicians most often want to prescribe, meaning what has been their experience, what is the safety profile of the product, what is the efficacy? And now in the case of bringing EYLEA HD to the marketplace, the durability. So we think those factors are very important and allow us to compete successfully in the anti-VEGF category. As to overall category growth, I would say that it is probably roughly in -- and this is overall, not just branded, it is roughly in the mid-single-digit range. And then come back again just to say a little bit more about the pricing pressure. Obviously, that's something that's been more apparent for EYLEA and probably the product now having been on the marketplace for over a decade is understandable. The differentiation for EYLEA HD is the clinical profile, the product that is giving physicians the opportunity not only for the confidence in clinical aspects, results and safety as they have with EYLEA, but also now this really demonstrated durability that we're seeing more and more of. And obviously, our clinical data is supporting in the longer term as well.\nRyan Crowe: Thank you. Next move to the next question please Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. I just want to understand how high does EYLEA uptake so far is tracking versus your own internal expectations, given that, I mean, it seems like about 25% conversion has happened yet at point. And at the same time, compared to -- this has been growing really rapidly. So just trying to understand what are the dynamics that we need to look at here and if there are any levers you can pull going forward to help increase uptake?\nLeonard Schleifer: So Mohit, thanks for the question. Obviously, we don't give specific guidance on conversion or the size of the market, but we do talk about what we think the catalyst can be -- and I do feel that we have a bunch of catalysts next year, the potential approval and data for RVO, more importantly, perhaps the prefilled syringe by mid-year. So I think that next year, we could see a little bit of an acceleration. Obviously, we're working very hard. It's a great product. But there are -- these things don't happen overnight because people do love EYLEA. And it is more sticky than one might have anticipated but I think the progress is solid and we expect it to keep going.\nRyan Crowe: Okay, let\u2019s move to the next question please Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Trung Huynh with UBS.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. This in [indiscernible] on for Trung from UBS. And thanks for taking all the questions. So I want to switch gears to the obesity program and about the ongoing [Phase II trevogrumab] (ph) plus garetosmab and [GP1 study] (ph) seems like you recently increased the trial size from 620 plus to 1,000 with 3 new arms added. And now the study has a total of 13 investigational arm does seem like you want to very comprehensive to hear. Could you provide more granularity why the protocol changes here are necessary? And why would you like to further expand the trial. Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Can we have somebody to repeat that question because I really couldn't understand it at all -- Go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Definitely. Yes. Just the ongoing Phase II obesity study of trevogrumab] plus garetosmab,and with and without [indiscernible]. So you recently increased the trial size [indiscernible], previously I think it was 620 plus. You also added two new arms. So why do you think like those protocol changes are necessary. And why would you like to further expand the trial? Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. I think what you're probably referring to is that we added additional dosing arms in our trial to expand different doses of the -- hopefully, muscle-enhancing treatments. And that's the major reason that the trial was enlarged. So that we would have broader information on different doses and their effects on muscle preservation.\nLeonard Schleifer: Right. And just to remember, we didn't see any -- in the healthy volunteer study, we were able to do that because we didn't see any new safety signals. So I think it's just a matter of exploring additional doses.\nRyan Crowe: Trying to find the right mix of antibodies with semaglutide to maximize the quality of the weight loss. Let\u2019s move to the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry about the earlier mishap. Just a follow-up on obesity. I know, George, you've spoken a lot about the really need for quality of weight loss, and I think that's very important. Maybe talk to the regulatory environment for muscle or preservation or muscle building assets. I know FDA has been kind of hesitant there. And they're really focused on weight loss, but maybe how you talk about -- how those will evolve in the coming years.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. I guess what you're referring to is obviously we all know, and it's been widely noted and acknowledged that in the setting of the very rapid weight loss that can be caused by these GLP related agents, you get significant lean body and muscle loss up to 30%, 40% of the weight loss, especially because most of these patients actually go off these treatments and then often cycle, this can actually lead to cumulative loss of muscle over time, which can actually be quite catastrophic. We may be creating a secondary problem here over time as people cycle on and off these treatments. So our approaches are intended to maintain the muscle. That said, the agents because they're promoting muscle. Remember, muscle is the major non-essential spender of energy that is renowned for its ability to expand energy. We've seen in the animal models that it can also cause our approaches when you maintain muscle, you are increasing the metabolic rate. So you're actually expending more calories, so you actually can lose more weight while you're gaining the muscle or preserving the muscle because the muscle itself is eating up the calories or using up the calories. So the easiest regulatory path will be if our approach is, as has been seen in the preclinical studies actually result in more weight loss but a better composition of that weight loss. So that one won't even have to actually rely on a muscle regulatory end-point, just on the increased weight loss itself. Of course, one will then hopefully be able to describe, and this is all part of ongoing discussions with regulatory agencies that not only might you be seeing increased weight loss, but the body composition results will be better. So the simplest regulatory path will be just by increasing the actual weight loss, and then you'll be able to show secondary end points that you are doing better on composition of the weight loss as well. That said, we are going to be measuring metabolic parameters. And we're also going to be measuring functional assets as well. And those are, of course, regulatory paths as well that will be more complicated and probably require a larger and longer studies than just the weight loss studies themselves. So of course, we expect to be improving metabolic endpoints. We expect to be improving functional endpoints whether we're going to be needing those as exploratory or descriptive endpoints or whether we're going to end up relying on them for approval remains an open story. But the goal, of course, is to show these benefits in the setting of maintenance of the muscle while maintaining or actually getting greater weight loss. I should also point out that in our pipeline, we have a variety of what we call Unimolecular solutions, a whole series of molecules that have the ability all within the same molecule to do all of these things. And obviously, those will all have their own indifferent regulatory path, some of which might be much more expedient in terms of what endpoints you can use for approval and so forth.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks George. Let\u2019s move to the next question Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.\nDavid Risinger: Yes. Thanks very much. So I have -- I'll just keep it to one question, please. Regarding next-gen product development. So clearly, Regeneron was extremely successful in creating EYLEA HD. Could you talk about your efforts to develop a next-gen Dupixent, including whether it would be a less frequently administered product? Thanks very much.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: All we can say is that we are constantly working on both improving approaches for something where we already have important products such as in the Dupixent class, as well as coming up with entirely new and different products and approaches as well. And as you might imagine, we delivered with HD, I mean this is what we're trying to do all the time. We're trying to improve the current approaches but we're also trying to come up with an entirely different next-gen approach as well. That's what we do here at Regeneron.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks, George. Time for two more questions, Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from William Pickering with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nWilliam Pickering: Hi, thank you for taking my question. Do you think that the rate of biosimilar erosion for Lucentis is a good proxy for what we can expect for EYLEA. I think they saw about 25% of volume switch over in the first 12 months? And are there any important differences in the commercial dynamics to keep in mind? Thank you.\nMarion McCourt: Just would say that it's very -- and way too early to comment. And I think that through the conversation today, we've gone through the factors that create such confidence in EYLEA, the demonstrated use of the product on a worldwide basis, but very early to try to make any comment about a product that hasn't been used in the real-world setting yet.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Well, I think it's also important. The situation is very different because at the same time, there are patients on EYLEA who might have a choice of going to a bio similar staying and EYLEA are actually moving to a differentiated product profile, which is EYLEA HD. So that's a very different sort of situation than you had with just the Lucentis erosion situation.\nMarion McCourt : Great point.\nRyan Crowe: Thank you. Shannon, let\u2019s take our last question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nCory Kasimov: Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for fitting me in. I wanted to follow up on Carter's question earlier about capital allocation priorities. I'm sure you're pretty frustrated by the market reaction to recent developments around EYLEA. I know you have nearly $3 billion left in your authorized share repo. But have you given any thoughts to an ASR? And what are your evolving views around a dividend given that you already have over $15 billion in net cash on hand? And obviously have another significant inflection in additional cash generation not too far down the road. Thank you.\nLeonard Schleifer: So we have lots of discussions on this. We don't really have anything more to add than we've said publicly, which is perhaps the best opportune time to think about the dividend is when we have paid-off the development balance to Sanofi, which we anticipate should be somewhere around the end of 2026. But beyond that, how we repurchase stock, when, whether, et cetera, et cetera, is something that we really don't discuss until it's happening.\nRyan Crowe: Okay. Thank you, Len, and thanks to everyone who dialed in for your interest in Regeneron. We apologize to those remaining in the Q&A queue that we did not have a chance to hear from. As always, the Investor Relations team here. Regeneron is available to answer any remaining questions you may have. Thank you once again. Happy Halloween, happy Diwali. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Marion McCourt",
            "content": "Thank you, George. Our third quarter performance demonstrates Regeneron's ongoing leadership across therapeutic categories. We continue to advance the strength and diversity of our product portfolio. And as George described, our pipeline is advancing with several potential regulatory filings and approvals on the horizon, creating both near and longer-term opportunities. I'll begin with EYLEA HD and EYLEA. In the third quarter, combined US net sales were $1.54 billion, a 3% year-over-year increase. EYLEA HD and EYLEA net sales were favorably impacted by approximately $40 million, as a result of higher wholesaler inventory levels for EYLEA HD at the end of the third quarter partially offset by lower inventory levels for EYLEA. As a result, we expect fourth quarter EYLEA HD net sales to be negatively impacted as this increase in wholesaler inventory is absorbed. Together, EYLEA HD and EYLEA captured 44% of the total anti-VEGF category in the third quarter, demonstrating retina specialists experience and confidence in both brands. EYLEA HD net sales grew 29% sequentially in the quarter to $392 million, driven by ongoing adoption across treatment experienced and treatment-naive patients as treatment Experience grows, retina specialists reporting to EYLEA HD's durability, coupled with its efficacy and safety as important clinical differentiators. Recent late-breaking data presented at American Academy of Ophthalmology's annual meeting highlighted EYLEA HD's potential best-in-class profile. As George highlighted, diabetic macular edema patients who switched to EYLEA HD, consistently achieved longer dosing intervals and slower retinal fluid re-accumulation. While we anticipate the anti-VEGF category to continue to be highly competitive with both branded and biosimilar products in the marketplace, we plan to further strengthen the EYLEA HD product profile through the anticipated launch of our differentiated prefilled syringe by mid-2025 and a potential approval of the RVO indication, which is registration-enabling data are expected by the end of this year. In the first year since launch, positive physician and patient experience has propelled EYLEA HD to achieve billion-dollar brand status. With additional growth catalysts expected in 2025, our team is focused on helping even more patients benefit from EYLEA HD. Turning to Libtayo. We continue to make significant progress in the third quarter with global net sales increasing 24% year-over-year on a constant currency basis to $289 million, and the US net sales grew 35% to $195 million in non-melanoma skin cancer, our work to expand the immunotherapy market has resulted in an even greater number of Libtayo patients. And in lung cancer, we continue to gain market share. Outside the US, net sales were $94 million, which does not include $20 million in distributor purchases that shifted to the fourth quarter. We continue to see opportunities to increase Libtayo demand in 2025 with new launches in several markets. And finally, to Dupixent, which continues its remarkable growth trajectory. In addition to the positive data readouts and regulatory updates that George mentioned, we've reached an impressive milestone. Dupixent has now surpassed 1 million patients on therapy across 7 indications worldwide. In the quarter, Dupixent achieved global net sales of $3.8 billion, a 24% year-over-year increase on a constant currency basis, driven by uptake across all indications, age groups and geographies. In the US, net sales grew 19% year-over-year to $2.8 billion, and Dupixent continues to be the #1 prescribed biologic for new-to-brand patients in all of its approved indications. It's widely recognized by prescribers that Dupixent's differential dual mechanism of action targeting IL-4 and IL-13 addresses the underlying cause of these type 2 diseases. Demand is strong across the blockbuster indications of atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyps, and there is opportunity for ongoing market penetration based on unmet patient need. Uptake is also increasing across our recent US launches, new-to-brand prescriptions for prurigo nodularis are up approximately 30% compared to the prior year and EOE new-to-brand prescriptions, including the pediatric indication, are up approximately 40%. In September, Dupixent's label was expanded to include patients as young as 12 years of age who have inadequately controlled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and we estimate approximately 9,000 additional US patients can now benefit from Dupixent. In recent months, Dupixent has been approved to treat COPD in more than 30 countries. We are excited about the opportunity to extend Dupixent's leadership in respiratory KR, which we estimate may benefit more than 300,000 patients in the US alone with inadequately controlled COPD and an eosinophilic phenotype. In the first weeks of the US launch, we've been encouraged by the enthusiasm from physicians and patients for Dupixent as a treatment option in this underserved population. Educational efforts are underway to highlight the importance of type 2 inflammation in COPD and supporting patient identification by prescribers and motivating patients to speak with their physician about Dupixent. We've made significant progress in securing access and reimbursement for patients, many of whom are covered under Medicare. With Dupixent's unique clinical profile and first biologic to market advantage, we anticipate the COPD indication will drive meaningful growth for Dupixent. In summary, Dupixent continues to transform standard-of-care in lives of patients worldwide. In addition to current approvals, we look forward to future potential launches in diseases, including COPD in Japan, pediatric EoE in the EU and chronic spontaneous urticaria in US, as well as global regulatory filings for bullous pemphigoid. In conclusion, our commercial team continues to deliver on our goal to provide Regeneron medicines to an ever-expanding number of patients worldwide. There is significant growth potential within the current and future indications of our medicines and our pipeline provides meaningful opportunities for growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris. So let me take both of those, Tyler. First, as I described to you the performance in the quarter showed growth for EYLEA and EYLEA HD? And then more specifically to your comment related to EYLEA HD, we have very strong confidence in the product profile, the interest of the retina community, the quality of our safety, clinical data durability are all being seen. But I did want to call out that we did see an inventory matter take place in the quarter that I wanted to comment on. We're not going to give fourth quarter guidance. But specifically, I wanted to be an awareness related to the favorable impact of approximately $40 million as a result of higher wholesaler inventory levels for EYLEA HD. At the end of the third quarter, partially offset by wholesaler inventory levels that were lower -- a bit lower on EYLEA. So we wanted to share that information, but certainly we have every confidence in EYLEA HD performance, but that inventory obviously will be used in the fourth quarter of this year. Tyler, I also want to cover your question related to [Pine] (ph) and they are coming away from support of Avastin in the marketplace. So we're very well aware of that. And certainly, our teams are actively involved in retina offices supporting staff and working with them on any challenges that present I would share that at this point, there still is Avastin inventory from Pine in the market. I think it's anticipated to run out within a couple of weeks. So we haven't seen a material uptake in EYLEA HD or EYLEA related to that yet, but we're staying very close to that situation and support to our customers. So Chris, let me take the impact and the situation with Pine and say that I think that probably what we're hearing is that because of the prior Avastin shortages last year around this time that the same thing occurred, offices and practices are getting used to how to deal with the situation. And obviously, the confidence in Avastin goes down in the supply. So certainly, it's important. And I see -- I think the evolution that you're hearing is because it's a situation that has been dealt with before. We certainly want physicians to have choice in prescribing the anti-VEGF category product brand that they think is best for their patients. And certainly, I think it is a competitive marketplace, but as we show in growth of our franchise, this quarter, we did last quarter as well, we certainly think that both EYLEA HD and EYLEA are both positioned very well in this competitive marketplace. So as we reflect on anti-VEGF category pricing pressure, that is something, Salveen, that has an impact on all products in the category, branded products, biosimilar products as well, and it's not inconsistent with other competitive categories. What's really important to note though is what often prevails is the product that physicians most often want to prescribe, meaning what has been their experience, what is the safety profile of the product, what is the efficacy? And now in the case of bringing EYLEA HD to the marketplace, the durability. So we think those factors are very important and allow us to compete successfully in the anti-VEGF category. As to overall category growth, I would say that it is probably roughly in -- and this is overall, not just branded, it is roughly in the mid-single-digit range. And then come back again just to say a little bit more about the pricing pressure. Obviously, that's something that's been more apparent for EYLEA and probably the product now having been on the marketplace for over a decade is understandable. The differentiation for EYLEA HD is the clinical profile, the product that is giving physicians the opportunity not only for the confidence in clinical aspects, results and safety as they have with EYLEA, but also now this really demonstrated durability that we're seeing more and more of. And obviously, our clinical data is supporting in the longer term as well. Just would say that it's very -- and way too early to comment. And I think that through the conversation today, we've gone through the factors that create such confidence in EYLEA, the demonstrated use of the product on a worldwide basis, but very early to try to make any comment about a product that hasn't been used in the real-world setting yet. Great point."

            "name": "Leonard Schleifer",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and thanks to everyone for joining today's call. Regeneron had a strong quarter, highlighted by 11% revenue growth and 8% non-GAAP earnings growth, along with continued investments and advances across our broad-pipeline. For my remarks today, I'd like to review some of our key performance drivers and then briefly discuss near-term pipeline opportunities. After my remarks, George will provide further updates on our pipeline. Marion will then review our commercial performance. And finally, Chris will detail our quarterly financial results. Third quarter, 2024 total revenues grew 11% to $3.72 billion, primarily driven by higher Sanofi collaboration revenues reflecting the continued strong performance of Dupixent, continued growth for Libtayo, and growth for combined EYLEA HD and EYLEA in the United States. Dupixent had another strong quarter with global revenues of 24% on a constant currency basis to $3.8 billion. With this latest quarterly result, global Dupixent revenues are annualizing at over $15 billion, with over 1 million patients currently on treatment around the world across seven approved indications in patients as young as six months. In September, the FDA and Chinese regulators both approved Dupixent for patients with uncontrolled COPD and an eosinophilic phenotype. These approvals, along with the approval in Europe in June, enabled Dupixent to address several hundred thousand patients that are currently uncontrolled on maximal inhaled triple therapy. As Marion will discuss, early launch indicators have been positive with strong physician interest and initial favorable US payer coverage decisions. As the only approved biologic for COPD, we anticipate these ongoing launches will represent a meaningful driver for depictions continued growth in 2025 and beyond. Net product sales for EYLEA HD and EYLEA combined were $1.54 billion, up 3% compared to the prior year. EYLEA HD generated $392 million in its fourth -- full quarter on the US Market. EYLEA HD and EYLEA maintained antiVEGF category leadership with combined share of approximately 44% compared to 45% in the second quarter of 2024. As Marion will discuss, we have focused on increasing EYLEA HD share, while preserving share for EYLEA in an increasingly competitive category, including a near-term biosimilar aflibercept 2-milligram launch and the recent launch of a branded pre-filled syringe. The EYLEA HD clinical profile continues to look differentiated relative to EYLEA and other antiVEGF products. As George will soon detail, results from the recently reported photon extension study in DME further underscore EYLEA HD's unprecedented durability while achieving vision gains and a safety profile typically seen with EYLEA. Moving to our pipeline, we're excited about several upcoming readouts later this year and in 2025 to further inform programs that could support significant long-term growth opportunities. By year-end, we expect to share interim Phase II lung cancer beta for the combination of fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody plus Libtayo, as well as proof-of-contact data for our Factor XI antibodies in thrombosis, both of which will inform our Phase III plans. Looking ahead to 2025, We expect to read out the results of our pivotal AERIFY studies for itepekimab our IL-33 antibody in former smokers with COPD. We will also learn more about potential opportunity to improve the quality of weight loss in obese patients on semaglutide by blocking myostatin and/or Activin A. Pivotal data for the fianlimab-libtayo combination in first-line metastatic melanoma are also anticipated which could support regulatory filings in this setting. In addition, we expect to provide periodic updates on our novel treatment approach for reversing severe food allergies, involving linvoseltamab, our BCMA by CD3 bispecific and Dupixent. In closing, our pipeline continues to generate innovative and differentiated opportunities and now had approximately 40 programs in clinical development spanning many distinct therapeutic areas. We view our pipeline as the key to driving medium and long-term shareholder value and our antibody platform technologies and the Regeneron Genetics centered database of over 2.5 million sequenced exomes linked to the de-identified health records is expected to provide an enduring competitive advantage that we will continue to invest in. With that, I'll now turn the call over to George. So [may] (ph) -- may have some extra comments on that. But look, EYLEA is a fantastic product. We have delivered probably somewhere in the neighborhood of around 100 million or more injections with EYLEA. And so the performance and safety of the product, our transparency with safety issues that may arise over the past decade, I think has given physicians and their patients, a lot of comfort with EYLEA, and you see some stickiness of that product. Nonetheless, we think that EYLEA HD is a differentiated product, and we are continuing to work on using the standard approaches of education and informing the doctors about the potential use in patients, providing them with more data, as George referred to some of the long-term data is rather striking. We know that there is a biosimilar in the market for EYLEA, not for EYLEA HD, and we know it will be competitive, but we think we'll be able to compete well. Looking forward, Tyler, to next year, I think Marion may mentioned that bringing our prefilled syringe to market around -- by the middle of the year, I think will be a nice catalyst for acceleration I think that we've taken a lot of pain to make sure that when we bring something to the market, it is going to withstand the test of millions and millions of injections our competition may have brought something forth that, for example needs a [filter needle] (ph) because they must be trying to filter something out, we presume. We are hoping to not have to have that issue and we are looking very carefully to make sure that we bring something that really will not result in inflammation. Remember that in this marketplace, products have been really killed if you have too much inflammation, which leads to potential for retinal vasculitis and even occlusive retinal vasculitis with loss of vision. So we are very sensitive to all that. I think doctors will be sensitive to that with any new launch despite biosimilars. They're going to probably want to look carefully and they know EYLEA and EYLEA is something I think they can trust in. So we will be methodical about how we do this, and we're in this for the long game. Yes. As I said, we anticipate bringing that to the market by the middle of next year. I believe already or almost immediately, Bayer will be bringing the same device to the market with EYLEA HD, outside of the United States. So we have a high degree of confidence. There are some additional requirements that you have to do inside the United States, which we are working through. And as I said, we think we'll have a differentiated product opportunity there. So you're right, Brian, it's possible that there could be an inflection when that comes to market because there is a preference for the prefilled syringe. Well, we're -- they say imitation is the best form of flattery. So we're glad to be flattered by Amgen that they're spending their time imitating our products. We're spending our money trying to bring new products to market which where we think is what this industry really is built for. It's really not built -- biosimilars are fine, but we think the industry is best built and Regeneron is best built to bring innovative products to market. As I mentioned, we have over 40 products in clinical development, many of which are in Phase III. As George detailed, there are a lot of exciting programs in there with lots of data readouts. We're not going to gate spending based upon a biosimilar entry, we're going to spend what's appropriate based upon the opportunities that we see. We have a strong balance sheet. We have good earnings. We have the capability to make significant investments. And George has built, I think, the most prolific research and development organization in the industry. So it would be full hardy not to invest in that, and you'll probably see some investments to go up. The big question in this game always is, will these investments pay-off I think our past performance will not guarantee to anything in the future, the more than 10 or 12 products that George and [indiscernible] have bought market there's a good harbinger of things to come. And as I said, with more than 40 things in development, we couldn't be more excited about our future product profiles. One second. I just wanted to add to that. What George has taught me over the years is that not all antibodies are created equal. And I would not -- not all blockers of the pathway are created equal. And we have in-house pharmacodynamic data, which suggests that the antibodies that Regeneron has created and selected, we really have a competitive advantage in how we do that outperform other Factor XI antibodies or small molecule competitors. Of course, with the small molecule competitors, it's hard to get to the high dose because you have off-target problems. And with the antibodies, people can't always get the best antibodies. We think we have the technology and these things are not all created equal. So the proof of the pudding, will be in the eating, when we get the data and see how that performed. So Mohit, thanks for the question. Obviously, we don't give specific guidance on conversion or the size of the market, but we do talk about what we think the catalyst can be -- and I do feel that we have a bunch of catalysts next year, the potential approval and data for RVO, more importantly, perhaps the prefilled syringe by mid-year. So I think that next year, we could see a little bit of an acceleration. Obviously, we're working very hard. It's a great product. But there are -- these things don't happen overnight because people do love EYLEA. And it is more sticky than one might have anticipated but I think the progress is solid and we expect it to keep going. Right. And just to remember, we didn't see any -- in the healthy volunteer study, we were able to do that because we didn't see any new safety signals. So I think it's just a matter of exploring additional doses. So we have lots of discussions on this. We don't really have anything more to add than we've said publicly, which is perhaps the best opportune time to think about the dividend is when we have paid-off the development balance to Sanofi, which we anticipate should be somewhere around the end of 2026. But beyond that, how we repurchase stock, when, whether, et cetera, et cetera, is something that we really don't discuss until it's happening."

            "name": "Chris Fenimore",
            "content": "Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron delivered strong financial performance in the third quarter with continued execution driving top and bottom-line growth. Total revenues increased 11% year-over-year to $3.7 billion, primarily driven by higher Sanofi collaboration revenue, continued growth for Libtayo and US growth of total EYLEA HD and EYLEA. Third quarter net income per share grew 8% from the prior year to $12.46 on net income of $1.5 billion. Third quarter revenues from our Sanofi collaboration were $1.3 billion inclusive of $1.1 billion related to our share of collaboration profits. Regeneron's share of profits grew 26% versus the prior year driven by volume growth for Dupixent and improving collaboration margins, with collaboration profitability reaching another all-time high in the third quarter. The Sanofi development balance was approximately $1.8 billion at the end of the third quarter, reflecting a reduction of approximately $200 million from the end of the second quarter and approximately $520 million from the end of 2023. Moving to Bayer. Third quarter ex-US net sales of EYLEA and EYLEA 8 mg were $932 million, up 9% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Total buyer collaboration revenue was $391 million, of which $368 million related to our share of net profits outside the US. We recorded $35 million of sales for Inmazeb, our antibody cocktail for Ebola in the third quarter related to deliveries to the US government under our existing agreement. We still expect 2024 Inmazeb sales to be in-line with 2023 sales of approximately $70 million. Other revenue in the third quarter was $114 million. We expect other revenue will increase sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2024, but on a full year basis, is expected to be lower than 2023. Now to our operating expenses. R&D expense was $1.1 billion in the third quarter. The increase in R&D expense versus the prior year was driven by ongoing investments in our pipeline, including late-stage oncology programs and increased clinical manufacturing costs to support ongoing programs. SG&A grew 15% from the prior year to $613 million in the third quarter, primarily reflecting ongoing investment to support the launch of EYLEA HD. Third quarter 2024 gross margin on net product sales declined to 89% compared to 90% in the prior year, primarily reflecting higher start-up costs for our fill/finish manufacturing facility. Now to cash flow and the balance sheet. Regeneron generated approximately $2.6 billion in free cash flow through the first nine months of 2024 and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $15.6 billion. Through the first nine months of 2024, we have repurchased over $1.6 billion of our shares, including $738 million in the third quarter. Given our long-term growth potential, we continue to see share repurchases as an efficient use of capital and had approximately $2.9 billion available for repurchases as of the end of the third quarter. Finally, we made some minor changes to our full year 2021 financial guidance based on our year-to-date results, narrowing ranges across most guidance items. A complete summary of our latest full year 2024 guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. In summary, Regeneron delivered strong financial results in the third quarter, and our focused investments continue to position us to drive long-term growth. With that, I'll pass the call back to Ryan."

            "content": "Thanks, Leonard. I'll start with EYLEA HD and the data from the Photon extension study in diabetic macular edema, that were recently presented at the American Academy of Ophthalmology Annual Meeting. In addition to demonstrating that the vision gains and anatomic achievements or improvements with EYLEA HD over two years could be sustained over a third year of treatment at EYLEA HD, the results of the extension study provided the first data for patients who switched from EYLEA to EYLEA HD. For these switch patients who were dosed for 88 weeks with EYLEA every eight-weeks following five initial loading doses, retinal fluid re-accumulation was substantially slower after a single EYLEA HD injection at week 96, as compared to these patients' previous rate of fluid accumulation with our EYLEA 2 milligram. In addition, after one year of EYLEA HD treatment, 83% of these switch patients had a last assigned dosing interval of at least 12 weeks. Importantly, mean visual and anatomic achievement improvements achieved with EYLEA were sustained following the switch to longer dosing intervals with EYLEA HD. For Photon, patients assigned to EYLEA HD treatment groups at baseline, visual gains and anatomic improvements achieved in the first two years were all sustained in three years, but many of these patients were able to meaningfully extend the dosing interval. At the end of three years of treatment, nearly half were signed the final dosing interval of at least 20 weeks. In summary, EYLEA HD achieved consistently longer dosing intervals, as well as notably slower fluid re-accumulation as compared to EYLEA, a first for the category. When all other antiVEGF agents were compared to EYLEA and head-to-head studies, these agents did not demonstrate slow fluid re-accumulation. The safety profile of EYLEA HD has continued to be similar to EYLEA through three years and remain generally consistent with known safety profile of EYLEA HD in its pivotal trials. Altogether, these data support our belief that our EYLEA HD has a best-in-class profile. Now moving to Dupixent, which achieved several first and only clinical and regulatory milestones since our second quarter earnings call in early August. First, we are pleased to receive US regulatory approval for Dupixent as an add-on maintenance treatment of adult patients with inadequately controlled COPD and the eosinophilic phenotype marking the first ever biologic approved to treat this disease and represent to [Dupixent 6] (ph) indications approved in the United States. Also in COPD, as Len mentioned, we're looking forward to pivotal results in the second half of next year for Itepekimab, our interleukin-33 antibody. If approved in the United States, EU and Japan, Itepekimab could address approximately 1 million former smokers with COPD regardless of eosinophilic phenotypes. In terms of potential future indications for Dupixent, the Phase III ADEPT trial in moderate to severe bullous pemphigoid patients met the primary and all key secondary endpoints. Five time more Dupixent patients achieved sustained disease remission at 36 weeks compared to those on placebo. Dupixent patients were far less likely than patients on placebo to relapse following steroid taper or need rescue therapy during the treatment period. Based on these data, Dupixent is the first and only biologic to achieve significant improvements in disease remission and symptoms in bullous pemphigoid, and is the first medicine to show significant steroid sparing in this disease. We anticipate this Phase III ADEPT trial will support regulatory approvals around the world with the US supplementary BLA submission expected by the end of the year. We also announced results of a second Phase III study of Dupixent in biologic-naive patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria, or CSU, confirming the results of a prior Phase III study in the same population. In this most recent study, treatment with Dupixent met the primary endpoint and in addition, resulted in a nearly 50% reduction in itch and urticaria activity scores from Baseline. With 30% of Dupixent treated patients reporting a complete response or no urticaria by week 24 compared to only 18% of those on placebo. These data, along with the data generated in the first CSU study evaluating biologically naive patients supported our supplementary BLA resubmission earlier this month, and we look forward to a potential FDA approval early next year which would mark the first targeted therapy for CSU in a decade. Moving to oncology, starting with Libtayo, which provides a best-in-class foundation for combinations with our other oncology assets. At the World Conference on Lung Cancer, we announced five-year results from the final prespecified overall survival analysis of the Phase III EMPOWER Lung 1 trial, which evaluated the entire monotherapy as a first-line treatment for adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with more than 50% PD-L1 expression. The late-breaking data showed that at five years, Libtayo monotherapy nearly doubled median overall survival and reduced the risk of death by 41% compared to chemotherapy. There were also no new safety signals observed their five years among those patients. These 5-year outcomes data in advanced non-small cell lung cancer compare favorably cross trial to other PD-1 or PD-L1 antibodies and further support Libtayo's position as the anti-PD-1 backbone for Regeneron's ongoing oncology efforts. Moving on to one such Libtayo combination. At the recent ESMO meeting, we presented updated results of the [fianlimab] (ph), or LAG-3 antibody in combination with Libtayo in adults with advanced melanoma across three independent expansion cohorts of our first-in-human multi-cohort trial. With longer follow-up, these latest results showed persistent and deepening tumor responses across all cohorts. In post-hoc pooled analysis, 50% -- 57% of patients responded with 25% of these patients achieving a complete response. Median progression-free survival was 24 months. Median OS was not reaching any of the individual cohorts on when the results were pooled. These fianlimab-libtayo proof-of-concept data showed nearly double the complete response rate with more than 5 times greater median PFS than previously reported for anti-PD-1 monotherapies. The fianlimab-libtayo combination also showed robust clinical activity in subpopulations where there is currently no established standard-of-care, such as in patients previously treated with the anti-PD-1 therapy in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting. Of the 13 patients in this subgroup, six patients or 46% response to therapy. Among patients receiving any adjuvant or neoadjuvant systemic therapy 11 of 23 or 48% respond to the therapy, including six complete responses. The safety profile of the fianlimab-libtayo combination was generally consistent with the safety profile of the libtayo monotherapy and other anti-PD-1 agents, except for higher rates of treatment-related adrenal insufficiency. Ever since the exciting early data with individual checkpoint inhibitors were presented more than a decade ago, it's been widely hypothesized that combining multiple classes of checkpoint inhibitors might meaningfully enhance antitumor activity without exacerbating safety issues. [Yet] (ph) progress to-date has been broadly disappointed. We believe the results generated so far in advanced melanoma for fianlimab and Libtayo suggests it might be the first checkpoint inhibitor combination to demonstrate meaningful additive clinical benefit without significantly exacerbating safety. Our ongoing randomized Phase III trial of the fianlimab-libtayo versus Pembrolizumab monotherapy in preciously treated, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic melanoma is ongoing with pivotal data expected to readout next year. In addition to melanoma, we're exploring this combination in a variety of other cancer settings that have historically been responsive to anti-PD-1 therapy, including lung cancer, initial Phase II data for which are expected to read out under this year. Next, to our bispecifics for hematology-oncology. We are pleased that the European Commission approved Ordspono or odronextamab, or CD20xCD3 bispecific for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, marking the first regulatory approval from our bispecific antibody platform. We continue to work on enrollment of our confirmatory studies to support resubmission of our BLA for follicular lymphoma, which we now expect to achieve in the first half of 2025. linvoseltamab or BCMAxCD3 bispecific for myeloma, data from the ongoing linker MM1 study in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma continue to mature with responses continuing to do recall that 14 months of median follow-up among 117 patients, linvoseltamab continues to demonstrate a potentially best-in-class profile in terms of efficacy, safety, dosing as well as hospitalization burden with 71% of patients respond to therapy and 50% achieving a complete response or better. Perhaps the most differentiating about our clinical development program for both our odronextamab and linvoseltamab, in earlier line settings is our plan to evaluate each agent as monotherapy, as well as in limited combinations. While competing CD20 bispecifics are evaluating combinations with linvoseltamab and plus rituximab in first-line follicular lymphoma regardless of tumor burden, our Phase III OLYMPIA 1 study is evaluating odronextamab monotherapy compared to R-CHOP. Similarly, in first-line multiple myeloma, our ongoing Phase I/II LINKER MM4 study is available in linvoseltamab monotherapy. Furthermore, we are also conducting Phase II studies for [linvoseltamab monotherapy] (ph) in precursor conditions such as smoldering myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or MGUS in an attempt to prevent progression to myeloma. Now to our non-oncology hematology pipeline, starting with our C5 program, which is the first combination of an antibody and siRNA that targets the same protein. We expect to present updated results for one potential indication Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria, later this year and expect to read out pivotal results and generalize Myasthenia Gravis in the second half of next year. We also initiated our Phase III program in geographic atrophy in dry age-related macro degeneration with initial patient screening now underway. We believe that our systemic approach has several significant advantages over currently approved agents. First, it may avoid the risk of rare but severe eye inflammation irreversible vision loss that has been observed with currently approved intravitreal treatments. And our systemic approach is the potential to offer convenient treatment of bilateral disease as well. Regarding our Factor XI antibodies, we remain on track to report top-line results by year-end of our proof-of-concept studies for our A2 domain targeting and our catalytic domain targeting antibodies in the setting of prevention of venous thromboembolism following knee replacement surgery. Results of these studies will inform whether to proceed to registration-enabling studies with one or both of these antibodies with the possibility that both antibodies will advance to Phase III, but in different thrombosis indications or in different patient populations. In summary, we continue to drive forward our innovative development pipeline and anticipate reading out several pivotal and proof-of-concept data sets in oncology, immunology, obesity hematology and genetic medicines over the next 12 to 18 months while our early research engine has never been more productive with multiple novel programs potentially advancing into the clinic over the same time frame. And with that, I will turn the call over to Marion. Yes. This is George. We're very excited about our Factor XI program because we think it's very different from anything else that's out there. we chose to take a different approach where we attack Factor XI in two different ways, what we call our A2 domain antibody or catalytic domain antibody. Our A2 domain antibody is not a complete blocker of Factor XI, it actually is more like a complete Factor XII blocker. It's expected to not have as profound effect on the coagulation pathways, but to have a much milder safety profile. In contrast, we believe that our catalytic domain antibody is the best-in-class blocker of Factor XI will come with the best ability to control coagulation among all agents that are attacking this pathway. But of course, it will also have presumably a higher safety load than our A2 domain antibody. So we think it's very exciting to have these two parallel but very distinguished approaches. We actually hope to be able to show that both of these substantially controlled thrombo formation in the clinical trials that we now have running. And we hope to then in the future, decide based on how well they each control and their expected safety profile, we expect the ability to consider multiple indications that we can evaluate each one for different potential indications for one versus the other. So these are sort of a pipeline in and of themselves able to attack, we believe, a variety of different coagulation settings, and each one of them can be used differentially and provide a different profile of efficacy versus safety as might be needed in the different clinical settings. Can we have somebody to repeat that question because I really couldn't understand it at all -- Go ahead. Yes. I think what you're probably referring to is that we added additional dosing arms in our trial to expand different doses of the -- hopefully, muscle-enhancing treatments. And that's the major reason that the trial was enlarged. So that we would have broader information on different doses and their effects on muscle preservation. Yes. I guess what you're referring to is obviously we all know, and it's been widely noted and acknowledged that in the setting of the very rapid weight loss that can be caused by these GLP related agents, you get significant lean body and muscle loss up to 30%, 40% of the weight loss, especially because most of these patients actually go off these treatments and then often cycle, this can actually lead to cumulative loss of muscle over time, which can actually be quite catastrophic. We may be creating a secondary problem here over time as people cycle on and off these treatments. So our approaches are intended to maintain the muscle. That said, the agents because they're promoting muscle. Remember, muscle is the major non-essential spender of energy that is renowned for its ability to expand energy. We've seen in the animal models that it can also cause our approaches when you maintain muscle, you are increasing the metabolic rate. So you're actually expending more calories, so you actually can lose more weight while you're gaining the muscle or preserving the muscle because the muscle itself is eating up the calories or using up the calories. So the easiest regulatory path will be if our approach is, as has been seen in the preclinical studies actually result in more weight loss but a better composition of that weight loss. So that one won't even have to actually rely on a muscle regulatory end-point, just on the increased weight loss itself. Of course, one will then hopefully be able to describe, and this is all part of ongoing discussions with regulatory agencies that not only might you be seeing increased weight loss, but the body composition results will be better. So the simplest regulatory path will be just by increasing the actual weight loss, and then you'll be able to show secondary end points that you are doing better on composition of the weight loss as well. That said, we are going to be measuring metabolic parameters. And we're also going to be measuring functional assets as well. And those are, of course, regulatory paths as well that will be more complicated and probably require a larger and longer studies than just the weight loss studies themselves. So of course, we expect to be improving metabolic endpoints. We expect to be improving functional endpoints whether we're going to be needing those as exploratory or descriptive endpoints or whether we're going to end up relying on them for approval remains an open story. But the goal, of course, is to show these benefits in the setting of maintenance of the muscle while maintaining or actually getting greater weight loss. I should also point out that in our pipeline, we have a variety of what we call Unimolecular solutions, a whole series of molecules that have the ability all within the same molecule to do all of these things. And obviously, those will all have their own indifferent regulatory path, some of which might be much more expedient in terms of what endpoints you can use for approval and so forth. All we can say is that we are constantly working on both improving approaches for something where we already have important products such as in the Dupixent class, as well as coming up with entirely new and different products and approaches as well. And as you might imagine, we delivered with HD, I mean this is what we're trying to do all the time. We're trying to improve the current approaches but we're also trying to come up with an entirely different next-gen approach as well. That's what we do here at Regeneron. Well, I think it's also important. The situation is very different because at the same time, there are patients on EYLEA who might have a choice of going to a bio similar staying and EYLEA are actually moving to a differentiated product profile, which is EYLEA HD. So that's a very different sort of situation than you had with just the Lucentis erosion situation."

With that let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Leonard Schleifer. Len?\nLeonard Schleifer: Thanks, Ryan. Thanks to everyone joining today's call. Regeneron continued its track record of strong execution highlighted by double-digit revenue and earnings growth in the second quarter along with important advances across our broad pipeline. For my remarks today, I'd like to briefly review some of the key performance drivers for the quarter and then discuss near-term pipeline opportunities. After my remarks, George will provide further updates on our pipeline. Marion will then review our commercial performance. And finally Chris will detail our quarterly financial results and discuss updates to our full year guidance. Second quarter 2024 total revenues grew 12% to $3.55 billion, primarily driven by sales of EYLEA HD in the United States. Higher Sanofi collaboration revenues reflecting the continued strong performance of DUPIXENT as well as robust growth for LIBTAYO. EYLEA HD generated $304 million in its third full quarter on the US market and continues to outperform recent launches in the anti-VEGF category. Net product sales for EYLEA HD and EYLEA combined were $1.53 billion, representing a 2.3% growth compared to the prior year. We are encouraged that despite increased competition in the anti-VEGF space, we have achieved a strong EYLEA HD launch trajectory while maintaining our category-leading combined EYLEA HD and EYLEA market share of 45%. Our efforts to bring an EYLEA HD pre-filled syringe, the United States market remain a high priority, and we are tracking towards a potential pre-filled syringe launch by early 2025. In summary, we continue to position EYLEA HD as the new standard-of-care for retinal diseases based on its differentiated clinical profile, coupled with strong familiarity and satisfaction among retinal specialists. DUPIXENT global revenues grew 29% on a constant currency basis to $3.56 billion, reflecting strong growth across all approved indications, age groups and geographies. In June, the European Commission approved DUPIXENT for COPD in patients with raised blood eosinophils, marking the first global regulatory approval for DUPIXENT in COPD. This approval enables DUPIXENT to address the approximately 220,000 eosinophilic COPD patients in the EU that are currently uncontrolled on maximum and eligible therapy. The approval also represents the first biologic approved to treat this disease. We continue to work with the FDA regarding its ongoing review for this indication and expect their decision by the September 27 PDUFA date. We and our partner, Sanofi, are prepared for US launch that many pulmonologists, respiratory key opinion leaders and their patients have been eagerly anticipating. There is a high unmet need in COPD with Type 2 inflammation with approximately 300,000 eligible patients in the United States and our potential launch represents a significant driver for DUPIXENT's continued growth. LIBTAYO global net product sales were $297 million in the second quarter, an increase of 43% on a constant currency basis. Despite intense competition, LIBTAYO has maintained its leadership position in non-melanoma skin cancers, while making impressive inroads in non-small cell lung cancer. We are also pleased with the progress we have made in establishing an international commercial footprint to support LIBTAYO and other future products following our purchase of full global rights to LIBTAYO from Sanofi in mid-2022. Regarding linvoseltamab or BCMA by CD3 bispecific for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma, during its review of the linvoseltamab BLA, the FDA informed us that the third-party fill/finish manufacturer for linvoseltamab had unresolved findings from a preapproval inspection for another company's product candidate. While we now believe these findings have been resolved, a reinspection will be required, and therefore, we anticipate any potential FDA approval for linvoseltamab is likely to be delayed beyond the August 22 PDUFA date. The FDA has not informed us of any approvability issues for linvoseltamab related to safety, efficacy or the status of our ongoing confirmatory trial. More broadly on our pipeline, we are excited about several upcoming readouts later this year or in 2025 to further inform programs that could support significant long-term growth opportunities which George will discuss in a moment. In closing, our pipeline continues to generate innovative and differentiated opportunities and now has over 35 programs in clinical development spanning several distinct therapeutic areas. Our commercial team is executing well with our in-market products and is building momentum in competitive categories. Finally, we continue to prudently deploy capital with the goal of delivering long-term value to shareholders. With that I'll turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len. Starting with DUPIXENT. Regarding COPD, data from our second confirmatory trial, NOTUS was featured as a late-breaking presentation at the American Thoracic Society Conference and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. In NOTUS, DUPIXENT reduced exacerbations by 34%, while significantly improving lung function confirming the unprecedented results from the previously reported Phase III BOREAS trial. Based on data from NOTUS and BOREAS, DUPIXENT was recently approved by the European regulatory authorities for eosinophilic COPD patients uncontrolled on maximum standard-of-care inhaled therapy. Additional submissions are under review with other regulatory authorities around the world, including in the US, China and Japan. Beyond COPD later this year, we are looking forward to data readouts from Phase III studies of DUPIXENT in chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid. Seven years after its initial FDA approval and with approval in seven different indications around the world DUPIXENT continues to deliver potential new approvals for additional important disease indications. Regarding our small pilot study to potentially eliminate severe food allergies using our innovative approach that combines DUPIXENT and linvoseltamab or BCMA by CD3 bispecific, we continue to expect to see initial data by the end of this year. On itepekimab, our IL-33 antibody in development for certain COPD patients, our two Phase III studies are now fully enrolled, study readouts and regulatory submissions for our second therapeutic candidate for this devastating disease are expected in the second half of next year. Moving to oncology and starting with fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody in combination with LIBTAYO, at the upcoming ESMO meeting in September, we look forward to presenting longer-term follow-up on the metastatic melanoma cohorts from our first-in-human study. Responses have continued to deepen with the proportion of complete responders and median progression-free survival continuing to improve. These results strengthen our view that fianlimab and LIBTAYO may be the most promising immunotherapy combination in clinical development. As we recently announced, we are looking forward to the Phase III readout in this melanoma setting next year, which could position fianlimab and LIBTAYO as a new standard-of-care in melanoma and eventually potentially other cancer settings. Additionally, we hope to gain insights into the antitumor activity of this combination in non-small cell lung cancer later this year. We are also advancing fianlimab development to earlier lines of therapy with proof-of-concepts in perioperative non-small cell lung cancer and perioperative melanoma now underway with additional indications likely to follow. On to bispecifics for solid tumors. Our costimulatory bispecific antibodies are being tested in numerous studies, including as monotherapies as well as in combination with CD3 bispecifics and with LIBTAYO. At the ASCO Conference, we presented results for our EGFR by CD28 bispecific in combination with LIBTAYO. In microsatellite stable colorectal cancer tumor historically unresponsive to immunotherapy, EGFR by CD28 in combination with LIBTAYO demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity with an overall response rate of 20% in patients without liver metastases. Regarding safety, to-date, we have not observed severe immune-related adverse events with this agent at our recommended Phase II dose. Dose expansion cohorts testing EGFR by CD28 plus LIBTAYO continue to enroll in various solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer with or without EGFR mutations, microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, head and neck, squamous cell carcinoma and others. On to our PSMA by CD28 costimulatory bispecific, which has already demonstrated promising activity in late-line prostate cancer when combined with LIBTAYO. We have now initiated combination treatment of our PSMA by CD28 costim bispecific with our PSMA by CD3 bispecific, which based on preclinical studies may maintain the efficacy of served with the LIBTAYO combination that may improve the safety and tolerability profile. We are also testing PSMA by CD28 in other cancers. Next, to our bispecifics for hematology oncology, the linvoseltamab or BCMA by CD3 bispecific, an oral presentation at the European Hematologic Association Conference we presented updated pivotal data, which continue to demonstrate a potentially best-in-class profile in late-line myeloma in terms of efficacy, safety, dosing as well as hospitalization burden. As we expected, responses continue to deepen with longer follow-up. At 14-month median follow-up of 117 patients, 50% achieved a complete response or better with an objective overall response rate of 71%. Additional studies of linvoseltamab are now also underway in earlier stages of myeloma and in precursor conditions such as smoldering myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance or MGUS. Developing linvoseltamab in earlier-line myeloma settings presents an important opportunity for us to help patients and their physicians in these diseases, which currently have complex treatment paradigms. Touching on our nononcology hematology pipeline, as highlighted previously, later this year, we are anticipating proof-of-concept results for our two Factor XI antibodies in the setting of prevention of venous thromboembolism after knee replacement surgery. The study for the antibody targeting the Factor XI A2 domain is now fully enrolled and we expect to present results at a medical meeting in the second half of this year. Interim Phase II results for our second Factor XI antibody which targets the catalytic domain are expected by the end of this year for internal analysis. We have also started an additional proof-of-concept study to further evaluate the two antibodies profile for thrombosis prevention in patients, who have a peripherally inserted catheter. Results of these studies will inform whether to proceed to registrational studies with one or both of these antibodies by next year. Moving to obesity. Our most advanced approach is designed to address the potential negative consequences of widespread use of GLP and GIP receptor agonists. As has been widely reported, the profound weight loss caused by these agents unfortunately, it can also result in substantial loss of muscle, which is particularly concerning older obese patients. Our myostatin antibody when combined with semaglutide with or without our active NA antibody, may protect against this muscle loss as previously demonstrated in nonhuman primates. Part A of our COURAGE Phase II study testing a higher dose of trevogrumab or myostatin antibody in healthy subjects has now been successfully completed with no new safety signals identified. Part B of the study, which evaluates our muscle preservation antibodies in combination with semaglutide and obese participants has started enrolling patients assuming a reasonable pace of enrollment, we continue to expect to report top line results, including changes in body weight, fat mass and muscle mass by the second half of 2025. I will conclude with our genetics medicines efforts. At the ASGCT Conference, we presented updated data from our DB-OTO gene therapy program for genetic hearing loss due to mutations of the otoferlin gene. The first child treated with this therapy, an 11-month old girl, who is profoundly deaf at baseline had hearing in the normal range by 24 weeks after treatment. Also initial hearing improvements were observed in a second child dose at 4 years of age at a 6-week assessment with additional follow-up plan. As of July, we have dosed five patients in our study and we are on track to enroll several more patients this year. We also look forward to bringing additional otoferlin gene therapy programs to the clinic in the coming years with the potential to address more common forms of monogenic hearing loss. Regarding our Intellia collaboration, transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, the world's first Phase III program for in vivo CRISPR-based therapy is enrolling at a rapid pace indicating considerable interest from investigators and patients. In addition, we are also on track to be the first to use CRISPR technology to insert a corrective gene in vivo for a deficiency disease, hemophilia B. As noted previously, we have enrolled initial patients in the leading portion of this trial and first patient should be dosed soon. Our siRNA collaboration with Alnylam has not only demonstrated successful silencing of genes in the liver, but also for the first time for siRNA in the brain. This opens up opportunities for us to go after other disease-causing genes in the brain. A study of ALN-SOD in ALS patients with SOD1 mutations recently initiated. Other CNS-directed siRNA programs are expected to enter the clinic shortly, including targeting HTT for Huntington's disease, synuclein for Parkinson's and tau for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, with regard to our C5 program, our innovative approach involving the first combination of an antibody together with an siRNA both targeting the same molecule is progressing well and we are expecting to present updated data for initial potential indication, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria by the end of this year. We're also looking forward to starting our Phase III program in geographic atrophy in the second half of this year. In summary, we continue to drive forward our innovative development pipeline and anticipate reading out several pivotal and proof-of-concept data sets over the next 12 to 18 months. Our early research efforts continue to be productive with multiple novel programs potentially advancing to the clinic over that same time frame. And with that I will turn the call over to Marion.\nMarion McCourt: Thank you, George. Our second quarter commercial results further solidify Regeneron's leadership across therapeutic categories. Our performance demonstrates the ongoing strength and diversity of our product portfolio with continued growth opportunities powered by existing and upcoming product and indication launches across multiple geographies. I'll start with EYLEA HD and EYLEA in the US. In the second quarter, combined net sales for both medicines grew 2.3% year-over-year to $1.53 billion. EYLEA continues its clear category leadership while EYLEA HD remained the fastest growing medicine in this highly competitive category. EYLEA HD continued its launch momentum in the second quarter, delivering net product sales of $304 million, which represents 52% sequential growth. EYLEA HD continues to be the fastest launch of any anti-VEGF therapy since EYLEA more than a decade ago and the trajectory confirms a significant transition to EYLEA HD is underway. The breadth and depth of EYLEA HD prescribing continues to grow with utilization across a broad range of patients, including a treatment-naive population, which has doubled since last quarter. Physicians are also increasingly switching patients to EYLEA HD from other anti-VEGF treatments based on their positive early treatment experiences. And these switch patients, early real-world data indicate that treatment intervals are being extended with EYLEA HD. EYLEA HD's durability, along with the same trusted efficacy, visual acuity and safety as EYLEA represents a meaningful improvement for patient lives and greater efficiency for physician practices. The number of physician offices ordering EYLEA HD during the second quarter increased by more than 50% compared to the prior quarter. We believe this suggests prescriber confidence in EYLEA HD's clinical profile as well as in reimbursement now that the permanent J-code has been well established. Of note, we recognize the importance of providing physicians with a pre-filled syringe option and as Len mentioned, we're excited about our anticipated EYLEA HD pre-filled syringe launch. In summary, we're pleased with our second quarter performance for EYLEA HD and EYLEA and remain on track to achieve our goal of establishing EYLEA HD as the new standard-of-care for retinal disease. Next to DUPIXENT, which delivered 29% growth in the second quarter on a constant currency basis with global net sales of $3.56 billion. We are approaching the important milestone of 1 million patients on DUPIXENT worldwide. In addition, there's substantial opportunity for even more patients to benefit from DUPIXENT based on significant unmet need across indications, ages and geographies. In the US, net sales grew 24% to $2.61 billion, driven by an increased demand across all five approved indications. DUPIXENT continues its number one leadership position and new-to-brand prescriptions across all approved indications. Our commercial team remains laser-focused on pursuing initiatives that drive patient awareness and support prescribing. We continue to see increasing penetration in our blockbuster indications of atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyps. Additionally, recent launches in eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis are exceeding our expectations and new patient initiations are steadily increasing. We hear remarkable stories of patients as young as one year of age with EoE, who are now thriving on DUPIXENT following its approval in January of this year. The European Commission also recently approved DUPIXENT in COPD patients with raised blood eosinophils with patients already getting treatment in Germany. We all recognize that there is significant unmet need worldwide among patients with this debilitating disease and DUPIXENT represents the first biologic medicine for COPD. Our US team is ready for the anticipated FDA approval of DUPIXENT in COPD by late September and estimate approximately 300,000 US patients may benefit from DUPIXENT in this indication separately, an FDA decision for DUPIXENT in adolescents with chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps is expected next month. As George mentioned, there are two DUPIXENT Phase III programs reading out later this year in chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid. If data from these trials are positive, DUPIXENT has the potential to support even more patients with unmet need. We also made significant progress with LIBTAYO in the second quarter with global net sales of $297 million, up 43% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Strong commercial execution resulted in market share gains across both skin and lung cancers. In the US, net sales grew 40% to $182 million with growth across all market segments and indications. In non-melanoma skin cancer, we continue to extend LIBTAYO leadership with increasing demand and market share. In lung cancer, LIBTAYO is recognized by physicians as an important therapy for their lung cancer patients and continues to gradually gain market share. Outside the US, our teams are delivering excellent results with net product sales of $115 million as Regeneron continues its international expansion. LIBTAYO net product sales in some of these international markets were favorably impacted by approximately $15 million of stocking purchases. Our oncology team is also eagerly awaiting the potential FDA and EU decisions for linvoseltamab in late-stage myeloma. We believe linvoseltamab represents a best-in-class opportunity and we look forward to potential launch. In summary, our commercial team continues to deliver on our goal to provide Regeneron medicines to even more patients worldwide. There is meaningful future growth potential within our approved indications and our robust pipeline provides both near and long-term opportunities to advance patient care. With that I'll turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Fenimore: Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron delivered strong double-digit top and bottom line growth in the second quarter. Total revenues increased 12% year-over-year to $3.5 billion, primarily driven by strong execution of the ongoing EYLEA HD launch in the US, higher Sanofi collaboration revenue and continued global sales growth from LIBTAYO. Second quarter diluted net income per share grew 13% from the prior year to $11.56 on net income of $1.4 billion. Second quarter revenues from our Sanofi collaboration grew to $1.1 billion, primarily composed of our share of collaboration profits of $988 million, which increased by 32% compared to the prior year driven by DUPIXENT's continued volume growth and improving margins. Reimbursement from manufacturing and commercial supply, the other component of Sanofi collaboration revenue was $157 million, taking into account increased volumes, offset by manufacturing efficiencies, we continue to expect reimbursement for manufacturing and commercial supply in 2024 to be comparable to 2023 on a full year basis. The Sanofi development balance was approximately $2 billion at the end of the second quarter, reflecting a reduction of approximately $190 million from the end of the first quarter. We continue to anticipate this balance will be fully reimbursed to Sanofi by the end of 2026. Moving to Bayer. Second quarter ex-US net sales of EYLEA and EYLEA 8 mg were $908 million, up 8% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $375 million, of which $353 million related to our share of net profits outside the US. Now to our operating expenses. Second quarter R&D expense grew 10% year-over-year to $1.1 billion, reflecting continued investments to support our robust pipeline, including late-stage oncology and hematology programs. We continue to make thoughtful investments to enable us to move quickly into Phase III programs is supported by data readouts anticipated over the next 12 to 18 months. SG&A grew 19% from the prior year to $666 million in the second quarter, primarily driven by investment to support the launch of EYLEA HD as well as our ongoing international commercial expansion. Second quarter gross margin and net product sales was approximately 89%, which reflected ongoing start-up costs for our fill/finish manufacturing facility. Now to cash flow and the balance sheet. Regeneron generated approximately $1.6 billion in free cash flow through the first six months of 2024 and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $14.8 billion. We repurchased approximately $900 million of our shares through the first six months of the year and had approximately $3.6 billion available for repurchases as of the end of the second quarter. Finally, we have made some minor changes to our full year 2024 financial guidance. We have updated our 2024 gross margin guidance and now expect gross margin to be approximately 89%, primarily reflecting anticipated changes in product mix as well as higher non-product specific costs, including start-up costs for our fill/finish facility. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. In summary, Regeneron delivered outstanding results in the second quarter and is well positioned to continue to drive growth in the near and long-term. With that, I'll pass the call back to Ryan.\nRyan Crowe: Thank you, Chris. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for Q&A. To ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. Shannon, can we go to the first question, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nTyler Van Buren: Hey, guys. Good morning. Congratulations on the great quarter. Regarding the EYLEA franchise, I'm really encouraged to see that the overall franchise is up year-over-year and that the 45% category share is maintained quarter-over-quarter. So do you believe that EYLEA HD is reaching a stage and maturity of its launch, where it will allow the overall category share to be relatively stable in the coming quarters that will allow you to participate in the retinal disease market growth and is the market still growing around 10% year-over-year?\nRyan Crowe: Marion?\nMarion McCourt: So Tyler, I'll take it in a couple of pieces. Thank you for the question. First, I did want to comment, we were very pleased to report the total net sales of 1.4, excuse me, $1.54 billion in the quarter. Obviously, as you mentioned, that's a 2.4% increase year-over-year. Additionally, I'll just comment a little bit more on EYLEA HD. We certainly are very much in the launch stage. This is our third full quarter of results that we're reporting today. And certainly, we're encouraged that in the quarter, we had a 52% increase in net sales. And certainly, that calculation represents $100 million net sales increase from the prior quarter, which is very significant in this competitive market. So certainly, we are continuing to progress our launch and see it is important. Certainly, EYLEA is an important source of switch patients for EYLEA HD. Next, we see switches coming from faricimab, also avastin, very pleased as well this quarter to report that we're seeing increased use of EYLEA HD in naive patient population. So all-in-all, we see this indicative that EYLEA HD has the potential and certainly the profile to be the new standard-of-care. I think you also asked me about market growth, overall market growth. Let me cover that as well. I would say probably at this stage in the year, we're tracking more on single-digit growth in the category in the midrange as opposed to double-digit, which I think is what was cited in your question.\nRyan Crowe: That's right. Okay. Thank you, Marion. Let's move to the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question and always congrats on the progress. I want to touch on your work in obesity specifically with leptin. Can you just walk me through some of the rationale of moving this to a Phase II? I know that leptin had been kind of controversial, clearly, you saw some interesting data in earlier trials. But why do you want to add this on top of say, tirzepatide, versus using triple agonist that Lilly is doing some of the other trials. Thank you so much.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Well, we have leptin going forward in a number of different programs. I believe the one that you're talking about is in combination with other weight loss agent. And that's based on results that suggest that the reason leptin doesn't work in normal obese patients is because in those patients who have a high degree of fat and are in fact on the upswing of their obesity profile, their leptin levels are very high. They're already saturating. Once you undergo profound weight loss, the leptin levels drop and you may be getting into the range where the leptin is now providing a signal, which is creating an increased desire in the individual to each. And so in these patients, it may be that some of the weight loss is limited by decreases in the leptin, which is then driving increasing feeding type of behavior. So this might be and at least it's been shown in animal studies to be the situation where leptin might actually be playing an important role. So as you point out, in historical studies in stably obese patients, leptin is already saturated and giving more leptin may not have a benefit. But in these settings where there are falling leptin levels, the falling and low leptin levels may lead to a food-seeking drive and giving leptin in that setting may allow further weight loss on top of that obtained with these other agents, which tend to plateau at a certain point, and that plateau at least based on animal studies may be in part driven by these drops in the leptin. And these studies, as you know, are done in collaboration with a partnership with Lilly. So there -- so we're studying it in collaboration with their agent tirzepatide.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks, George. Let's move to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nBrian Abrahams: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the quarter and all the progress. On linvo, as you prepare for the potential launch there, I'm curious the feedback you're getting on how docs may position it relative to existing therapies, how much appreciation there is out there for the efficacy and administration advantages that you cited in your slide? And maybe you could also elaborate a little bit more on some of the issues with the third-party facility and they're confident if that's resolved. Thanks.\nLeonard Schleifer: I'll take the third-party issue and George can cover or Marion, how people are thinking about a BCMA approach and where it might fit in the longer term. There's been a lot of third-party filler type and manufacturing issues with lots of CRLs across our, the biopharmaceutical space. As you know, we had one last year with HD EYLEA and this was a case where the FDA was inspecting our filler for a different product. And they found some observations the observation is needed to be remediated, but because of the nature of the observations, a reinspection is necessary, we believe, based on what we've been told is that the observations have been remediated. But since there's a reinspection required, it might not get done, it's likely not to get done in time for our PDUFA date. That's why we called your attention to that. This is an industry-wide kind of issue. I think the FDA is, in fact, having planning some sort of public hearing on these sorts of things. We're working with the FDA because this is a priority review application to see how we can resolve this in this expeditious manner as possible. George or Marion, do you want to cover these.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes, I'll start and then I'll hand it over to Marion. But as we summarize and we've detailed and as we'll continue to be presented, the efficacy data with our bispecific continues to look like it is leading the field as the data matures, and patients continue on treatment, they continue to progress to deeper and deeper responses and where now we have complete response rates at 50% with, we believe, best-in-class PFS and overall survival type numbers. This is obviously really important because what cancer treatment is all about is trying to eliminate the cancer and getting long-term durable responses and survival in the patients. And we would imagine that this is exactly what patients and physicians are focused about. Other aspects of our profile, we also believe in terms of safety and our dosing schedule and hospitalization burden also, we believe, are best-in-class. In terms of how Marion believes the physician community is appreciating the data, I'll ask Marion to comment on that.\nMarion McCourt: Thanks, George. And certainly, we're very excited about the potential upcoming approval for linvoseltamab. George describes the differentiated clinical efficacy, safety profile that will be incredibly important to physicians. We have a highly experienced hematology team in place and ready for launch.\nLeonard Schleifer: Yes, I would just add, this is Len. I would just add that we're not limiting ourselves, obviously, just to the last line. We are trying to move this aggressively either in monotherapy or in combinations to much early lines of therapy. The rule of thumb has been in cancer that you tend to get more responses as you move to earlier lines. But this would be quite remarkable given what George just told you about the amount of responses we're seeing in the last line. So we're very excited about moving this forward and we'll go -- we'll keep you updated as we do that.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. Just a follow-up on what Len said, obviously, this is why we're moving to these trials in these earlier lines of therapy. Obviously, we won't be commercializing those areas until we get the results from those clinical trial.\nBrian Abrahams: Sure. Absolutely.\nRyan Crowe: All right, gentlemen. Let's go to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nCory Kasimov: Thank you, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So we're getting an increasing amount of inbound interest in your Factor XI program. Can you speak to the differences, I guess, probably for George between your two antibodies? And what will be the key aspects you'll be focused on in your upcoming readouts to know you're on the right track? Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. So very importantly, what we've done is we've created antibodies that split the mechanism of action. One affects the activation domain, the other the catalytic domain. We have developed in both these classes, the only ones in class or the best-in-class type of antibodies, which are best at actually hitting and inhibiting that target based on all of the signs, a huge amount of genetics in part fortified by our own Regeneron genetics efforts and so forth, it suggests that these two approaches will allow us to separate and optimize optimum efficacy and optimum safety. So it's quite possible that we might actually move forward with both of these antibodies for different target populations in some of which where efficacy is the primary driver and others where safety might be most important. So they're very unique in their mechanisms of action. They really are exploring this target both much more precisely by splitting the mechanism of action, but also more powerfully than competitors that have antibodies that can do one or the other of these things. So we're very excited about these programs. As we said, we have some proof-of-concept studies ongoing and we hope by the end of the year to be able to announce the directions we may be taking either or both of these antibodies going forward in the future.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks, George. Let's move to the next question, please, Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nChristopher Raymond: Hey, thanks. And just a quick question on EYLEA and the commercial progress. So you guys, I think, were pretty clear in your messaging on the permanent J-code is we should not really see an inflection that was sort of seen maybe with VABYSMO when they got their permanent J-code as there were some other variables such as discounting, et cetera, going on with that example. But we've gotten some market feedback that access barriers remain even with the J-code change and specifically among Medicare Advantage plans. Marion, I'm kind of curious if you can sort of talk about the dynamic there and how you see things playing out with respect to access post permanent J-code.\nMarion McCourt: Sure. I'm very, very happy to comment. So certainly, for a portion of the market, fee-for-service Medicare patients, there's open access and freedom of prescribing for physicians. If we go to those areas of the market where there's a payer impact, our teams have successfully opened access for EYLEA HD in a way that covers over 80% of patient lives. So certainly, significant progress has been made and we continue to work through situations where physicians might be having some utilization management or step edits I will share that those are often easily managed when the physician and office staff provide information. But overall, the takeaway message should be that EYLEA HD has a very strong payer coverage. And again 80% of the market where reimbursement is in place.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks, Marion. Let's move to the next question, Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Akash Tewari with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nKatherine Wang: Hi. This is Kathy on for Akash. So for your myostatin program, can you talk about your preference for using a doublet versus triplet combination approach in your Phase III trials? And also where do you think myostatin will stack up versus GIP, GLP, amylin combination approaches, which could show potentially like 90% plus fat versus muscle loss. Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. Well, once again, what we focused on is creating individual reagents that allow us to best dissect the pathway and separate out which are the most important players. As you're aware, other people, for example, are using an antibody that blocks all the pathways, not only the two that we've targeted, but about 20 others that are irrelevant for muscle and we know are known to have a variety of other potential side effects and adverse effects. So we targeted the two muscle specific pathways in this whole mechanism. And what we want to see is which one might have the best efficacy to safety profile that we believe is very important. Once we determine that, we may move forward with either one or both of these antibodies in combination with the weight loss agents or we also have been developing in our pipeline, a variety of unimolecular solutions that will allow a single molecule to do whichever one of these multiple pathways we want to attack in addition to the weight loss pathway. So what we're hoping to do is by dissecting the pathway as precisely and scientifically as possible, allow us to choose between the unimolecular solutions that we can have to follow on. That said, remember, it's not just a matter of amplifying the weight loss because with more weight loss, regardless of pathway you use, you can throw on the GLP-1 agonist, you can throw on GPR antagonist, you can lay on additional pathways. The more rate loss and the more rapidly occurs, which is what patients want, out of necessity because you're mimicking the starvation to get the pathway, it inevitably leads to muscle loss because of why, because of activation of these very pathways that we're looking at. So any approach right now that focuses on rapidly causing weight loss will of necessity because it plugs into evolutionarily conserved pathways of necessity will result in profound lean body and muscle loss, which can be a huge detriment to these patients especially the older obese patient. And by invoking these agents blocking these specific pathways, we may be able to do two things. We may block this associated necessarily evolutionary conserved muscle loss that accompanies rapid and profound weight loss while also perhaps increasing the amount of fat loss, which is what you specifically want to lose. This is what we've now shown in preclinical studies, including through nonhuman primates and these studies that we're embarking on right now should tell us whether all of these pathways, which are incredibly evolutionarily conserved will indeed pertain in humans and whether we really can optimize not only the weight loss, that's not what's important, but optimize particularly fat loss while maintaining the muscle. And we believe we're the only ones who are properly precisely interrogating the pathways and we'll be able to dissect them to decide on which exactly is the best, safest pathway to give the best benefit to the patient.\nRyan Crowe: Okay. Thanks, George. Shannon, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the question. Just on linvo, DUPIXENT and food allergy. I know it's early but an exciting program. Can you help us just a bit to frame out the number of patients or percent of those with food allergy where you think this could be an appropriate treatment if the data we see later this year and going forward supports moving that combination forward? Thanks so much.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: I think that it's all going to be a matter of the benefit to risk profile once again. And this is what, as I've said in these other programs we're focusing on. We believe, based on all the data that we've shown, that we may have a very safe way of eliminating the actual cells that are causing all these allergic responses and then very safely keep them from coming back by giving one of the world's historically most safe biologics, which is DUPIXENT. Of course, we have to prove this in patients. And so we are starting in the most severe food allergy patients. And in these patients where they have, for example, very high unmet need, very high risks and so forth, it warrants undertaking this approach. The more effective it is, but more importantly, the safer we can prove it is then the broader the population can go. And in fact, if ultimately, we really have a very safe way of eliminating all allergy inducing cells and then preventing their rebound. And remember, particularly, most of these patients are also suffering from other allergic diseases, some of them may already be indicated for DUPIXENT. So you're giving them a drug which may actually be helping them anyway and has been shown to be quite safe in terms of as almost any biologic goes. We may be able to go into milder and milder allergy patients. So we can start and we are starting with the most severe patients we're seeing in these patients with a high unmet need, whether this approach is both effective, but also safe and how safe it is and the safer it is, we can broaden wider and wider. There's also ultimately no need to be limited to food allergies, you can actually eliminate essentially all allergies from the most serious to the most mundane, but it depends on the benefit risk and the safety, which is what we're testing in these initial studies. And for the initial studies, we're taking the most severe food-allergic patients who have a very high unmet need and very high risk profile depending on how it goes there, we can broaden to milder and milder types of disease.\nLeonard Schleifer: I mean the numbers I get are quite staggering. Looking at -- if you just look at the number of emergency room visits a year, it could be hundreds of thousands of millions of people go to the emergency room for food-based allergies. Obviously, a smaller number for actual anaphylaxis. But just to reinforce exactly what George says, if all it takes is an induction in BCMA to induce the process where you can get on to Dupi, Dupi is a very safe agent, and we've got hundreds of thousands, approaching million of patients on the drug. So we know the profile of that drug. So this is all makes great scientific sense. We just have to take our time, do it safely and see how it develops.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks, Len and George. Let's move to the next question, please, Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nTim Anderson: Thank you very much. I have a question on EYLEA and this DOJ investigation into the marketing practices that emerged since April, where they assert that you guys violate the False Claims Act. Can you provide an update on kind of what happens from here, specifically in the interim and out of prudence, has Regeneron changed any of its marketing practices since April. And is that having any impact even on prescribers. I asked because on Slide 6, you mentioned, other market dynamics that resulted in lower volumes and lower price. I am just wondering what those where.\nLeonard Schleifer: There's nothing in the marketplace related to this lawsuit. And frankly we think there's nothing to this lawsuit. And we have not changed our practice, and we intend to fight it vigorously. And I think once you see our papers in court, you'll get a much better understanding of that.\nRyan Crowe: Let's move to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.\nDavid Risinger: Yes. Thanks very much. So Regeneron is obviously a tremendous R&D leader, but there's also substantial innovation happening outside of the company, and the company has a tremendous balance sheet that it's not really putting to work. So my question is, is there an opportunity to leverage Regeneron's eye disease commercial presence by acquiring novel potential blockbuster therapies for severe eye disease. And if so, does the company see any opportunities in the near to medium term to do so? Thanks very much.\nLeonard Schleifer: Yes, it's a great question, and it's one we ask every day here. Is there some opportunity that we are -- isn't resulting from our own innovation that we should be trying to acquire. We have not seen any such large scale. Obviously, we've done some smaller scale and hundreds of millions of kind of numbers or a few million and whether or not we would -- we could leverage any of our in-line products or research capabilities, it's certainly something we think about, but there's nothing that we at the moment for late-stage products see an opportunity for.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks, Len. Let's move to the next question please, Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nSalveen Richter: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On the Factor XI programs here, could you speak to the potential commercial opportunity that are represented and what the future development plans look like here? Thank you.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: Well, as I said, we're in the stages of evaluating our Factor XI two classes of antibodies that are attacking this pathway in two different ways. We expect I think we've already talked about. One of them will be more effective at preventing clot formation, but potentially come with slightly more serious side effect profiles. The other might be less effective, but much safer. And as I said, we thought it was important to really precisely interrogate this pathway using these two antibodies that are attacking, two different parts. So this is one enzyme. It has an activation domain, a catalytic domain. And by blocking independently the two different domains, we expect to deliver two different profiles each one with the best-in-class antibody. Once we really understand those profiles, we will understand in which directions to be taken either one or both potentially in antibodies. We can easily imagine taking forward, the more effective one, but for a higher-risk patients, let's say, the less effective one into settings where you might want more safety and clot prevention is not as important. So all of this is going to depend on these profiles. And as I said, we hope to get our key data by the end of this year, and that should better define the efficacy and safety profile how they compare to the various existing agents that are out there now and which direction to take them for which indication. So two antibodies, two distinct profiles we hope to better understand them based on our initial proof-of-concept study. And from there, we'll understand where to take them and what the ultimate opportunity will be. But obviously there's still enormous need here for agents that can block, clot and thrombus formation. And so much depends on safety profiles here, and we're very excited about having the opportunity to have these two very related but distinct profiles.\nLeonard Schleifer: Just to amplify a little bit of what George said the direct oral anticoagulant market is a very, very large market. It's about a $20 billion market. if you could bring to part of that market, most of that market or some fragment similar efficacy, but with a better safety profile then you really have a big opportunity here. So that's what we're sort of focusing on. Can we deliver with one or the other antibody in the proper setting, as George was suggesting a same or better efficacy, but with a better safety profile. If we can give you that, if we can give patients that, then we will be able to really have a big large market opportunity.\nGeorge Yancopoulos: And there are many settings where you don't use certain agents because of the safety profile, which could create whole new opportunities as well.\nRyan Crowe: Okay. Thank you. Let's move to the next question please, Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nCarter Gould: Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. I appreciated the earlier commentary from Len on the pre-filled syringe effort, I guess, but for Marion and the team, just the confidence that the high dose launch momentum won't be disrupted by the relative near-term disadvantage of VABYSMO having a pre-filled syringe and if you wanted to give more specificity on your own time lines, that would be appreciated. Thank you.\nLeonard Schleifer: Well, I think I said in my prepared remarks that we're anticipating a launch in early 2025. I'm not sure what the competition is actually going to do about launching, but we're a matter of months, I think, a part if they launch ahead of us. And so I don't think that, that's going to have a significant impact in the marketplace where people really are focused, I think, on the profile of our drug, the durability of our drug, the safety experience they've had with aflibercept, the active ingredient. So we feel pretty confident in the ongoing launch.\nRyan Crowe: Okay. Thank you. We have time for two more questions, please, Shannon.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Chris on for Terence. Just one question from us about EYLEA HD. Given what you have seen in the market dynamics in 2Q. How should we think about the pace of conversion for the second half of 2024?\nLeonard Schleifer: You should think hard about it. That's your job. I don't know if Marion wants to have any comment there.\nMarion McCourt: I would just say that as I commented earlier, we're very pleased in our progress in the EYLEA HD launch.\nRyan Crowe: All right. Thank you. Let's move to the final question, please, Shannon.\nOperator: Our last question is from the line of Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMohit Bansal: Thank you very much for taking my question, Shannon. I just want to, again, talk about EYLEA HD. In terms of -- Marion, if you could comment on, at this point, how much is switch versus naive patient adjustment? I assume most of them are switch and are they difficult to treat patients in the beginning? And then when you think about going forward, do you think you're in the early innings of conversion? Or do you think there is some other dynamics we should think about from the pricing as well as access point of view as we model EYLEA HD versus standard dose EYLEA going forward? Thank you.\nMarion McCourt: So it's always a combination of initiation for EYLEA HD of switch patients and then, of course, naive patients. So I'd mentioned the profile today of switch patients to EYLEA HD, which is very encouraging comes not surprisingly from EYLEA because it's the largest product in the category, secondarily from faricimab. And then the third source of switch patients would be avastin and then there's everything else. But what's really encouraging, as I mentioned in the quarter, is that the utilization among treatment-naive patients doubled from the prior quarter. So we'll continue to see an ongoing combination as does every product potentially, if it's got the right profile in the category, but the evolution of prescribing to EYLEA HD is progressing very well.\nRyan Crowe: Thanks, Marion, and thanks to everyone who dialed in today for your interest in Regeneron. We apologize to those remaining in the Q&A queue that did not have a chance -- that we did not have a chance to hear from. As always, the IR team is available to answer any remaining questions that you may have. Thank you once again and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, George. Our second quarter commercial results further solidify Regeneron's leadership across therapeutic categories. Our performance demonstrates the ongoing strength and diversity of our product portfolio with continued growth opportunities powered by existing and upcoming product and indication launches across multiple geographies. I'll start with EYLEA HD and EYLEA in the US. In the second quarter, combined net sales for both medicines grew 2.3% year-over-year to $1.53 billion. EYLEA continues its clear category leadership while EYLEA HD remained the fastest growing medicine in this highly competitive category. EYLEA HD continued its launch momentum in the second quarter, delivering net product sales of $304 million, which represents 52% sequential growth. EYLEA HD continues to be the fastest launch of any anti-VEGF therapy since EYLEA more than a decade ago and the trajectory confirms a significant transition to EYLEA HD is underway. The breadth and depth of EYLEA HD prescribing continues to grow with utilization across a broad range of patients, including a treatment-naive population, which has doubled since last quarter. Physicians are also increasingly switching patients to EYLEA HD from other anti-VEGF treatments based on their positive early treatment experiences. And these switch patients, early real-world data indicate that treatment intervals are being extended with EYLEA HD. EYLEA HD's durability, along with the same trusted efficacy, visual acuity and safety as EYLEA represents a meaningful improvement for patient lives and greater efficiency for physician practices. The number of physician offices ordering EYLEA HD during the second quarter increased by more than 50% compared to the prior quarter. We believe this suggests prescriber confidence in EYLEA HD's clinical profile as well as in reimbursement now that the permanent J-code has been well established. Of note, we recognize the importance of providing physicians with a pre-filled syringe option and as Len mentioned, we're excited about our anticipated EYLEA HD pre-filled syringe launch. In summary, we're pleased with our second quarter performance for EYLEA HD and EYLEA and remain on track to achieve our goal of establishing EYLEA HD as the new standard-of-care for retinal disease. Next to DUPIXENT, which delivered 29% growth in the second quarter on a constant currency basis with global net sales of $3.56 billion. We are approaching the important milestone of 1 million patients on DUPIXENT worldwide. In addition, there's substantial opportunity for even more patients to benefit from DUPIXENT based on significant unmet need across indications, ages and geographies. In the US, net sales grew 24% to $2.61 billion, driven by an increased demand across all five approved indications. DUPIXENT continues its number one leadership position and new-to-brand prescriptions across all approved indications. Our commercial team remains laser-focused on pursuing initiatives that drive patient awareness and support prescribing. We continue to see increasing penetration in our blockbuster indications of atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyps. Additionally, recent launches in eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis are exceeding our expectations and new patient initiations are steadily increasing. We hear remarkable stories of patients as young as one year of age with EoE, who are now thriving on DUPIXENT following its approval in January of this year. The European Commission also recently approved DUPIXENT in COPD patients with raised blood eosinophils with patients already getting treatment in Germany. We all recognize that there is significant unmet need worldwide among patients with this debilitating disease and DUPIXENT represents the first biologic medicine for COPD. Our US team is ready for the anticipated FDA approval of DUPIXENT in COPD by late September and estimate approximately 300,000 US patients may benefit from DUPIXENT in this indication separately, an FDA decision for DUPIXENT in adolescents with chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps is expected next month. As George mentioned, there are two DUPIXENT Phase III programs reading out later this year in chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid. If data from these trials are positive, DUPIXENT has the potential to support even more patients with unmet need. We also made significant progress with LIBTAYO in the second quarter with global net sales of $297 million, up 43% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Strong commercial execution resulted in market share gains across both skin and lung cancers. In the US, net sales grew 40% to $182 million with growth across all market segments and indications. In non-melanoma skin cancer, we continue to extend LIBTAYO leadership with increasing demand and market share. In lung cancer, LIBTAYO is recognized by physicians as an important therapy for their lung cancer patients and continues to gradually gain market share. Outside the US, our teams are delivering excellent results with net product sales of $115 million as Regeneron continues its international expansion. LIBTAYO net product sales in some of these international markets were favorably impacted by approximately $15 million of stocking purchases. Our oncology team is also eagerly awaiting the potential FDA and EU decisions for linvoseltamab in late-stage myeloma. We believe linvoseltamab represents a best-in-class opportunity and we look forward to potential launch. In summary, our commercial team continues to deliver on our goal to provide Regeneron medicines to even more patients worldwide. There is meaningful future growth potential within our approved indications and our robust pipeline provides both near and long-term opportunities to advance patient care. With that I'll turn the call over to Chris. So Tyler, I'll take it in a couple of pieces. Thank you for the question. First, I did want to comment, we were very pleased to report the total net sales of 1.4, excuse me, $1.54 billion in the quarter. Obviously, as you mentioned, that's a 2.4% increase year-over-year. Additionally, I'll just comment a little bit more on EYLEA HD. We certainly are very much in the launch stage. This is our third full quarter of results that we're reporting today. And certainly, we're encouraged that in the quarter, we had a 52% increase in net sales. And certainly, that calculation represents $100 million net sales increase from the prior quarter, which is very significant in this competitive market. So certainly, we are continuing to progress our launch and see it is important. Certainly, EYLEA is an important source of switch patients for EYLEA HD. Next, we see switches coming from faricimab, also avastin, very pleased as well this quarter to report that we're seeing increased use of EYLEA HD in naive patient population. So all-in-all, we see this indicative that EYLEA HD has the potential and certainly the profile to be the new standard-of-care. I think you also asked me about market growth, overall market growth. Let me cover that as well. I would say probably at this stage in the year, we're tracking more on single-digit growth in the category in the midrange as opposed to double-digit, which I think is what was cited in your question. Thanks, George. And certainly, we're very excited about the potential upcoming approval for linvoseltamab. George describes the differentiated clinical efficacy, safety profile that will be incredibly important to physicians. We have a highly experienced hematology team in place and ready for launch. Sure. I'm very, very happy to comment. So certainly, for a portion of the market, fee-for-service Medicare patients, there's open access and freedom of prescribing for physicians. If we go to those areas of the market where there's a payer impact, our teams have successfully opened access for EYLEA HD in a way that covers over 80% of patient lives. So certainly, significant progress has been made and we continue to work through situations where physicians might be having some utilization management or step edits I will share that those are often easily managed when the physician and office staff provide information. But overall, the takeaway message should be that EYLEA HD has a very strong payer coverage. And again 80% of the market where reimbursement is in place. I would just say that as I commented earlier, we're very pleased in our progress in the EYLEA HD launch. So it's always a combination of initiation for EYLEA HD of switch patients and then, of course, naive patients. So I'd mentioned the profile today of switch patients to EYLEA HD, which is very encouraging comes not surprisingly from EYLEA because it's the largest product in the category, secondarily from faricimab. And then the third source of switch patients would be avastin and then there's everything else. But what's really encouraging, as I mentioned in the quarter, is that the utilization among treatment-naive patients doubled from the prior quarter. So we'll continue to see an ongoing combination as does every product potentially, if it's got the right profile in the category, but the evolution of prescribing to EYLEA HD is progressing very well."

            "content": "Thanks, Ryan. Thanks to everyone joining today's call. Regeneron continued its track record of strong execution highlighted by double-digit revenue and earnings growth in the second quarter along with important advances across our broad pipeline. For my remarks today, I'd like to briefly review some of the key performance drivers for the quarter and then discuss near-term pipeline opportunities. After my remarks, George will provide further updates on our pipeline. Marion will then review our commercial performance. And finally Chris will detail our quarterly financial results and discuss updates to our full year guidance. Second quarter 2024 total revenues grew 12% to $3.55 billion, primarily driven by sales of EYLEA HD in the United States. Higher Sanofi collaboration revenues reflecting the continued strong performance of DUPIXENT as well as robust growth for LIBTAYO. EYLEA HD generated $304 million in its third full quarter on the US market and continues to outperform recent launches in the anti-VEGF category. Net product sales for EYLEA HD and EYLEA combined were $1.53 billion, representing a 2.3% growth compared to the prior year. We are encouraged that despite increased competition in the anti-VEGF space, we have achieved a strong EYLEA HD launch trajectory while maintaining our category-leading combined EYLEA HD and EYLEA market share of 45%. Our efforts to bring an EYLEA HD pre-filled syringe, the United States market remain a high priority, and we are tracking towards a potential pre-filled syringe launch by early 2025. In summary, we continue to position EYLEA HD as the new standard-of-care for retinal diseases based on its differentiated clinical profile, coupled with strong familiarity and satisfaction among retinal specialists. DUPIXENT global revenues grew 29% on a constant currency basis to $3.56 billion, reflecting strong growth across all approved indications, age groups and geographies. In June, the European Commission approved DUPIXENT for COPD in patients with raised blood eosinophils, marking the first global regulatory approval for DUPIXENT in COPD. This approval enables DUPIXENT to address the approximately 220,000 eosinophilic COPD patients in the EU that are currently uncontrolled on maximum and eligible therapy. The approval also represents the first biologic approved to treat this disease. We continue to work with the FDA regarding its ongoing review for this indication and expect their decision by the September 27 PDUFA date. We and our partner, Sanofi, are prepared for US launch that many pulmonologists, respiratory key opinion leaders and their patients have been eagerly anticipating. There is a high unmet need in COPD with Type 2 inflammation with approximately 300,000 eligible patients in the United States and our potential launch represents a significant driver for DUPIXENT's continued growth. LIBTAYO global net product sales were $297 million in the second quarter, an increase of 43% on a constant currency basis. Despite intense competition, LIBTAYO has maintained its leadership position in non-melanoma skin cancers, while making impressive inroads in non-small cell lung cancer. We are also pleased with the progress we have made in establishing an international commercial footprint to support LIBTAYO and other future products following our purchase of full global rights to LIBTAYO from Sanofi in mid-2022. Regarding linvoseltamab or BCMA by CD3 bispecific for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma, during its review of the linvoseltamab BLA, the FDA informed us that the third-party fill/finish manufacturer for linvoseltamab had unresolved findings from a preapproval inspection for another company's product candidate. While we now believe these findings have been resolved, a reinspection will be required, and therefore, we anticipate any potential FDA approval for linvoseltamab is likely to be delayed beyond the August 22 PDUFA date. The FDA has not informed us of any approvability issues for linvoseltamab related to safety, efficacy or the status of our ongoing confirmatory trial. More broadly on our pipeline, we are excited about several upcoming readouts later this year or in 2025 to further inform programs that could support significant long-term growth opportunities which George will discuss in a moment. In closing, our pipeline continues to generate innovative and differentiated opportunities and now has over 35 programs in clinical development spanning several distinct therapeutic areas. Our commercial team is executing well with our in-market products and is building momentum in competitive categories. Finally, we continue to prudently deploy capital with the goal of delivering long-term value to shareholders. With that I'll turn the call over to George. I'll take the third-party issue and George can cover or Marion, how people are thinking about a BCMA approach and where it might fit in the longer term. There's been a lot of third-party filler type and manufacturing issues with lots of CRLs across our, the biopharmaceutical space. As you know, we had one last year with HD EYLEA and this was a case where the FDA was inspecting our filler for a different product. And they found some observations the observation is needed to be remediated, but because of the nature of the observations, a reinspection is necessary, we believe, based on what we've been told is that the observations have been remediated. But since there's a reinspection required, it might not get done, it's likely not to get done in time for our PDUFA date. That's why we called your attention to that. This is an industry-wide kind of issue. I think the FDA is, in fact, having planning some sort of public hearing on these sorts of things. We're working with the FDA because this is a priority review application to see how we can resolve this in this expeditious manner as possible. George or Marion, do you want to cover these. Yes, I would just add, this is Len. I would just add that we're not limiting ourselves, obviously, just to the last line. We are trying to move this aggressively either in monotherapy or in combinations to much early lines of therapy. The rule of thumb has been in cancer that you tend to get more responses as you move to earlier lines. But this would be quite remarkable given what George just told you about the amount of responses we're seeing in the last line. So we're very excited about moving this forward and we'll go -- we'll keep you updated as we do that. I mean the numbers I get are quite staggering. Looking at -- if you just look at the number of emergency room visits a year, it could be hundreds of thousands of millions of people go to the emergency room for food-based allergies. Obviously, a smaller number for actual anaphylaxis. But just to reinforce exactly what George says, if all it takes is an induction in BCMA to induce the process where you can get on to Dupi, Dupi is a very safe agent, and we've got hundreds of thousands, approaching million of patients on the drug. So we know the profile of that drug. So this is all makes great scientific sense. We just have to take our time, do it safely and see how it develops. There's nothing in the marketplace related to this lawsuit. And frankly we think there's nothing to this lawsuit. And we have not changed our practice, and we intend to fight it vigorously. And I think once you see our papers in court, you'll get a much better understanding of that. Yes, it's a great question, and it's one we ask every day here. Is there some opportunity that we are -- isn't resulting from our own innovation that we should be trying to acquire. We have not seen any such large scale. Obviously, we've done some smaller scale and hundreds of millions of kind of numbers or a few million and whether or not we would -- we could leverage any of our in-line products or research capabilities, it's certainly something we think about, but there's nothing that we at the moment for late-stage products see an opportunity for. Just to amplify a little bit of what George said the direct oral anticoagulant market is a very, very large market. It's about a $20 billion market. if you could bring to part of that market, most of that market or some fragment similar efficacy, but with a better safety profile then you really have a big opportunity here. So that's what we're sort of focusing on. Can we deliver with one or the other antibody in the proper setting, as George was suggesting a same or better efficacy, but with a better safety profile. If we can give you that, if we can give patients that, then we will be able to really have a big large market opportunity. Well, I think I said in my prepared remarks that we're anticipating a launch in early 2025. I'm not sure what the competition is actually going to do about launching, but we're a matter of months, I think, a part if they launch ahead of us. And so I don't think that, that's going to have a significant impact in the marketplace where people really are focused, I think, on the profile of our drug, the durability of our drug, the safety experience they've had with aflibercept, the active ingredient. So we feel pretty confident in the ongoing launch. You should think hard about it. That's your job. I don't know if Marion wants to have any comment there."

            "content": "Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron delivered strong double-digit top and bottom line growth in the second quarter. Total revenues increased 12% year-over-year to $3.5 billion, primarily driven by strong execution of the ongoing EYLEA HD launch in the US, higher Sanofi collaboration revenue and continued global sales growth from LIBTAYO. Second quarter diluted net income per share grew 13% from the prior year to $11.56 on net income of $1.4 billion. Second quarter revenues from our Sanofi collaboration grew to $1.1 billion, primarily composed of our share of collaboration profits of $988 million, which increased by 32% compared to the prior year driven by DUPIXENT's continued volume growth and improving margins. Reimbursement from manufacturing and commercial supply, the other component of Sanofi collaboration revenue was $157 million, taking into account increased volumes, offset by manufacturing efficiencies, we continue to expect reimbursement for manufacturing and commercial supply in 2024 to be comparable to 2023 on a full year basis. The Sanofi development balance was approximately $2 billion at the end of the second quarter, reflecting a reduction of approximately $190 million from the end of the first quarter. We continue to anticipate this balance will be fully reimbursed to Sanofi by the end of 2026. Moving to Bayer. Second quarter ex-US net sales of EYLEA and EYLEA 8 mg were $908 million, up 8% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $375 million, of which $353 million related to our share of net profits outside the US. Now to our operating expenses. Second quarter R&D expense grew 10% year-over-year to $1.1 billion, reflecting continued investments to support our robust pipeline, including late-stage oncology and hematology programs. We continue to make thoughtful investments to enable us to move quickly into Phase III programs is supported by data readouts anticipated over the next 12 to 18 months. SG&A grew 19% from the prior year to $666 million in the second quarter, primarily driven by investment to support the launch of EYLEA HD as well as our ongoing international commercial expansion. Second quarter gross margin and net product sales was approximately 89%, which reflected ongoing start-up costs for our fill/finish manufacturing facility. Now to cash flow and the balance sheet. Regeneron generated approximately $1.6 billion in free cash flow through the first six months of 2024 and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $14.8 billion. We repurchased approximately $900 million of our shares through the first six months of the year and had approximately $3.6 billion available for repurchases as of the end of the second quarter. Finally, we have made some minor changes to our full year 2024 financial guidance. We have updated our 2024 gross margin guidance and now expect gross margin to be approximately 89%, primarily reflecting anticipated changes in product mix as well as higher non-product specific costs, including start-up costs for our fill/finish facility. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. In summary, Regeneron delivered outstanding results in the second quarter and is well positioned to continue to drive growth in the near and long-term. With that, I'll pass the call back to Ryan."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "George Yancopoulos",
            "content": "Thank you, Len. Starting with DUPIXENT. Regarding COPD, data from our second confirmatory trial, NOTUS was featured as a late-breaking presentation at the American Thoracic Society Conference and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. In NOTUS, DUPIXENT reduced exacerbations by 34%, while significantly improving lung function confirming the unprecedented results from the previously reported Phase III BOREAS trial. Based on data from NOTUS and BOREAS, DUPIXENT was recently approved by the European regulatory authorities for eosinophilic COPD patients uncontrolled on maximum standard-of-care inhaled therapy. Additional submissions are under review with other regulatory authorities around the world, including in the US, China and Japan. Beyond COPD later this year, we are looking forward to data readouts from Phase III studies of DUPIXENT in chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid. Seven years after its initial FDA approval and with approval in seven different indications around the world DUPIXENT continues to deliver potential new approvals for additional important disease indications. Regarding our small pilot study to potentially eliminate severe food allergies using our innovative approach that combines DUPIXENT and linvoseltamab or BCMA by CD3 bispecific, we continue to expect to see initial data by the end of this year. On itepekimab, our IL-33 antibody in development for certain COPD patients, our two Phase III studies are now fully enrolled, study readouts and regulatory submissions for our second therapeutic candidate for this devastating disease are expected in the second half of next year. Moving to oncology and starting with fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody in combination with LIBTAYO, at the upcoming ESMO meeting in September, we look forward to presenting longer-term follow-up on the metastatic melanoma cohorts from our first-in-human study. Responses have continued to deepen with the proportion of complete responders and median progression-free survival continuing to improve. These results strengthen our view that fianlimab and LIBTAYO may be the most promising immunotherapy combination in clinical development. As we recently announced, we are looking forward to the Phase III readout in this melanoma setting next year, which could position fianlimab and LIBTAYO as a new standard-of-care in melanoma and eventually potentially other cancer settings. Additionally, we hope to gain insights into the antitumor activity of this combination in non-small cell lung cancer later this year. We are also advancing fianlimab development to earlier lines of therapy with proof-of-concepts in perioperative non-small cell lung cancer and perioperative melanoma now underway with additional indications likely to follow. On to bispecifics for solid tumors. Our costimulatory bispecific antibodies are being tested in numerous studies, including as monotherapies as well as in combination with CD3 bispecifics and with LIBTAYO. At the ASCO Conference, we presented results for our EGFR by CD28 bispecific in combination with LIBTAYO. In microsatellite stable colorectal cancer tumor historically unresponsive to immunotherapy, EGFR by CD28 in combination with LIBTAYO demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity with an overall response rate of 20% in patients without liver metastases. Regarding safety, to-date, we have not observed severe immune-related adverse events with this agent at our recommended Phase II dose. Dose expansion cohorts testing EGFR by CD28 plus LIBTAYO continue to enroll in various solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer with or without EGFR mutations, microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, head and neck, squamous cell carcinoma and others. On to our PSMA by CD28 costimulatory bispecific, which has already demonstrated promising activity in late-line prostate cancer when combined with LIBTAYO. We have now initiated combination treatment of our PSMA by CD28 costim bispecific with our PSMA by CD3 bispecific, which based on preclinical studies may maintain the efficacy of served with the LIBTAYO combination that may improve the safety and tolerability profile. We are also testing PSMA by CD28 in other cancers. Next, to our bispecifics for hematology oncology, the linvoseltamab or BCMA by CD3 bispecific, an oral presentation at the European Hematologic Association Conference we presented updated pivotal data, which continue to demonstrate a potentially best-in-class profile in late-line myeloma in terms of efficacy, safety, dosing as well as hospitalization burden. As we expected, responses continue to deepen with longer follow-up. At 14-month median follow-up of 117 patients, 50% achieved a complete response or better with an objective overall response rate of 71%. Additional studies of linvoseltamab are now also underway in earlier stages of myeloma and in precursor conditions such as smoldering myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance or MGUS. Developing linvoseltamab in earlier-line myeloma settings presents an important opportunity for us to help patients and their physicians in these diseases, which currently have complex treatment paradigms. Touching on our nononcology hematology pipeline, as highlighted previously, later this year, we are anticipating proof-of-concept results for our two Factor XI antibodies in the setting of prevention of venous thromboembolism after knee replacement surgery. The study for the antibody targeting the Factor XI A2 domain is now fully enrolled and we expect to present results at a medical meeting in the second half of this year. Interim Phase II results for our second Factor XI antibody which targets the catalytic domain are expected by the end of this year for internal analysis. We have also started an additional proof-of-concept study to further evaluate the two antibodies profile for thrombosis prevention in patients, who have a peripherally inserted catheter. Results of these studies will inform whether to proceed to registrational studies with one or both of these antibodies by next year. Moving to obesity. Our most advanced approach is designed to address the potential negative consequences of widespread use of GLP and GIP receptor agonists. As has been widely reported, the profound weight loss caused by these agents unfortunately, it can also result in substantial loss of muscle, which is particularly concerning older obese patients. Our myostatin antibody when combined with semaglutide with or without our active NA antibody, may protect against this muscle loss as previously demonstrated in nonhuman primates. Part A of our COURAGE Phase II study testing a higher dose of trevogrumab or myostatin antibody in healthy subjects has now been successfully completed with no new safety signals identified. Part B of the study, which evaluates our muscle preservation antibodies in combination with semaglutide and obese participants has started enrolling patients assuming a reasonable pace of enrollment, we continue to expect to report top line results, including changes in body weight, fat mass and muscle mass by the second half of 2025. I will conclude with our genetics medicines efforts. At the ASGCT Conference, we presented updated data from our DB-OTO gene therapy program for genetic hearing loss due to mutations of the otoferlin gene. The first child treated with this therapy, an 11-month old girl, who is profoundly deaf at baseline had hearing in the normal range by 24 weeks after treatment. Also initial hearing improvements were observed in a second child dose at 4 years of age at a 6-week assessment with additional follow-up plan. As of July, we have dosed five patients in our study and we are on track to enroll several more patients this year. We also look forward to bringing additional otoferlin gene therapy programs to the clinic in the coming years with the potential to address more common forms of monogenic hearing loss. Regarding our Intellia collaboration, transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, the world's first Phase III program for in vivo CRISPR-based therapy is enrolling at a rapid pace indicating considerable interest from investigators and patients. In addition, we are also on track to be the first to use CRISPR technology to insert a corrective gene in vivo for a deficiency disease, hemophilia B. As noted previously, we have enrolled initial patients in the leading portion of this trial and first patient should be dosed soon. Our siRNA collaboration with Alnylam has not only demonstrated successful silencing of genes in the liver, but also for the first time for siRNA in the brain. This opens up opportunities for us to go after other disease-causing genes in the brain. A study of ALN-SOD in ALS patients with SOD1 mutations recently initiated. Other CNS-directed siRNA programs are expected to enter the clinic shortly, including targeting HTT for Huntington's disease, synuclein for Parkinson's and tau for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, with regard to our C5 program, our innovative approach involving the first combination of an antibody together with an siRNA both targeting the same molecule is progressing well and we are expecting to present updated data for initial potential indication, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria by the end of this year. We're also looking forward to starting our Phase III program in geographic atrophy in the second half of this year. In summary, we continue to drive forward our innovative development pipeline and anticipate reading out several pivotal and proof-of-concept data sets over the next 12 to 18 months. Our early research efforts continue to be productive with multiple novel programs potentially advancing to the clinic over that same time frame. And with that I will turn the call over to Marion. Well, we have leptin going forward in a number of different programs. I believe the one that you're talking about is in combination with other weight loss agent. And that's based on results that suggest that the reason leptin doesn't work in normal obese patients is because in those patients who have a high degree of fat and are in fact on the upswing of their obesity profile, their leptin levels are very high. They're already saturating. Once you undergo profound weight loss, the leptin levels drop and you may be getting into the range where the leptin is now providing a signal, which is creating an increased desire in the individual to each. And so in these patients, it may be that some of the weight loss is limited by decreases in the leptin, which is then driving increasing feeding type of behavior. So this might be and at least it's been shown in animal studies to be the situation where leptin might actually be playing an important role. So as you point out, in historical studies in stably obese patients, leptin is already saturated and giving more leptin may not have a benefit. But in these settings where there are falling leptin levels, the falling and low leptin levels may lead to a food-seeking drive and giving leptin in that setting may allow further weight loss on top of that obtained with these other agents, which tend to plateau at a certain point, and that plateau at least based on animal studies may be in part driven by these drops in the leptin. And these studies, as you know, are done in collaboration with a partnership with Lilly. So there -- so we're studying it in collaboration with their agent tirzepatide. Yes, I'll start and then I'll hand it over to Marion. But as we summarize and we've detailed and as we'll continue to be presented, the efficacy data with our bispecific continues to look like it is leading the field as the data matures, and patients continue on treatment, they continue to progress to deeper and deeper responses and where now we have complete response rates at 50% with, we believe, best-in-class PFS and overall survival type numbers. This is obviously really important because what cancer treatment is all about is trying to eliminate the cancer and getting long-term durable responses and survival in the patients. And we would imagine that this is exactly what patients and physicians are focused about. Other aspects of our profile, we also believe in terms of safety and our dosing schedule and hospitalization burden also, we believe, are best-in-class. In terms of how Marion believes the physician community is appreciating the data, I'll ask Marion to comment on that. Yes. Just a follow-up on what Len said, obviously, this is why we're moving to these trials in these earlier lines of therapy. Obviously, we won't be commercializing those areas until we get the results from those clinical trial. Yes. So very importantly, what we've done is we've created antibodies that split the mechanism of action. One affects the activation domain, the other the catalytic domain. We have developed in both these classes, the only ones in class or the best-in-class type of antibodies, which are best at actually hitting and inhibiting that target based on all of the signs, a huge amount of genetics in part fortified by our own Regeneron genetics efforts and so forth, it suggests that these two approaches will allow us to separate and optimize optimum efficacy and optimum safety. So it's quite possible that we might actually move forward with both of these antibodies for different target populations in some of which where efficacy is the primary driver and others where safety might be most important. So they're very unique in their mechanisms of action. They really are exploring this target both much more precisely by splitting the mechanism of action, but also more powerfully than competitors that have antibodies that can do one or the other of these things. So we're very excited about these programs. As we said, we have some proof-of-concept studies ongoing and we hope by the end of the year to be able to announce the directions we may be taking either or both of these antibodies going forward in the future. Yes. Well, once again, what we focused on is creating individual reagents that allow us to best dissect the pathway and separate out which are the most important players. As you're aware, other people, for example, are using an antibody that blocks all the pathways, not only the two that we've targeted, but about 20 others that are irrelevant for muscle and we know are known to have a variety of other potential side effects and adverse effects. So we targeted the two muscle specific pathways in this whole mechanism. And what we want to see is which one might have the best efficacy to safety profile that we believe is very important. Once we determine that, we may move forward with either one or both of these antibodies in combination with the weight loss agents or we also have been developing in our pipeline, a variety of unimolecular solutions that will allow a single molecule to do whichever one of these multiple pathways we want to attack in addition to the weight loss pathway. So what we're hoping to do is by dissecting the pathway as precisely and scientifically as possible, allow us to choose between the unimolecular solutions that we can have to follow on. That said, remember, it's not just a matter of amplifying the weight loss because with more weight loss, regardless of pathway you use, you can throw on the GLP-1 agonist, you can throw on GPR antagonist, you can lay on additional pathways. The more rate loss and the more rapidly occurs, which is what patients want, out of necessity because you're mimicking the starvation to get the pathway, it inevitably leads to muscle loss because of why, because of activation of these very pathways that we're looking at. So any approach right now that focuses on rapidly causing weight loss will of necessity because it plugs into evolutionarily conserved pathways of necessity will result in profound lean body and muscle loss, which can be a huge detriment to these patients especially the older obese patient. And by invoking these agents blocking these specific pathways, we may be able to do two things. We may block this associated necessarily evolutionary conserved muscle loss that accompanies rapid and profound weight loss while also perhaps increasing the amount of fat loss, which is what you specifically want to lose. This is what we've now shown in preclinical studies, including through nonhuman primates and these studies that we're embarking on right now should tell us whether all of these pathways, which are incredibly evolutionarily conserved will indeed pertain in humans and whether we really can optimize not only the weight loss, that's not what's important, but optimize particularly fat loss while maintaining the muscle. And we believe we're the only ones who are properly precisely interrogating the pathways and we'll be able to dissect them to decide on which exactly is the best, safest pathway to give the best benefit to the patient. I think that it's all going to be a matter of the benefit to risk profile once again. And this is what, as I've said in these other programs we're focusing on. We believe, based on all the data that we've shown, that we may have a very safe way of eliminating the actual cells that are causing all these allergic responses and then very safely keep them from coming back by giving one of the world's historically most safe biologics, which is DUPIXENT. Of course, we have to prove this in patients. And so we are starting in the most severe food allergy patients. And in these patients where they have, for example, very high unmet need, very high risks and so forth, it warrants undertaking this approach. The more effective it is, but more importantly, the safer we can prove it is then the broader the population can go. And in fact, if ultimately, we really have a very safe way of eliminating all allergy inducing cells and then preventing their rebound. And remember, particularly, most of these patients are also suffering from other allergic diseases, some of them may already be indicated for DUPIXENT. So you're giving them a drug which may actually be helping them anyway and has been shown to be quite safe in terms of as almost any biologic goes. We may be able to go into milder and milder allergy patients. So we can start and we are starting with the most severe patients we're seeing in these patients with a high unmet need, whether this approach is both effective, but also safe and how safe it is and the safer it is, we can broaden wider and wider. There's also ultimately no need to be limited to food allergies, you can actually eliminate essentially all allergies from the most serious to the most mundane, but it depends on the benefit risk and the safety, which is what we're testing in these initial studies. And for the initial studies, we're taking the most severe food-allergic patients who have a very high unmet need and very high risk profile depending on how it goes there, we can broaden to milder and milder types of disease. Well, as I said, we're in the stages of evaluating our Factor XI two classes of antibodies that are attacking this pathway in two different ways. We expect I think we've already talked about. One of them will be more effective at preventing clot formation, but potentially come with slightly more serious side effect profiles. The other might be less effective, but much safer. And as I said, we thought it was important to really precisely interrogate this pathway using these two antibodies that are attacking, two different parts. So this is one enzyme. It has an activation domain, a catalytic domain. And by blocking independently the two different domains, we expect to deliver two different profiles each one with the best-in-class antibody. Once we really understand those profiles, we will understand in which directions to be taken either one or both potentially in antibodies. We can easily imagine taking forward, the more effective one, but for a higher-risk patients, let's say, the less effective one into settings where you might want more safety and clot prevention is not as important. So all of this is going to depend on these profiles. And as I said, we hope to get our key data by the end of this year, and that should better define the efficacy and safety profile how they compare to the various existing agents that are out there now and which direction to take them for which indication. So two antibodies, two distinct profiles we hope to better understand them based on our initial proof-of-concept study. And from there, we'll understand where to take them and what the ultimate opportunity will be. But obviously there's still enormous need here for agents that can block, clot and thrombus formation. And so much depends on safety profiles here, and we're very excited about having the opportunity to have these two very related but distinct profiles. And there are many settings where you don't use certain agents because of the safety profile, which could create whole new opportunities as well."

Once our call concludes, Chris and the IR team will be available to answer any further questions.\n With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Leonard Schleifer. Len? \nLeonard Schleifer: Thanks, Ryan. Thanks to everyone joining today's call. Regeneron is off to a strong start in 2024, reflected in our solid first quarter financial results as well as the progress we have made across our pipeline in the first 4 months of the year. For my remarks today, I'd like to briefly review some of our key performance drivers and then discuss a few of our more differentiated development programs, which have the potential to drive sustainable long-term growth for the company and value for our shareholders. After my remarks, George will provide an update on our pipeline. Marion will then review our commercial performance, and Chris will discuss our financial results. First quarter 2024 revenues grew 7% after excluding last year's revenue contribution from our COVID antibodies. Growth was primarily driven by Sanofi collaboration revenues and Libtayo global net product sales, which grew by 14% and 45%, respectively.  \n Dupixent global net product sales were $3.1 billion, up 24% reflecting strong growth across all approved indications. EYLEA HD generated $200 million in its second full quarter on the U.S. market outperforming recent launches in the anti-VEGF category. Now with the permanent J-Code in place, improving payer coverage, broad prescriber familiarity and satisfaction with the EYLEA HD clinical profile and direct-to-consumer TV promotion underway. We continue to position EYLEA HD as the new standard of care for retinal diseases. \n Shifting to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD where Regeneron and Sanofi have 2 differentiated opportunities to transform the treatment paradigm for patients living with this debilitating disease. As announced in February, our sBLA for Dupixent for the treatment of COPD with type 2 inflammation was accepted by the FDA for priority review with a June 27 PDUFA date.  \n During its review of our submission, the FDA has requested additional efficacy analyses, including an information request received earlier this week regarding subpopulations from the BOREAS and NOTUS pivotal studies. Our analyses across these requested patient subgroups indicate a consistent and clinically meaningful reduction in COPD exacerbations. While the FDA has requested these analyses to be submitted by the end of May, we anticipate providing them substantially sooner. We and Sanofi are confident that these additional analyses strongly support the approval of Dupixent and eosinophilic COPD. If the FDA determines that they need additional time to review these analyses, a decision on the sBLA could be delayed for up to 3 months.\n We and our partner, Sanofi, are preparing for launch that many pulmonologists, respiratory key opinion leaders and their patients are eagerly anticipating. If approved Dupixent will be the only biologic therapy for COPD and the first new treatment approach for this disease in more than a decade. There is a high unmet need in COPD with type 2 inflammation with approximately 300,000 eligible patients in the United States and another approximately 300,000 eligible patients in the EU and Japan, where we are also seeking regulatory approvals. Turning to itepekimab our IL-33 antibody, which is being evaluated in former smokers with COPD regardless of eosinophil phenotype. We remain on track to report results and enable potential global regulatory filings in the second half of next year.  \n Itepekimab can potentially address up to 1 million patients in the G7 countries, while China also represents a significant opportunity. We are very excited about potentially bringing these important new therapies with COPD patients while expanding our commercial respiratory franchise. In a moment, George will describe another key opportunity in our pipeline involving Dupixent in combination with our BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody linvoseltamab which we believe has the potential to address any severe allergy and allow the millions of severe allergy sufferers to stop living in fear of an accidental exposure. Moving from linvoseltamab in severe allergy to its differentiated opportunity in multiple myeloma where it is currently under FDA and EMA review in the relapsed refractory setting. In our registration-enabling data set, while cross trial comparisons caveat supply, we believe linvoseltamab represents a best-in-class opportunity because it has the highest objective response rates and complete response rates at similar follow-ups observed across the [ BCMA ] bispecific class to date requires the least number of days in the hospital compared to other drugs in the category and is the only BCMA by CD3 agent currently under review or are already approved by the FDA that evaluated every 4-week dosing.\n If approved, we believe these are all important considerations for patients, caregivers, providers and payers that could drive linvoseltamab adoption. In closing, I'm excited and energized by the differentiated opportunities in our pipeline, which now has over 35 programs in clinical development spanning many distinct therapeutic areas. Our commercial team continues to execute well and is building momentum in competitive categories, and we continue to deploy capital with the goal of driving shareholder returns over time. With that, I'll turn the call over to George. \nGeorge Yancopoulos: Thanks, Len. Since Len covered the status of the Dupixent and itepekimab programs in COPD in great detail, I'd like to start with a bit more about our innovative treatment approach for severe allergies, a first-ever combination of an immunomodulatory antibody that is DUPIXENT with a bispecific antibody. Despite the remarkable benefit demonstrated by DUPIXENT across multiple diseases characterized by allergic or type 2 inflammation, DUPIXENT alone does not immediately reverse severe allergies by itself. These allergies are caused by high levels of an immunoglobulin class known as IgE made by long-lived plasma cells. This has caused some to refer the E in IgE as E for evil. Although DUPIXENT will prevent formation of new IgE plasma cells, it does not eliminate those that have already formed.  \n Regeneron scientists have shown that these allergy causing IgE plasma cells can be rapidly eliminated with a short course of treatment with our bispecific antibody known as linvoseltamab. While Dupixent treatment will then prevent these cells from returning as recently highlighted in our publication and Science Translational Medicine. We have commenced our proof-of-concept clinical trial to explore the potential for this combination approach to eliminate severe food allergy. We are hoping to see initial observations from this small study later this year, which will inform next steps.\n Moving on to oncology and libtayo combinations. Early clinical results of our LAG-3 antibody fianlimab in combination with libtayo suggest that these antibodies represent one of the most promising checkpoint inhibitor combinations in clinical development. Recall, fianlimab libtayo demonstrated potential for best-in-class efficacy in first-line metastatic melanoma with objective response rates of approximately 60% across 3 independent cohorts from our first-in-human study with a safety profile that is similar to that seen with anti-PD-1 monotherapy with longer-term follow-up, these initial responses continue to deepen, including patients converting into complete responses. We look forward to presenting updated results from these expansion cohorts in the second half of this year.\n Encouraged by these initial results, last year, we initiated a Phase II/III study of the combination of fianlimab and libtayo in first-line metastatic melanoma. This study is enrolling faster than expected and will now be conducted solely as a Phase III study with the final analysis to be reported during 2025. These pivotal melanoma data will inform whether fianlimab and libtayo have the potential to emerge as a new standard of care in melanoma. \n Next, to our bispecifics for hematology oncology. Regarding odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific, as announced in March, we received complete response letters from the FDA for our BLA for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma and relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The only approvability issue was related to the limited enrollment of these confirmatory trials, which we intend to address as we continue to enroll patients in these studies. The EU decision on odronextamab application is expected in the second half of this year.\n Moving on to linvoseltamab. As Len noted, this bispecific continues to demonstrate a potentially best-in-class profile in late-line myeloma in terms of efficacy, safety, dosing and hospitalization burden. In an oral presentation at the recent AACR medical meeting, we presented results of an 11-month median follow-up of 117 patients. A 71% objective response rate with 46% of patients achieving a complete response or better. We are planning to present updated 14-month follow-up results at the upcoming EHA meeting in which we anticipate observing a further deepening of responses. Regarding the ongoing FDA review, we believe the confirmatory study will be sufficiently enrolled to support approval. We're also evaluating linvoseltamab in earlier stages of myeloma and in precursor conditions such as smoldering myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance or MGUS.\n Next, to bispecifics for solid tumors. Our cost inventory bispecific antibodies are being tested in numerous studies, including as monotherapies as well as in combination with CD3 bispecifics and with libtayo. Our EGFR by CD28 bispecific in combination with libtayo, we are planning to present updated dose escalation results in an oral presentation at ASCO, most notably, in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, a tumor historically unresponsive to immunotherapy. EGFR by CD28 in combination with libtayo demonstrated antitumor activity. \n Regarding safety, to date, we have not observed severe immune-related adverse events with this agent at our recommended Phase II dose. Based on these data, we are enrolling dose expansion cohorts testing our EGFRxCD28 costim bispecific plus libtayo in various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer with or without EGF receptor mutations. Microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and others. \n On to our PSMA by CD28 costimulatory bispecific, which is already demonstrating promising activity in prostate cancer in combination with libtayo. We will soon initiate combination treatment of our PSMA by CD28 costim bispecific with our PSMA by CD3 bispecific, which based on preclinical studies, may maintain efficacy but with better tolerability. \n We're also evaluating our MUC16xCD28 costimulatory bispecific with ubamatamab, or MUC16xCD3 bispecific as well as with libtayo, or CD3xCD28 (sic) [ BCMAxCD3 ] costim with linvoseltamab for myeloma and our CD22xCD28 costim with odronextamab for lymphoma. Moving on to our classical hematology pipeline. Our C5 approach involves a first-in-class combination of an sRNA with an antibody for a more complete target blockade in our initial clinical data supports potential best-in-class efficacy in paroxysmal and external hemoglobinuria or PNH. \n Results from the preliminary cohort of the PNH Phase III study will be presented at the EHA conference in June with additional results expected later this year. In addition to PNH and myasthenia gravis, which are already enrolling their respective pivotal trials, we are planning on extending the systemic combination approach to geographic atrophy in dry AMD with the first pivotal study in GA expected to get underway this year. \n We are also anticipating proof-of-concept data later this year for our 2 complementary Factor XI antibodies in the setting of prevention of venous thromboembolism after knee replacement surgery. Depending on these data, 1 or both of these antibodies could remain on a rapid path to registrational studies, which could begin by late 2024 or early 2025. We -- our first-in-class antibody TMPRSS6, a genetically validated target for iron overload diseases such as beta thalassemia, is also making progress. This antibody has potential to meaningfully reduce toxic organ iron in patients whom iron chelation is inadequate or intolerable. \n Updated proof of mechanism data in healthy volunteers will be presented at the upcoming EHA conference. These results demonstrated deep sustained reductions in serum iron and robust induction of the liver hormone hepcidin, supporting the potential to release iron from organs. We are on track to start a Phase II proof-of-concept study in beta-thalassemia patients in the second half of the year. \n Moving to obesity. Our most advanced approach is designed to address potential negative consequences of widespread use of GLP GIP receptor agonist. As it has been widely reported, the profound weight loss caused by these agents, unfortunately, can also result in substantial loss of muscle, which is particularly concerning in older, obese patients. Our antibodies to myostatin-related pathways may prevent this muscle loss. Indeed, our data in obese nonhuman primates show that combining semaglutide with trevogrumab, or an antibiotic targeting myostatin with or without [ pertuzumab ], our antibody targeting active NA, or myostatin 2, demonstrated a comparable reduction in body weight at week 20 relative to semaglutide monotherapy, but with improved quality of weight loss resulting in more fat loss while preserving or even increasing lean mass. \n Part A of our proof-of-concept study in healthy volunteers intended to demonstrate safety of a higher dose of trevogrumab, has completed enrollment note that over 400 subjects, including healthy volunteers in sarcopenic patients have been dosed with trevogrumab throughout its clinical development with no meaningful safety or tolerability concerns observed to date. Part B of the study, which will evaluate muscle preservation antibodies in combination with semaglutide in obese participants remains on track to start enrolling mid-year assuming a reasonable pace of enrollment, we expect to report top line results, including changes in body weight, fat mass and muscle mass in second half of 2025. I will conclude with our genetic medicines effort. \n At the upcoming ASGCT conference, we will present updated data from our DB-OTO gene therapy program for genetic hearing loss. The first patient treated with this therapy, a 10-month old girl who is profoundly deaf at baseline. Now at 24 weeks after treatment had hearing in the normal range and the second treated patient is following a similar trajectory of improvement through earlier stages of follow-up. We are aiming to enroll several more patients this year, potentially enabling regulatory submissions by the end of next year, and we also look forward to bringing additional auditory gene therapy programs to the clinic in the coming years with the potential to address more common forms of monogenic hearing loss. \n Our collaboration with Intellia on CRISPR gene editing continues to advance. We have begun to enroll patients in the Phase III magnitude study of Intellia 2001 for a lead indication of TTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. The first in vivo CRISPR program clear to enter Phase III studies in the United States. We're also on track to be the first to use CRISPR technology to insert a corrective gene in vivo for a deficiency disease. We have now achieved clearance from both the U.S. and EU authorities for our insertion program for Factor IX, and we have already enrolled initial patients into the leading portion of this program. \n Moving on to our sRNA collaboration with Alnylam, which has not only demonstrated successful silencing of genes in the liver, but also for the first time for siRNA in the brain. Additionally, we're excited about potentially initiating later this year a potentially pivotal study for our ALN SOD treatment in ALS patients with SOD1 mutations.\n With that overview, I will turn the call over to Mary. \nMarion McCourt: Thanks, George. Our results in the first quarter demonstrate the strong performance of our commercial portfolio and future growth opportunity. We continue to strengthen and expand our leadership positions across our in-line brands, and we are preparing for potential upcoming launches. I'll start with our anti-VEGF franchise and the ongoing launch progress of EYLEA HD. \n First quarter U.S. net sales grew 63% sequentially to $200 million as real-world experience with efficacy and safety continues to grow EYLEA HD is delivering on its promise of extending the duration between treatments, but the majority of patients achieving this goal. Retina specialists are highly satisfied with EYLEA HD as demonstrated by prescribing across a broad range of patients. To date, most EYLEA HD patients are being switched from existing medicines most notably, EYLEA and faricimab, and we are also seeing an increase in treatment-naive patients.  \n For the quarter, EYLEA HD and EYLEA together secured 45% of the anti-VEGF category share combined U.S. net sales were $1.4 billion, which includes a reduction in wholesaler inventory of approximately $40 million. This reflects the sequential drawdown of EYLEA inventory that was partially offset by a modest increase in EYLEA HD inventory ahead of the permanent J-code on April 1. Since launch, our team has made significant progress to enhance reimbursement and market access for EYLEA HD. The permanent J-Code has increased prescribers reimbursement confidence, reflected by increased use among existing customers as well as a step-up in new customers ordering for the first time. We're very encouraged by EYLEA HD uptake despite a different payer market today compared to when EYLEA was launched more than a decade ago.\n For example, while more than 80% of medical benefit lives are now covered for EYLEA HD increases in utilization management or step edits are impacting all branded products. We are also highly focused on educating patients about the potential for EYLEA HD to deliver best in category vision and safety benefits with fewer injections. In mid-March, we began our direct-to-consumer TV campaign designed to raise brand awareness among treatment experienced and treatment-naive patients. Since initiating the DTC campaign, retina specialists have reported a significant increase in patients actively asking about and being prescribed EYLEA HD. In summary, the EYLEA HD launch outperformed expectations, and we are on track to establish EYLEA HD as the new standard of care for retinal disease.  \n Turning now to Dupixent. From our first quarter global net sales grew 25% on a constant currency basis to $3.1 billion. In the U.S., net sales grew 17% to $2.2 billion, driven by continued robust demand and the impact of customary first quarter seasonality dynamics, including annual resets of insurance plans. Dupixent is the clear leader in new-to-brand prescription share across all 5 FDA-approved indications and leads in total biologic prescriptions in 4 of its approved indications. \n More than 850,000 patients are currently on therapy worldwide and 3 Dupixent indications have achieved blockbuster status, atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyps. Across all 3 of these indications, Dupixent is competitively differentiated based on its clinical profile, depth of clinical experience and potential to be prescribed to very young patients as young as 6 months in the case of atopic dermatitis. \n We continue to see great progress with our recent launches in EoE, Dupixent's GI indication [indiscernible] and dermatology. Patient initiations across both indications continue to reach all-time highs and in late January, Dupixent was approved in pediatric EOE, the brand's fourth pediatric indication. Early launch indicators are positive as Dupixent is transforming the standard of care for these children aged 1 to 11 as it has for adults and adolescents with EoE. In addition to its approved indications, there's great potential for Dupixent in an increasing list of additional type 2 diseases, including COPD. If approved, Dupixent will achieve 2 important first, the first biologic medicine for COPD and also the first new treatment in more than a decade for this devastating disease.  \n In the U.S., approximately 300,000 patients with uncontrolled COPD show evidence of type 2 inflammation. If approved, we will rapidly --  we work to rapidly establish the unique clinical benefits of Dupixent, activate physician adoption, motivate patients to seek treatment and also advance access and affordability. We are confident that COPD will drive meaningful growth for Dupixent, if approved in this indication and see an additional opportunity to address patient unmet need with itepekimab our investigational IL-33 antibody designed to help COPD patients who are former smokers. With significant runway for growth in existing and potential new indications, we are confident in Dupixent's ongoing growth trajectory. \n And finally, to libtayo. In the first quarter, global net sales were $264 million, up 44% on a constant currency basis from the prior year, driven by our dual focus in skin and lung cancers. In non-melanoma skin cancer, libtayo continues to lead the immunotherapy category in CSCC and BCC with opportunity for continued market growth. In lung cancer, we are making steady progress in capturing category share in both monotherapy and chemotherapy combination patients. Our oncology team is also preparing for the upcoming August 22 linvoseltamab, PDUFA date recently to reinforces that linvoseltamab has the potential to be best-in-class for late-stage myeloma patients, and we look forward to its potential launch.  \n In summary, our commercial team continues to bring important medicines to patients across an expanding range of diseases. We are focused on differentiating our medicines to increase category share and drive market growth, potential upcoming launches across our portfolio, provide the opportunity to extend the benefits of our medicines to even more patients. And with that, I'll pass the call to Chris. \nChristopher Fenimore: My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron delivered solid financial results in the first quarter of 2024. Excluding contributions from our COVID antibodies, total revenues increased 7% year-over-year to $3.1 billion, primarily driven by continued sales growth and margin expansion from Dupixent and strong global sales growth from libtayo. First quarter diluted net income per share was $9.55 due to higher Dupixent volumes, we expect the amount of these reimbursements to be comparable to 2023. \n The Sanofi development balance was approximately $2.2 billion at the end of  the first quarter. We anticipate this balance will be fully reimbursed by  the end  of 2026, which we expect will result in a significant step-up in our Sanofi collaboration  profits thereafter. \n Before moving to expenses, I will mention that despite lower volumes, U.S. Praluent sales  in the first quarter reflected a gross to net adjustment related to a true-up of rebates due to  an adverse change in payer coverage. We now expect U.S. net sales of Praluent to be modestly higher in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to this adjustment. Now to our operating expenses. First quarter R&D expense grew 17% year-over-year to $1.1 billion, reflecting continued investment in our robust pipeline. SG&A grew 13% from the prior year to $544 million in the first quarter, driven by investment to support the launch of EYLEA HD, including direct-to-consumer promotion as well as higher headcount and related costs, primarily for our ongoing international commercial expansion. First quarter gross margin on net product sales was approximately 89%, which was impacted by ongoing start-up costs for our fill/finish manufacturing facility. \n First quarter COCM was $193 million, reflecting a decline of 22% compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower Dupixent drug substance manufacturing costs. Now to cash flow and the balance sheet. Regeneron generated $1.4 billion in free cash flow in the first quarter and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $14.8 billion. We repurchased approximately $300 million of our shares in the first quarter and had approximately $1.2 billion available for repurchases under our February 2023 authorization at the end of the first quarter. This morning, we also announced a new $3 billion share repurchase program, which provides us with additional flexibility to continue returning capital to shareholders over time, and we remain buyers of our shares. \n Finally, we have made some minor changes to our full year 2024 financial guidance. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. We now expect 2024 R&D expense to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion. The change in R&D guidance is solely due to the inclusion of operating expenses associated with the acquisition of 2seventy bio development programs, which closed on April 1. In summary, Regeneron performed well in the first quarter and is positioned to continue to deliver strong results in 2024 and beyond. With that, I'll pass the call back to Ryan. \nRyan Crowe: Thank you, Chris. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for Q&A to ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. Josh, can we please go to the first question? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Colin Bristow with UBS. \nColin Bristow: Congrats on the quarter. A question for George. George, there's a lot of interest, obviously, in your muscle sparing obesity program. I was wondering if you could speak to how you think this will differentiate versus competitor muscle-sparing programs and then within that, what will you be specifically paying attention to whenever Len decides to disclose the bimagrumab Phase II data? \nGeorge Yancopoulos: Thanks. Great question. As when you block with other approaches like bimagrumab, you're blocking over a dozen members of the so-called BMP, GDF family and so forth. And that raises the concern because only a couple of those are actually involved in muscle preservation that you may end up doing more harm than good. What we have identified over the years is we identified 2 members of this very large family of almost 20 factors, which 2 are specifically involved in muscle preservation and we created antibodies to each of these 2 individually. \n And we're testing these antibodies individually as well as together. And obviously, in this field of obesity, safety matters almost as much as efficacy here. So we believe we have the best program that is testing specifically just the specific members of this very large family that are involved in muscle preservation where they're blocking either one or both together is going to benefit the quality of the weight loss in terms of preserving muscle and maybe even causing more fat loss while creating hopefully the best possible safety profile.\n So we think that's a big difference between our program and other programs that are blocking as I said, almost 20 different members that are involved in all sorts of things from growth factors for the bone marrow for red blood cells, controlling all sorts of things from clotting to liver function and other things and so anyway, that's the major difference in our program. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. \nEvan Seigerman: Kind of a follow-up to Colin. When you think about endpoints in muscle sparing kind of approaches in obesity, what do you think FDA would accept. Right now, they're not really accepting dexa scans, they're just looking at weight loss. Do you think that they would evolve to look at quality of weight loss as a key endpoint asset space evolves? \nGeorge Yancopoulos: Well, just to remind you, if you look at our paper where we did the nonhuman primate studies and so forth, is the first thing we're going to be looking for is there is the very real possibility of increased weight loss. And that might be the simplest regulatory endpoint of all. After that, if we don't see that, but we see better quality of weight loss, that could be manifested in a variety of ways, though we, of course, recognize that those would perhaps create more complicated ways of being regulated. So obviously, if you increase the fat loss while preserving muscle you should have dramatic benefits in metabolic parameters, which are often used in the field, particularly in people with diabetes and so forth as well as ultimately in terms of function by having maintenance of function as opposed to losing function and maintaining those sort of functional endpoints. \n So the simplest path might be simply weight loss one could then move into metabolic parameters or muscle actual functional outcome measures. But to us, the most important thing in the Phase II study is to really just demonstrate the quality of the weight loss in terms of fat versus muscle because ultimately, if you're preserving muscle and increasing the fat loss, it has to be much better for patients, and it may avoid a lot of catastrophic long-term effects of widespread GLP-1 use and so if we see that, we think that we have a real opportunity to turn that into real widespread benefit for patients using this class of drugs. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Christopher Raymond with Piper Sandler. \nChristopher Raymond: I have a question on the EYLEA franchise. I just noticed that McKesson bought one of the largest GPOs, U.S. retina earlier this year and there's actually been -- as you guys know, a relatively long march of retina practices being rolled up by various private equity firms over the last few years. So I know this is something that's happening across a number of therapeutic specialty areas, but maybe just talk about how you see this phenomenon impacting the practice of ophthalmology in the U.S. and any changes to your go-to-market strategy? And I guess related, the inventory drawdown, we didn't see that happen last year. Was there any effect from maybe some of these changes in your customer base that sort of drove that? \nMarion McCourt: Sure. So let me take the inventory item first, and then I'll come back to the overall marketplace. But this was in aggregate. As I mentioned, in the quarter, we saw a reduction in wholesaler inventory broadly of about $40 million. So that reflects market-wide. But that was a combination of 2 elements. It was a sequential drawdown of EYLEA inventory that was partially offset by a modest increase in EYLEA HD inventory ahead of the permanent J-Code on April 1. And then I would share on the overall market in all the categories where we participate, we're always very conscious of the segmentation of the market, targeting the market, what's occurring in terms of customer base and certainly, our strategies and our approach to the marketplace is reflective of that. And the range of customers we have, as you point out, in retina and how that market has evolved over time. And I think our commercialization approach has been very effective in addressing that market evolution. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. \nSalveen Richter: With regard to the COPD program here, it doesn't seem like this is an approvability question. So could you just speak to whether restrictions to specific subpopulations could be possible, albeit noting that you had a subpopulation analysis that was consistent with the broader data. \nLeonard Schleifer: Yes, Salveen, thanks for the question. You're right. From our perspective, we think the data broadly supports the entire BLA and as well as all these analyses, the approval of the drug in eosinophilic COPD. As you might imagine, the FDA went anticipating or looking at a new class of biologics is very interested in checking it up and down and down and up and making sure that there's no subpopulation of the study that might be driving the data. So they might -- if one saw that, one might think about labeling it differently, but none of that has occurred. We've looked at all these analyses. We're going to submit them a way ahead of the schedule that they've asked for, and all of the analyses show a consistent and clinically meaningful reduction in the COPD exacerbations across all of these subgroups that have been asked for. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Tyler Van Buren with TD Cowen. \nTyler Van Buren: For this initial severe food allergy study and the results by year-end, could you elaborate on exactly what will be reported and what you would hope to see to have early clinical proof of concept and how long do you anticipate that these patients would stay on Dupixent in order to maintain low or no IgE levels? \nGeorge Yancopoulos: These are great questions. We hope from the first few patients if the results are as dramatic as they are in the preclinical studies that we'll be seeing meaningful indicators that we are really reversing severe food allergy. Of course, the first thing and the most important biomarker, as I said, is this evil immunoglobulin IgE, which you can both measure, but they are also routinely tested using these skin prick tests, which are how people are actually evaluated for allergies. \n So we expect, first of all, to be seeing that happening in the study in obvious ways. And then we can follow that up, and it is allowed in the study if we see dramatic responses in these markers of the actual allergy-causing immunoglobulin to then go on and do actual food challenges and so forth in the patients. So it all depends on how obvious the reductions in this [ IgE are ] and if they are really dramatic, we can go on and do additional allergen-challenged tests. But we hope if the humans behave like the nonhuman primate that we might be seeing something dramatic in the initial patients. \nRyan Crowe: George, can you comment? I think they also want to know how long you have to stay on IgG... \nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes. The interesting thing is the animal study suggests that the antibodies against the allergens come back as  IgG, G for good antibodies. The whole point of -- if you guys are familiar with so-called immunotherapy or desensitization therapy, all of those therapies, what they're trying to do is induce production of IgG to overwhelm the IgE. That's a much harder thing to do because they're not really getting rid of the Ig. They just have to overwhelm with a lot more IgG. In the animal studies, it suggests that we get rid of the Ig and we replace it with IgG. We don't know, obviously, in the humans, it may be possible that short-term treatment, relatively short-term treatment, may allow patients who have replaced their IgE with IgG, and they will have long-term protection. \n On the other hand, we may see that to prevent these patients from making Ig and more IgGs in the future that they may have to stay on the Dupixent for substantial long periods of time. The good news about that as we all know and as was highlighted in Marion's comments, Dupixent compared to most other immunomodulatory agents, it's not immunosuppressive. It actually is corrective for the immune system. And as indicated by its labeling to very, very young patients, it's a very, very relatively safe immunomodulator and biologic. And since most people who have severe allergies also have a lot of other concomitant atopic diseases. \n It may be that it is best for these patients to keep their abnormal atopy or abnormal type 2 inflammation under control. So short answer is it's -- there's a possibility it could be relatively short term, but there's also a possibility at least for some or the majority of patients, it could be relatively long term. But the good news is that they may actually have a long-term benefit for the patients because these patients are almost by definition, what you call atopic patients who might need control of their type 2 excess inflammation. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. \nTerence Flynn: Just had one on your LAG-3 program. Obviously, you guys are aware that Bristol discussed seeing a signal in a subset of lung cancer that benefits from a combination of PD-1 and LAG-3. So I would just love your latest thoughts on how to think about that in the context of both your program and then what you're hoping to see with this Phase II data later this year? \nGeorge Yancopoulos: Right. That's a great question. Obviously, the thing that gets us excited about our program compare to the field is that we've seen levels of activity that haven't been seen in the other LAG-3 programs, particularly in melanoma. If that's true in melanoma, there would be hope that this would be seen broadly in other settings and indications. We are certainly excited to see the follow-up details on the BMS story with potential activity in a specific subpopulation that will certainly help point us in our own studies to see what we're seeing within that subpopulation that they are talking about as well as more broadly. But of course, the hope, as I said, is if it is indeed more active in one setting such as melanoma, the hope is it will be broadly more active across other cancer settings as well. So we are excited to see follow-up on their data. We're excited to see follow-up on our data, both in melanoma and in our lung studies. \nOperator: Next question comes from William Pickering with Bernstein. \nWilliam Pickering: I had a follow-up on the food allergy program. Could you comment on the dose of linvoseltamab that you'll be testing as compared to the myeloma setting? How -- what gives you confidence in the safety profile and if a patient misses a Dupixent dose, would they then need to start over again with linvo? \nGeorge Yancopoulos: Yes, these are all great questions. What we've already actually shown based on a variety of studies that we've done is that normal nonmalignant noncancerous plasma cells, the cells that are the immunoglobulin factory cells are the normal versions of the cells are much more susceptible to the bispecific than our malignant myeloma cells. So in discussions and communications with the FDA, we're actually starting at much lower doses than the doses that are used in the myeloma programs, though there is an intrapatient dose escalation process. So we're literally watching -- we're starting with low doses and we're going up in the doses until we actually hopefully see elimination of the IgE. That said, in terms of the safety, I'd just remind you that the much higher myeloma doses, we came up as Len briefly summarized in this program. \n We believe that we have a differentiated program in terms of not only efficacy and hospitalization burden and so forth, but also in safety. We have less than 1% Grade 3 events at those high doses in the much sicker myeloma patients. So we hope and we expect that with lower doses in a much healthier population, that this will be a hopefully pretty well tolerated approach. And a much shorter, yes. We think that ultimately, we make it by with a single short course or a very short course of treatment. In terms of whether if somebody takes a holiday, whether one has to then start all over again with the elimination of the IgE cells, we think probably not because it takes a long time to get to those levels of IgE. \n So just delaying for a short period of time, we may not bounce back to those levels. As I said, you may have converted all of those cells to IgG or good sales by that point anyway. But of course, we have to be doing the studies, and we have to be looking at these patients in the clinic to really understand. When I -- I should mention that the Grade 3 events that I was talking about are reflected by cytokine release syndrome. A lot of that is also thought to be -- due to the load of the cancer cells. And obviously, these normal patients have much less of a load here. So it's just another reason to expect, hopefully, better safety. We're going to be going with lower doses, more gentle treatment, and they have much less load in there, so you would expect much less reason to be seeing things like cytokine release syndrome. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. \nCarter L. Gould: I wanted to ask another follow-up sort of bispecifics in autoimmune, but I want to go down a little bit of a different path acknowledging the BCMA in Dupi effort. But we've seen sort of CAR-T efforts and ADC approaches sort of come to the rise in lupus and other autoimmune disorders and naturally, people have then started talking about T cell engagers. This seems like a natural place where Regeneron could leverage its bispecific capabilities, expertise. Are there efforts underway internally on this front? Has Regeneron looked at ways to leverage in that expertise? \nGeorge Yancopoulos: That's a phenomenal question. And first of all, let me remind you that with our long-term collaboration and recent acquisition of 2seventy. 2seventy had exactly the sort of CAR-T programs that you're referring to in lupus and other autoimmune settings, which we are now obviously pursuing together with them but that is one of the reasons why we were excited about turning the collaboration into a situation where we brought all the expertise and the scientists and leadership from 2seventy in-house because we're doing exactly what you suggested. We're hoping to actually literally look in side-by-side studies, how CAR-T approaches in these settings of autoimmune, severe autoimmune disease like lupus and so forth, compare directly head-to-head to our bispecifics. And as you are sort of suggesting, you would think that there would be really little reason to think that the CAR-T solutions would be preferable in this setting, both in terms of off-the-shelf mess and the ability to eliminate the normal cells.\n As I said, it's usually a lot easier to get rid of normal cells than it is malignant cells. So whatever advantages you might have in certain settings of CAR-Ts you would think in the normal disease setting or at least normal cells in autoimmune disease settings that bispecifics might be just as good, much more convenient and much safer. So together with now our internal Regeneron cell medicines group that has involved a lot of the expertise and leadership of 2seventy, we're exploring that exact question. \n I should also say that as clearly been announced by the company and is available in our public disclosures, we have already initiated separately a variety of studies looking at our bispecifics to decrease autoantibodies and autoimmune diseases in other settings as well. So we were already looking at this, but now we're looking at these in direct comparison to our CAR-T approaches with our now internal Regeneron cell medicines efforts. \nOperator: Next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. \nBrian Abrahams: Congrats on all the progress. I know docs are really excited for Dupi and COPD, but it is a new space for biologics. So I'm curious, the amount of education you think is going to be required and how this might affect the initial uptake trajectory. And then how you're thinking the introduction of other biologics, which have also been showing promise might impact the overall long-term market here in Dupi's positioning? \nMarion McCourt: So certainly, we look forward to the potential launch of Dupixent in COPD. There's such unmet need and such opportunity to help those patients with an eosinophilic COPD. Our team, as you know, is very experienced with launches in Dupixent. So work is very much underway at Regeneron and also with, obviously, under our collaboration with Sanofi to make sure that we apply the best practices and launch of new indications. \n I will share that many of these physicians have already experienced use of Dupixent with tremendous results. We've made great progress, as you know, in asthma leading in new scripts and certainly making tremendous overall performance strides. But we will be very thoughtful on how best to reach physicians, how to make sure that we're aligned with reimbursement and affordability for patients, educating in the way we've come to understand is best for Dupixent in the various markets and indications that we've entered. So we look forward to this opportunity. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. \nMohit Bansal: I have a question on itepekimab so in our conversation and literature search, it suggests that there may be a potential for disease modification with some kind of remodeling at this mechanism. Just wanted to see if you think that is possible? And what markets would you be looking forward to in the Phase III trial beyond exacerbation when the data come. \nGeorge Yancopoulos: Well, there's always the possibility of disease modification. We actually believe, for example, Dupixent in asthma may be doing exactly that sort of benefit. One of the best ways of actually looking at that is looking at overall loss of lung function over time because, as you know, in these lung diseases as Marion said, in both asthma and COPD, these are diseases of the lungs followed largely by pulmonologists, the same sort of doctors and it is well known that in both of these diseases over time, patients start permanently losing lung capacity and lung function. We are and have been and have early data suggesting that Dupixent may prefer that in asthma, and we'll certainly be looking at those sorts of things for not only Dupixent but itepekimab in the COPD patients in terms of modifying disease and long-term preservation and prevention of this otherwise unstoppable lung function loss. \nOperator: And our last question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. \nUnknown Analyst: This is Taylor on for Chris Schott. So we were wondering, would you elaborate a little bit more about how you're thinking about the linvoseltamab launch as we approach the August PDUFA and then thinking about the field more broadly in myeloma, how are you thinking about MRD negativity as a surrogate and thoughts on how you might be able to move into earlier lines in myeloma faster? \nLeonard Schleifer: Mary can take the question on the launch and everything. I mean, obviously, the MRD negativity as endorsed by that panel gives an opportunity to get these kinds of drugs to patients earlier in a variety of settings. So we are looking forward to applying that approach in our future studies as we move towards earlier in different lines of therapy. Marion on the launch? \nMarion McCourt: Sure. So we're certainly preparing for the potential launch with the August 22 PDUFA date. And we're really excited because as I've mentioned before, the recent data reinforces linvoseltamab as potentially a best-in-class product for late-stage myeloma patients. So it's a wonderful opportunity to extend our oncology franchise in the new disease area. \nRyan Crowe: All right. Thanks, Len and Marion, and thanks to everyone who dialed in for your interest in Regeneron. We apologize to those remaining in the queue that we did not have a chance to hear from. As always, the IR team here at Regeneron is available to answer any remaining questions that you may have. Thank you once again, and have a great day. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Marion McCourt",
            "content": "Thanks, George. Our results in the first quarter demonstrate the strong performance of our commercial portfolio and future growth opportunity. We continue to strengthen and expand our leadership positions across our in-line brands, and we are preparing for potential upcoming launches. I'll start with our anti-VEGF franchise and the ongoing launch progress of EYLEA HD. \n First quarter U.S. net sales grew 63% sequentially to $200 million as real-world experience with efficacy and safety continues to grow EYLEA HD is delivering on its promise of extending the duration between treatments, but the majority of patients achieving this goal. Retina specialists are highly satisfied with EYLEA HD as demonstrated by prescribing across a broad range of patients. To date, most EYLEA HD patients are being switched from existing medicines most notably, EYLEA and faricimab, and we are also seeing an increase in treatment-naive patients.  \n For the quarter, EYLEA HD and EYLEA together secured 45% of the anti-VEGF category share combined U.S. net sales were $1.4 billion, which includes a reduction in wholesaler inventory of approximately $40 million. This reflects the sequential drawdown of EYLEA inventory that was partially offset by a modest increase in EYLEA HD inventory ahead of the permanent J-code on April 1. Since launch, our team has made significant progress to enhance reimbursement and market access for EYLEA HD. The permanent J-Code has increased prescribers reimbursement confidence, reflected by increased use among existing customers as well as a step-up in new customers ordering for the first time. We're very encouraged by EYLEA HD uptake despite a different payer market today compared to when EYLEA was launched more than a decade ago.\n For example, while more than 80% of medical benefit lives are now covered for EYLEA HD increases in utilization management or step edits are impacting all branded products. We are also highly focused on educating patients about the potential for EYLEA HD to deliver best in category vision and safety benefits with fewer injections. In mid-March, we began our direct-to-consumer TV campaign designed to raise brand awareness among treatment experienced and treatment-naive patients. Since initiating the DTC campaign, retina specialists have reported a significant increase in patients actively asking about and being prescribed EYLEA HD. In summary, the EYLEA HD launch outperformed expectations, and we are on track to establish EYLEA HD as the new standard of care for retinal disease.  \n Turning now to Dupixent. From our first quarter global net sales grew 25% on a constant currency basis to $3.1 billion. In the U.S., net sales grew 17% to $2.2 billion, driven by continued robust demand and the impact of customary first quarter seasonality dynamics, including annual resets of insurance plans. Dupixent is the clear leader in new-to-brand prescription share across all 5 FDA-approved indications and leads in total biologic prescriptions in 4 of its approved indications. \n More than 850,000 patients are currently on therapy worldwide and 3 Dupixent indications have achieved blockbuster status, atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyps. Across all 3 of these indications, Dupixent is competitively differentiated based on its clinical profile, depth of clinical experience and potential to be prescribed to very young patients as young as 6 months in the case of atopic dermatitis. \n We continue to see great progress with our recent launches in EoE, Dupixent's GI indication [indiscernible] and dermatology. Patient initiations across both indications continue to reach all-time highs and in late January, Dupixent was approved in pediatric EOE, the brand's fourth pediatric indication. Early launch indicators are positive as Dupixent is transforming the standard of care for these children aged 1 to 11 as it has for adults and adolescents with EoE. In addition to its approved indications, there's great potential for Dupixent in an increasing list of additional type 2 diseases, including COPD. If approved, Dupixent will achieve 2 important first, the first biologic medicine for COPD and also the first new treatment in more than a decade for this devastating disease.  \n In the U.S., approximately 300,000 patients with uncontrolled COPD show evidence of type 2 inflammation. If approved, we will rapidly --  we work to rapidly establish the unique clinical benefits of Dupixent, activate physician adoption, motivate patients to seek treatment and also advance access and affordability. We are confident that COPD will drive meaningful growth for Dupixent, if approved in this indication and see an additional opportunity to address patient unmet need with itepekimab our investigational IL-33 antibody designed to help COPD patients who are former smokers. With significant runway for growth in existing and potential new indications, we are confident in Dupixent's ongoing growth trajectory. \n And finally, to libtayo. In the first quarter, global net sales were $264 million, up 44% on a constant currency basis from the prior year, driven by our dual focus in skin and lung cancers. In non-melanoma skin cancer, libtayo continues to lead the immunotherapy category in CSCC and BCC with opportunity for continued market growth. In lung cancer, we are making steady progress in capturing category share in both monotherapy and chemotherapy combination patients. Our oncology team is also preparing for the upcoming August 22 linvoseltamab, PDUFA date recently to reinforces that linvoseltamab has the potential to be best-in-class for late-stage myeloma patients, and we look forward to its potential launch.  \n In summary, our commercial team continues to bring important medicines to patients across an expanding range of diseases. We are focused on differentiating our medicines to increase category share and drive market growth, potential upcoming launches across our portfolio, provide the opportunity to extend the benefits of our medicines to even more patients. And with that, I'll pass the call to Chris. Sure. So let me take the inventory item first, and then I'll come back to the overall marketplace. But this was in aggregate. As I mentioned, in the quarter, we saw a reduction in wholesaler inventory broadly of about $40 million. So that reflects market-wide. But that was a combination of 2 elements. It was a sequential drawdown of EYLEA inventory that was partially offset by a modest increase in EYLEA HD inventory ahead of the permanent J-Code on April 1. And then I would share on the overall market in all the categories where we participate, we're always very conscious of the segmentation of the market, targeting the market, what's occurring in terms of customer base and certainly, our strategies and our approach to the marketplace is reflective of that. And the range of customers we have, as you point out, in retina and how that market has evolved over time. And I think our commercialization approach has been very effective in addressing that market evolution. So certainly, we look forward to the potential launch of Dupixent in COPD. There's such unmet need and such opportunity to help those patients with an eosinophilic COPD. Our team, as you know, is very experienced with launches in Dupixent.

            "name": "Leonard Schleifer",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan. Thanks to everyone joining today's call. Regeneron is off to a strong start in 2024, reflected in our solid first quarter financial results as well as the progress we have made across our pipeline in the first 4 months of the year. For my remarks today, I'd like to briefly review some of our key performance drivers and then discuss a few of our more differentiated development programs, which have the potential to drive sustainable long-term growth for the company and value for our shareholders. After my remarks, George will provide an update on our pipeline. Marion will then review our commercial performance, and Chris will discuss our financial results. First quarter 2024 revenues grew 7% after excluding last year's revenue contribution from our COVID antibodies. Growth was primarily driven by Sanofi collaboration revenues and Libtayo global net product sales, which grew by 14% and 45%, respectively.  \n Dupixent global net product sales were $3.1 billion, up 24% reflecting strong growth across all approved indications. EYLEA HD generated $200 million in its second full quarter on the U.S. market outperforming recent launches in the anti-VEGF category. Now with the permanent J-Code in place, improving payer coverage, broad prescriber familiarity and satisfaction with the EYLEA HD clinical profile and direct-to-consumer TV promotion underway. We continue to position EYLEA HD as the new standard of care for retinal diseases. \n Shifting to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD where Regeneron and Sanofi have 2 differentiated opportunities to transform the treatment paradigm for patients living with this debilitating disease. As announced in February, our sBLA for Dupixent for the treatment of COPD with type 2 inflammation was accepted by the FDA for priority review with a June 27 PDUFA date.  \n During its review of our submission, the FDA has requested additional efficacy analyses, including an information request received earlier this week regarding subpopulations from the BOREAS and NOTUS pivotal studies. Our analyses across these requested patient subgroups indicate a consistent and clinically meaningful reduction in COPD exacerbations. While the FDA has requested these analyses to be submitted by the end of May, we anticipate providing them substantially sooner. We and Sanofi are confident that these additional analyses strongly support the approval of Dupixent and eosinophilic COPD. If the FDA determines that they need additional time to review these analyses, a decision on the sBLA could be delayed for up to 3 months.\n We and our partner, Sanofi, are preparing for launch that many pulmonologists, respiratory key opinion leaders and their patients are eagerly anticipating. If approved Dupixent will be the only biologic therapy for COPD and the first new treatment approach for this disease in more than a decade. There is a high unmet need in COPD with type 2 inflammation with approximately 300,000 eligible patients in the United States and another approximately 300,000 eligible patients in the EU and Japan, where we are also seeking regulatory approvals. Turning to itepekimab our IL-33 antibody, which is being evaluated in former smokers with COPD regardless of eosinophil phenotype. We remain on track to report results and enable potential global regulatory filings in the second half of next year.  \n Itepekimab can potentially address up to 1 million patients in the G7 countries, while China also represents a significant opportunity. We are very excited about potentially bringing these important new therapies with COPD patients while expanding our commercial respiratory franchise. In a moment, George will describe another key opportunity in our pipeline involving Dupixent in combination with our BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody linvoseltamab which we believe has the potential to address any severe allergy and allow the millions of severe allergy sufferers to stop living in fear of an accidental exposure. Moving from linvoseltamab in severe allergy to its differentiated opportunity in multiple myeloma where it is currently under FDA and EMA review in the relapsed refractory setting. In our registration-enabling data set, while cross trial comparisons caveat supply, we believe linvoseltamab represents a best-in-class opportunity because it has the highest objective response rates and complete response rates at similar follow-ups observed across the [ BCMA ] bispecific class to date requires the least number of days in the hospital compared to other drugs in the category and is the only BCMA by CD3 agent currently under review or are already approved by the FDA that evaluated every 4-week dosing.\n If approved, we believe these are all important considerations for patients, caregivers, providers and payers that could drive linvoseltamab adoption. In closing, I'm excited and energized by the differentiated opportunities in our pipeline, which now has over 35 programs in clinical development spanning many distinct therapeutic areas. Our commercial team continues to execute well and is building momentum in competitive categories, and we continue to deploy capital with the goal of driving shareholder returns over time. With that, I'll turn the call over to George. Yes, Salveen, thanks for the question. You're right. From our perspective, we think the data broadly supports the entire BLA and as well as all these analyses, the approval of the drug in eosinophilic COPD. As you might imagine, the FDA went anticipating or looking at a new class of biologics is very interested in checking it up and down and down and up and making sure that there's no subpopulation of the study that might be driving the data. So they might -- if one saw that, one might think about labeling it differently, but none of that has occurred. We've looked at all these analyses. We're going to submit them a way ahead of the schedule that they've asked for, and all of the analyses show a consistent and clinically meaningful reduction in the COPD exacerbations across all of these subgroups that have been asked for. Mary can take the question on the launch and everything. I mean, obviously, the MRD negativity as endorsed by that panel gives an opportunity to get these kinds of drugs to patients earlier in a variety of settings. So we are looking forward to applying that approach in our future studies as we move towards earlier in different lines of therapy. Marion on the launch?"

            "content": "My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron delivered solid financial results in the first quarter of 2024. Excluding contributions from our COVID antibodies, total revenues increased 7% year-over-year to $3.1 billion, primarily driven by continued sales growth and margin expansion from Dupixent and strong global sales growth from libtayo. First quarter diluted net income per share was $9.55 due to higher Dupixent volumes, we expect the amount of these reimbursements to be comparable to 2023. \n The Sanofi development balance was approximately $2.2 billion at the end of  the first quarter. We anticipate this balance will be fully reimbursed by  the end  of 2026, which we expect will result in a significant step-up in our Sanofi collaboration  profits thereafter. \n Before moving to expenses, I will mention that despite lower volumes, U.S. Praluent sales  in the first quarter reflected a gross to net adjustment related to a true-up of rebates due to  an adverse change in payer coverage. We now expect U.S. net sales of Praluent to be modestly higher in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to this adjustment. Now to our operating expenses. First quarter R&D expense grew 17% year-over-year to $1.1 billion, reflecting continued investment in our robust pipeline. SG&A grew 13% from the prior year to $544 million in the first quarter, driven by investment to support the launch of EYLEA HD, including direct-to-consumer promotion as well as higher headcount and related costs, primarily for our ongoing international commercial expansion. First quarter gross margin on net product sales was approximately 89%, which was impacted by ongoing start-up costs for our fill/finish manufacturing facility. \n First quarter COCM was $193 million, reflecting a decline of 22% compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower Dupixent drug substance manufacturing costs. Now to cash flow and the balance sheet. Regeneron generated $1.4 billion in free cash flow in the first quarter and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $14.8 billion. We repurchased approximately $300 million of our shares in the first quarter and had approximately $1.2 billion available for repurchases under our February 2023 authorization at the end of the first quarter. This morning, we also announced a new $3 billion share repurchase program, which provides us with additional flexibility to continue returning capital to shareholders over time, and we remain buyers of our shares. \n Finally, we have made some minor changes to our full year 2024 financial guidance. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. We now expect 2024 R&D expense to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion. The change in R&D guidance is solely due to the inclusion of operating expenses associated with the acquisition of 2seventy bio development programs, which closed on April 1. In summary, Regeneron performed well in the first quarter and is positioned to continue to deliver strong results in 2024 and beyond. With that, I'll pass the call back to Ryan."

            "content": "Thanks, Len. Since Len covered the status of the Dupixent and itepekimab programs in COPD in great detail, I'd like to start with a bit more about our innovative treatment approach for severe allergies, a first-ever combination of an immunomodulatory antibody that is DUPIXENT with a bispecific antibody. Despite the remarkable benefit demonstrated by DUPIXENT across multiple diseases characterized by allergic or type 2 inflammation, DUPIXENT alone does not immediately reverse severe allergies by itself. These allergies are caused by high levels of an immunoglobulin class known as IgE made by long-lived plasma cells. This has caused some to refer the E in IgE as E for evil. Although DUPIXENT will prevent formation of new IgE plasma cells, it does not eliminate those that have already formed.  \n Regeneron scientists have shown that these allergy causing IgE plasma cells can be rapidly eliminated with a short course of treatment with our bispecific antibody known as linvoseltamab. While Dupixent treatment will then prevent these cells from returning as recently highlighted in our publication and Science Translational Medicine. We have commenced our proof-of-concept clinical trial to explore the potential for this combination approach to eliminate severe food allergy. We are hoping to see initial observations from this small study later this year, which will inform next steps.\n Moving on to oncology and libtayo combinations. Early clinical results of our LAG-3 antibody fianlimab in combination with libtayo suggest that these antibodies represent one of the most promising checkpoint inhibitor combinations in clinical development. Recall, fianlimab libtayo demonstrated potential for best-in-class efficacy in first-line metastatic melanoma with objective response rates of approximately 60% across 3 independent cohorts from our first-in-human study with a safety profile that is similar to that seen with anti-PD-1 monotherapy with longer-term follow-up, these initial responses continue to deepen, including patients converting into complete responses. We look forward to presenting updated results from these expansion cohorts in the second half of this year.\n Encouraged by these initial results, last year, we initiated a Phase II/III study of the combination of fianlimab and libtayo in first-line metastatic melanoma. This study is enrolling faster than expected and will now be conducted solely as a Phase III study with the final analysis to be reported during 2025. These pivotal melanoma data will inform whether fianlimab and libtayo have the potential to emerge as a new standard of care in melanoma. \n Next, to our bispecifics for hematology oncology. Regarding odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific, as announced in March, we received complete response letters from the FDA for our BLA for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma and relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The only approvability issue was related to the limited enrollment of these confirmatory trials, which we intend to address as we continue to enroll patients in these studies. The EU decision on odronextamab application is expected in the second half of this year.\n Moving on to linvoseltamab. As Len noted, this bispecific continues to demonstrate a potentially best-in-class profile in late-line myeloma in terms of efficacy, safety, dosing and hospitalization burden. In an oral presentation at the recent AACR medical meeting, we presented results of an 11-month median follow-up of 117 patients. A 71% objective response rate with 46% of patients achieving a complete response or better. We are planning to present updated 14-month follow-up results at the upcoming EHA meeting in which we anticipate observing a further deepening of responses. Regarding the ongoing FDA review, we believe the confirmatory study will be sufficiently enrolled to support approval. We're also evaluating linvoseltamab in earlier stages of myeloma and in precursor conditions such as smoldering myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance or MGUS.\n Next, to bispecifics for solid tumors. Our cost inventory bispecific antibodies are being tested in numerous studies, including as monotherapies as well as in combination with CD3 bispecifics and with libtayo. Our EGFR by CD28 bispecific in combination with libtayo, we are planning to present updated dose escalation results in an oral presentation at ASCO, most notably, in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, a tumor historically unresponsive to immunotherapy. EGFR by CD28 in combination with libtayo demonstrated antitumor activity. \n Regarding safety, to date, we have not observed severe immune-related adverse events with this agent at our recommended Phase II dose. Based on these data, we are enrolling dose expansion cohorts testing our EGFRxCD28 costim bispecific plus libtayo in various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer with or without EGF receptor mutations. Microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and others. \n On to our PSMA by CD28 costimulatory bispecific, which is already demonstrating promising activity in prostate cancer in combination with libtayo. We will soon initiate combination treatment of our PSMA by CD28 costim bispecific with our PSMA by CD3 bispecific, which based on preclinical studies, may maintain efficacy but with better tolerability. \n We're also evaluating our MUC16xCD28 costimulatory bispecific with ubamatamab, or MUC16xCD3 bispecific as well as with libtayo, or CD3xCD28 (sic) [ BCMAxCD3 ] costim with linvoseltamab for myeloma and our CD22xCD28 costim with odronextamab for lymphoma. Moving on to our classical hematology pipeline. Our C5 approach involves a first-in-class combination of an sRNA with an antibody for a more complete target blockade in our initial clinical data supports potential best-in-class efficacy in paroxysmal and external hemoglobinuria or PNH. \n Results from the preliminary cohort of the PNH Phase III study will be presented at the EHA conference in June with additional results expected later this year. In addition to PNH and myasthenia gravis, which are already enrolling their respective pivotal trials, we are planning on extending the systemic combination approach to geographic atrophy in dry AMD with the first pivotal study in GA expected to get underway this year. \n We are also anticipating proof-of-concept data later this year for our 2 complementary Factor XI antibodies in the setting of prevention of venous thromboembolism after knee replacement surgery. Depending on these data, 1 or both of these antibodies could remain on a rapid path to registrational studies, which could begin by late 2024 or early 2025. We -- our first-in-class antibody TMPRSS6, a genetically validated target for iron overload diseases such as beta thalassemia, is also making progress. This antibody has potential to meaningfully reduce toxic organ iron in patients whom iron chelation is inadequate or intolerable. \n Updated proof of mechanism data in healthy volunteers will be presented at the upcoming EHA conference. These results demonstrated deep sustained reductions in serum iron and robust induction of the liver hormone hepcidin, supporting the potential to release iron from organs. We are on track to start a Phase II proof-of-concept study in beta-thalassemia patients in the second half of the year. \n Moving to obesity. Our most advanced approach is designed to address potential negative consequences of widespread use of GLP GIP receptor agonist. As it has been widely reported, the profound weight loss caused by these agents, unfortunately, can also result in substantial loss of muscle, which is particularly concerning in older, obese patients. Our antibodies to myostatin-related pathways may prevent this muscle loss. Indeed, our data in obese nonhuman primates show that combining semaglutide with trevogrumab, or an antibiotic targeting myostatin with or without [ pertuzumab ], our antibody targeting active NA, or myostatin 2, demonstrated a comparable reduction in body weight at week 20 relative to semaglutide monotherapy, but with improved quality of weight loss resulting in more fat loss while preserving or even increasing lean mass. \n Part A of our proof-of-concept study in healthy volunteers intended to demonstrate safety of a higher dose of trevogrumab, has completed enrollment note that over 400 subjects, including healthy volunteers in sarcopenic patients have been dosed with trevogrumab throughout its clinical development with no meaningful safety or tolerability concerns observed to date. Part B of the study, which will evaluate muscle preservation antibodies in combination with semaglutide in obese participants remains on track to start enrolling mid-year assuming a reasonable pace of enrollment, we expect to report top line results, including changes in body weight, fat mass and muscle mass in second half of 2025. I will conclude with our genetic medicines effort. \n At the upcoming ASGCT conference, we will present updated data from our DB-OTO gene therapy program for genetic hearing loss. The first patient treated with this therapy, a 10-month old girl who is profoundly deaf at baseline. Now at 24 weeks after treatment had hearing in the normal range and the second treated patient is following a similar trajectory of improvement through earlier stages of follow-up. We are aiming to enroll several more patients this year, potentially enabling regulatory submissions by the end of next year, and we also look forward to bringing additional auditory gene therapy programs to the clinic in the coming years with the potential to address more common forms of monogenic hearing loss. \n Our collaboration with Intellia on CRISPR gene editing continues to advance. We have begun to enroll patients in the Phase III magnitude study of Intellia 2001 for a lead indication of TTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. The first in vivo CRISPR program clear to enter Phase III studies in the United States. We're also on track to be the first to use CRISPR technology to insert a corrective gene in vivo for a deficiency disease. We have now achieved clearance from both the U.S. and EU authorities for our insertion program for Factor IX, and we have already enrolled initial patients into the leading portion of this program. \n Moving on to our sRNA collaboration with Alnylam, which has not only demonstrated successful silencing of genes in the liver, but also for the first time for siRNA in the brain. Additionally, we're excited about potentially initiating later this year a potentially pivotal study for our ALN SOD treatment in ALS patients with SOD1 mutations.\n With that overview, I will turn the call over to Mary. Thanks. Great question. As when you block with other approaches like bimagrumab, you're blocking over a dozen members of the so-called BMP, GDF family and so forth. And that raises the concern because only a couple of those are actually involved in muscle preservation that you may end up doing more harm than good. What we have identified over the years is we identified 2 members of this very large family of almost 20 factors, which 2 are specifically involved in muscle preservation and we created antibodies to each of these 2 individually. \n And we're testing these antibodies individually as well as together. And obviously, in this field of obesity, safety matters almost as much as efficacy here. So we believe we have the best program that is testing specifically just the specific members of this very large family that are involved in muscle preservation where they're blocking either one or both together is going to benefit the quality of the weight loss in terms of preserving muscle and maybe even causing more fat loss while creating hopefully the best possible safety profile.\n So we think that's a big difference between our program and other programs that are blocking as I said, almost 20 different members that are involved in all sorts of things from growth factors for the bone marrow for red blood cells, controlling all sorts of things from clotting to liver function and other things and so anyway, that's the major difference in our program. Well, just to remind you, if you look at our paper where we did the nonhuman primate studies and so forth, is the first thing we're going to be looking for is there is the very real possibility of increased weight loss. And that might be the simplest regulatory endpoint of all. After that, if we don't see that, but we see better quality of weight loss, that could be manifested in a variety of ways, though we, of course, recognize that those would perhaps create more complicated ways of being regulated. So obviously, if you increase the fat loss while preserving muscle you should have dramatic benefits in metabolic parameters, which are often used in the field, particularly in people with diabetes and so forth as well as ultimately in terms of function by having maintenance of function as opposed to losing function and maintaining those sort of functional endpoints. \n So the simplest path might be simply weight loss one could then move into metabolic parameters or muscle actual functional outcome measures. But to us, the most important thing in the Phase II study is to really just demonstrate the quality of the weight loss in terms of fat versus muscle because ultimately, if you're preserving muscle and increasing the fat loss, it has to be much better for patients, and it may avoid a lot of catastrophic long-term effects of widespread GLP-1 use and so if we see that, we think that we have a real opportunity to turn that into real widespread benefit for patients using this class of drugs. These are great questions. We hope from the first few patients if the results are as dramatic as they are in the preclinical studies that we'll be seeing meaningful indicators that we are really reversing severe food allergy. Of course, the first thing and the most important biomarker, as I said, is this evil immunoglobulin IgE, which you can both measure, but they are also routinely tested using these skin prick tests, which are how people are actually evaluated for allergies. \n So we expect, first of all, to be seeing that happening in the study in obvious ways. And then we can follow that up, and it is allowed in the study if we see dramatic responses in these markers of the actual allergy-causing immunoglobulin to then go on and do actual food challenges and so forth in the patients. So it all depends on how obvious the reductions in this [ IgE are ] and if they are really dramatic, we can go on and do additional allergen-challenged tests. But we hope if the humans behave like the nonhuman primate that we might be seeing something dramatic in the initial patients. Yes. The interesting thing is the animal study suggests that the antibodies against the allergens come back as  IgG, G for good antibodies. The whole point of -- if you guys are familiar with so-called immunotherapy or desensitization therapy, all of those therapies, what they're trying to do is induce production of IgG to overwhelm the IgE. That's a much harder thing to do because they're not really getting rid of the Ig. They just have to overwhelm with a lot more IgG. In the animal studies, it suggests that we get rid of the Ig and we replace it with IgG. We don't know, obviously, in the humans, it may be possible that short-term treatment, relatively short-term treatment, may allow patients who have replaced their IgE with IgG, and they will have long-term protection. \n On the other hand, we may see that to prevent these patients from making Ig and more IgGs in the future that they may have to stay on the Dupixent for substantial long periods of time. The good news about that as we all know and as was highlighted in Marion's comments, Dupixent compared to most other immunomodulatory agents, it's not immunosuppressive. It actually is corrective for the immune system. And as indicated by its labeling to very, very young patients, it's a very, very relatively safe immunomodulator and biologic. And since most people who have severe allergies also have a lot of other concomitant atopic diseases. \n It may be that it is best for these patients to keep their abnormal atopy or abnormal type 2 inflammation under control. So short answer is it's -- there's a possibility it could be relatively short term, but there's also a possibility at least for some or the majority of patients, it could be relatively long term. But the good news is that they may actually have a long-term benefit for the patients because these patients are almost by definition, what you call atopic patients who might need control of their type 2 excess inflammation. Right. That's a great question. Obviously, the thing that gets us excited about our program compare to the field is that we've seen levels of activity that haven't been seen in the other LAG-3 programs, particularly in melanoma. If that's true in melanoma, there would be hope that this would be seen broadly in other settings and indications. We are certainly excited to see the follow-up details on the BMS story with potential activity in a specific subpopulation that will certainly help point us in our own studies to see what we're seeing within that subpopulation that they are talking about as well as more broadly. But of course, the hope, as I said, is if it is indeed more active in one setting such as melanoma, the hope is it will be broadly more active across other cancer settings as well. So we are excited to see follow-up on their data. We're excited to see follow-up on our data, both in melanoma and in our lung studies. Yes, these are all great questions. What we've already actually shown based on a variety of studies that we've done is that normal nonmalignant noncancerous plasma cells, the cells that are the immunoglobulin factory cells are the normal versions of the cells are much more susceptible to the bispecific than our malignant myeloma cells. So in discussions and communications with the FDA, we're actually starting at much lower doses than the doses that are used in the myeloma programs, though there is an intrapatient dose escalation process. So we're literally watching -- we're starting with low doses and we're going up in the doses until we actually hopefully see elimination of the IgE. That said, in terms of the safety, I'd just remind you that the much higher myeloma doses, we came up as Len briefly summarized in this program. \n We believe that we have a differentiated program in terms of not only efficacy and hospitalization burden and so forth, but also in safety. We have less than 1% Grade 3 events at those high doses in the much sicker myeloma patients. So we hope and we expect that with lower doses in a much healthier population, that this will be a hopefully pretty well tolerated approach. And a much shorter, yes. We think that ultimately, we make it by with a single short course or a very short course of treatment. In terms of whether if somebody takes a holiday, whether one has to then start all over again with the elimination of the IgE cells, we think probably not because it takes a long time to get to those levels of IgE. \n So just delaying for a short period of time, we may not bounce back to those levels. As I said, you may have converted all of those cells to IgG or good sales by that point anyway. But of course, we have to be doing the studies, and we have to be looking at these patients in the clinic to really understand. When I -- I should mention that the Grade 3 events that I was talking about are reflected by cytokine release syndrome. A lot of that is also thought to be -- due to the load of the cancer cells. And obviously, these normal patients have much less of a load here. So it's just another reason to expect, hopefully, better safety. We're going to be going with lower doses, more gentle treatment, and they have much less load in there, so you would expect much less reason to be seeing things like cytokine release syndrome. That's a phenomenal question. And first of all, let me remind you that with our long-term collaboration and recent acquisition of 2seventy. 2seventy had exactly the sort of CAR-T programs that you're referring to in lupus and other autoimmune settings, which we are now obviously pursuing together with them but that is one of the reasons why we were excited about turning the collaboration into a situation where we brought all the expertise and the scientists and leadership from 2seventy in-house because we're doing exactly what you suggested. We're hoping to actually literally look in side-by-side studies, how CAR-T approaches in these settings of autoimmune, severe autoimmune disease like lupus and so forth, compare directly head-to-head to our bispecifics. And as you are sort of suggesting, you would think that there would be really little reason to think that the CAR-T solutions would be preferable in this setting, both in terms of off-the-shelf mess and the ability to eliminate the normal cells.\n As I said, it's usually a lot easier to get rid of normal cells than it is malignant cells. So whatever advantages you might have in certain settings of CAR-Ts you would think in the normal disease setting or at least normal cells in autoimmune disease settings that bispecifics might be just as good, much more convenient and much safer. So together with now our internal Regeneron cell medicines group that has involved a lot of the expertise and leadership of 2seventy, we're exploring that exact question. \n I should also say that as clearly been announced by the company and is available in our public disclosures, we have already initiated separately a variety of studies looking at our bispecifics to decrease autoantibodies and autoimmune diseases in other settings as well. So we were already looking at this, but now we're looking at these in direct comparison to our CAR-T approaches with our now internal Regeneron cell medicines efforts. Well, there's always the possibility of disease modification. We actually believe, for example, Dupixent in asthma may be doing exactly that sort of benefit. One of the best ways of actually looking at that is looking at overall loss of lung function over time because, as you know, in these lung diseases as Marion said, in both asthma and COPD, these are diseases of the lungs followed largely by pulmonologists, the same sort of doctors and it is well known that in both of these diseases over time, patients start permanently losing lung capacity and lung function. We are and have been and have early data suggesting that Dupixent may prefer that in asthma, and we'll certainly be looking at those sorts of things for not only Dupixent but itepekimab in the COPD patients in terms of modifying disease and long-term preservation and prevention of this otherwise unstoppable lung function loss."
