Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC\u2019s website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Latest Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today\u2019s press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today\u2019s format will consist of providing you with highlights of our fourth quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter\u2019s business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our financial results. Then, I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.\nGary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. Our fourth quarter capped the year in which the pandemic challenged our customers and our business. It highlighted some core strengths for the company, introduced some obstacles to overcome and triggered some changes for us. To put the year and quarter in context, let me first review some of the numbers. Procedures grew 6% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 1% for the full-year over 2019, resulting in approximately 1.25 million procedures in 2020. We placed 326 systems in the quarter, down from 336 systems in Q4 of 2019. For the full-year, we placed 936 systems in 2020, down from 1,119 systems in 2019. Finally, revenue fell 3% in 2020 as the result of delays in surgical procedures, as hospitals focused on treating COVID patients. Digging a little deeper, our core business remains healthy. After the first surge of COVID abated during this past summer, our customers returned to more routine use of our systems and solutions. We believe that the Intuitive ecosystem enabled increased access to and practice of high-quality minimally invasive surgery, which may have helped hospitals conserve valuable intensive care resources during the pandemic. Despite pressure on utilization of our systems due to COVID, our hospital customers continued to invest in building their Intuitive's robotics programs with additional systems, evidenced by a 7% increase in the clinical installed base in 2020. We saw committed customers strengthening their programs, likely due to their analysis of how well the Intuitive ecosystem satisfied their quadruple aim objectives, better outcomes, better care team experiences, better patient experiences, and lower total cost to treat per patient episode. Lastly, we believe our investments in our analytics programs have helped customers routinely analyze their performance, supporting their programmatic insights in the year. Our confidence in our core business and our long-term opportunity remains robust, in spite of near-term uncertainty, which is as follows. First, the pandemic is resurgent in many regions, powered now by more contagious variants. While hospitals have better protocols to manage patients today than they did earlier in 2020, our weekly surgical data in December 2020 and continuing today shows another clamp down on surgeries. Furthermore, we believe diagnostic procedures are slowing in hard hit regions. With diagnostic procedures running significantly below pre-pandemic levels, patients and hospitals will acutely feel the impact through disease progression and the more complex therapies necessary when patients do return for care. This delay in diagnostic pipelines will likely take several quarters to resolve, even after the threat of COVID begins to abate. Second, we know that future of new capital installs are highly sensitive to utilization rates. Delayed surgeries will also impact the growth of surgical departments, pressuring new system installs until excess capacity is consumed. Third, in countries where the government pays the healthcare bill, budget strain and economic fallout from COVID may impact health care spending in new and variable ways in different countries. Lastly, the trend that started prior to the pandemic for increased data requirements and longer clearance time lines from regulators in the United States and Europe for our industry has continued this year. Taken together, these obstacles make predictions for the next several quarters difficult. As I mentioned earlier, 2020 has broadly eliminated some longer-term trends in health-care that validate our thesis. The increased pressure on healthcare systems to conserve acute care resources for the sickest patients may have accelerated investments that enable patients to get the care they need with fast recovery, minimizing consumption of scarce hospital resources and reducing complications. The compounding value of analyzing real-time data and offline healthcare data to drive insights, to drive better care has become obvious this year. Lastly, we saw an acceleration of remote technology used to enable proctoring, learning and analysis. I've heard it said that in good times, we develop ourselves to become who we want to be while hard times reveal who we really are. In the year, we set our priorities based on our values. We implemented community relief and customer relief, launched our Extended Use Instruments program, mobilized local and remote training resources to support customers differently and continued to listen carefully to our customers to best understand their needs. We've seen positive customer response to this approach, which is reflected in our Net Promoter Score. You can find more information on these scores in our JPMorgan Healthcare Conference presentation from this month, posted on our website. Over the past several years, we've been building our capabilities in different countries to better serve their healthcare systems. I'd like to take a moment to take you through how we performed outside the United States in the year. Turning first to Asia. Our business in Japan is moving beyond urology, given reimbursements for a broad slate of procedures obtained in Japan in 2018 and 2020. Government hospitals in Japan have been conserving resources for COVID care and the pandemic has introduced noticeable delays as the healthcare system reacts to outbreaks. In Korea, our business continues to be dynamic with an innovation-oriented customer group adopting new products like our da Vinci SP. In China, we saw accelerated customer acceptance of our partnership with Fosun Pharma and our products, with growth in procedures and the business overall outpacing our pre-pandemic plans. In 2020, China emerged as our number two procedure market. Turning to Europe. Our team in Germany has had success in engaging larger German hospital groups with increased system placements broadening our market access. Constraints on elective surgery have been implemented assertively in Germany in light of COVID. In Germany, France, UK, Italy and the Nordics, our goals have been to broaden da Vinci use beyond urology. Progress therein has been hampered significantly by COVID. Lastly, we see relatively low public sector reimbursements in Europe for benign procedures. Innovations from Intuitive like da Vinci S and our Extended Use Instruments are providing an option for more price sensitive customers in these markets. With regard to our innovation and product engines, we spent time walking through our progress at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference this month and our presentation is available online at our website, intuitive.com. I'd recommend to the interested listener a review of those materials for greater insight into our progress. Summarizing briefly here, we're making good progress in advancing many elements of our ecosystem, including our advanced instruments, deepening our imaging and informatics programs, including our augmented reality program, Iris, and extending the launches of our new platforms. We grew the installed base in procedures for our single port platform, da Vinci SP. We're focused on advancing clinical indications for SP in several regions, as well as extending its instrument and accessory portfolio. For our flexible robotics platform, Ion, we saw strong clinical results and demand in the year, but met manufacturing and supply performance challenges in the fourth quarter as catheter demand outpaced our forecasting models and the need for important quality improvement implementations and COVID quarantines hampered our production. We are currently shipping Ion product and expect to meet the demand curve in the first-half of 2021. Before Marshall takes you through our finances in detail, I'd like to touch on our financial strategy. Our operating model withstood the strains of 2020 well, starting with our decision several years ago to shift to greater flexibility in system placement models, the incorporation of sales, leasing and risk-shared models allowed us to meet customers' needs during a disruptive time. Our investments in advanced instruments, including stapling and energy have been fruitful with growing revenues, improving margins and growing customer appreciation for advanced instruments. We've been investing capital in our manufacturing methods to increase quality and lower our costs, which in turn has allowed us to extend savings to our customers to allow them greater flexibility and deploying our products in more cost-sensitive environments. This has triggered a virtuous cycle that allows us greater volume, which in turn gives us greater ability to invest in higher-volume processes. We'll continue to invest in this cycle going forward. We believe we are still in the early innings of a long opportunity to substantially improve the quadruple aim and acute medical interventions using robotics, computing, advanced imaging and informatics. As a result, we continue to invest in our innovation engines to create and pursue these opportunities. In closing, our priorities for 2021 are as follows. First, we'll support our customers' recovery of surgery during and post pandemic. Second, we'll focus on outstanding regional performance. Third, we'll advance our priority programs and launches, SP, Ion, imaging and analytics, including new indications. And finally, continued expansion of clinical, economic and analytical evidence base for key procedures and countries. I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will take you through financial matters in greater detail.\nMarshall Mohr: Good afternoon. I\u2019ll describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Revenue and procedures are consistent with our preliminary press release of January 13th. Key business metrics for the fourth quarter were as follows. Fourth quarter 2020 procedures increased approximately 6% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 and increased approximately 10% compared with last quarter. Fourth quarter system placements of 326 systems decreased 3% compared with 336 systems last year and increased 67% compared with 195 systems last quarter. We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems over last year by 7% to approximately 5,989 systems. This growth rate compares with 8% in the last quarter and 12% last year. Utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, declined approximately 2% compared with last year and increased 8% compared with last quarter. The impact of COVID on da Vinci procedures varied by region. Resurgence of COVID in parts of Europe had significant impacts on procedures, including in Italy, UK, Nordics and France. While the impact of COVID on procedures in the Asia Pacific region, including China, Japan and Korea, was far less significant. In the U.S., fourth quarter procedure growth was impacted by the COVID\u2019s resurgence, resulting in 5% year-over-year growth compared to 7% growth in the third quarter. The resurgence in U.S. and Europe was more acute and had a greater impact on procedures late in the quarter, a trend that continued into January. The impact of a resurgence can be significant. For example, in California, the fourth quarter COVID resurgence turned a year-over-year da Vinci procedure growth in October of 8% to a year-over-year decline of 6% in December. We also believe that reduced diagnosis reflecting patient concern over COVID exposure has impacted certain procedures globally. This has had its most pronounced effect on prostatectomies. Despite the fact that hospitals are better equipped to handle COVID patients today compared to the outset of the pandemic, COVID-19 resurgences like those currently being experienced in parts of Europe and the U.S. have challenged hospital care capabilities and have negatively impacted da Vinci procedures. In addition, delays in diagnosis and treatment of underlying conditions will also continue to negatively impact da Vinci procedures. Uncertainties in this COVID environment are not predictable, and the vaccine rollout and its impact on controlling COVID spread is also not predictable. Given these uncertainties, we are not providing procedure guidance at this time. Philip will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call. Fourth quarter capital placements exceeded our expectations, reflecting several factors. In certain cases, hospitals exhausted 2020 budgets and spend capacities. And in some cases, hospitals purchased systems in preparation for post-pandemic environment. We also experienced a higher level of trade-ins of SI systems for fourth generation systems, reflecting hospital desire to standardize their fleet and to avail themselves to fourth generation technology and lower cost Extended Use Instruments. Looking forward, we see the following capital revenue headwinds. Utilization declined 2% year-over-year, resulting in excess system capacity at hospitals. We expect customers to fill existing system capacity before purchasing additional capital. Some of the fourth quarter capital placements reflected hospitals exhausting 2020 budgets. As budgets reset for 2021, hospitals could reduce their capital spend, particularly as COVID strains hospital profitability. We expect leasing to continue to increase as a percentage of overall placements. Macroeconomic conditions created by COVID could also impact hospital capital spending. And as we face competition in various markets, we may experience longer selling cycles and price pressures. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. Total fourth quarter revenue was $1,329 million, representing a 4% increase from last year and a 23% increase from last quarter. Fourth quarter revenue benefited from U.S. customer stocking of Extended Use Instruments and higher than expected system placements. Leasing represented 37% of current quarter placements compared with 35% last quarter. Fourth quarter placements included some larger IDN transactions where the IDN prefers purchase transactions. Excluding those transactions, leasing as a percentage of total placements would have been several percentage points higher. In an environment of COVID-19 as economic pressures increase, we anticipate more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than reflected in historical run rates. Approximately half of the systems placed in the fourth quarter involve trade-ins, which is higher than the 40% last quarter and higher than the average over the last couple of years. Trade-in activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict. Fourth quarter average selling prices declined to $1.43 million from $1.61 million last year and $1.55 million in the third quarter. The decrease relative to last year reflects a lower mix of systems placed in China and Japan and a higher proportion of trade transactions. The decrease relative to last quarter reflects a higher proportion of trade-in transactions and a higher mix of indirect market placements. We recognized $14 million of lease buyout revenue in the fourth quarter compared with $17 million last quarter and $34 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure increased to approximately $2,060 per procedure compared with $1,910 per procedure in the third quarter of 2020 and $1,980 realized in the fourth quarter of last year. The entirety of the increase compared to the third quarter reflects U.S. hospital stocking Extended Use Instruments. We launched Extended Use Instruments early in the quarter in the U.S. and mid-quarter in Europe. We will launch Extended Use Instruments in other markets in 2021 and 2022, depending on regulatory requirements. Going forward, we expect customers to adjust their instrument buying patterns and reduce their inventory levels to reflect the additional uses per instrument. In addition, Extended Use Instruments and lower instrument pricing will result in lower I&A revenue per procedure to Intuitive. The impact and timing of customer buying patterns and lower per use revenue will likely begin to impact revenues in the first quarter, but will depend on customer inventory practices and procedure volumes. While we expect price elasticity associated with Extended Use Instruments to enable greater penetration into available markets, that benefit will be delayed by COVID and otherwise will take time. 12 of the systems placed in the fourth quarter were SP systems, reflecting continued measured rollout of SP and the impact of COVID-19. Our installed base of SP systems is now 69, 8 in Korea and 61 in the U.S. Our rollout of the SP surgical system will continue to be measured, putting systems in the hands of experienced da Vinci users, while we pursue additional indications and optimize training pathways in our supply chain. We expect to initiate first cases associated with a U.S. colorectal clinical trial this quarter. We placed four Ion systems in the quarter, bringing the installed base to 36 systems. Ion system placements and procedures are excluded from our overall system and procedure counts. Ion system placements were affected by supply chain issues described by Gary earlier in the call. We expect to remediate these supply issues in the first half of 2021. Our rollout of Ion will continue to be measured while we optimize training pathways in our supply chain. Procedures under the PRECISE study are expected to complete in the second quarter of 2021. Outside the U.S., we placed 130 systems in the fourth quarter compared with 140 in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 79 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 54 into Europe, 22 into Japan and 13 into China compared with 54 into Europe, 26 into Japan and 39 into China in the fourth quarter of 2019. System placements into China in the fourth quarter of 2019 were higher as hospitals accelerated tenders in anticipation of the possibility of higher tariffs. Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 69.7% compared with 72.2% for the fourth quarter of 2019 and 70.2% last quarter. The fourth quarter of 2020 included higher period costs associated with lower production and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges. The decrease relative to the fourth quarter of 2019 reflects higher period costs associated with lower production, higher excess and obsolete inventory charges and lower system ASPs. As revenues are pressured by COVID-19, production levels may operate at below normal levels, which may result in higher labor costs and under-absorbed overhead and reduced product margins. In addition, product and customer mix fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and could cause fluctuations in gross margins. Pro forma operating expenses decreased 6% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 and increased 11% compared with the third quarter of 2020. The fourth quarter of 2020 includes a $25 million contribution to the Intuitive Foundation compared with a $5 million contribution in the fourth quarter of 2019 and no contribution last quarter. Fourth quarter operating expenses continued to reflect reduced spending on activities directly impacted by COVID-19, including marketing events, travel and in-person training as well as lower variable compensation. These costs will naturally increase as the impact of COVID declines. We continue to believe we have a unique opportunity to extend the benefits of computer-aided surgery and acute interventions around the world, and we'll continue to invest in the business for the long term. During this period of COVID, we continue to invest in product development activities, including informatics, advanced imaging, advanced instruments and our Ion and SP platforms. Accordingly, you should expect the growth rate of R&D expenses in 2021 to significantly exceed the 2020 growth rate. We expect the growth rate of SG&A expenses to also increase significantly in 2021 compared to 2020. SG&A spending can be categorized as follows. Investments in OUS markets will increase over 2020 spend as we expand our capabilities and investment in clinical data. Variable compensation will increase over 2020 as we reset goals and targets. Core spending on resources and infrastructure will increase over 2020 to prepare for a post-COVID environment. Spend on activities impacted by COVID, like travel, marketing events and in-person training will increase as the impact of COVID declines. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 20.7% compared with our expectations of 20% to 21%, primarily reflecting the geographic mix of income. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of onetime items. Our fourth quarter 2020 pro forma net income was $436 million or $3.58 per share compared with $426 million or $3.48 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019 and $341 million or $2.77 per share for last quarter. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $364 million or $3.02 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with GAAP net income of $363 million or $2.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019 and GAAP net income of $317 million or $2.60 per share for last quarter. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation and IP charges, amortization of intangibles, and acquisition-related items and legal settlements. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter and third quarters of 2020 also included pretax gains of $4.7 million and $61.7 million on our investments in private entities, resulting from our purchases of certain technologies. The EPS impact of these gains net of tax was $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.39 per share in the third quarter. These gains are excluded from our pro forma results. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $6.9 billion compared with $6.4 billion at September 30, 2020 and $5.8 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in cash in the fourth quarter reflected cash from operations, a reduction in inventory and overall working capital and stock exercises. We repurchased $34 million of shares in the quarter with an average price of -- at an average price of $661.10 per share. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Philip, who will go over our procedure performance.\nPhilip Kim: Thank you, Marshall. Our overall fourth quarter procedure growth was 6% compared to 19% growth during the fourth quarter of 2019 and 7% growth last quarter. Our Q4 procedure growth was driven by 5% growth in the U.S. and 11% growth OUS. Resurgences of COVID in the U.S. and Europe impacted our growth rates in the quarter, and we saw procedure growth rates decline as the quarter progressed, particularly late in the quarter. With respect to key contributors to growth, overall procedures in China and bariatrics in the U.S. were the largest drivers of procedure growth in Q4. In the U.S., within general surgery, bariatric, cole and hernia were the largest contributors to procedure growth within the quarter. Bariatrics may be benefiting from certain patients prioritizing weight loss as obesity is a significant COVID risk factor. In addition, we continue to receive positive reviews of our SureForm 60 stapler, which provides surgeons an optimized robotic tool set and feedback for bariatric procedures. In China, procedure growth accelerated as new systems installed under the quota began to provide additional capacity for incremental growth. Q4 China procedures had broad-based growth in urology, thoracic, general surgery and gynecology. With respect to our more mature procedure categories in the U.S., Q4 gynecology procedure growth was up, reflecting growth in cancer procedures, partially offset by declines in benign procedures. On a worldwide basis, dVP procedures in the fourth quarter declined year-over-year and had similar trends as we described last quarter. COVID is impacting the diagnostic and patient pipeline related to dVP. Now, turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain republished studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. Doctors Clark A. Wilson and Jihad Kaouk from the Cleveland Clinic and colleagues in a paper published in Urology described their experience evaluating robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy with da Vinci SP through an extraperitoneal approach and enhanced recovery protocol for same-day surgery. 60 subjects with organ confined disease underwent an SP procedure with no patients requiring conversion to another approach. Median length of stay for all patients was 4.2 hours. 75% of all patients enrolled were discharged on the day of surgery and 96% of patients discharged within 24 hours, when excluding those either with surgery after 6:00 p.m. or with preplanned admissions due to patient preference or significant comorbidities. The authors concluded a robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy with the da Vinci SP system and extraperitoneal approach can be performed safely and reproducibly as the same-day surgery. This publication adds to the number of early studies around the emerging SP technology, demonstrating encouraging results within robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy as a same-day surgery and acceptable, perioperative, functional and short-term oncological outcomes in the hands of experienced surgeons for the appropriate patients. We look forward to the growth of the body of evidence around da Vinci SP. Lastly, we'd like to highlight that our second annual sustainability report will be available after the call on our Investor Relations website. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First, we go to the line of Amit Hazan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAmit Hazan: Thanks very much. Hey, good afternoon, everyone. I thought maybe I'd first go to your comments in general on hospital capital spending and maybe try to reconcile some of them. I think, if you go back to last week, you cited hospitals with seven-plus systems were up strongly. And here, you're still citing lower utilization as the key headwind. And so, I'm just wondering, are you otherwise seeing a skewing towards newer customers, and just trying to get my hands around. I have to imagine it's complicated and hospital systems are different, but how much more color you can provide around kind of some of these different data points that you've provided?\nMarshall Mohr: Yes. I think I just -- go ahead.\nGary Guthart: Why don't I jump in, Marshall, and then, I'll kick it back to you? Amit, thanks for the question. We were talking about earlier in the month here. We think there's some budget flushing that happened at the end of 2020. How strong that will be into 2021? Did they pull forward spending that would otherwise normally have been in 2021? Hard to say. Having said that, if you look at where we were winning relative to other priorities, even if there is some budget pull forward, large customers were -- that already had robotics programs were expressing confidence with us, which we think is a positive. The caution we're sending you now in this call is just that over time, there'll be an equilibration, which is there is some excess capacity in the field because COVID is suppressing procedures. And at some point, COVID will lift, and that capacity will be absorbed. Some folks will invest ahead, getting ready and being able to work on backlog and others will be conservative and wait till they consume that capacity. Forecasting that is hard. And so, that's how we're trying to help you navigate through this. But Marshall, please clean up anything that you need to do in that answer.\nMarshall Mohr: No, you hit it perfectly.\nAmit Hazan: Okay. And as my follow-up and separate on data and digital engagements to date. Again, kind of going off of a comment you made last week at hospital analytics and you talked about the 350 hospitals, 690 engagements. I'm just wondering how much more color you can give on that in terms of how much of that is that programmatic variety that you talked about that won't necessarily be monetized versus something that could either improve outcomes or reduce costs and potentially be monetized? Just any color around those early engagements would be helpful? Thank you.\nGary Guthart: Yes. Thanks for the question. When we\u2019re talking about what we shared with you in the talk at JPMorgan, most of that is programmatic analysis. And it's not so much something that we think is going to be revenue-generating directly. We think that it illuminates the value of our ecosystem and strong da Vinci programs. And that is a benefit to us. It increases the stick rate, allows people to see in a verifiable way within their own data sets, the value they're bringing. It gives them action plans to find opportunity for standardization and other kinds of efficiency improvements. So, it's of high value to the customer and high value to us. Some of the other things that we've shared with you, for example, Iris, those things are something that we'll collect revenue for. They probably won't become huge revenue arms in and of themselves, but they bring value on a per case basis. And it's something that we can talk to the customer about in terms of value creation there. They also strengthen the ecosystem. So, I think for shareholders who are asking the question, \u201cHey, when does informatics and machine learning create a revenue arm of its own?\u201d I'm not sure that's the right question. I think that analytics and informatics power the ecosystem as a whole. We're pretty agnostic as to how we get paid for that. If we get paid for that through increased utilization, wonderful. That works great. We look at cost to develop those programs and kind of overall their contribution to our financial health. But we don't have to charge for them individually if that's not how a customer wants to pay for it. Let me turn it to you, Marshall, and any color you want to add.\nMarshall Mohr: No, I think, that's right. I think that we look at it as the opportunity to increase the ecosystem and to expand our base and/or accelerate adoption.\nAmit Hazan: Thank you.\nGary Guthart: Thanks, Amit.\nOperator: Next we have the line of David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nDavid Lewis: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Marshall, I appreciate we don't have guidance and I appreciate your commentary on spending levels for 2021, but as I'm sure you appreciate, without revenue figures, those are kind of hard numbers to put in context. So, I was wondering if you could help us out a little bit more. I mean, is the right messaging here that OpEx growth in 2021 is going to go faster than whatever the sales growth rate is? Or ask that kind of same question a different way. I mean, SG&A for the last several years has grown in line with revenue and R&D has grown kind of 2x revenue growth rates. Are those the type of -- any of those parameters you would kind of give us any visibility and to be super helpful? And then, I've got a couple of follow-ups.\nMarshall Mohr: It's a good question. And I am empathetic to the fact that we aren't giving you revenue guidance. And so, it's hard to put those numbers in context. However, it really does come down to that -- the impacts of COVID are really pretty unpredictable. And so, if COVID wanes quickly, then I think the spend we're talking about might match up better with the revenue increase. But I got to tell you, the point of my -- the reason I pointed this all out in terms of the increases in expenses that we were able -- this year, we saw a long period where COVID impacted us. And we -- some of the variable expenses I outlined, came in pretty low relative to what they historically had been. And those will increase as COVID goes away. But in addition to that, there are other expenses that we will continue to spend. The increase -- there will be increases regardless of what happens to COVID. I think, we want to continue to invest in the R&D areas that I mentioned. And we want to -- because we see that there's a real opportunity to continue to expand our marketplace and to expand penetration in the long-term. And so, we're going to increase those costs. I know I haven't given you what you're looking for, but it's just a very difficult environment to predict revenue and procedures at this point.\nDavid Lewis: Okay. And then, just maybe two quick follow-ups, one easier to answer than the other. Just in terms of volumes, obviously, fourth quarter was more similar to third quarter. And generally speaking, the message from most corporates last week was that first quarter is going to be at fourth quarter, if not frankly a little worse. I just wonder if you could sort of comment on sort of what you're seeing from the procedure environment here in the first quarter? And then, just secondarily, on the Extended Use Program, obviously, we saw kind of a bolus on revenue per procedure this particular quarter as hospitals didn't change inventory patterns. Are you seeing any evidence? I know it's hard in COVID that it's driving higher demand, the Extended Use Program driving higher demand. And when would you expect those revenue per procedure numbers to begin to reverse? Is that as early as the first quarter, or probably more likely middle part of the year? Sorry for both questions. Thanks so much.\nMarshall Mohr: Yes. So, your -- the first part of your question was...\nGary Guthart: Q1 volume update.\nMarshall Mohr: Yes, Q1 volume. I made the comment that as we went through the quarter, the resurgence became more acute and it had a greater impact on procedures. And so I gave you the California example of where you go from growth in October to reduction in December. That should be an indication of the level of sort of impact they can have. And then, I also made the comment that we saw the trends at the end of the quarter continue into January. So, I think you said that other companies are saying that Q1 could be worse, it could be. But again, we're not going to try to predict exactly where it's going to come out, given the uncertainties around it. But it's clear coming into the quarter, it was at the bottom end of what was going on in Q4. As far as Extended Use Instruments go, we launched it in the U.S. in -- at the beginning of the quarter and in Europe in the middle of the quarter, about three quarters of our customers are now acquiring Extended Use Instruments. They're starting to be used on procedures. It's really hard for us to predict exactly when we'll start to see the benefits of those Extended Use Instruments in terms of elasticity and price elasticity, and it's certainly going to be confounded by COVID. So, I think it will take time. I think it's going to take a while before we start to see that. Sometimes you have to point out the benefits to the hospital. You have to sell it a little bit. And I just think we'll be patient about it.\nOperator: Next, we have the line of Bob Hopkins, Bank of America.\nBob Hopkins: Gary, I wanted to get you up in two geographies, if okay. First, on the U.S. Just curious, do you think that perhaps by the second half of this year, there's a chance based on everything you're seeing that we could be close to a normal level of surgical procedure volumes in the U.S., or given what you're seeing on the diagnostic side and the slow vaccine rollout that that's more likely to be a 2022 event? And then, I'd also love to get your opinion on China and the durability of the phenomenal growth you appear to be having here of late.\nGary Guthart: Hey Bob. On the first one, the U.S., I won't predict for you, but let's talk about the puts and the takes, the things that are going to be the push-pull about it. Clearly, hospitals want to get back to treating patients who are non-COVID patients. There is a demand and the desire to do that. It takes a couple of things. One is that resources get freed up from treating COVID patients to allow them to treat other things, and some of that is ICU resources and a lot of it is staff. So, as COVID surges go, so does access to that set of resources. Your tracking and analysis is as good as ours in terms of looking at how well the vaccine is going to go out and what the COVID numbers might be. So, I think, that's a large part of it. In terms of the diagnostic pipelines, kind of the same thing. I think, everybody wants to get patients back in to get diagnosed. We think backlog that's been building for surgical patients as the search happens, and then you have this longer been forgoing normal checkups, whether it's colonoscopies or PSA screening or what have you, that will start coming back in. And of course, disease doesn't take a holiday. And as a result, those things will be more advanced when they're caught. We've seen this before. We\u2019ve been in this movie when we saw changes to PSA testing recommendations. That will again create a backlog, but it will take longer for it to realize and longer for it to process through. I don't think it's going to drive substantive share shifts between treatment modalities. I think, it's going to be hard on patients as they go through that. And that will provide a headwind for us in -- certainly in 2021 and then tailwinds thereafter as those folks are diagnosed and come back into the pipe. So, that's kind of where I see the U.S. Moving to China, long term, we're quite excited. Pretty clearly, Chinese patients are interested in high quality care. Chinese surgeons are quite interested in robotics and in da Vinci and our partnership with Fosun and the joint venture is going well for us. So, in the near term, that feels great, and I think, there's a lot of strong underlying. As we've talked about before, the medical marketplace in China is complicated. Right now, systems are under quota, centrally managed quota. We see changes occurring in the Chinese regulatory environment over time as the FDA implements new policies and processes and we see that there are Chinese companies that are interested in this opportunity are pushing hard to field competitive systems. So, we are committed long-term to China. I think, it's going to be a strong demand market and a bouncy, sometimes turbulent marketplace due to policy changes and some of the central controls that are in place. We'll keep you updated as we get more clarity there.\nOperator: Next we have the line of Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: I'll just ask one multipart question on Ion. I'm just curious to know kind of the -- what comes next year? You talked about the PRECISE data completing enrollment I think in the second quarter. Should we assume that we see that data in 2022? Is there any update on Ion in China? And then, your competition has talked about indication expansion beyond lung bronchoscopy. Any color you're willing to share there? And just lastly, adding a therapeutic capability to Ion. So, basically, the roadmap here on Ion, what can we expect maybe going forward here? Thanks for taking the question.\nGary Guthart: All right. Thanks, Larry. Philip, I'm going to turn to you on PRECISE trial timing. And then, I'll take it from there.\nPhilip Kim: Yes. With respect to when you might hear some data, it is a fair assumption to expect to hear something in 2022. We haven't been more specific beyond that, Larry.\nGary Guthart: With regard to future indications, right now, where we're at with Ion, we are -- our commercial teams and our manufacturing operations teams are tightly focused on supplying and performing in the diagnostic bronchoscopy market, our first indication. Clearly, Ion is a platform technology, and we're excited about it. That said, I'd remind everybody, we are in early innings, all of us, the entire field is in early innings with regard to bronchoscopy. Our clinical results there are outstanding. I think that they are market-leading relative to competitors, any of the competitors. And we want to fulfill that market. We want to satisfy those customers. That means satisfying them in terms of quality and demand and shipments and so on. We think there are longer term applications beyond bronchoscopy and beyond diagnostics, and we're working on those. We are working on ablation technologies and some other things. We're not ready to speak publicly about where we might go next for a couple of reasons. One is, we're still in the very earliest innings about making bronchoscopy a reality; and two, for competitive reasons, we're not ready yet to describe what we intend to do next.\nLarry Biegelsen: And China, Gary?\nGary Guthart: On the China front, we of course have the joint venture with Fosun. We are working through pathways for Ion in China. We think there is a market there. I would advise folks that the Chinese regulatory system and CFDA handles gen 1 products pretty differently than FDA does in the U.S. And as a result, you want to see a little greater maturity in your product line before you go broadly there. So, we're working through that with our JV and also with the Chinese regulators. When we have some time lines for you, we will describe them. But, we remain active and interested.\nOperator: Next, we have the line of Tycho Peterson, JP Morgan.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. Gary, you mentioned no kind of shift in treatment modalities. So, I assume the deceleration doesn't imply any kind of share loss to laparoscopic. But as we think about coming out of the pandemic, the other side of it is you highlight a remote technology, for monitoring, proctoring and analysis. Are there structural changes here you think coming out of the pandemic that could drive faster adoption of robotics?\nGary Guthart: I believe so. Now, this is -- the right answer is we'll see. Time will tell. But, there are some encouraging anecdotes and they\u2019re anecdotes. One is, I think folks are realizing that a lot can get done without jumping on planes and that's true for surgeons. And one of the things that our teams have done beautifully this year is to more fully digitize and regionalize training. That has been great. So, forward deployment of training and greater use of digital tools, that will continue, and I think the acceptance of that is increasing. It's also accelerated remote proctoring, as you said. So, I think that has been a positive for us and something that we had thankfully made some investments in prior to the pandemic. The second part is I think that people are seeing changes in resource consumption, days in the hospital, ICU time, patient comforted, being housed in hospitals in the pandemic, has declined. And I think that will be durable. I think, even after COVID rates start to drop, I think folks thinking that sitting around a hospital isn't a great idea, and using ICU resources when you don't have to isn't a great idea. And I already, I think we see that folks are saying, hey, really high-quality minimally invasive surgery done well. And by the way, having the analytics to back that up is going to be appreciated and maybe an accelerant. So, I am cautiously optimistic that some of the trends we're seeing in terms of what recovery might be are going to be real positive for Intuitive.\nTycho Peterson: Another thing you highlighted at the conference was the regulatory requirements and time lines for the industry keep increasing. I know that's something you've been talking about for a while. But as we think about the roadmap here for SP, the IDE trial for colorectal, have the time lines gotten pushed out further in your view, given the regulatory burden, or is just kind of in line with what you've been talking about for a while?\nGary Guthart: Yes. I think we're starting to see the contours of the regulation side in the U.S. stabilize. So, it's stabilizing at a requirement level that's greater than it was in years past, but I don't think it's continuously moving. That's been good. I think, the thing that's challenged some time lines for us and others is COVID. If your clinical trial sites are having to manage COVID as well as whatever your clinical trial is, that can put pressure on you. That's kind of a near term thing. I think, longer term, the question of what does this do if clinical trial requirements and general data requirements in the U.S. and Europe for computer aided systems and robotics have become greater, what does that imply? And it probably implies a couple of things. One is that systems in the market are likely to stay in the market a little longer because it's just extended time lines for innovation. I think, the other thing is that it probably resequences when you see different products where in the world because some health care systems, Korea being notable, are allowing innovative products into their systems a little more quickly and other ones are becoming a little less. So, for a Company like us, you'll see increased investment in headcount and in resources for clinical and regulatory staff, and you'll see a reordering of where we go with new innovations over time. You'll probably see for the industry platforms sit a little longer that probably benefits incumbents a little more than it does in surgeons.\nTycho Peterson: Great. And then one last one on the extended use rollout. You did Europe recently, U.S. last quarter. Is there a next step to the process? Are you going to do it in Asia? And any reason the elasticity would be different in any of the geographies in your view?\nGary Guthart: Marshall, why don't you take that first?\nMarshall Mohr: Sure. The rollout into other parts of the world will depend on the regulatory time lines. As you could imagine, in China, it will take a long time. In some of the other markets, it might be a little bit quicker. I don't have a complete roadmap of every country. But yes, Asia Pac is absolutely on our mind. And we'd like to get them out to our direct markets in Asia as soon as possible. As far as the impact on elasticity, we did two things in the United States, if you recall. We modified the -- we obviously launched Extended Use Instruments, which lower the cost of care for hospitals, but we also -- simultaneous with that, lowered the price of a few select instruments that are used typically in lower benign -- lower acuity procedure -- or benign lower acuity procedures like cholecystectomy, benign hysterectomies and inguinal hernias. And then, in totality, then the use that -- if you look at an instrument, set that might be used in cholecystectomies, then the cost is competitive with other minimally invasive approaches. In each country, we have modified the pricing differently, and we're targeting those procedures that are pressured by reimbursement. So, you can't kind of paint or butter spread the comment of what elasticity will do in the United States will happen in the other countries. But, we are targeting specified procedures in each of those countries where reimbursement is stressed, and we believe we provide value. And we'll see. We believe that we'll create some elasticity in each country. It will just vary in terms of magnitude.\nOperator: Okay. Next, we have the line of Richard Newitter of SVB Leerink.\nRichard Newitter: If I could just start off on the competitive landscape, Gary, any comments you could offer on internationally, any competitors that are on the market, and what you're seeing out there relative to kind of what you would have expected? And then, in the U.S., just in light of some updates from mainly competitor. J&J recently, this fall provided an update on the feature set? And any thoughts you would care to offer where they're going to be trying to compete, particularly on kind of extra robotic arms, et cetera?\nGary Guthart: Sure. Just on the -- just speaking to the international side, the first thing I'd remind everybody is it's not really a robot versus robot question for customers. It's really a robotically-enabled ecosystem that drives outcomes versus a robotically-enabled ecosystem that drives different outcomes. That is programmatic versus programmatic. So, each of these, when they come out, we kind of look at it and say, okay, what's the robot capable of, do they have the instruments and the accessories, the imaging systems, the advanced tools that are required, some of those software and analytic capabilities, training capabilities and so on? And you see a pretty different skill set and capability out of each of these ecosystems. And that's true as well for some of the bigger competitors that are domestic. So, that's how we think about it. And I think that's how customers, by and large, will think about it. There will always be some customers who are interested in trialing and seeing what's capable out of something new, so I'd expect that. Nothing architecturally that I've seen of any of them, including the most recent announcements, has surprised me. I think we've seen a lot of these ideas. We've trialed personally a lot of them inside the Company. And so I think time will tell. We have made the trade-offs we've made for a reason based on evaluation, building product and kind of scientific method. And I think that customers will evaluate those trade-offs over time. We've also seen the idea that some of the bigger players want to bundle, that they're going to put all these things together, maybe lower the price of capital and try to throw some other things in to see if they can entice folks. And I think the way I'd ask customers and shareholders to think about it is bundling makes sense if the underlying products are commodities, if everybody is selling two ply toilet paper and one brand is not that different than the other, it's all fine. But that's not where we are. Robotic systems and the instrumentation and the imaging systems are not commoditized. And as a result, there'll be strong differences. and how they're used and what the outcomes are. And in that regard, I think that's what we'll point our customers to and our sales force to understand as these different things come up.\nRichard Newitter: Got it. And if I could just have one more follow-up on the capital environment and the discussions that you're having. As you talk to the institutions, as they think of the 2021 budgets. I'm curious, one, are they kind of thinking of a two-year budgeting process, or is it any different than the way they've approached their budgeting in the past in the wake of COVID? And then, maybe two, is the -- what signs are they saying they're going to look forward to kind of get back to you to have confidence to go and make the purchase with the uncertainty that still exists? Thanks.\nGary Guthart: Marshall, why don't you kick off that answer, and I'll add a little when you're done.\nMarshall Mohr: Yes. I think the first part of your question, what are they doing from a budget perspective? I don't have enough insight to be able to answer the question well. We said that we believe that they'll go through a reset of course for 2021. I don't know if they'll have the same level of spending they did. We believe that there is financial pressure on the hospitals -- on a number of the hospitals as a result of COVID. So, there's the possibility that 2021 budgets will be less -- will be smaller than they were in 2020. But, I don't have great insight to that.\nGary Guthart: Yes. I think, the thing I would point to that I think is kind of a economics question for everybody is just going to be something to look at is they will make their estimates as to how fast folks will return and whether they want to accelerate, so that they have capacity available for dealing with the backlog. I think that that will differ by hospital groups. So, some folks will have the capital capacity to lean in and see this as an opportunity to deepen their exposure or their presence in market. Others will feel conservative and will want to wait and see. So, I do not think it's going to be one size fits all in terms of how they do their financial planning. That was our last question. So, I'll conclude from here. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim, better more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking to you again in three months.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the presentation for this afternoon. Again, we thank you very much for all of your participation and for using our teleconferencing services.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gary Guthart",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today. Our fourth quarter capped the year in which the pandemic challenged our customers and our business. It highlighted some core strengths for the company, introduced some obstacles to overcome and triggered some changes for us. To put the year and quarter in context, let me first review some of the numbers. Procedures grew 6% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 1% for the full-year over 2019, resulting in approximately 1.25 million procedures in 2020. We placed 326 systems in the quarter, down from 336 systems in Q4 of 2019. For the full-year, we placed 936 systems in 2020, down from 1,119 systems in 2019. Finally, revenue fell 3% in 2020 as the result of delays in surgical procedures, as hospitals focused on treating COVID patients. Digging a little deeper, our core business remains healthy. After the first surge of COVID abated during this past summer, our customers returned to more routine use of our systems and solutions. We believe that the Intuitive ecosystem enabled increased access to and practice of high-quality minimally invasive surgery, which may have helped hospitals conserve valuable intensive care resources during the pandemic. Despite pressure on utilization of our systems due to COVID, our hospital customers continued to invest in building their Intuitive's robotics programs with additional systems, evidenced by a 7% increase in the clinical installed base in 2020. We saw committed customers strengthening their programs, likely due to their analysis of how well the Intuitive ecosystem satisfied their quadruple aim objectives, better outcomes, better care team experiences, better patient experiences, and lower total cost to treat per patient episode. Lastly, we believe our investments in our analytics programs have helped customers routinely analyze their performance, supporting their programmatic insights in the year. Our confidence in our core business and our long-term opportunity remains robust, in spite of near-term uncertainty, which is as follows. First, the pandemic is resurgent in many regions, powered now by more contagious variants. While hospitals have better protocols to manage patients today than they did earlier in 2020, our weekly surgical data in December 2020 and continuing today shows another clamp down on surgeries. Furthermore, we believe diagnostic procedures are slowing in hard hit regions. With diagnostic procedures running significantly below pre-pandemic levels, patients and hospitals will acutely feel the impact through disease progression and the more complex therapies necessary when patients do return for care. This delay in diagnostic pipelines will likely take several quarters to resolve, even after the threat of COVID begins to abate. Second, we know that future of new capital installs are highly sensitive to utilization rates. Delayed surgeries will also impact the growth of surgical departments, pressuring new system installs until excess capacity is consumed. Third, in countries where the government pays the healthcare bill, budget strain and economic fallout from COVID may impact health care spending in new and variable ways in different countries. Lastly, the trend that started prior to the pandemic for increased data requirements and longer clearance time lines from regulators in the United States and Europe for our industry has continued this year. Taken together, these obstacles make predictions for the next several quarters difficult. As I mentioned earlier, 2020 has broadly eliminated some longer-term trends in health-care that validate our thesis. The increased pressure on healthcare systems to conserve acute care resources for the sickest patients may have accelerated investments that enable patients to get the care they need with fast recovery, minimizing consumption of scarce hospital resources and reducing complications. The compounding value of analyzing real-time data and offline healthcare data to drive insights, to drive better care has become obvious this year. Lastly, we saw an acceleration of remote technology used to enable proctoring, learning and analysis. I've heard it said that in good times, we develop ourselves to become who we want to be while hard times reveal who we really are. In the year, we set our priorities based on our values. We implemented community relief and customer relief, launched our Extended Use Instruments program, mobilized local and remote training resources to support customers differently and continued to listen carefully to our customers to best understand their needs. We've seen positive customer response to this approach, which is reflected in our Net Promoter Score. You can find more information on these scores in our JPMorgan Healthcare Conference presentation from this month, posted on our website. Over the past several years, we've been building our capabilities in different countries to better serve their healthcare systems. I'd like to take a moment to take you through how we performed outside the United States in the year. Turning first to Asia. Our business in Japan is moving beyond urology, given reimbursements for a broad slate of procedures obtained in Japan in 2018 and 2020. Government hospitals in Japan have been conserving resources for COVID care and the pandemic has introduced noticeable delays as the healthcare system reacts to outbreaks. In Korea, our business continues to be dynamic with an innovation-oriented customer group adopting new products like our da Vinci SP. In China, we saw accelerated customer acceptance of our partnership with Fosun Pharma and our products, with growth in procedures and the business overall outpacing our pre-pandemic plans. In 2020, China emerged as our number two procedure market. Turning to Europe. Our team in Germany has had success in engaging larger German hospital groups with increased system placements broadening our market access. Constraints on elective surgery have been implemented assertively in Germany in light of COVID. In Germany, France, UK, Italy and the Nordics, our goals have been to broaden da Vinci use beyond urology. Progress therein has been hampered significantly by COVID. Lastly, we see relatively low public sector reimbursements in Europe for benign procedures. Innovations from Intuitive like da Vinci S and our Extended Use Instruments are providing an option for more price sensitive customers in these markets. With regard to our innovation and product engines, we spent time walking through our progress at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference this month and our presentation is available online at our website, intuitive.com. I'd recommend to the interested listener a review of those materials for greater insight into our progress. Summarizing briefly here, we're making good progress in advancing many elements of our ecosystem, including our advanced instruments, deepening our imaging and informatics programs, including our augmented reality program, Iris, and extending the launches of our new platforms. We grew the installed base in procedures for our single port platform, da Vinci SP. We're focused on advancing clinical indications for SP in several regions, as well as extending its instrument and accessory portfolio. For our flexible robotics platform, Ion, we saw strong clinical results and demand in the year, but met manufacturing and supply performance challenges in the fourth quarter as catheter demand outpaced our forecasting models and the need for important quality improvement implementations and COVID quarantines hampered our production. We are currently shipping Ion product and expect to meet the demand curve in the first-half of 2021. Before Marshall takes you through our finances in detail, I'd like to touch on our financial strategy. Our operating model withstood the strains of 2020 well, starting with our decision several years ago to shift to greater flexibility in system placement models, the incorporation of sales, leasing and risk-shared models allowed us to meet customers' needs during a disruptive time. Our investments in advanced instruments, including stapling and energy have been fruitful with growing revenues, improving margins and growing customer appreciation for advanced instruments. We've been investing capital in our manufacturing methods to increase quality and lower our costs, which in turn has allowed us to extend savings to our customers to allow them greater flexibility and deploying our products in more cost-sensitive environments. This has triggered a virtuous cycle that allows us greater volume, which in turn gives us greater ability to invest in higher-volume processes. We'll continue to invest in this cycle going forward. We believe we are still in the early innings of a long opportunity to substantially improve the quadruple aim and acute medical interventions using robotics, computing, advanced imaging and informatics. As a result, we continue to invest in our innovation engines to create and pursue these opportunities. In closing, our priorities for 2021 are as follows. First, we'll support our customers' recovery of surgery during and post pandemic. Second, we'll focus on outstanding regional performance. Third, we'll advance our priority programs and launches, SP, Ion, imaging and analytics, including new indications. And finally, continued expansion of clinical, economic and analytical evidence base for key procedures and countries. I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will take you through financial matters in greater detail. Why don't I jump in, Marshall, and then, I'll kick it back to you? Amit, thanks for the question. We were talking about earlier in the month here. We think there's some budget flushing that happened at the end of 2020. How strong that will be into 2021? Did they pull forward spending that would otherwise normally have been in 2021? Hard to say. Having said that, if you look at where we were winning relative to other priorities, even if there is some budget pull forward, large customers were -- that already had robotics programs were expressing confidence with us, which we think is a positive. The caution we're sending you now in this call is just that over time, there'll be an equilibration, which is there is some excess capacity in the field because COVID is suppressing procedures. And at some point, COVID will lift, and that capacity will be absorbed. Some folks will invest ahead, getting ready and being able to work on backlog and others will be conservative and wait till they consume that capacity. Forecasting that is hard. And so, that's how we're trying to help you navigate through this. But Marshall, please clean up anything that you need to do in that answer. Yes. Thanks for the question. When we're talking about what we shared with you in the talk at JPMorgan, most of that is programmatic analysis. And it's not so much something that we think is going to be revenue-generating directly. We think that it illuminates the value of our ecosystem and strong da Vinci programs. And that is a benefit to us. It increases the stick rate, allows people to see in a verifiable way within their own data sets, the value they're bringing. It gives them action plans to find opportunity for standardization and other kinds of efficiency improvements. So, it's of high value to the customer and high value to us. Some of the other things that we've shared with you, for example, Iris, those things are something that we'll collect revenue for. They probably won't become huge revenue arms in and of themselves, but they bring value on a per case basis. And it's something that we can talk to the customer about in terms of value creation there. They also strengthen the ecosystem. So, I think for shareholders who are asking the question, \u201cHey, when does informatics and machine learning create a revenue arm of its own?\u201d I'm not sure that's the right question. I think that analytics and informatics power the ecosystem as a whole. We're pretty agnostic as to how we get paid for that. If we get paid for that through increased utilization, wonderful. That works great. We look at cost to develop those programs and kind of overall their contribution to our financial health. But we don't have to charge for them individually if that's not how a customer wants to pay for it. Let me turn it to you, Marshall, and any color you want to add. Thanks, Amit. Q1 volume update. Hey Bob. On the first one, the U.S., I won't predict for you, but let's talk about the puts and the takes, the things that are going to be the push-pull about it. Clearly, hospitals want to get back to treating patients who are non-COVID patients. There is a demand and the desire to do that. It takes a couple of things. One is that resources get freed up from treating COVID patients to allow them to treat other things, and some of that is ICU resources and a lot of it is staff. So, as COVID surges go, so does access to that set of resources. Your tracking and analysis is as good as ours in terms of looking at how well the vaccine is going to go out and what the COVID numbers might be. So, I think, that's a large part of it. In terms of the diagnostic pipelines, kind of the same thing. I think, everybody wants to get patients back in to get diagnosed. We think backlog that's been building for surgical patients as the search happens, and then you have this longer been forgoing normal checkups, whether it's colonoscopies or PSA screening or what have you, that will start coming back in. And of course, disease doesn't take a holiday. And as a result, those things will be more advanced when they're caught. We've seen this before. We've been in this movie when we saw changes to PSA testing recommendations. That will again create a backlog, but it will take longer for it to realize and longer for it to process through. I don't think it's going to drive substantive share shifts between treatment modalities. I think, it's going to be hard on patients as they go through that. And that will provide a headwind for us in -- certainly in 2021 and then tailwinds thereafter as those folks are diagnosed and come back into the pipe. So, that's kind of where I see the U.S. Moving to China, long term, we're quite excited. Pretty clearly, Chinese patients are interested in high quality care. Chinese surgeons are quite interested in robotics and in da Vinci and our partnership with Fosun and the joint venture is going well for us. So, in the near term, that feels great, and I think, there's a lot of strong underlying. As we've talked about before, the medical marketplace in China is complicated. Right now, systems are under quota, centrally managed quota. We see changes occurring in the Chinese regulatory environment over time as the FDA implements new policies and processes and we see that there are Chinese companies that are interested in this opportunity are pushing hard to field competitive systems. So, we are committed long-term to China. I think, it's going to be a strong demand market and a bouncy, sometimes turbulent marketplace due to policy changes and some of the central controls that are in place. We'll keep you updated as we get more clarity there. All right. Thanks, Larry. Philip, I'm going to turn to you on PRECISE trial timing. And then, I'll take it from there. With regard to future indications, right now, where we're at with Ion, we are -- our commercial teams and our manufacturing operations teams are tightly focused on supplying and performing in the diagnostic bronchoscopy market, our first indication. Clearly, Ion is a platform technology, and we're excited about it. That said, I'd remind everybody, we are in early innings, all of us, the entire field is in early innings with regard to bronchoscopy. Our clinical results there are outstanding. I think that they are market-leading relative to competitors, any of the competitors. And we want to fulfill that market. We want to satisfy those customers. That means satisfying them in terms of quality and demand and shipments and so on. We think there are longer term applications beyond bronchoscopy and beyond diagnostics, and we're working on those. We are working on ablation technologies and some other things. We're not ready to speak publicly about where we might go next for a couple of reasons. One is, we're still in the very earliest innings about making bronchoscopy a reality; and two, for competitive reasons, we're not ready yet to describe what we intend to do next. On the China front, we of course have the joint venture with Fosun. We are working through pathways for Ion in China. We think there is a market there. I would advise folks that the Chinese regulatory system and CFDA handles gen 1 products pretty differently than FDA does in the U.S. And as a result, you want to see a little greater maturity in your product line before you go broadly there. So, we're working through that with our JV and also with the Chinese regulators. When we have some time lines for you, we will describe them. But, we remain active and interested. I believe so. Now, this is -- the right answer is we'll see. Time will tell. But, there are some encouraging anecdotes and they're anecdotes. One is, I think folks are realizing that a lot can get done without jumping on planes and that's true for surgeons. And one of the things that our teams have done beautifully this year is to more fully digitize and regionalize training. That has been great. So, forward deployment of training and greater use of digital tools, that will continue, and I think the acceptance of that is increasing. It's also accelerated remote proctoring, as you said. So, I think that has been a positive for us and something that we had thankfully made some investments in prior to the pandemic. The second part is I think that people are seeing changes in resource consumption, days in the hospital, ICU time, patient comforted, being housed in hospitals in the pandemic, has declined. And I think that will be durable. I think, even after COVID rates start to drop, I think folks thinking that sitting around a hospital isn't a great idea, and using ICU resources when you don't have to isn't a great idea. And I already, I think we see that folks are saying, hey, really high-quality minimally invasive surgery done well. And by the way, having the analytics to back that up is going to be appreciated and maybe an accelerant. So, I am cautiously optimistic that some of the trends we're seeing in terms of what recovery might be are going to be real positive for Intuitive. Yes. I think we're starting to see the contours of the regulation side in the U.S. stabilize. So, it's stabilizing at a requirement level that's greater than it was in years past, but I don't think it's continuously moving. That's been good. I think, the thing that's challenged some time lines for us and others is COVID. If your clinical trial sites are having to manage COVID as well as whatever your clinical trial is, that can put pressure on you. That's kind of a near term thing. I think, longer term, the question of what does this do if clinical trial requirements and general data requirements in the U.S. and Europe for computer aided systems and robotics have become greater, what does that imply? And it probably implies a couple of things. One is that systems in the market are likely to stay in the market a little longer because it's just extended time lines for innovation. I think, the other thing is that it probably resequences when you see different products where in the world because some health care systems, Korea being notable, are allowing innovative products into their systems a little more quickly and other ones are becoming a little less. So, for a Company like us, you'll see increased investment in headcount and in resources for clinical and regulatory staff, and you'll see a reordering of where we go with new innovations over time. You'll probably see for the industry platforms sit a little longer that probably benefits incumbents a little more than it does in surgeons. Marshall, why don't you take that first? Sure. Just on the -- just speaking to the international side, the first thing I'd remind everybody is it's not really a robot versus robot question for customers. It's really a robotically-enabled ecosystem that drives outcomes versus a robotically-enabled ecosystem that drives different outcomes. That is programmatic versus programmatic. So, each of these, when they come out, we kind of look at it and say, okay, what's the robot capable of, do they have the instruments and the accessories, the imaging systems, the advanced tools that are required, some of those software and analytic capabilities, training capabilities and so on? And you see a pretty different skill set and capability out of each of these ecosystems. And that's true as well for some of the bigger competitors that are domestic. So, that's how we think about it. And I think that's how customers, by and large, will think about it. There will always be some customers who are interested in trialing and seeing what's capable out of something new, so I'd expect that. Nothing architecturally that I've seen of any of them, including the most recent announcements, has surprised me. I think we've seen a lot of these ideas. We've trialed personally a lot of them inside the Company. And so I think time will tell. We have made the trade-offs we've made for a reason based on evaluation, building product and kind of scientific method. And I think that customers will evaluate those trade-offs over time. We've also seen the idea that some of the bigger players want to bundle, that they're going to put all these things together, maybe lower the price of capital and try to throw some other things in to see if they can entice folks. And I think the way I'd ask customers and shareholders to think about it is bundling makes sense if the underlying products are commodities, if everybody is selling two ply toilet paper and one brand is not that different than the other, it's all fine. But that's not where we are. Robotic systems and the instrumentation and the imaging systems are not commoditized. And as a result, there'll be strong differences. and how they're used and what the outcomes are. And in that regard, I think that's what we'll point our customers to and our sales force to understand as these different things come up. Marshall, why don't you kick off that answer, and I'll add a little when you're done. Yes. I think, the thing I would point to that I think is kind of a economics question for everybody is just going to be something to look at is they will make their estimates as to how fast folks will return and whether they want to accelerate, so that they have capacity available for dealing with the backlog. I think that that will differ by hospital groups. So, some folks will have the capital capacity to lean in and see this as an opportunity to deepen their exposure or their presence in market. Others will feel conservative and will want to wait and see. So, I do not think it's going to be one size fits all in terms of how they do their financial planning. That was our last question. So, I'll conclude from here. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim, better more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking to you again in three months."

            "content": "Good afternoon. I'll describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Revenue and procedures are consistent with our preliminary press release of January 13th. Key business metrics for the fourth quarter were as follows. Fourth quarter 2020 procedures increased approximately 6% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 and increased approximately 10% compared with last quarter. Fourth quarter system placements of 326 systems decreased 3% compared with 336 systems last year and increased 67% compared with 195 systems last quarter. We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems over last year by 7% to approximately 5,989 systems. This growth rate compares with 8% in the last quarter and 12% last year. Utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, declined approximately 2% compared with last year and increased 8% compared with last quarter. The impact of COVID on da Vinci procedures varied by region. Resurgence of COVID in parts of Europe had significant impacts on procedures, including in Italy, UK, Nordics and France. While the impact of COVID on procedures in the Asia Pacific region, including China, Japan and Korea, was far less significant. In the U.S., fourth quarter procedure growth was impacted by the COVID's resurgence, resulting in 5% year-over-year growth compared to 7% growth in the third quarter. The resurgence in U.S. and Europe was more acute and had a greater impact on procedures late in the quarter, a trend that continued into January. The impact of a resurgence can be significant. For example, in California, the fourth quarter COVID resurgence turned a year-over-year da Vinci procedure growth in October of 8% to a year-over-year decline of 6% in December. We also believe that reduced diagnosis reflecting patient concern over COVID exposure has impacted certain procedures globally. This has had its most pronounced effect on prostatectomies. Despite the fact that hospitals are better equipped to handle COVID patients today compared to the outset of the pandemic, COVID-19 resurgences like those currently being experienced in parts of Europe and the U.S. have challenged hospital care capabilities and have negatively impacted da Vinci procedures. In addition, delays in diagnosis and treatment of underlying conditions will also continue to negatively impact da Vinci procedures. Uncertainties in this COVID environment are not predictable, and the vaccine rollout and its impact on controlling COVID spread is also not predictable. Given these uncertainties, we are not providing procedure guidance at this time. Philip will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call. Fourth quarter capital placements exceeded our expectations, reflecting several factors. In certain cases, hospitals exhausted 2020 budgets and spend capacities. And in some cases, hospitals purchased systems in preparation for post-pandemic environment. We also experienced a higher level of trade-ins of SI systems for fourth generation systems, reflecting hospital desire to standardize their fleet and to avail themselves to fourth generation technology and lower cost Extended Use Instruments. Looking forward, we see the following capital revenue headwinds. Utilization declined 2% year-over-year, resulting in excess system capacity at hospitals. We expect customers to fill existing system capacity before purchasing additional capital. Some of the fourth quarter capital placements reflected hospitals exhausting 2020 budgets. As budgets reset for 2021, hospitals could reduce their capital spend, particularly as COVID strains hospital profitability. We expect leasing to continue to increase as a percentage of overall placements. Macroeconomic conditions created by COVID could also impact hospital capital spending. And as we face competition in various markets, we may experience longer selling cycles and price pressures. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. Total fourth quarter revenue was $1,329 million, representing a 4% increase from last year and a 23% increase from last quarter. Fourth quarter revenue benefited from U.S. customer stocking of Extended Use Instruments and higher than expected system placements. Leasing represented 37% of current quarter placements compared with 35% last quarter. Fourth quarter placements included some larger IDN transactions where the IDN prefers purchase transactions. Excluding those transactions, leasing as a percentage of total placements would have been several percentage points higher. In an environment of COVID-19 as economic pressures increase, we anticipate more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than reflected in historical run rates. Approximately half of the systems placed in the fourth quarter involve trade-ins, which is higher than the 40% last quarter and higher than the average over the last couple of years. Trade-in activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict. Fourth quarter average selling prices declined to $1.43 million from $1.61 million last year and $1.55 million in the third quarter. The decrease relative to last year reflects a lower mix of systems placed in China and Japan and a higher proportion of trade transactions. The decrease relative to last quarter reflects a higher proportion of trade-in transactions and a higher mix of indirect market placements. We recognized $14 million of lease buyout revenue in the fourth quarter compared with $17 million last quarter and $34 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure increased to approximately $2,060 per procedure compared with $1,910 per procedure in the third quarter of 2020 and $1,980 realized in the fourth quarter of last year. The entirety of the increase compared to the third quarter reflects U.S. hospital stocking Extended Use Instruments. We launched Extended Use Instruments early in the quarter in the U.S. and mid-quarter in Europe. We will launch Extended Use Instruments in other markets in 2021 and 2022, depending on regulatory requirements. Going forward, we expect customers to adjust their instrument buying patterns and reduce their inventory levels to reflect the additional uses per instrument. In addition, Extended Use Instruments and lower instrument pricing will result in lower I&A revenue per procedure to Intuitive. The impact and timing of customer buying patterns and lower per use revenue will likely begin to impact revenues in the first quarter, but will depend on customer inventory practices and procedure volumes. While we expect price elasticity associated with Extended Use Instruments to enable greater penetration into available markets, that benefit will be delayed by COVID and otherwise will take time. 12 of the systems placed in the fourth quarter were SP systems, reflecting continued measured rollout of SP and the impact of COVID-19. Our installed base of SP systems is now 69, 8 in Korea and 61 in the U.S. Our rollout of the SP surgical system will continue to be measured, putting systems in the hands of experienced da Vinci users, while we pursue additional indications and optimize training pathways in our supply chain. We expect to initiate first cases associated with a U.S. colorectal clinical trial this quarter. We placed four Ion systems in the quarter, bringing the installed base to 36 systems. Ion system placements and procedures are excluded from our overall system and procedure counts. Ion system placements were affected by supply chain issues described by Gary earlier in the call. We expect to remediate these supply issues in the first half of 2021. Our rollout of Ion will continue to be measured while we optimize training pathways in our supply chain. Procedures under the PRECISE study are expected to complete in the second quarter of 2021. Outside the U.S., we placed 130 systems in the fourth quarter compared with 140 in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 79 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 54 into Europe, 22 into Japan and 13 into China compared with 54 into Europe, 26 into Japan and 39 into China in the fourth quarter of 2019. System placements into China in the fourth quarter of 2019 were higher as hospitals accelerated tenders in anticipation of the possibility of higher tariffs. Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 69.7% compared with 72.2% for the fourth quarter of 2019 and 70.2% last quarter. The fourth quarter of 2020 included higher period costs associated with lower production and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges. The decrease relative to the fourth quarter of 2019 reflects higher period costs associated with lower production, higher excess and obsolete inventory charges and lower system ASPs. As revenues are pressured by COVID-19, production levels may operate at below normal levels, which may result in higher labor costs and under-absorbed overhead and reduced product margins. In addition, product and customer mix fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and could cause fluctuations in gross margins. Pro forma operating expenses decreased 6% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 and increased 11% compared with the third quarter of 2020. The fourth quarter of 2020 includes a $25 million contribution to the Intuitive Foundation compared with a $5 million contribution in the fourth quarter of 2019 and no contribution last quarter. Fourth quarter operating expenses continued to reflect reduced spending on activities directly impacted by COVID-19, including marketing events, travel and in-person training as well as lower variable compensation. These costs will naturally increase as the impact of COVID declines. We continue to believe we have a unique opportunity to extend the benefits of computer-aided surgery and acute interventions around the world, and we'll continue to invest in the business for the long term. During this period of COVID, we continue to invest in product development activities, including informatics, advanced imaging, advanced instruments and our Ion and SP platforms. Accordingly, you should expect the growth rate of R&D expenses in 2021 to significantly exceed the 2020 growth rate. We expect the growth rate of SG&A expenses to also increase significantly in 2021 compared to 2020. SG&A spending can be categorized as follows. Investments in OUS markets will increase over 2020 spend as we expand our capabilities and investment in clinical data. Variable compensation will increase over 2020 as we reset goals and targets. Core spending on resources and infrastructure will increase over 2020 to prepare for a post-COVID environment. Spend on activities impacted by COVID, like travel, marketing events and in-person training will increase as the impact of COVID declines. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 20.7% compared with our expectations of 20% to 21%, primarily reflecting the geographic mix of income. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of onetime items. Our fourth quarter 2020 pro forma net income was $436 million or $3.58 per share compared with $426 million or $3.48 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019 and $341 million or $2.77 per share for last quarter. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $364 million or $3.02 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with GAAP net income of $363 million or $2.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019 and GAAP net income of $317 million or $2.60 per share for last quarter. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation and IP charges, amortization of intangibles, and acquisition-related items and legal settlements. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter and third quarters of 2020 also included pretax gains of $4.7 million and $61.7 million on our investments in private entities, resulting from our purchases of certain technologies. The EPS impact of these gains net of tax was $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.39 per share in the third quarter. These gains are excluded from our pro forma results. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $6.9 billion compared with $6.4 billion at September 30, 2020 and $5.8 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in cash in the fourth quarter reflected cash from operations, a reduction in inventory and overall working capital and stock exercises. We repurchased $34 million of shares in the quarter with an average price of -- at an average price of $661.10 per share. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Philip, who will go over our procedure performance. Yes. I think I just -- go ahead. No, you hit it perfectly. No, I think, that's right. I think that we look at it as the opportunity to increase the ecosystem and to expand our base and/or accelerate adoption. It's a good question. And I am empathetic to the fact that we aren't giving you revenue guidance. And so, it's hard to put those numbers in context. However, it really does come down to that -- the impacts of COVID are really pretty unpredictable. And so, if COVID wanes quickly, then I think the spend we're talking about might match up better with the revenue increase. But I got to tell you, the point of my -- the reason I pointed this all out in terms of the increases in expenses that we were able -- this year, we saw a long period where COVID impacted us. And we -- some of the variable expenses I outlined, came in pretty low relative to what they historically had been. And those will increase as COVID goes away. But in addition to that, there are other expenses that we will continue to spend. The increase -- there will be increases regardless of what happens to COVID. I think, we want to continue to invest in the R&D areas that I mentioned. And we want to -- because we see that there's a real opportunity to continue to expand our marketplace and to expand penetration in the long-term. And so, we're going to increase those costs. I know I haven't given you what you're looking for, but it's just a very difficult environment to predict revenue and procedures at this point. Yes. So, your -- the first part of your question was... Yes, Q1 volume. I made the comment that as we went through the quarter, the resurgence became more acute and it had a greater impact on procedures. And so I gave you the California example of where you go from growth in October to reduction in December. That should be an indication of the level of sort of impact they can have. And then, I also made the comment that we saw the trends at the end of the quarter continue into January. So, I think you said that other companies are saying that Q1 could be worse, it could be. But again, we're not going to try to predict exactly where it's going to come out, given the uncertainties around it. But it's clear coming into the quarter, it was at the bottom end of what was going on in Q4. As far as Extended Use Instruments go, we launched it in the U.S. in -- at the beginning of the quarter and in Europe in the middle of the quarter, about three quarters of our customers are now acquiring Extended Use Instruments. They're starting to be used on procedures. It's really hard for us to predict exactly when we'll start to see the benefits of those Extended Use Instruments in terms of elasticity and price elasticity, and it's certainly going to be confounded by COVID. So, I think it will take time. I think it's going to take a while before we start to see that. Sometimes you have to point out the benefits to the hospital. You have to sell it a little bit. And I just think we'll be patient about it. Sure. The rollout into other parts of the world will depend on the regulatory time lines. As you could imagine, in China, it will take a long time. In some of the other markets, it might be a little bit quicker. I don't have a complete roadmap of every country. But yes, Asia Pac is absolutely on our mind. And we'd like to get them out to our direct markets in Asia as soon as possible. As far as the impact on elasticity, we did two things in the United States, if you recall. We modified the -- we obviously launched Extended Use Instruments, which lower the cost of care for hospitals, but we also -- simultaneous with that, lowered the price of a few select instruments that are used typically in lower benign -- lower acuity procedure -- or benign lower acuity procedures like cholecystectomy, benign hysterectomies and inguinal hernias. And then, in totality, then the use that -- if you look at an instrument, set that might be used in cholecystectomies, then the cost is competitive with other minimally invasive approaches. In each country, we have modified the pricing differently, and we're targeting those procedures that are pressured by reimbursement. So, you can't kind of paint or butter spread the comment of what elasticity will do in the United States will happen in the other countries. But, we are targeting specified procedures in each of those countries where reimbursement is stressed, and we believe we provide value. And we'll see. We believe that we'll create some elasticity in each country. It will just vary in terms of magnitude. Yes. I think the first part of your question, what are they doing from a budget perspective? I don't have enough insight to be able to answer the question well. We said that we believe that they'll go through a reset of course for 2021. I don't know if they'll have the same level of spending they did. We believe that there is financial pressure on the hospitals -- on a number of the hospitals as a result of COVID. So, there's the possibility that 2021 budgets will be less -- will be smaller than they were in 2020. But, I don't have great insight to that."

And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.\nGary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. Our third quarter was a productive one with return to growth and da Vinci procedure amid continuing adaptation to customer needs. In the field performance grew strongly by region, given differences in pandemic impact. Operational performance inside the company has been strong, with remarkable focus and diligence by our teams. Turning first to global procedures, Q3 2020 procedures grew 7% compared with Q3 2019. Procedure growth varied widely by country, with growth returning to most of the countries we serve with a direct commercial team. U.S. growth was in the mid-single digits and procedure growth in China\u2019s stood out is particularly strong. Analyzing current global quarterly procedure performance compared with Q3 2019 by clinical category, general surgery is rebounding most quickly, posting double-digit growth with mid single-digit growth in gynecology and modest growth in urology. Overall, we have seen utilization increasing for our customers as their resources become available, indicating that surgeons and hospitals are maintaining their commitment to minimally invasive surgery. da Vinci enables access to high quality minimally invasive care, increasing the number of patients who can return home sooner and decreasing the demand on ICU resources, clearly important in the era of COVID-19. Currently, two factors are at play at hospitals, as hospitals treat both COVID and non-COVID patients. First, there are some deferred cases that were scheduled in the spring and summer that have now come back to the hospital for treatment. Second, diagnostic procedures such as colonoscopies and PSA tests have been delayed and may not be back to pre-COVID levels now. The delay in diagnostic visits will delay disease detection and like prostate screening changes in 2012 create a reservoir of patients with more advanced disease. This push pull of those patients who delayed a scheduled surgery coming back into hospitals now and the delay of disease identification due to diagnostic visit postponement makes hospital patient volumes hard to model for coming quarters. That said, full diagnostic recovery is in everyone\u2019s interest and we expect surgery to return to pre-pandemic levels over the mid-term. Philip will take you through procedure trends later in the call. Given the slowdown in procedures due to the pandemic we expected weaker capital demand in the third quarter. For the quarter, we installed 195 new systems. This compares to 275 installs in Q3 2019 and 178 installs in Q2 2020. Year-over-year install base growth was 8% at the end of Q3 after accounting for trade-ins. We know the correlation between system utilization in the form of procedure demand and the need for new capital capacity at hospitals is strong. Many hospitals will seek to absorb existing capacity before installing new capital. In regions in which da Vinci systems are more common, hospitals may delay adding new systems until utilization recovers. Average globally we continue to expect a challenging near- to mid-term environment for future capital placements, as COVID-19 wears on and hospital finances remain strained. Because COVID is impacting locales differently, we see significant variability in procedure growth and new system placement pipelines by region. Marshall will take you through capital placement trends and risks later in the call. At Intuitive we are focused on those activities and priorities within our control. Our team in the field, in our labs, in our factories and working in homes and offices is performing well. We adapted our priorities for 2020 to meet the challenge of the pandemic and the needs of those we serve. First, we are focused on the health and well being of patients, customers, our employees and our communities. Second, we are focused on inventory and supply chain management. So far product availability has been very strong. Thanks to the relentless work of our supply chain teams and our partners. Third, we implemented our Customer Financial Relief Program and/or Extended Use Instruments Program. The timeliness and the design of these programs has been well received by our customers. Fourth, we continue to invest in our high priority development programs. Recognizing that high quality MIS is more important in the coming years not less so. If we are accelerating activities that help us adapt to the current environment and for which demand is likely to be durable post-COVID. Finally, we have constraints spend where we believe it is inefficient in the current environment. With these priorities as our guide, our operational and financial performance served both our customers and our company well in the quarter. Intuitive commercial and learning teams adjusted their work methods to meet customers where they are, figuratively and literally. Over the years our time -- our teams have built a strong network of capable field trainers, sales reps, surgeon proctors and cloud enabled da Vinci systems. Our professional education and commercial teams engage this network, implementing on-site digital and regional programs such that customer engagement and training programs are approaching pre-pandemic levels, a remarkable achievement. Across the company, our teams have prioritized their efforts and practice physical discipline. Based on quality and automation improvements and continued attention, our manufacturing teams are managing our product costs well, leading to strong gross margin performance, while we implemented our Customer Relief Program and our Extended Use Program for Generation 4 instruments. While the pandemic has created near- and mid-term uncertainty in the form of competing healthcare priorities and economic stresses, I have high confidence in the need for high quality, minimally invasive surgery and therapies in long-term. To deal with the current and future stresses on the healthcare system, payers, hospitals and surgeons are looking for solutions that improve outcomes, decrease in hospital resource consumption and lower total cost to treat. In other words, the core pillars of the quadruple aim we had set as our goal many years ago. We have a team that has demonstrated physical discipline, particularly in light of the pandemic. Over time, we plan to increase investment in our innovation engines to improve the quadruple aim at our customers and to expand our market opportunity. And we will continue to invest in our virtuous cycle of quality and efficiency gains in production, that fuel quality improvement, manufacturing cost reductions and pricing flexibility for our customers that can lead to increase volume. Looking at product operations in the quarter, our advanced instruments and endoscopy programs are producing strong clinical and financial results. Customer adoption of our stapler product line, our vessel sealers and our E-100 generator has been encouraging. Utilization of these products and their targeted clinical procedures and their reorder rates has been strong. Despite disruptions caused by COVID in 2020, uptake of newly launched products, as well as our newest endoscope, Endoscope Plus has also been strong. As we have said in the past, a great clinical procedure takes the customer, the right system, the right instruments, the right imaging, the right training and the right support. As our Generation 4 ecosystem has matured, customers achieve high utilization rates for our target procedures in Gen 4 accounts. Our Ion program continues to advance with 11 systems placed in the quarter, many of which are in large teaching institutions. Ion diagnostic procedures are also returning to significant growth. Early clinical studies comparing Ion to existing alternatives in the market, both handheld and robotic, are beginning to be published and are encouraging, supporting the architectural decisions made early by our design team. While our progress in our precise trial for Ion has been slowed, we are seeing a return to cases as our clinical trial partners come free. Lastly, our team continues to incorporate learnings from customers and improving our system, our manufacturing and our supply chain, as we have worked diligently to support Ion at greater scale. Turning to our SP system, its clinical evidence continues to mount and advocacy for the system by surgeons who use it is increasing, procedures on SP rebounded nicely in the third quarter. I am quite encouraged by the commentary from surgeons on the performance of the system and the potential for it to impact a wider variety of procedures over time. In the United States, we are pursuing expanded clinical indications in a number of areas with our colorectal IDE trials reading initiation. Our system in first clinical case sites are standing by to start the study pending feedback from FDA and barring additional headwinds from COVID-19. If these go to plan we expect first cases in Q4 of this year or Q1 of 2021. Our cloud simulation, intelligence and analytics programs are also performing well. We have accelerated our cloud and remote technology efforts this year, with use of our remote case observations and our network simulators ramping quickly. In the quarter, our network surgical simulators were used over 87,000 times, roughly doubling year-over-year. Our IRIS augmented reality program entered limited launch in Q4 of last year and has recovered well in Q3. Lastly, our customer analytics efforts have been well utilized by hospitals in 2020 and are scaling nicely. As we finalize our 2021 planning it\u2019s worth reflecting for a moment. The opportunity for improvement in acute interventions including surgery is a substantial and decade\u2019s long journey. The fourth quarter of 2020 will mark the 25th anniversary of the founding of Intuitive and the 21st year of clinical use. Looking back at what has been achieved and forward to the important work that remains to be done, we are committed both to our organic innovation and to expanding the universe of bright minds who can improve medicine with the types of science and technology got pioneered. To that end, we launched our Intuitive Ventures Group, a part of our futures initiatives, whose mission is to accelerate opportunities at the frontiers of medicine. Intuitive Ventures Group\u2019s first fund is $100 million dollars and our team is engaging globally with entrepreneurs, having funded some in the quarter. We look forward to seeing what solutions they bring to complex problems. In closing, our priorities for the next few quarters remain as follows. First, continued strong performance on customer, employee and community safety, while ensuring supply chain stability. Second, continued support of our customers adapted to their specific conditions. Well support them according to their needs. Third, advancing our priority programs, instruments, accessories, endoscopy systems and intelligence programs. And finally, disciplines spend management during this period of change. I will now turn the call over to Marshall, who will take you through financial matters in greater detail.\nMarshall Mohr: Good afternoon. I would describe the highlights of our performance on the non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Key business metrics for the third quarter were as follows. Third quarter 2020 procedures increased approximately 7% compared with the third quarter of 2019. It increased approximately 36% compared with last quarter. Third quarter placements of 195 systems decreased 29%, compared with 275 systems last year, it increased 10%, compared with 178 systems last quarter. We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems over the last year by 8% to approximately 5,865 systems. This growth rate compares with 9% in the last quarter and 13% last year. Utilization of clinical systems in the field measured by procedures per system declined approximately 2% compared with last year and increased 33% compared with last quarter. Let me walk you through the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on procedures and system placements and how it impacts our business. Overall, procedures recovered gradually during the quarter to around 90% of pre-COVID levels by the end of the quarter. However, the extent and pace of recover varied by market. In the U.S., reflect -- we reflected several underlying themes. We experienced broader adoption across multiple procedures led by general surgery. For example, we saw significant year-over-year bariatric procedure growth. Partially offsetting broader adoption is the impact of reduced diagnosis and treatment of conditions given patients concern over COVID exposure and regional COVID resurgences and regional that disrupt elective procedures. The reduction of diagnosis and treatment was the most -- was most pronounced in prostate cancer. Dynamics that affected the U.S. also affected our OUS markets. In summary, we saw higher procedure growth in markets where COVID spread is lower, like China and Japan, compared with markets where COVID impact is greater, like the U.K. and India. While total worldwide procedure rates have improved, it is possible that resurgences of COVID-19 like those currently being experienced in parts of Europe and the U.S. could negatively impact da Vinci procedures. In addition, delays in diagnosis and treatment of underlying conditions could also negatively impact da Vinci procedures. Philip will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call. Although capital placements were higher in the second quarter, third quarter placements reflected headwinds, we discussed last quarter, including hospitals filling existing system capacity before purchasing additional capital and delayed capital spending while hospitals revisit their capital budgets given the impacts of COVID-19. Utilization in the third quarter was 2% lower than the third quarter of 2019, while the second quarter 2020 utilization was 27% lower than the second quarter of 2019. Going forward, we expect these same headwinds to impact capital placements. In addition, macro economic conditions created by COVID could also impact hospital spending. And as we face competition in various markets, we may experience longer selling cycles and price pressures. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. Total third quarter revenue was $1,078 million, representing a 4.5% decrease from last year and a 26% increase from last quarter. Third quarter 2020 revenue reflects $23 million of service credits issued in relation to the previously announced Customer Relief Program where we provide service credits to customers as their use of da Vinci systems were lower than pre-COVID comp volumes. Total service credits issued under the Customer Relief Program which has now ended were $82 million. Leasing represented 35% of current quarter placements, compared with 29% last quarter. Second quarter placements included a higher proportion of China placements, where leasing is prohibited. Excluding China we saw increased demand for leasing structures. In an environment of COVID-19 and as economic pressures increase, we anticipate more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than reflected in historical run rates. 40% of systems placed in the third quarter involve trade-ins consistent with last quarter. Trade-in activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict. We recognize $17 million of lease buyout revenue in the third quarter, compared with $9 million last quarter and $20 million last year. Lease buyout revenue is varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure increased slightly to approximately $1,910 per procedure, compared with $1,900 per procedure in the second quarter of 2020 and decreased compared with $1,980 realized in the third quarter of last year. The decrease compared to last year reflects customer buying patterns partially offset by increased advanced instrument usage. In the third quarter of 2020, we did not experience reduced purchases of instruments that we anticipated in advance of the launch of Extended Use Instruments. In early October, we launched our Extended Use Instruments in the U.S. Extended Use Instruments have 12 to 18 uses, compared with our previous 10 use instruments. In addition, we are reducing the price of certain instruments used commonly in lower acuity procedures and our lower reimburse procedures. We plan to launch our Extended Use Instruments later in the fourth quarter in Europe and in 2021 and 2022 in other markets depending on regulatory requirements. Overall, Extended Use Instruments and lower instrument pricing will result in lower INA revenue per procedure to Intuitive. For example, had the Extended Use Instruments been available and the lower instrument pricing been in place for all of 2019, revenue for 2019 would have been $150 million to $170 million less than reported and INA per procedure would have been 7% lower. The impact of these actions on future revenue will depend on procedure volumes, instrument usage and mix, and whether cost elasticity will enable greater penetration into available markets. Beginning in the fourth quarter with the introduction of Extended Use Instruments, we expect that INA revenue and revenue per procedure will be lower than it otherwise would have been. Six of the systems placed in the third quarter were SP systems reflecting both our measured rollout of SP and the continued impact of COVID-19. Our installed base of SP systems is now 58, eight in Korea and 50 in the U.S. Our rollout of the SP surgical system will continue to be measured, putting systems in the hands of experienced da Vinci users, while we pursue additional indications and optimize training pathways in our supply chain. As Gary outlined, we expect to initiate first cases associated with colorectal clinical trial by the first quarter of 2021. We placed 11th Ion systems in the quarter, bringing the installed base to 32 systems. Ion system placements also continue to be impacted by COVID-19. Ion system placements, procedures and related information is excluded from our overall systems and procedure counts. Our rollout of Ion will continue to be measured, while we optimize training pathways and our supply chain. Procedures under the precise study are being completed at a slower pace than anticipated due to COVID-19. Based on the current pace of procedures we expect the precise study to complete in the second quarter of 2021. Outside the U.S., we placed 79 systems in the third quarter, compared with 90 in the third quarter of 2019 and 72 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 39 into Europe, 15 into Japan and 12 into China, compared with 36 into Europe, 27 into Japan and 10 into China in the third quarter of 2019. During the third quarter, MOH in China expanded the previous 154 system quota for the period 2016 through 2020 to 225 systems. The timeline for purchasing the 125 systems remaining under the expanded quota is the same as the original quota, which is the hospital\u2019s allocated quota by December 31, 2020, have two years to complete their tenders. We expect more of their remaining systems to be completed towards the end of the two-year period and only approximately a dozen systems to be placed in the fourth quarter of 2020. We also anticipate other companies to achieve regulatory approval over the next year or so. If approved, those competitors will share in the remaining quota. Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses, pro forma margin -- gross margin for the third quarter of 2020 was 70.2%, compared with 72% for the third quarter of 2019 and 62.4% last quarter. The second quarter of 2020 included higher period costs associated with abnormally low production, higher impact of the Customer Relief Program and higher excess in obsolete inventory charges. The decrease relative to the third quarter of 2019 reflects higher period costs associated with abnormally low production, the Customer Relief Program, partially offset by product mix. As revenues are pressured by COVID-19, production levels may operate at below normal levels, which may result in higher labor costs and under absorbed overhead and reduced product margins. In addition, product and customer mix fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and could cause fluctuation in gross margins. Pro forma operating expenses increased 1% compared with the third quarter of 2019 and increased around 5% compared with last quarter. The increase in third quarter operating expenses compared with the third quarter of 2019 is driven by higher investments in product development activities including informatics, advanced imaging in our Ion and SP platforms, and investment in headcounts and capabilities in OUS markets. This was partially offset by reduced spending on activities directly impacted by COVID-19, including marketing events, travel and training and reduce spending, reflecting continued discipline throughout the organization. Relative to last quarter, spending reflects increase -- increases in training and travel, increased spending on product development areas outlined and partially offset by reduced spending. We continue to believe that we have a unique opportunity to expand the benefits of computer aided surgery and acute interventions around the world and we will continue to invest in the business for the long-term. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 19.8%, compared with our expectations of 20% to 21%. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of one-time items. Our third quarter 2020 pro forma net income was $334 million or $2.77 per share, compared with $409 million or $3.43 per share for the third quarter of 2019 and $132 million or $1.11 per share for last quarter. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $314 million or $2.60 per share for the third quarter of 2020, compared with GAAP net income of $396 million or $3.33 per share for the third quarter of 2019 and GAAP net income of $68 million or $0.57 per share for last quarter. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website. It includes excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation and IP charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition related items, and legal settlements. Third quarter of 2020 GAAP net income also included pretax gains of $62 million on our investments in private entities resulting from purchases of certain technologies. The EPS impact of these gains net of tax is $0.39 per share. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $6.4 million, compared with $6.1, sorry, $6.4 billion, compared with $6.1 billion at June 30, 2020. Cash generated from operations and stock exercises was partially offset by investments in working capital and our infrastructure. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. Our current thoughts on capital deployment are in the following order. We recognize the hardship that COVID-19 places on our customers and we will work with customers to ease the burden of lower da Vinci utilization, including providing customers with more flexible financing. We will ensure a secure supply chain and build appropriate levels of inventory to ensure customer supply. We will invest in securing our employees. We will continue to reinvest in the business focused on expanding our market opportunity or accelerating adoption of our products. We will continue to open market repurchase program consistent with our prior practice. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Philip, who will go over procedure performance.\nPhilip Kim: Thank you, Marshall. Our overall third quarter procedure growth was 7%, compared to 20% growth during the third quarter of 2019 and the 19% decline last quarter. Our Q3 procedure growth was driven by 7% growth in the U.S. and 9% growth OUS. U.S. general surgery and China were key drivers of procedure growth in Q3. In the U.S. Q3 procedure growth was largely driven by strength in general surgery, hernia, coli and bariatric were the largest drivers of growth within general surgery in the quarter. Bariatric procedures have been an increased area of focus in 2020 and may also have benefited from certain patients prioritizing weight loss as obesity is a significant COVID risk factor. In China, procedure growth accelerated meaningfully as new systems installed under the quota began to provide additional capacity for incremental growth. Q3 China procedure growth was strong with broad based growth in urology, thoracic, general surgery and gynecology. With respect to our more mature procedure categories in the U.S., Q3 gynecology procedure growth was up low-single digits year-over-year with hysterectomy for cancer volumes growing mid-single digits. Q3 dVH-benign procedures were up modestly year-over-year. In the U.S., dVP procedures in the third quarter declined high-single digits in the quarter compared to a year ago. We believe a constricted diagnostic pipeline may be impacting dVP volumes as patients may be postponing cancer screening procedures during the pandemic. On a worldwide basis, dVP procedures in the third quarter declined mid-single digits compared to a year ago. We do not have visibility as to when the diagnostic pipeline returns. Certain states that saw increased COVID cases had lower growth rates. At the end of Q2 procedure volumes in these states slowed and gradually recovered later in the third quarter. We would caution investors that our visibility of COVID outbreaks is limited and that procedure volumes may fluctuate when certain geographies face an uptick in COVID. Third quarter OUS procedure volume grew 9%, compared to 23% growth for the third quarter of 2019. Third quarter OUS growth was driven by continued growth in urology, thoracic, general surgery and gynecology. In Japan, procedure growth moderated versus Q2 due to a slowdown in dVP. Overall, European procedures grew modestly in Q3 as countries recovered from COVID. In Q3, Germany, France and Italy contributed to year-over-year growth, while the U.K. declined. However, we would caution that as COVID surges occur in different countries, procedures can be impacted adversely. It is important to note that we do not have guidance and Q3 trends may not be indicative of future results due to potential COVID surges, patients willingness to have procedures done and a restricted diagnostic pipeline. Now turning to the clinical side of our business, each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deemed to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. Early this year an article led by Dr. Melissa LaPinska from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in the Journal of Surgical Endoscopy provided results from one of the largest matched case series analysis for non-complex ventral hernia repair based on real world evidence utilizing the abdominal core Health Quality Collaborative. The study compared 1,230 subjects undergoing either robotic assisted or laparoscopic non-complex ventral hernia repair. In a propensity score matched analysis with 615 subjects in each cohort, the robotic assisted approach had a shorter mean length of stay by two days, a lower rate of conversion by over 1%, a lower rate of clinic re-encounters through 30 days by 6% and a lower rate of surgical site occurrences or infections requiring treatments by 2.4%. In article with Dr. Ravi Rajaram, David Rice and Eduardo Bruera from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in the Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery provided results from a real world evidence analysis using the premier hospital database from lobectomy. This study included patients who underwent an elective lobectomy for primary lung cancer between January 1, 2013 and September 30, 2015, with the objective to compare post-operative inpatient opioid administration after robotic-assisted lobectomy compared to open and video assisted thoracoscopic surgery approaches. In a propensity score matched analysis with over 2,000 subjects in each cohort, robotic-assisted lobectomy patients use a lower total opioid dose and lower average daily dose assess through the median morphine equivalent daily dosage, compared to patients undergoing either an open or VATS approach from post-operative day one until discharge. In both comparisons over the same period, open lobectomy and VATS patients were more likely to be administered opioids compared to those undergoing a robotic-assisted procedure, 7.6% fewer robotic-assisted patients when compared to open and 2.6% fewer robotic-assisted patients when compared to VATS. The authors concluded in this study of patients with lung cancer undergoing lobectomy use of a robotic-assisted approach with associated with less opioid administration and the inpatient post-operative period compared to either VATS or lobectomy.  That includes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTycho Peterson: Hey. Good afternoon. I will start with the procedures here. You were growing 8% exiting June, and obviously, there\u2019s a lot of give and takes on the second wave and some of the diagnostic headwinds as you flagged. But can you maybe just talk on linearity during the quarter, how is July, August and September and any color on the first half of October? And when do you think the diagnostic headwinds could reverse? How do you think that potentially could play out?\nGary Guthart: Marshall, why don\u2019t you jump in and speak a little bit to the linearity question and I will talk a little bit -- I will pick up the diagnostic pipelines then.\nMarshall Mohr: Sure. Consistent with our last call, at the beginning of the quarter was depressed relative to, let\u2019s say, middle of June. It slowly gradually came back during the quarter. There\u2019s choppiness, of course, because it varied region by region. But slowly came back into quarter, and probably, reached its peak near the end of the third quarter.\nGary Guthart: On the diagnostic side, I think, there\u2019s a broad recognition by healthcare providers that it\u2019s not in anybody\u2019s interest for these pipelines to remain stalled. I think there are efforts to drive them. That said, in terms of how fast they refill and patient comfort to come in and get these things done. I think all of us are going to have to wait and see. So we will keep watching and tracking it. Channel check show that people are working on it. How fast did it converges? I don\u2019t think anybody has a great predictor.\nTycho Peterson: And then, Gary, on the -- some of the developments from last quarter, the Extended Use Instruments and the price of adjustment, any anecdotal color you can provide on your customer conversations on how they are thinking about incremental usage? And then you kind of mentioned the regulatory hurdle for the Extended Use Instruments. I assume that\u2019s pretty straightforward, but can you just comment on that as well?\nGary Guthart: Sure. On the customer feedback side, we have seen a positive response. There are different market segments, both in terms of the types of procedures that people are interested in using. Our device 4, da Vinci 4 and also different regions and those reimbursement dynamics and payment dynamics differ. In places where that has been greater stress, we have seen really positive engagement and response. We will see as it plays out in time. I think COVID in the early days of Extended Use will be a confounding factor, that the early drivers may be as simple as how folks are treating non-COVID and COVID patients concurrently. But we think as it lays out in time this is going to be really healthy for us and was not a hard analysis to do to understand the potential value of it. In terms of regulatory pathways, we don\u2019t see real hurdles on the regulatory side. I think there\u2019s work to be done in terms of validations, and otherwise, I think, that\u2019s all well enhanced. So I don\u2019t see stresses around regulatory clearances as it relates to Extended Use Instruments.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. And then just last one on China, you mentioned in your comments, with regard to the quarter that you may see approval for competitive systems next year. Can you just talk on the competitive environment there? Are you seeing more platforms emerge?\nGary Guthart: For several folks there, there are a handful of commercial groups in China that are working on systems of one variety or another whether they seek to compete with a multi-port da Vinci type system or a single port system or an Ion type system, we see interest in all those things. Ultimately, they will make it through the regulatory process and get into the market. We see great demand in China and the increase in the quota, I think, is a reflection of customer interest working its way through the national processes to get additional approval. So we feel like we are in a strong position competitively. We think that there\u2019s a real market there that\u2019s really gated and limited by the quota system and we expect others will enter the market seeing the value it has and we have oriented our teams to make sure we are meeting customer needs better than others.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. Thank you.\nGary Guthart: Thanks, Tycho.\nOperator: Next we have a question from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nDavid Lewis: Good afternoon. Just a few here for me, Gary. So it\u2019s pretty clear procedure trends normalized across the quarter and you have seen that and J&J saw it as well. You talked about these various forces, exhausting backlog, hospital capacity, improving diagnosis. Is it reasonable to expect slow and steady improvement going forward, but at a more modest rate, that\u2019s sort of the message we got from J&J, I am just wondering if you would comment on that. So we get improvement but that improvement is going to be more measured going forward?\nGary Guthart: I hesitate to characterize it just because I don\u2019t know what the future holds for COVID outbreaks and strain. What I can say is that, hospitals are handling the concurrent needs that they have a little bit better. I think they have protocols that they feel good about. I think they have access to resources and things like PPE that early on they didn\u2019t. That gives us some comfort that barring a massive influx that they can manage both size of patient need. What that plays out like in the future, sorry, capacity is better. It\u2019s also clear that they want to do minimally invasive surgery and high quality minimally invasive surgery and they have an interest in using our products gives me comfort. What the weather does, what the COVID pandemic does, I think, it is harder for Intuitive to have direct insight into.\nDavid Lewis: Okay. But it sounds like on an apples-to-apples basis all things being normal, the system continues to improve, obviously, you are not in control of exogenous factors?\nGary Guthart: I think that\u2019s fair.\nDavid Lewis: Okay. Very fair. Just on Extended Use, two questions for me. Marshall for you, I thought I heard, I apologize if I misheard. The customers did not change buying patterns in the third quarter. I am just sort of curious why do you think that was and are you more confident, obviously, that will change in the fourth quarter? And then, Gary, if I said to you, Extended Use is going to do one or two things, it\u2019s going to bring more general surgeons and more types of procedures into the mix or it\u2019s going to stimulate a significant amount of sort of Gen 4 platform demand. What do you think is sort of the bigger trigger, a bigger factor here near-term?\nMarshall Mohr: So we announced in July the program for the very intent that maybe hospitals might want to take advantage of managing their inventory levels. They do what they do. I can\u2019t answer the question as to why their buying patterns where they were. I think that -- as far as going forward, there will be a hard cutover. You are not going to see hospitals buy a combination of the two and we are not offering a combination of the two. We are basically cutting it over to the extended use instruments. So that will, like, I said in my script, that will have an impact on Q4. But I think it will be positive from a hospital economics perspective, which is the whole intent of the program, right?\nGary Guthart: Turning to the issue of what do we think it\u2019s going to catalyze. First, we think that surgeons have an interest in using our products broadly, and in fact, in procedures that have been traditionally done laparoscopically. Early days of the company it was predominantly a substitution of open surgery. It was a way to allow minimally invasive surgery where open surgery was the norm and MIS by manual means was really difficult. And yet in general surgery we are seeing a draw, a pull by our customer base to do with da Vinci procedures that are often done with laparoscopy and there\u2019s a reason for that. System is ergonomically sound. It allows more complex cases to be done comfortably and repeatedly, and so we see real demand there. And as a result, we feel like as we have gotten scale, as our instrument quality and processes have improved over the years and we have made design changes, we can make it easier for those who want to use it more broadly to do so economically. So we think it\u2019s going to stimulate over the long-term more demand on that side and a better way to say it perhaps is it\u2019s going to reduce barriers. I think customers want to go there and this reduces barriers to them getting there. With regard to upgrades, I think, there are a whole hosts of good reasons to move -- for a customer to move into a Generation 4 system, Xi or X, if they are in a Gen 3 or Gen 2 system and S or Si and Extended Use Instruments are just one of the advantages there. So I think it helps that problem, but I think that, if I had to weigh it to the former is a strong pull in this. Extended Use Instruments, next-gen imaging, next-gen advanced instruments, next-gen stapling, vessel sealing, those things are great reasons to upgrade from an Si into Gen 4.\nDavid Lewis: Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Similar question on the recovery but on the system side, Gary, how do you see that playing out over the next few quarters? Any anecdotes you can share about conversations with hospitals, utilization was down less this quarter, I think, it was last quarter and I had one follow-up.\nGary Guthart: I have been relatively pleased with the nature of conversations with hospitals around systems and how they view the robotic programs. I think they are being highly rational. I think they view high quality minimally invasive surgery is important going forward. They have a lot more data at their fingertips, a lot of its supplied by us to understand and measure the performance of their programs and they can look out and say, okay, as they -- if they get more comfortable with recovery, does this help them, and largely speaking, yes, they view it as a help. So I think that\u2019s good. Having said that, I think, they are trying to plan what their finance is going to look like in 2021. Some of them have reasonable visibility others have low visibility. And so I think they may pace and we are seeing that pacing. I am not discouraged over the long-term. I look out, I think, that a combination of analytical prowess and recognizing the value of lower variability, high quality interventions is quite strong. So it will be hard to predict in the near-term. We expect pressure, as Marshall said. I think Marshall is right on it. Having said that, in the long-term, as procedures come back, capital will be important and we keep innovating on our products that catalyzes upgrade cycles.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thanks. And Gary, Intuitive has historically been almost exclusively an organic grower, investing in early in IP and developing products around that rather than buying companies with commercial products or folding in distribution. Do you expect that to change over the next few years and is that partly why you announced Intuitive Ventures? Thanks for taking the questions.\nGary Guthart: Yeah. I think we have an interest in and pride in our organic innovation capabilities and I expect that to remain a pillar in part of our DNA. As we have grown and as I think the market has started to really appreciate here, I mean, the medical market, really appreciate what robotic-assisted surgery and computer aided surgery can do. I think that a lot of new avenues open and that provides opportunity for us. We have been -- we are not a not invented here culture. We are open-minded to the very bright people outside. We do a lot of activities and tuck-ins over time. Those may get bigger in time. We may continue to do it. In general, I\u2019d prefer to bring things in earlier rather than later. On the other hand, if something is interesting, we are open-minded to it. The venture fund and our futures initiatives, I think, are really recognizing as an interesting ecosystem out there developing. There\u2019s a lot of technology lines that can make a big difference in medicine and we would like to facilitate that growth.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thank you.\nOperator: Next we have a question from Amit Hazan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAmit Hazan: Oh! Thanks. Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to kind of try the angle of talking about new technology and pipeline. Maybe try again kind of from an R&D perspective, I think, that\u2019s where you have been most comfortable answering it in the past. So ask it in that context, obviously, R&D spending is kind of growing right through these last couple of quarters despite the pressures. Can you just talk to the biggest buckets of R&D spend and your focus or most focused on these days and how you allocate those buckets within R&D spend?\nGary Guthart: Yeah. I will start and I will ask Marshall to do a little bit more of the comparator. For us we kind of think about it in three categories. One of them is, what are the kinds of things we can invest and that makes a substantive change in outcomes, not a 2% change but a bigger one and those things get our attention and drive a set of investments, that\u2019s one. We look out at new ways to get into the body with less damage to healthy tissue and less variability. As you know, we look a lot in ways we can bring more information to the surgeon and to make that information more understandable, whether it\u2019s advanced imaging or higher quality imaging or machine learning. All those things are ways to help the decision-making and share the load with surgeons and we are making substantial progress in that domain. And we have been talking for several quarters now, perhaps, several years, about catalyzing a virtuous cycle of driving volume, driving quality, decreasing the cost to make our products and sharing those savings with our customers, which allows them to take our products into places they would like to go and we see that happen as well. So those are categorically where we are thinking. Marshall, I will let you take the kind of rough mix question.\nMarshall Mohr: Sure. From a year-over-year perspective, as I said in my script, the biggest area of investment really is digital capabilities, AI, machine learning and informatics. Then after that would be advanced imaging and our capabilities there and you have seen us introduce new scope technologies, but also making investments in other ways to image the anatomy. And then the other two areas I\u2019d call out would be Ion and SP, of course, as we bring those products to market.\nAmit Hazan: So maybe just a related follow-up on IRIS, just given you mentioned I think that it recovered well in the quarter. I would love just a better understanding of where you are deploying it and implementation, I mean, there\u2019s obviously some very big players in the space that you have to contend with, practically speaking and work with and partner with it. How you are seeing that develop now and what we should be thinking about over the next year or two for that evolution?\nGary Guthart: I would just kind of anchor everybody on what IRIS is. This is augmented reality program that takes preoperative 3D models, MR and CT scans, things like that that are typically already done in the workflow of a workup for a patient and making it really easy for the surgeon to have access to that data real time, first, before the case to help them visualize the case and plan, and second to have it in real-time in the console. So it\u2019s kind of a really simple idea, and as you say, and rightly say, doing it well, executing it well is the hard part. We have some really good natural collaboration partners in the space to do that with. You think about -- we don\u2019t go out and acquire those images ourselves. They are acquired on other people\u2019s devices. Those companies are incented and open-minded about how to help those things progress and we have had good relationships with them. We have done some really cool proprietary things. We have a brilliant team of scientists and computer scientists who have thought hard about how to make that augmented reality work really well. And it\u2019s easy to do a quick prototype and it\u2019s hard to do it in such a way that it\u2019s additive to the procedure and doesn\u2019t get in the way of the surgeon. That\u2019s a lot of what has been going on in IRIS since then. And then if you think about, well, where can that take you inside the body, it\u2019s really neat. You think about you are interested in what the vasculature is up to, you are interested in what solid organs are doing, you are interested in where tumor boundaries are and surgeons getting access to that, thinking through what approach might be, getting advice from the computing system is how that might work and consulting with patients about it. Those things are really good, facilitated discussions. I think we are quite strong relative to what I see out in the market from others and where people are kind of in universities. So our team is really good. How that grows over time? What parts of the body we approach next? We have a roadmap. We are working through it. We think that surgeons and hospitals will value it. We are developing the evidence in IRIS 1.0, this first launch to really build the value and to lay that roadmap. So far, we have really passionate advocates both inside and outside the company. So, so far, so good.\nAmit Hazan: Thanks very much.\nGary Guthart: Thanks, Amit.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nLarry Keusch: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Just -- you mentioned some of this in the prepared comments, but just sort of curious sort of how you are thinking about as you look across your procedures, where do we stand with backlog and those that have actually been completed? And at this point, we -- how are we starting to work through that backlog and really into new cases or just I am trying to get some sense of how you think that backlog is working its way through?\nGary Guthart: I think we are coming at it from three different ways and we have no great insight to share with you. I wish I had better insight. I don\u2019t know that if somebody gave you great insight that I would believe it. Having said that, with that as a lovely setup, Phil, if anything you would like to add, please jump in.\nPhilip Kim: No. I mean it\u2019s clear in our prepared comments. We talked about how there are patients that are being deferred -- that are deferring treatment right now and that\u2019s clearly a detriment to the patient. And so we do see -- we have worked through some of the backlog, as Gary alluded to in the script, but there still are patients that are clearly deferring treatment and still are to be worked on.\nLarry Keusch: Okay.\nGary Guthart: We are in close contact with our customers to the extent that we can help them provide assurance to patients to make sure that they stay attending to their healthcare. If we can partner with others to make that easier we do. We had some of those opportunities. Largely, I think, this is a -- the main owners of this process are the health providers themselves and we stand in support of them. What makes it so hard to model is that no region, no hospital, no country fits a single pattern and so you are integrating across a wide spot.\nLarry Keusch: Okay. Great. And then just the second question is, again, you talked a lot about sort of the benefits of the Extended Use of the instruments and the lower pricing of the less complex instruments, and certainly, all that makes sense. I think one part of the equation that people are looking to get some color on is, so how do you look at that price elasticity and what does that do potentially to the TAM, presumably in part the analysis was done to kind of figure out what the right price for the instruments are. So just wondering if there\u2019s anything incremental to add on how you are now thinking about the TAM expansion with sort of the changes that you made to the pricing?\nGary Guthart: Yeah. Perfectly fair question. I -- clearly, we think that there\u2019s greater demand at different price points, given both the types of procedures that people want to do and given the regions. What that TAM looks like over what period of time. I don\u2019t think we are ready to update with you on this call. We do think over time and as we move into next year, we will have greater visibility in terms of what\u2019s actually happening versus what our models are and we will start to share with you a little bit more of what our models look like.\nLarry Keusch: Okay. Terrific. Thank you.\nGary Guthart: So, Operator, just one more caller, please.\nOperator: Thank you. That question will come from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBob Hopkins: Great, and good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. I will just ask one given the lateness of the hour. Gary, I thought I heard you comment that you expect procedures to return to normal sometime in the mid-term. And first, did I hear you correctly and I am just curious how you kind of define mid-term? And then lastly and maybe most importantly, I am just curious, what gives you that confidence because there are some people that are beginning to think that maybe some of these COVID issues could have sort of a lasting impact on procedures in terms of patients or logistics within hospitals, so just curious if you could add a little color to your mid-term comment?\nGary Guthart: Yeah. Fair. I haven\u2019t anchored it on a particular time horizon. I think, frankly, it\u2019s exactly as you have really outlined in your question, what\u2019s implied in your question is, I think, as COVID is either tamped down or concurrently managed well, every -- it\u2019s in the healthcare system and patient\u2019s interest to make sure that people aren\u2019t sitting with undiagnosed conditions or suffering with diagnosed conditions that are being untreated. I think health systems globally, health policymakers and leaders of these institutions are trying to make sure they serve their constituencies well. And to me, the definition of mid-term is when they come over the hump of being able to manage that set of backlogs and the flow of patients, that may mean managing it within a COVID context or maybe that COVID impressions start to drop and they have more room. So you can imagine it plays out in a couple of different ways. So as long as hospital systems are fully in reactive mode with regard to COVID, I think, we are in the near-term. So I\u2019d define mid-term as when folks are not in pure reaction that -- when they can manage things concurrently. And we see that executing well in some countries where COVID exists. It\u2019s not growing out of sight and they can manage that pretty well. And where that happens, we see a return to managing surgical patients pretty well. So it\u2019s one that starts to happen in more and more countries. How long does that take? I don\u2019t really know and what exactly the catalysts are? Well, it depends on COVID management policy.\nBob Hopkins: Great. Very helpful. I will leave it at that. Thank you.\nGary Guthart: Okay. Thanks, Bob. Well, that was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams and pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim, better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams, and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months. This concludes today\u2019s call.\nOperator: As stated, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconferencing. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gary Guthart",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today. Our third quarter was a productive one with return to growth and da Vinci procedure amid continuing adaptation to customer needs. In the field performance grew strongly by region, given differences in pandemic impact. Operational performance inside the company has been strong, with remarkable focus and diligence by our teams. Turning first to global procedures, Q3 2020 procedures grew 7% compared with Q3 2019. Procedure growth varied widely by country, with growth returning to most of the countries we serve with a direct commercial team. U.S. growth was in the mid-single digits and procedure growth in China's stood out is particularly strong. Analyzing current global quarterly procedure performance compared with Q3 2019 by clinical category, general surgery is rebounding most quickly, posting double-digit growth with mid single-digit growth in gynecology and modest growth in urology. Overall, we have seen utilization increasing for our customers as their resources become available, indicating that surgeons and hospitals are maintaining their commitment to minimally invasive surgery. da Vinci enables access to high quality minimally invasive care, increasing the number of patients who can return home sooner and decreasing the demand on ICU resources, clearly important in the era of COVID-19. Currently, two factors are at play at hospitals, as hospitals treat both COVID and non-COVID patients. First, there are some deferred cases that were scheduled in the spring and summer that have now come back to the hospital for treatment. Second, diagnostic procedures such as colonoscopies and PSA tests have been delayed and may not be back to pre-COVID levels now. The delay in diagnostic visits will delay disease detection and like prostate screening changes in 2012 create a reservoir of patients with more advanced disease. This push pull of those patients who delayed a scheduled surgery coming back into hospitals now and the delay of disease identification due to diagnostic visit postponement makes hospital patient volumes hard to model for coming quarters. That said, full diagnostic recovery is in everyone's interest and we expect surgery to return to pre-pandemic levels over the mid-term. Philip will take you through procedure trends later in the call. Given the slowdown in procedures due to the pandemic we expected weaker capital demand in the third quarter. For the quarter, we installed 195 new systems. This compares to 275 installs in Q3 2019 and 178 installs in Q2 2020. Year-over-year install base growth was 8% at the end of Q3 after accounting for trade-ins. We know the correlation between system utilization in the form of procedure demand and the need for new capital capacity at hospitals is strong. Many hospitals will seek to absorb existing capacity before installing new capital. In regions in which da Vinci systems are more common, hospitals may delay adding new systems until utilization recovers. Average globally we continue to expect a challenging near- to mid-term environment for future capital placements, as COVID-19 wears on and hospital finances remain strained. Because COVID is impacting locales differently, we see significant variability in procedure growth and new system placement pipelines by region. Marshall will take you through capital placement trends and risks later in the call. At Intuitive we are focused on those activities and priorities within our control. Our team in the field, in our labs, in our factories and working in homes and offices is performing well. We adapted our priorities for 2020 to meet the challenge of the pandemic and the needs of those we serve. First, we are focused on the health and well being of patients, customers, our employees and our communities. Second, we are focused on inventory and supply chain management. So far product availability has been very strong. Thanks to the relentless work of our supply chain teams and our partners. Third, we implemented our Customer Financial Relief Program and/or Extended Use Instruments Program. The timeliness and the design of these programs has been well received by our customers. Fourth, we continue to invest in our high priority development programs. Recognizing that high quality MIS is more important in the coming years not less so. If we are accelerating activities that help us adapt to the current environment and for which demand is likely to be durable post-COVID. Finally, we have constraints spend where we believe it is inefficient in the current environment. With these priorities as our guide, our operational and financial performance served both our customers and our company well in the quarter. Intuitive commercial and learning teams adjusted their work methods to meet customers where they are, figuratively and literally. Over the years our time -- our teams have built a strong network of capable field trainers, sales reps, surgeon proctors and cloud enabled da Vinci systems. Our professional education and commercial teams engage this network, implementing on-site digital and regional programs such that customer engagement and training programs are approaching pre-pandemic levels, a remarkable achievement. Across the company, our teams have prioritized their efforts and practice physical discipline. Based on quality and automation improvements and continued attention, our manufacturing teams are managing our product costs well, leading to strong gross margin performance, while we implemented our Customer Relief Program and our Extended Use Program for Generation 4 instruments. While the pandemic has created near- and mid-term uncertainty in the form of competing healthcare priorities and economic stresses, I have high confidence in the need for high quality, minimally invasive surgery and therapies in long-term. To deal with the current and future stresses on the healthcare system, payers, hospitals and surgeons are looking for solutions that improve outcomes, decrease in hospital resource consumption and lower total cost to treat. In other words, the core pillars of the quadruple aim we had set as our goal many years ago. We have a team that has demonstrated physical discipline, particularly in light of the pandemic. Over time, we plan to increase investment in our innovation engines to improve the quadruple aim at our customers and to expand our market opportunity. And we will continue to invest in our virtuous cycle of quality and efficiency gains in production, that fuel quality improvement, manufacturing cost reductions and pricing flexibility for our customers that can lead to increase volume. Looking at product operations in the quarter, our advanced instruments and endoscopy programs are producing strong clinical and financial results. Customer adoption of our stapler product line, our vessel sealers and our E-100 generator has been encouraging. Utilization of these products and their targeted clinical procedures and their reorder rates has been strong. Despite disruptions caused by COVID in 2020, uptake of newly launched products, as well as our newest endoscope, Endoscope Plus has also been strong. As we have said in the past, a great clinical procedure takes the customer, the right system, the right instruments, the right imaging, the right training and the right support. As our Generation 4 ecosystem has matured, customers achieve high utilization rates for our target procedures in Gen 4 accounts. Our Ion program continues to advance with 11 systems placed in the quarter, many of which are in large teaching institutions. Ion diagnostic procedures are also returning to significant growth. Early clinical studies comparing Ion to existing alternatives in the market, both handheld and robotic, are beginning to be published and are encouraging, supporting the architectural decisions made early by our design team. While our progress in our precise trial for Ion has been slowed, we are seeing a return to cases as our clinical trial partners come free. Lastly, our team continues to incorporate learnings from customers and improving our system, our manufacturing and our supply chain, as we have worked diligently to support Ion at greater scale. Turning to our SP system, its clinical evidence continues to mount and advocacy for the system by surgeons who use it is increasing, procedures on SP rebounded nicely in the third quarter. I am quite encouraged by the commentary from surgeons on the performance of the system and the potential for it to impact a wider variety of procedures over time. In the United States, we are pursuing expanded clinical indications in a number of areas with our colorectal IDE trials reading initiation. Our system in first clinical case sites are standing by to start the study pending feedback from FDA and barring additional headwinds from COVID-19. If these go to plan we expect first cases in Q4 of this year or Q1 of 2021. Our cloud simulation, intelligence and analytics programs are also performing well. We have accelerated our cloud and remote technology efforts this year, with use of our remote case observations and our network simulators ramping quickly. In the quarter, our network surgical simulators were used over 87,000 times, roughly doubling year-over-year. Our IRIS augmented reality program entered limited launch in Q4 of last year and has recovered well in Q3. Lastly, our customer analytics efforts have been well utilized by hospitals in 2020 and are scaling nicely. As we finalize our 2021 planning it's worth reflecting for a moment. The opportunity for improvement in acute interventions including surgery is a substantial and decade's long journey. The fourth quarter of 2020 will mark the 25th anniversary of the founding of Intuitive and the 21st year of clinical use. Looking back at what has been achieved and forward to the important work that remains to be done, we are committed both to our organic innovation and to expanding the universe of bright minds who can improve medicine with the types of science and technology got pioneered. To that end, we launched our Intuitive Ventures Group, a part of our futures initiatives, whose mission is to accelerate opportunities at the frontiers of medicine. Intuitive Ventures Group's first fund is $100 million dollars and our team is engaging globally with entrepreneurs, having funded some in the quarter. We look forward to seeing what solutions they bring to complex problems. In closing, our priorities for the next few quarters remain as follows. First, continued strong performance on customer, employee and community safety, while ensuring supply chain stability. Second, continued support of our customers adapted to their specific conditions. Well support them according to their needs. Third, advancing our priority programs, instruments, accessories, endoscopy systems and intelligence programs. And finally, disciplines spend management during this period of change. I will now turn the call over to Marshall, who will take you through financial matters in greater detail. Marshall, why don't you jump in and speak a little bit to the linearity question and I will talk a little bit -- I will pick up the diagnostic pipelines then. On the diagnostic side, I think, there's a broad recognition by healthcare providers that it's not in anybody's interest for these pipelines to remain stalled. I think there are efforts to drive them. That said, in terms of how fast they refill and patient comfort to come in and get these things done. I think all of us are going to have to wait and see. So we will keep watching and tracking it. Channel check show that people are working on it. How fast did it converges? I don't think anybody has a great predictor. Sure. On the customer feedback side, we have seen a positive response. There are different market segments, both in terms of the types of procedures that people are interested in using. Our device 4, da Vinci 4 and also different regions and those reimbursement dynamics and payment dynamics differ. In places where that has been greater stress, we have seen really positive engagement and response. We will see as it plays out in time. I think COVID in the early days of Extended Use will be a confounding factor, that the early drivers may be as simple as how folks are treating non-COVID and COVID patients concurrently. But we think as it lays out in time this is going to be really healthy for us and was not a hard analysis to do to understand the potential value of it. In terms of regulatory pathways, we don't see real hurdles on the regulatory side. I think there's work to be done in terms of validations, and otherwise, I think, that's all well enhanced. So I don't see stresses around regulatory clearances as it relates to Extended Use Instruments. For several folks there, there are a handful of commercial groups in China that are working on systems of one variety or another whether they seek to compete with a multi-port da Vinci type system or a single port system or an Ion type system, we see interest in all those things. Ultimately, they will make it through the regulatory process and get into the market. We see great demand in China and the increase in the quota, I think, is a reflection of customer interest working its way through the national processes to get additional approval. So we feel like we are in a strong position competitively. We think that there's a real market there that's really gated and limited by the quota system and we expect others will enter the market seeing the value it has and we have oriented our teams to make sure we are meeting customer needs better than others. Thanks, Tycho. I hesitate to characterize it just because I don't know what the future holds for COVID outbreaks and strain. What I can say is that, hospitals are handling the concurrent needs that they have a little bit better. I think they have protocols that they feel good about. I think they have access to resources and things like PPE that early on they didn't. That gives us some comfort that barring a massive influx that they can manage both size of patient need. What that plays out like in the future, sorry, capacity is better. It's also clear that they want to do minimally invasive surgery and high quality minimally invasive surgery and they have an interest in using our products gives me comfort. What the weather does, what the COVID pandemic does, I think, it is harder for Intuitive to have direct insight into. I think that's fair. Turning to the issue of what do we think it's going to catalyze. First, we think that surgeons have an interest in using our products broadly, and in fact, in procedures that have been traditionally done laparoscopically. Early days of the company it was predominantly a substitution of open surgery. It was a way to allow minimally invasive surgery where open surgery was the norm and MIS by manual means was really difficult. And yet in general surgery we are seeing a draw, a pull by our customer base to do with da Vinci procedures that are often done with laparoscopy and there's a reason for that. System is ergonomically sound. It allows more complex cases to be done comfortably and repeatedly, and so we see real demand there. And as a result, we feel like as we have gotten scale, as our instrument quality and processes have improved over the years and we have made design changes, we can make it easier for those who want to use it more broadly to do so economically. So we think it's going to stimulate over the long-term more demand on that side and a better way to say it perhaps is it's going to reduce barriers. I think customers want to go there and this reduces barriers to them getting there. With regard to upgrades, I think, there are a whole hosts of good reasons to move -- for a customer to move into a Generation 4 system, Xi or X, if they are in a Gen 3 or Gen 2 system and S or Si and Extended Use Instruments are just one of the advantages there. So I think it helps that problem, but I think that, if I had to weigh it to the former is a strong pull in this. Extended Use Instruments, next-gen imaging, next-gen advanced instruments, next-gen stapling, vessel sealing, those things are great reasons to upgrade from an Si into Gen 4. I have been relatively pleased with the nature of conversations with hospitals around systems and how they view the robotic programs. I think they are being highly rational. I think they view high quality minimally invasive surgery is important going forward. They have a lot more data at their fingertips, a lot of its supplied by us to understand and measure the performance of their programs and they can look out and say, okay, as they -- if they get more comfortable with recovery, does this help them, and largely speaking, yes, they view it as a help. So I think that's good. Having said that, I think, they are trying to plan what their finance is going to look like in 2021. Some of them have reasonable visibility others have low visibility. And so I think they may pace and we are seeing that pacing. I am not discouraged over the long-term. I look out, I think, that a combination of analytical prowess and recognizing the value of lower variability, high quality interventions is quite strong. So it will be hard to predict in the near-term. We expect pressure, as Marshall said. I think Marshall is right on it. Having said that, in the long-term, as procedures come back, capital will be important and we keep innovating on our products that catalyzes upgrade cycles. Yeah. I think we have an interest in and pride in our organic innovation capabilities and I expect that to remain a pillar in part of our DNA. As we have grown and as I think the market has started to really appreciate here, I mean, the medical market, really appreciate what robotic-assisted surgery and computer aided surgery can do. I think that a lot of new avenues open and that provides opportunity for us. We have been -- we are not a not invented here culture. We are open-minded to the very bright people outside. We do a lot of activities and tuck-ins over time. Those may get bigger in time. We may continue to do it. In general, I'd prefer to bring things in earlier rather than later. On the other hand, if something is interesting, we are open-minded to it. The venture fund and our futures initiatives, I think, are really recognizing as an interesting ecosystem out there developing. There's a lot of technology lines that can make a big difference in medicine and we would like to facilitate that growth. Yeah. I will start and I will ask Marshall to do a little bit more of the comparator. For us we kind of think about it in three categories. One of them is, what are the kinds of things we can invest and that makes a substantive change in outcomes, not a 2% change but a bigger one and those things get our attention and drive a set of investments, that's one. We look out at new ways to get into the body with less damage to healthy tissue and less variability. As you know, we look a lot in ways we can bring more information to the surgeon and to make that information more understandable, whether it's advanced imaging or higher quality imaging or machine learning. All those things are ways to help the decision-making and share the load with surgeons and we are making substantial progress in that domain. And we have been talking for several quarters now, perhaps, several years, about catalyzing a virtuous cycle of driving volume, driving quality, decreasing the cost to make our products and sharing those savings with our customers, which allows them to take our products into places they would like to go and we see that happen as well. So those are categorically where we are thinking. Marshall, I will let you take the kind of rough mix question. I would just kind of anchor everybody on what IRIS is. This is augmented reality program that takes preoperative 3D models, MR and CT scans, things like that that are typically already done in the workflow of a workup for a patient and making it really easy for the surgeon to have access to that data real time, first, before the case to help them visualize the case and plan, and second to have it in real-time in the console. So it's kind of a really simple idea, and as you say, and rightly say, doing it well, executing it well is the hard part. We have some really good natural collaboration partners in the space to do that with. You think about -- we don't go out and acquire those images ourselves. They are acquired on other people's devices. Those companies are incented and open-minded about how to help those things progress and we have had good relationships with them. We have done some really cool proprietary things. We have a brilliant team of scientists and computer scientists who have thought hard about how to make that augmented reality work really well. And it's easy to do a quick prototype and it's hard to do it in such a way that it's additive to the procedure and doesn't get in the way of the surgeon. That's a lot of what has been going on in IRIS since then. And then if you think about, well, where can that take you inside the body, it's really neat. You think about you are interested in what the vasculature is up to, you are interested in what solid organs are doing, you are interested in where tumor boundaries are and surgeons getting access to that, thinking through what approach might be, getting advice from the computing system is how that might work and consulting with patients about it. Those things are really good, facilitated discussions. I think we are quite strong relative to what I see out in the market from others and where people are kind of in universities. So our team is really good. How that grows over time? What parts of the body we approach next? We have a roadmap. We are working through it. We think that surgeons and hospitals will value it. We are developing the evidence in IRIS 1.0, this first launch to really build the value and to lay that roadmap. So far, we have really passionate advocates both inside and outside the company. So, so far, so good. Thanks, Amit. I think we are coming at it from three different ways and we have no great insight to share with you. I wish I had better insight. I don't know that if somebody gave you great insight that I would believe it. Having said that, with that as a lovely setup, Phil, if anything you would like to add, please jump in.

I think, frankly, it's exactly as you have really outlined in your question, what's implied in your question is, I think, as COVID is either tamped down or concurrently managed well, every -- it's in the healthcare system and patient's interest to make sure that people aren't sitting with undiagnosed conditions or suffering with diagnosed conditions that are being untreated.

So it's one that starts to happen in more and more countries. How long does that take? I don't really know and what exactly the catalysts are? Well, it depends on COVID management policy. Okay. Thanks, Bob. Well, that was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams and pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim, better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams, and ultimately, a lower total cost of care.

Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months. This concludes today's call."

            "content": "Good afternoon. I would describe the highlights of our performance on the non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Key business metrics for the third quarter were as follows. Third quarter 2020 procedures increased approximately 7% compared with the third quarter of 2019. It increased approximately 36% compared with last quarter. Third quarter placements of 195 systems decreased 29%, compared with 275 systems last year, it increased 10%, compared with 178 systems last quarter. We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems over the last year by 8% to approximately 5,865 systems. This growth rate compares with 9% in the last quarter and 13% last year. Utilization of clinical systems in the field measured by procedures per system declined approximately 2% compared with last year and increased 33% compared with last quarter. Let me walk you through the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on procedures and system placements and how it impacts our business. Overall, procedures recovered gradually during the quarter to around 90% of pre-COVID levels by the end of the quarter. However, the extent and pace of recover varied by market. In the U.S., reflect -- we reflected several underlying themes. We experienced broader adoption across multiple procedures led by general surgery. For example, we saw significant year-over-year bariatric procedure growth. Partially offsetting broader adoption is the impact of reduced diagnosis and treatment of conditions given patients concern over COVID exposure and regional COVID resurgences and regional that disrupt elective procedures. The reduction of diagnosis and treatment was the most -- was most pronounced in prostate cancer. Dynamics that affected the U.S. also affected our OUS markets. In summary, we saw higher procedure growth in markets where COVID spread is lower, like China and Japan, compared with markets where COVID impact is greater, like the U.K. and India. While total worldwide procedure rates have improved, it is possible that resurgences of COVID-19 like those currently being experienced in parts of Europe and the U.S. could negatively impact da Vinci procedures. In addition, delays in diagnosis and treatment of underlying conditions could also negatively impact da Vinci procedures. Philip will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call. Although capital placements were higher in the second quarter, third quarter placements reflected headwinds, we discussed last quarter, including hospitals filling existing system capacity before purchasing additional capital and delayed capital spending while hospitals revisit their capital budgets given the impacts of COVID-19. Utilization in the third quarter was 2% lower than the third quarter of 2019, while the second quarter 2020 utilization was 27% lower than the second quarter of 2019. Going forward, we expect these same headwinds to impact capital placements. In addition, macro economic conditions created by COVID could also impact hospital spending. And as we face competition in various markets, we may experience longer selling cycles and price pressures. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. Total third quarter revenue was $1,078 million, representing a 4.5% decrease from last year and a 26% increase from last quarter. Third quarter 2020 revenue reflects $23 million of service credits issued in relation to the previously announced Customer Relief Program where we provide service credits to customers as their use of da Vinci systems were lower than pre-COVID comp volumes. Total service credits issued under the Customer Relief Program which has now ended were $82 million. Leasing represented 35% of current quarter placements, compared with 29% last quarter. Second quarter placements included a higher proportion of China placements, where leasing is prohibited. Excluding China we saw increased demand for leasing structures. In an environment of COVID-19 and as economic pressures increase, we anticipate more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than reflected in historical run rates. 40% of systems placed in the third quarter involve trade-ins consistent with last quarter. Trade-in activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict. We recognize $17 million of lease buyout revenue in the third quarter, compared with $9 million last quarter and $20 million last year. Lease buyout revenue is varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure increased slightly to approximately $1,910 per procedure, compared with $1,900 per procedure in the second quarter of 2020 and decreased compared with $1,980 realized in the third quarter of last year. The decrease compared to last year reflects customer buying patterns partially offset by increased advanced instrument usage. In the third quarter of 2020, we did not experience reduced purchases of instruments that we anticipated in advance of the launch of Extended Use Instruments. In early October, we launched our Extended Use Instruments in the U.S. Extended Use Instruments have 12 to 18 uses, compared with our previous 10 use instruments. In addition, we are reducing the price of certain instruments used commonly in lower acuity procedures and our lower reimburse procedures. We plan to launch our Extended Use Instruments later in the fourth quarter in Europe and in 2021 and 2022 in other markets depending on regulatory requirements. Overall, Extended Use Instruments and lower instrument pricing will result in lower INA revenue per procedure to Intuitive. For example, had the Extended Use Instruments been available and the lower instrument pricing been in place for all of 2019, revenue for 2019 would have been $150 million to $170 million less than reported and INA per procedure would have been 7% lower. The impact of these actions on future revenue will depend on procedure volumes, instrument usage and mix, and whether cost elasticity will enable greater penetration into available markets. Beginning in the fourth quarter with the introduction of Extended Use Instruments, we expect that INA revenue and revenue per procedure will be lower than it otherwise would have been. Six of the systems placed in the third quarter were SP systems reflecting both our measured rollout of SP and the continued impact of COVID-19. Our installed base of SP systems is now 58, eight in Korea and 50 in the U.S. Our rollout of the SP surgical system will continue to be measured, putting systems in the hands of experienced da Vinci users, while we pursue additional indications and optimize training pathways in our supply chain. As Gary outlined, we expect to initiate first cases associated with colorectal clinical trial by the first quarter of 2021. We placed 11th Ion systems in the quarter, bringing the installed base to 32 systems. Ion system placements also continue to be impacted by COVID-19. Ion system placements, procedures and related information is excluded from our overall systems and procedure counts. Our rollout of Ion will continue to be measured, while we optimize training pathways and our supply chain. Procedures under the precise study are being completed at a slower pace than anticipated due to COVID-19. Based on the current pace of procedures we expect the precise study to complete in the second quarter of 2021. Outside the U.S., we placed 79 systems in the third quarter, compared with 90 in the third quarter of 2019 and 72 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 39 into Europe, 15 into Japan and 12 into China, compared with 36 into Europe, 27 into Japan and 10 into China in the third quarter of 2019. During the third quarter, MOH in China expanded the previous 154 system quota for the period 2016 through 2020 to 225 systems. The timeline for purchasing the 125 systems remaining under the expanded quota is the same as the original quota, which is the hospital's allocated quota by December 31, 2020, have two years to complete their tenders. We expect more of their remaining systems to be completed towards the end of the two-year period and only approximately a dozen systems to be placed in the fourth quarter of 2020. We also anticipate other companies to achieve regulatory approval over the next year or so. If approved, those competitors will share in the remaining quota. Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses, pro forma margin -- gross margin for the third quarter of 2020 was 70.2%, compared with 72% for the third quarter of 2019 and 62.4% last quarter. The second quarter of 2020 included higher period costs associated with abnormally low production, higher impact of the Customer Relief Program and higher excess in obsolete inventory charges. The decrease relative to the third quarter of 2019 reflects higher period costs associated with abnormally low production, the Customer Relief Program, partially offset by product mix. As revenues are pressured by COVID-19, production levels may operate at below normal levels, which may result in higher labor costs and under absorbed overhead and reduced product margins. In addition, product and customer mix fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and could cause fluctuation in gross margins. Pro forma operating expenses increased 1% compared with the third quarter of 2019 and increased around 5% compared with last quarter. The increase in third quarter operating expenses compared with the third quarter of 2019 is driven by higher investments in product development activities including informatics, advanced imaging in our Ion and SP platforms, and investment in headcounts and capabilities in OUS markets. This was partially offset by reduced spending on activities directly impacted by COVID-19, including marketing events, travel and training and reduce spending, reflecting continued discipline throughout the organization. Relative to last quarter, spending reflects increase -- increases in training and travel, increased spending on product development areas outlined and partially offset by reduced spending. We continue to believe that we have a unique opportunity to expand the benefits of computer aided surgery and acute interventions around the world and we will continue to invest in the business for the long-term. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 19.8%, compared with our expectations of 20% to 21%. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of one-time items. Our third quarter 2020 pro forma net income was $334 million or $2.77 per share, compared with $409 million or $3.43 per share for the third quarter of 2019 and $132 million or $1.11 per share for last quarter. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $314 million or $2.60 per share for the third quarter of 2020, compared with GAAP net income of $396 million or $3.33 per share for the third quarter of 2019 and GAAP net income of $68 million or $0.57 per share for last quarter. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website. It includes excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation and IP charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition related items, and legal settlements. Third quarter of 2020 GAAP net income also included pretax gains of $62 million on our investments in private entities resulting from purchases of certain technologies. The EPS impact of these gains net of tax is $0.39 per share. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $6.4 million, compared with $6.1, sorry, $6.4 billion, compared with $6.1 billion at June 30, 2020. Cash generated from operations and stock exercises was partially offset by investments in working capital and our infrastructure. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. Our current thoughts on capital deployment are in the following order. We recognize the hardship that COVID-19 places on our customers and we will work with customers to ease the burden of lower da Vinci utilization, including providing customers with more flexible financing. We will ensure a secure supply chain and build appropriate levels of inventory to ensure customer supply. We will invest in securing our employees. We will continue to reinvest in the business focused on expanding our market opportunity or accelerating adoption of our products. We will continue to open market repurchase program consistent with our prior practice. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Philip, who will go over procedure performance. Sure. Consistent with our last call, at the beginning of the quarter was depressed relative to, let's say, middle of June. It slowly gradually came back during the quarter. There's choppiness, of course, because it varied region by region. But slowly came back into quarter, and probably, reached its peak near the end of the third quarter. So we announced in July the program for the very intent that maybe hospitals might want to take advantage of managing their inventory levels. They do what they do. I can't answer the question as to why their buying patterns where they were. I think that -- as far as going forward, there will be a hard cutover. You are not going to see hospitals buy a combination of the two and we are not offering a combination of the two. We are basically cutting it over to the extended use instruments. So that will, like, I said in my script, that will have an impact on Q4. But I think it will be positive from a hospital economics perspective, which is the whole intent of the program, right? Sure. From a year-over-year perspective, as I said in my script, the biggest area of investment really is digital capabilities, AI, machine learning and informatics. Then after that would be advanced imaging and our capabilities there and you have seen us introduce new scope technologies, but also making investments in other ways to image the anatomy. And then the other two areas I'd call out would be Ion and SP, of course, as we bring those products to market."

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Finance, Investor Relations for Intuitive Surgical, Calvin Darling. Please go ahead.\nCalvin Darling: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive\u2019s second quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Philip Kim, whom I'm pleased to introduce our Head of Investor Relations. As for me, while passing the lead over to Phil, I plan to continue on in a support role with our Investor Relations team. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today\u2019s call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 7, 2020, and Form 10-Q, filed on April 17, 2020. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC\u2019s website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.  Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Latest Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today\u2019s press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. In addition, this quarter, we have also posted charts illustrating 2020 weekly da Vinci procedure trends, which is intended to provide additional perspective and detail regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Today\u2019s format will consist of providing you with highlights of our second quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter\u2019s business and operational highlights, Marshall will provide a review of our financial results, then Philip will discuss procedure details. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.\nGary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. On this call, we'll describe our experience in the quarter, the actions we are taking and our priorities going forward. Our focus now and in the past is the safety and well-being of patients, care teams, our communities and our employees. Turning first to global procedures. We ended Q2, 2020 down 19% compared with Q2, 2019. The underlying driver for this decline has been the growth of COVID-19 and the communities that our customers serve. While we saw procedure declines in all categories, urology and thoracic procedures were relatively resilient, while gynecology experienced the greatest decline. Rates of recovery from lows by procedure types were more uniform. We've seen hospitals with adequate supplies of staff, PPE and physical resources returned to above 90% of pre-COVID procedure run rates over a few months period. Recovery above this number as dependent upon the intensity of COVID in the region, patient's comfort to return to the hospital, availability of testing and patient outreach. As we stand here in July, we see the continued growth of COVID in some regions, both domestically and internationally making future predictions on hospital capacity for surgery difficult. Phillip will take you through some examples of regional differences in procedure trends later in the call. With regard to capital placements, we installed 178 new systems in Q2, 2020. This compares to 273 installs in Q2, 2019 and 237 installs in Q1, 2020. The new installs in Q2, 2020 represent a clinical installed base growth of 9% after accounting for trade-ins. While these numbers are lower than prior year and prior quarter, frankly, they are greater than our expectation coming into the second quarter, due to strong performance in Asia and some larger IDN placements in the U.S. That said, we know the correlation between system utilization in the form of procedure demand and capital availability at hospitals is a strong one. Hospitals will seek to absorb existing capacity before installing the capital. So on average globally, we expect a challenging near to mid-term environment for future capital placements, as COVID-19 wears on and hospital expenditures remain constrained. Because COVID is impacting locales differently, we see significant variability in procedure growth and new system placement interest by region. Marshall will take you through capital placement trends and risks later in the call. Stepping back and evaluating hospital approaches to surgery during this period, we see some principles that are being applied broadly. During local rapid growth of COVID in a hospital catchment area, their initial response is to align and train their workforce, stabilize their PPE and testing capability, and if I see resources are scarce, the first surgeries that can be delayed with a managed risk to the patient. As staff material in ICU resources free up either by diverting patients to alternative sites of care or within the four walls of the hospital, program directors, triaged patients in need of surgery and ramp back up, the sites become less impacted. We have observed that outreach education and diagnostic visits and procedures come back. The surge of COVID in communities that represent our core markets, either from initial spread or secondary growth is occurring now. Add to the significant anecdotal evidence of delayed diagnostic visits for non-COVID illness, and we expect that the recovery tale of surgery will be a long one, likely to last many quarters. The ultimate timing and shape of a recovery remains uncertain. The drivers of a sustained recovery in surgery will likely vary regionally, and may be predicated on the extent and duration of COVID outbreaks, the availability of human, material and physical resources to concurrently treat both COVID and other disease, patient comfort in returning to care centers for diagnostics or treatment, and finally, the relative health of the broader economy and hospital finances. At Intuitive we're focused on those activities and priorities within our control. They are as follows: first, we're focused on the health and well-being of our customers, our employees and our communities. As COVID has ramped in our communities, we instituted employee health and safety protocols, and have been tracking our performance and refining our methods. We're also working with our foundation and others to produce and donate PPE for customers in the communities in which we work and live, having delivered to date to over 1 million pieces of PPE. Second, we focused on inventory and supply chain management. So far, product availability has been strong. Thanks to the relentless work of our supply chain teams and our partners. Third, we implemented our customer financial relief program in the quarter. The timeliness and the design of the program has been well received by our customers. Fourth, we continue to invest in our high priority programs, recognizing that high quality MIS is likely more important in the coming years post-COVID not less so. Fifth, we're evaluating those activities that should be accelerated in the incurrent environment, and for which demand is likely to be durable post-COVID. Finally, we're constraining spend where we believe it is suboptimal in the current environment. Turning to instruments, beginning Q4 this year, we plan to introduce an updated set of select and Arista instruments for use with da Vinci X and XI, that will enable increased use beyond the current 10 years lifespan, part of our extended use program. Extended use will vary from two to eight additional uses per instrument, and is the result of continuous and significant investment in the design and production of our instrument technologies that have resulted in improved quality and durability. In addition, we'll concurrently lower the price of some other instruments that are most commonly used in lower acuity procedures. We are dedicated to support our customers' pursuit of the quadruple aim, defined as better patient outcomes, better patient experiences, better care team experiences and lower total cost to treat per patient episode. The long-term opportunity for our products and services is substantial. Both in high acuity complex procedures and in shorter duration lower acuity cases, where customers are understandably more cost sensitive. Some under risk instruments are used in every procedure. So our extended use program helps all customers, and in particular those performing lower acuity cases, which are among the fastest growing procedures. As the program rolls out, I&A cost for customers performing lower acuity procedures will be highly competitive, with non-robotic MIS approaches. I have described our commitment to a virtuous cycle of value adjustment for our customers driving volume increases, allowing us to invest in design and manufacturing at scale, and giving us the opportunity to share these savings with our customers, to allow them to use our products more broadly. This program is another step in this journey. Our extended use program has been years in the making, and its timing is fortuitous relative to COVID. We're pleased to bring it to our customers now. The program will negatively impact our near-term revenue, but not substantially impact our gross margin for affected instruments. It is the right decision for our customers and therefore for Intuitive long-term. Marshall will take you through financial implications of this program later in the call. Turning to advanced instruments. Our da Vinci Energy platform, which includes our next generation energy instrument and system, SynchroSeal and E-100 have made surprisingly good commercial progress in the second quarter, in spite of current environmental challenges. A testament to customer reception to its speed and precision. We also initiated our first commercial cases for E-100 and SynchroSeal in Japan in the quarter. And lastly, our 45 millimeter SureForm stapler launched in Europe in the second quarter. Turning to other programs of interest. Our Ion program continues to march forward in the face of COVID headwinds. Three systems were placed in the quarter and our clinical trial is progressing. Design and manufacturing teams continue to make progress on incorporating learnings to allow us to drive towards wider distribution in the future. While our progress in our precise trial for Ion has been slowed, we're seeing a return to cases as our clinical trial partners come free. For our SP program, our teams continue to support our early customers. Average monthly utilization for SP in Korea continues to exceed that of XI, a strong positive that speaks to early interest in the platform by surgeons and their patients. In addition to our learning from Korea, we are working with regulatory agencies regarding expansion of indications. The regulatory environment in the U.S. and EU has become more complex for new systems over time, made more challenging by diversion of resources at hospitals and at regulators to fight COVID, which impacts clinical trials and regulatory reviews. We'll update progress on additional indications for SP, as we have greater clarity. In our intelligence and analytics programs, our teams are performing well. And we are leveraging our prior investments in cloud computing, training technologies and analytics prowess. We have focused on our integration of cloud technologies with InTouch to accelerate access to remote proctoring in certain regions. We had already moved to a network subscription model for our simulation technology platform called SimNow, which is helping us decrease travel for surgeons for some elements of surgical training. Use of our hospital analytics programs is accelerating, even through the turbulence of 2020, helping hospitals and us in planning for system use and dynamic times like these. Before concluding my prepared remarks, let's step back. We cannot yet see the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. When the lessons from this event are absorbed, I believe high quality minimally invasive care will be more important to the future, not less so. A balanced approach to improving the quadruple aim remains our North Star. Our priorities for the next few quarters are as follows: first, continued strong performance on customer employee and community safety, while ensuring supply chain stability. Second, continued support of our customers adapted to their specific conditions, different customers are at different stages in this period, and we'll support them according to their needs. Third, advancing our priority programs, instruments, accessories, endoscopy systems and intelligence programs. And finally disciplined spend management during a period of change. I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who\u2019ll take you through financial matters in greater detail.\nMarshall Mohr: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Key business metrics for the second quarter were as follows: second quarter, 2020 procedures decreased approximately 19% compared with the second quarter of 2019, and decreased approximately 22% compared with last quarter. Second quarter system placements of 178 systems decreased 35% compared with 273 systems last year, and decreased 25% compared with 237 systems last quarter. We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems over last year by 9% to approximately 5,764 systems. This gross rate compares with 11% last quarter and 13% last year. Utilization of clinical systems in the field measured by procedures per system declined approximately 27% compared with last year, and declined 23% compared with last quarter. Let me walk through the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on procedures and system placements and how it varied by market. The impact of COVID-19 varied significantly among geographies. To assist in your understanding of this dynamic, we have posted a graph showing U.S., China, Japan, and Germany procedures in Investor Relations portion of our website. In that graph, we compare procedures to the average of the first two complete weeks of the first quarter, which we have characterized as pre-COVID-19 levels. In the U.S., procedure volume started the second quarter at around 30% of pre-COVID-19 levels, and grew by the middle of June to nearly the level measured in the first two weeks of the first quarter. However, with the resurgence of COVID-19 regionally in U.S., and related deferrals of elective surgeries, procedures began to decline in the last weeks of the quarter. We expect to see da Vinci surgeries decline further in July, as the pandemic continues to spread and hospitals dedicate human and physical resources to the treatment of COVID-19 in a way from other procedures. Second quarter procedures in China, Japan and Korea grew well year-over-year, as COVID had a lower impact on these markets. In Europe, the impact of COVID varied widely with Germany experiencing year-over-year single digit growth, while France, UK, and Italy experienced large declines. Capital sales in the U.S. and Europe reflected lower procedures and delayed capital spending, while hospitals revisit their capital budgets, given the impacts of COVID-19. On the other hand, capital sales in several of our Asia direct markets, including China, Japan, and Korea were better than anticipated. System placements will likely continue to be pressured by hospital spending, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 and the result into economic pressures. Also, as system utilization declined by 27% year-over-year, hospitals have excess capacity that they will likely seek to fill before purchasing additional systems. The extent and duration of COVID-19 and subsequent resurgences in the U.S. and other parts of the world is uncertain. The time and extent to which da Vinci procedures may recover will vary by market. However, as we believe surgery is durable and with the long-term worldwide opportunity for robotic assisted interventions remain significant. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. Second quarter revenue was $852 million, representing a 22% decrease from last year and a 23% decrease from last quarter. Under the previously announced customer relief program, we're providing service credits to customers related to lower use of their systems during the second and third quarters, as hospital treat COVID patients. Revenue reflects $59 million of service credits granted to customers in the second quarter. As procedures in the U.S. and Europe recovered more quickly in the second quarter, the credits issued were less than expected. We are now anticipating the total cost of the customer relief program will be in the range of $80 million to $110 million. Second quarter placements included 21 into China, representing a greater proportion of total placements relative to the prior year in prior quarter. As leasing is prohibited in China and most systems are placed within Greenfield hospitals, the worldwide percent of leasing and trade-ins has declined. Leasing represented 29% of current quarter placements compared with 32% last quarter. Trade-ins represented 40% of current quarter placements compared with 57% last quarter. We would anticipate in an environment of COVID-19 as economic pressures increase, more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than reflected in historical run rates. Trade-in activity can be fluctuate and be difficult to predict. We recognized $9 million of lease buyout revenue in the second quarter compared with $12 million last quarter and $27 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure declined to approximately $1,900 per procedure, compared with just over $2,000 procedure in the first quarter of 2020, reflecting hospital usage of existing inventory as procedures decline. We expect instrument and accessory revenue per procedure to fluctuate, as hospitals adjust inventories to reflect changes in procedure volumes. Earlier today, we announced our Extended Use Program, under which in October, we will launch selected X and Xi instruments possessing 12 to 18 uses, compared with our existing 10 use instruments. These extended use instruments represent our higher volume instruments excluding stapler, monopolar and advanced energy instruments that are used in a broad set of procedures. The announcement is posted on our website. Our ability to introduce instruments with extended uses as the result of significant investments in quality and manufacturing processes over a long period of time. The extended use instruments will generally be priced higher than our 10 life instruments, reflecting the investments we've made, but the cost per use will be lower for our customers. In addition and simultaneously, we will lower the price of certain instruments used commonly in lower acuity procedures and/or lower reimbursement procedures, like cholecystectomy, inguinal hernias and benign hysterectomies in the U.S. Combined with the savings associated with extended use instruments, the resultant instrument and accessory cost for these procedures will be competitive with non-robotic MIS approaches. Overall, extended use instruments and lower instrument pricing will result in lower I&A revenue per procedure to Intuitive. For example, had the extended use instruments been available and the lower instrument pricing been in place for all of 2019, revenue for 2019 would have been $150 million to $170 million less than reported, and I&A INA per procedure would have been 7% lower. The impact of these actions on future revenue will be depended upon procedure volumes, instrument usage, mix, and whether cost elasticity will enable greater penetration into available markets. Five of the systems placed in the second quarter were SP systems, reflecting both our measured rollout of SP and the impact of COVID-19. Our rollout of SP surgical system will continue to be measured, putting systems in the hands of experience da Vinci users, while we pursue additional indications and optimize training pathways in our supply chain. COVID-19 has delayed the ability to perform the clinical trial associate with an SP colorectal procedure. We placed three Ion systems in the quarter, Ion system placements were also impacted by COVID-19. Ion system placements procedures and related information is excluded from our overall systems and procedure accounts. Our rollout of Ion will continue to be measured, while we optimize training pathways in our supply chain. The completion of the PRECISE study is delayed due to COVID-19, and we cannot predict when the PRECISE clinical study will be completed. Outside the U.S., we placed 72 systems in the second quarter, compared with 80 in the second quarter of 2019 and 55 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 18 into Europe, 18 into Japan and 21 into China, compared with 30 into Europe, 24 into Japan and eight into China in the second quarter of 2019. Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 was 62.4%, compared with 71.3% for the second quarter of 2019, and 69.7% last quarter. The decrease compared with the second quarter of 2019 and last quarter, primarily reflects period costs associated with abnormally low production. The customer relief program and higher excess in obsolete inventory charges, partially offset by higher system ASPs reflecting a favorable geographic mix. Second quarter inventory charges were approximately $27 million, primarily reflecting last generation system, vision and instrument products, which as a result of decreased demand we are now able to fulfill customer needs with new or more capable products. As revenues have pressured by COVID-19, the production levels may operate at below normal levels, which may result in higher labor cost and under absorbed overhead in reduced product margins. Pro forma operating expenses increased 3% compared with the second quarter of 2019, and decreased 11% compared with last quarter. Spending in the second quarter reflected curtailment of costs associated with the impact of COVID-19, particularly training, marketing events and travel and related expenses, partially offset by cost associated with employee relief programs and other direct costs of COVID-19. Spending during this period of the pandemic will be as follows: we will work to ensure our employees safety and well-being, including investing in PP&E and employee program. We will continue to support our customers. We will continue to invest in innovation focused on the quadruple aim. We will invest in manufacturing in our supply chain to ensure supply for our customers. We will ensure that we are prepared for periods when the spread of COVID-19 is contained. Certain costs will be lower as the underlying activities are restricted by COVID-19, including travel and related expenses, clinical trials, surgeon training and marketing events. We will eliminate spending that is ineffective due to COVID-19, like surgeon and hospital events. We will reduce the hiring of volume-related roles like sales reps and manufacturing employees as appropriate. We continue to believe that we have a unique opportunity to expand the benefits of computer-aided surgery and acute interventions around the world, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in the business for the long-term. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 36.9% compared with our expectations of 20% to 21%, reflecting a $37 million or $0.31 per diluted share charge associated with the conclusion of a tax case between an independent third-party and the IRS, related to charging foreign subsidiaries for share based compensation. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of one-time items. Our second quarter 2020 pro forma net income was $132 million or a $1.11 per share, compared with $388 million or $3.25 per share for the second quarter of 2019, and $323 million or $2.69 per share last quarter. I\u2019ll now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $68 million or $0.57 per share for the second quarter of 2020, compared with GAAP net income of $318 million or $2.67 per share for the second quarter of 2019, and GAAP net income of $314 million or $2. 62 per share for the last quarter. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation and IP charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition related items, and legal settlements. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $6.1 billion compared with $5.9 billion at March 31, 2020. Cash generated from operations was partially offset by investment in working capital and our infrastructure. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. Our current thoughts on capital deployment are in the following order. We recognize the hardship that COVID places on our customers and we will work with customers, to ease the burden of lower da Vinci utilization, including providing customers with more flexible financing. We will ensure secure supply chain and build appropriate levels of inventory to ensure customer supply, particularly as procedures resume. We will invest in securing our customers. We will continue our open market repurchase program consistent with our prior practice. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Philip, who will go over our procedure performance.\nPhilip Kim: Thank you, Marshall. Our overall second quarter procedure decrease was approximately 19%, compared to growth of 17% during the second quarter of 2019, and 10% last quarter. Our Q2 procedure decrease was driven by a 24% decrease in U.S. procedures and a 7% decrease in OUS markets. On a worldwide basis, procedures in the quarter troughed in April and continued to recover throughout the quarter. Although, worldwide procedure run rates trended closer to pre-COVID levels in June, we caution investors from assuming this trend continues, given the dynamics discussed earlier in the call. In the U.S., procedure run rates also trending closer to pre-COVID levels in June. However, future of procedure performance may fluctuate as customers and states like Texas, Florida and California encounter increased COVID cases. From a procedure standpoint during the end of Q2, we saw a broad recovery in most procedures, including procedures that had the biggest decline at the end of Q1, such as bariatrics, hernia and benign gynecology. Within the U.S., there were geographic differences between states that were hit harder by COVID and those that were not. For example, during the quarter Florida recovered to pre-COVID levels on a run-rate basis, while New York did not. State specific containment strategies impacted procedure growth, and the timing of COVID outbreaks will play a role in driving geographic differences. Outside of the U.S., procedure growth in Asia was strong. As shown in the chart on our Investor Relations website, China performance was strong, but we would caution investors not to use China as a proxy for our global recovery. Japan growth remained strong at over 30% in Q2, and South Korea also grew in the quarter. Western Europe saw broad declines with the exception of Germany, which continued to grow in Q2, albeit at a slower rate. We provide these data points to inform investors of the procedure dynamics in the second quarter. Given the uncertain scope and duration of the COVID pandemic and uncertain timing of global recovery and economic normalization, we continue to believe that Q2 procedure results aren't indicative of forward trends. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And first question will come from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDavid Lewis: Good afternoon. Can you hear me okay?\nGary Guthart: We can, David. Yes.\nDavid Lewis: Great. Thanks. A little choppy there. So a couple of questions for me, Gary, for you. Obviously, the focus of the call is going to be on the extended instruments program. So maybe one for you, Gary, which is look, in most technology industries where you democratize technology sort of lower price to drive the TAM. I'm sure you've extensively studied your customer elasticity. And so Marshall talked about a 7% drop in I&A revenue. Can you just give us a sense of a framework around how to think about improvement in utilization based on these cost improvements? And then also for you, given your competitors who've seen J&J Medtronic time line slip, I think some investors are going to say, why take this kind of move now when the competitive landscape is getting easier. And then I had a quick follow-up for Marshall.\nGary Guthart: Yes. Thank you. I appreciate the question. On the first question of do we think that it changes the volume of procedures that might be accessed by our technology? The answer to that is yes. I think the real question will be timeline. A little bit hard to predict the timeline in the near-term just because I think a lot of it will have to do with COVID and recovery. So that will kind of blur the speed with which it happens. But if you look out over a couple of years, we clearly think that customers want to use our products, they want to use them broadly and different procedure domains, like general surgery but also broadly regionally. And to the extent that we can help them with economics, we think they have a preference to use our products, and we think that will help, that\u2019s why we did it. On question two on timeline, we have been working at it for some time. These changes and manufacturing process improvements have taken years to get right. I think being a little too fancy in the timeline doesn't help the company or our customers, we think that it will be appreciated that we have done it, it will be appreciated that we have done it now. And overtime, I think we\u2019ll look back on it and be happy what we thought it as expeditiously as we could.\nDavid Lewis: Okay, very helpful. And then Marshall for you, I appreciate the commentary on 2019 on revenue, and I apologize if I missed it. The 7% or $170 million -ish type of revenue impact. Can you give us a sense of what the gross margin impact, gross or EBIT impact maybe gross would be more helpful on 2019? Just trying to get a sense of the gross margin mix shift into '21 on this I&A study use program change. Thanks so much.\nMarshall Mohr: Sure. The margin on the products will be relatively consistent with current margins, so the impact is nominal in terms of 2019. It\u2019s a slight down only because you have less instrument and accessory revenue. And from a mix perspective, you wind up with more systems revenue, and systems revenue have lower margins, but the individual margins on the instruments are not that different.\nOperator: Our next question will be from the line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nTycho Peterson: Thanks. Gary I have a question on the capital side. If I go back to last quarter you obviously talked about using the $6 million in balance sheet to place more systems. Operating leases did go down. So can you maybe just talk a little bit about that dynamic, what you\u2019re hearing from customers in particular and U.S. on operating leases? And to Dave's point before with their competitors delayed a little bit, does that change your appetite at all for pushing operating leases in this current environment?\nGary Guthart: Yes. So just sanding back to the capital, it's really variable regionally, so where they are not strongly affected by COVID or they\u2019re recovering strongly then capital rotates forward again you saw that in China. And there we feel good about leasing systems or selling systems. In China they buy them, they don\u2019t lease them, but in other markets, where they are interested in leasing, we\u2019re happy to do that. In regions that are being disrupted by COVID where the flow of patients is changing because of either delays like surgery, or delays in diagnostic pipelines, there they have capacity on the existing installed base. They may want to move those systems, they may want to upgrade them, but in general we have seen and we have seen this in years past, act one as an operator of a hospital was to use your existing capacity before expanding it. And there, I don\u2019t think leasing is the major issue. I think the real issue is them getting back to surgery and getting ready to the extent that they have demand, leasing helps us, so I think it's kind of secondary to recovery from COVID in the U.S. primarily.\nTycho Peterson: And then on the procedure recovery, just speaking about looking to the backlog of the patients, is there any some more patients going into laparoscopic or open as there is backlog on robotics or even radiation therapy. I am just curious about how you think about alternatives to robotics, given backlog today?\nGary Guthart: Yes, we get to ask like questions periodically. I don\u2019t see a philosophical shift by heads of perioperative services to try to shift share in response to COVID. In a really hard hit area, if they are doing everything they can and the only thing they have available is something other than MIS they might go that way, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s their r primary objective of the health system. And pretty quickly they want to return to what they believe is offering the patient the best outcome. Looking in the evidence, we don\u2019t see any evidence of share shifts at this time. Let\u2019s not say they aren\u2019t there, it's just that nothing has really come up. And what we do see is as much positive for robotics as anything else.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. I'll leave it with that. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will be from Bob Hopkins, with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBob Hopkins: Great, thank you. Can you hear me okay?\nGary Guthart: Yes.\nBob Hopkins: Great. Hi, Gary. Thank you for taking the questions. First one for me, I am just trying to understand hospital systems ability to kind of manage through this COVID increase in cases that we're seeing here of late. So I'm just curious has that increase in the United States in particular been disruptive to surgical volumes or things held steady despite the uptick in cases?\nGary Guthart: We've seen -- it really depends regionally. So I guess what we've seen is variance regionally. And hard hit areas we'll see the implementation of deferrals again in other places that had kind of round one and it is starting to creep back in. They're assuming to manage it concurrently a little bit better. Netting it out the first few weeks in July looks really wavy, hard to call a good trend certainly would not call it a recovery in July in the United States.\nBob Hopkins: Yes, it's okay. I was specifically asking about the U.S. But it sounds like your response was related to the U.S. too.\nGary Guthart: Yes, certainly true in the U.S.\nBob Hopkins: Okay. And then the second question I had was just on the capital environment. And I know you just made a comment there earlier. But these results -- it's not obvious that there was a big negative impact from COVID on capital. But, you made a comment about a challenging environment going forward. I'm wondering how much of that is the need to absorb capacity, versus the impact on COVID? I'm just wondering specifically in the U.S., the willingness to kind of purchase capital in this environment? Just would love an update there. Thank you.\nGary Guthart: Sure. So, we did see -- as we reach the end of the quarter, we did see additional postponements of purchases. And we did hear from hospitals that they were back to evaluating their budget, thinking about what the ramifications of the costs of COVID treatment were, as well as thinking about the longer-term impacts of COVID in terms of potential recession and impact on their funds. And so I think, the quarter was affected. The capital quarter was affected by COVID. And going forward, you're right, there will be first, we think the impact of trying to bring back up systems to full utilization. 27% is a pretty steep decline. And we would expect that they will seek to fill that before they go out and buy more capital, particularly when they're already strained on the financial side. So, I think if we started to see it this quarter, and I think we're going to continue to see pressures on capital spend.\nBob Hopkins: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question will be from line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. One on capital, one on the regulatory environment. Gary, obviously system shift greatly exceeded street expectations this quarter. Can you talk about any new programs? You've introduced to support new placement? And we heard you talk this quarter about the loaner program. Are there any commitments associated with that? And are usage-based agreements increasing? As I said, I had one follow-up on the regulatory environment.\nGary Guthart: Sure. On that system shifts in the quarter, I'll start to answer and I'll ask Marshall to jump in and provide a little additional color. I think a lot of what we saw in Q2, in the U.S. was around momentum. Capital pipelines are multi-month engagements for our sales teams and for our customers. They have long-term commitments. They're fairly far down the pipeline. And in some cases, I think they know they want to do this long-term. They went ahead and closed. Outside to us, we had strength because you're starting to see procedure recoveries. And they're looking to build capacity for additional procedures. With regard to whether a particular sales program or the introduction of a loaner program and so on that really drove that number. I would not guide you that way. I don't really think that's true. But Marshall wanted to step in.\nMarshall Mohr: I think you characterized it right. I don't think there was any particular program that drove it. And I think that it really does reflect momentum. Gary alluded to a couple of larger IDN deals getting done. Those were months, if not a year in the making and so it takes time to get them closed out. And when you're getting close, even though there's COVID virus, they went ahead. And we do see strength outside the U.S., particularly in Asia where our COVID has started to recover.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thanks, Marshall. And just for my follow-up, Gary. You talked about changes to the regulatory environment. Obviously, we all heard J&J saying that they're not going to be filing 510(k) for their robot in the U.S. I mean, what are you seeing Gary? At the FDA, do you think future surgical robots will de Novo 510(k)s PMAs, I obviously don\u2019t expect you to speak for J&J but what can you talk about generally on surgical robots?\nGary Guthart: Over the last few years we\u2019ve seen an increase in clinical data requirements and evidenced generation per new platform, as we come out and we\u2019ve been talking to you about that over last several years. With regard to introducing new platforms us or anybody else, I think the pathway depends on the details of the claims, what\u2019s being claimed, what procedures are being done, and the details of the predicates being used. And that would guide any of the conversations we would have with FDA, or frankly, our competitors would have. So I really can\u2019t call out what direction it will go for everybody. We do see the discussions being pretty rational, and they just have required additional data sets as time goes on, and nothing we\u2019ve heard from the last couple of weeks of earnings calls as kind of changed our perspective on what we've seen.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question will go to Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nLarry Keusch: Thanks, good afternoon. Gary, I'm just curious about how you\u2019re able to manage your internal R&D development projects throughout COVID? And I guess really the question is, are you able to keep things going or did you see setbacks as well? I mean I know you talked about the PRECISE trial again, but I'm really thinking sort of your internal development projects.\nGary Guthart: I think we\u2019ve seen both heroic effort on the part of our teams. We are blessed by having a medical office inside the company and surgeons and medical people who work for the company directly. So we implemented protocols that allowed us to stay at leading edge of where safety protocols ought to be for infectious disease, and do our best to be able to keep making work, making progress. Our engineering teams have been really creative and thoughtful about getting work done. So we have seen some delays for sure. I wish I would say otherwise, but it\u2019s just reality. That said, I think that the teams have thought pretty hard to keep our programs progressing and to not just accept slips because COVID exists. Where we are -- where those things are a little bit out of our control tend to be on things that are in clinical trials, as we mentioned, there you\u2019re going back and forth between hospital, institution on the frontlines. They are using the point of their resources and ways that are important to them to manage COVID, we fully understand that. So there sometime it\u2019s really us in the support mode. Where we can control it? We can control our environment, we can relay out our spaces, our labs and so on, and we can make a little more progress. So we see some slips but we also see great effort to manage the slips.\nLarry Keusch: Okay, terrific. And then the other question is, certainly there is a sense out there that COVID will sort of accelerate trend that we\u2019ve already been seeing and a move to some sort of ambulatory surgical setting. Just curious, in the last quarter\u2019s call you sort of mentioned that Intuitive organization was ready to be helpful in any way and certainly sound like, what was implied if robots need to be moved to either ASCs or other care areas that you\u2019d be prepared to do it. Did you actually see any of that occur? And do you think that there is going to be an accelerated trend to move things that you can into non-acute care settings?\nGary Guthart: I'm going to ask Marshall answer the first part of that question around have we seen acceleration in the data set and then I\u2019ll answer the second part of question around what do we think might happen going forward. So, Marshall if you would jump in on what we've seen so far?\nMarshall Mohr: In terms of ASCs, again ASC is the number of da Vinci type procedures, procedures that da Vinci addresses in ASCs is actually not all the significant. What you really -- if you are talking about HOPDs or ASCs that are owned by hospital IDNs, then we have a large presence and we are addressing procedures that are presented there. We haven't seen -- I haven't, I'm not aware of movements of large patient quantities to ASCs during this period. I think hospitals are struggling to meet all needs in terms of COVID. So, I don't think I have anything else to add there.\nGary Guthart: Yes, I'll jump in on my side. I think that surgery in those environments, what actually happens in the operating room is well understood. And robotics and all robotics can play a real role there. What really determines whether something's in an ambulatory setting, hospital-owned, outpatient department setting or inside a hospital and booked as the same day surgery the differences there are largely driven by reimbursement and reimbursement policy. To the extent that reimbursement policy stays as it is, then I don't think you'll see a huge move of the kind of procedures that Intuitive does into the ASCs. But if reimbursement policy were to change in the future, then we will change with it and go there. So there's a lot of same day surgery or outpatient surgery that's done on da Vinci devices, where they live has a lot to do with reimbursement. So for us, it's -- where does it make sense to be performed logistically, where does it make sense to be performed from a reimbursement perspective and then they have the right tools, technologies and training. And I think we can adjust to that over time.\nLarry Keusch: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Amit Hazan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAmit Hazan: Thanks. Hey, good afternoon. Just a couple quick ones. On the da Vinci SP, if I heard your comments right about Korea utilization being higher than XI. That was a little bit surprising. So I'm just curious if you can give some color behind that. And whether that suggests for you that the types of procedures being done on SP are kind of more on the lower acuity side of the spectrum? And whether that kind of pays for you how you might be marketing the product here as it evolves.\nGary Guthart: Yes. In Korea, the nice thing is that the regulatory clearance allows broad clinical application. As a result, they can do procedures in urology and thoracic and gynecology and head and neck. And they're also looking at procedures in the breast. There I think it's less about low acuity. And I think they're really exploring, where does the single incision or natural orifice approach really drive clinical value up. The surgeons are I think, thoughtful and innovative here. And that's exciting to us. In the U.S., we need to run trials and get additional data as we've said before for colorectal applications and for some of the other things that we have in the pipeline. So that will take us some time. So we look to Korea to say, okay, what does demand look like when not constrained by the regulatory setting? The nice utilization or high throughput sort of tells us two things. One is, there's a real interest in exploring the hypothesis that this creates better outcomes. We can also look at the data there and start to see where it does indeed. That's exciting. The second thing is it puts the product through the tests of high throughput high turnaround is a well-designed in that setting. And can they use it as much? And that's been powerful for learning but also encouraging for us as to the maturity of the product even at this early stage. So that's how we're looking at Korea and it will help inform our regulatory strategy in other parts of the world.\nAmit Hazan: And then my follow-up would be on just new doctor training. That was obviously still quite strong for you pre-COVID here in the U.S. and obviously been a key element for you procedure growth looking forward. So just qualitatively, are you able to just give us a sense of the impact on training that you saw in the quarter? And how you're thinking about the rest of the year? Just levels of normal, even like you did for procedure would be super helpful to just get a sense of where you are with being able to train new doctors?\nGary Guthart: Yes, I'll start and Marshall will help you. I'll ask you to jump in and add some color. It's clearly challenged, and one of the things that we're working on. First, right up front is particularly in the United States, doctors are focused on other things and travel which some training requires is strained. So for us, two things have been going on. One of them is to see if we can forward deploy our training assets to make travel easier or extremely convenient, travel by car for example rather than by plane or use of digital tools and cloud technologies to be able to get access to some of the materials that they might use. We're actually encouraged on that front, I think we have some investments we have made over the years that we can leverage to help and we\u2019re seeing the beginnings of that. So I think that side looks good. That said, training requires demand generation, requires interactions with our sales teams in addition to training once they get going. So its substantially below prior levels, we\u2019re starting to see the beginnings of it coming back, but I\u2019ll let Marshal give you a little bit of color there.\nMarshall Mohr: Yes, it has been below our historical levels. And the importance of it varies depending on the geography as well. So we\u2019re in -- let's say in Japan where you have newer procedures that you\u2019re trying to adopt, training becomes a more important element and let\u2019s say in the United States where people can otherwise be trained in their institutions or that we\u2019re talking about mature procedures where proctoring and so forth is more readily available. So, I think in the United States the contribution of new surgeons is much lower than let\u2019s say in geography like Japan. And so we did see quite a drop-off in training earlier in the United States, because of reluctance to travel and other COVID-related reasons. And as Gary said, we\u2019re finding other ways to perform in that training, and it could have some impact on us, but again, it's not as big a contributor in the United States as our existing surgeons.\nAmit Hazan: Thank you.\nOperator: Next we will go to the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nRick Wise: Good afternoon, Gary and Marshall. I was reflecting again about the delayed J&J program and about, I think you said it or Marshall said it Intuitive's unique opportunity to invest. Help us think about this. I have to imagine that in some way perhaps many ways Intuitive has been actively aggressively thinking about the challenge preparing for near-term and long-term for the possibility of more competition. That challenge would seem to be meaningfully delayed for the moment. Does this offer you in anyway any opportunity to accelerate the pipeline or accelerate spending in some kind of way? Does this window present an opportunity? It does present you some kind of unique opportunity to investment? You're going to do something different now than you would have if it has been more imminent?\nGary Guthart: Thanks, Rick. For us we have really focused on being tightly focused on really making measurable improvements to the quad aim, really looking forward looking through windshield rather than in the side mirrors as to what, we think is important. I guess what I\u2019d say is the greatest limitation for us so far has not been opportunity, I think to do interesting things. There's an enormous amount of opportunity out there to make improvements and there's an enormous technology opportunity. I think the biggest challenge in the great limiting step for us has really been to continue to deploy our programs with excellence. And so that\u2019s been rate limiting step on growth. I think that other companies out there are investing in things that make sense that are interesting. I think the vision about where the world might be in 10 or 15 years is not a complicated one, I think it\u2019s reasonably shared. And I think what will differentiate Intuitive and other companies is really the ability to deliver these complex technologies at a very high quality level, and then ways that customers can really use to access their resources. So, I look around at what\u2019s going on outside, and I think they are engaging some of the both opportunities that are out there in the world and some of the challenges of doing this well and delivering it. So for us, I guess I didn\u2019t wake up this week and think that the world has changed because of somebody else's conference call.\nRick Wise: And just the second question for me. On Monday, we presented 100 plus robotic surgeon survey. And of those who said they had wanted to buy eventually, 40% said that they were -- they had made a decision to now postpone. Not a big shock. And you're corroborating that, of course. But how are you thinking? How would you have us think about that postponed volume? Are you concerned at all that these orders are lost? And could we see a sharp resurgence in capital as normal demand continues, you opened those accounts, new procedures? And on top of that we see these postpone volume, is that the right way to think about it? Thanks, Gary.\nGary Guthart: Okay. I think there's two drivers of additional capital. One of them is the need for additional capacity driven by surgeon and patient demand for da Vinci procedures. To the extent that that demand is suppressed because of COVID, fears about COVID or delays in diagnostic pipelines that will pressure the capital pipeline. That varies regionally. So where COVID is well-managed, we see knock on the usual types of sales activities, where COVID is very intense, not surprisingly, they were focused on other things. The second thing that can drive capital demand is new features, product that they want access to because they have older technology. And in that case, if they have the attention span to pursue it and the capital or leasing dollars to do something about it, then we can continue to make progress. The prior one, the issue of absorbing existing demand in the field -- procedure demand in the field will be the dominant one in my opinion in the next few months. How long that lasts has a lot to do with COVID and really none of us know how long that will be. So we'll be ready, we'll react. We are in a strong position from an organization point of view. I think we are able to run the business for the long-term. And so we'll do our best in that period. And we'll see it as it as it plays out.\nRick Wise: I appreciate it. Thank you.\nGary Guthart: Well, that was our last question. Thank you. In closing, we continue to believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams, in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim:better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams, and ultimately a lower total cost to treat of care. We believe value creation, surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months.\nOperator: Ladies, gentlemen, that will conclude our conference for today.

            "content": "Thank you, Marshall. Our overall second quarter procedure decrease was approximately 19%, compared to growth of 17% during the second quarter of 2019, and 10% last quarter. Our Q2 procedure decrease was driven by a 24% decrease in U.S. procedures and a 7% decrease in OUS markets. On a worldwide basis, procedures in the quarter troughed in April and continued to recover throughout the quarter. Although, worldwide procedure run rates trended closer to pre-COVID levels in June, we caution investors from assuming this trend continues, given the dynamics discussed earlier in the call. In the U.S., procedure run rates also trending closer to pre-COVID levels in June. However, future of procedure performance may fluctuate as customers and states like Texas, Florida and California encounter increased COVID cases. From a procedure standpoint during the end of Q2, we saw a broad recovery in most procedures, including procedures that had the biggest decline at the end of Q1, such as bariatrics, hernia and benign gynecology. Within the U.S., there were geographic differences between states that were hit harder by COVID and those that were not. For example, during the quarter Florida recovered to pre-COVID levels on a run-rate basis, while New York did not. State specific containment strategies impacted procedure growth, and the timing of COVID outbreaks will play a role in driving geographic differences. Outside of the U.S., procedure growth in Asia was strong. As shown in the chart on our Investor Relations website, China performance was strong, but we would caution investors not to use China as a proxy for our global recovery. Japan growth remained strong at over 30% in Q2, and South Korea also grew in the quarter. Western Europe saw broad declines with the exception of Germany, which continued to grow in Q2, albeit at a slower rate. We provide these data points to inform investors of the procedure dynamics in the second quarter. Given the uncertain scope and duration of the COVID pandemic and uncertain timing of global recovery and economic normalization, we continue to believe that Q2 procedure results aren't indicative of forward trends. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions."

Our focus now and in the past is the safety and well-being of patients, care teams, our communities and our employees. Turning first to global procedures. We ended Q2, 2020 down 19% compared with Q2, 2019. The underlying driver for this decline has been the growth of COVID-19 and the communities that our customers serve. While we saw procedure declines in all categories, urology and thoracic procedures were relatively resilient, while gynecology experienced the greatest decline. Rates of recovery from lows by procedure types were more uniform. We've seen hospitals with adequate supplies of staff, PPE and physical resources returned to above 90% of pre-COVID procedure run rates over a few months period. Recovery above this number as dependent upon the intensity of COVID in the region, patient's comfort to return to the hospital, availability of testing and patient outreach. As we stand here in July, we see the continued growth of COVID in some regions, both domestically and internationally making future predictions on hospital capacity for surgery difficult. Phillip will take you through some examples of regional differences in procedure trends later in the call. With regard to capital placements, we installed 178 new systems in Q2, 2020. This compares to 273 installs in Q2, 2019 and 237 installs in Q1, 2020. The new installs in Q2, 2020 represent a clinical installed base growth of 9% after accounting for trade-ins. While these numbers are lower than prior year and prior quarter, frankly, they are greater than our expectation coming into the second quarter, due to strong performance in Asia and some larger IDN placements in the U.S. That said, we know the correlation between system utilization in the form of procedure demand and capital availability at hospitals is a strong one. Hospitals will seek to absorb existing capacity before installing the capital. So on average globally, we expect a challenging near to mid-term environment for future capital placements, as COVID-19 wears on and hospital expenditures remain constrained. Because COVID is impacting locales differently, we see significant variability in procedure growth and new system placement interest by region. Marshall will take you through capital placement trends and risks later in the call. Stepping back and evaluating hospital approaches to surgery during this period, we see some principles that are being applied broadly. During local rapid growth of COVID in a hospital catchment area, their initial response is to align and train their workforce, stabilize their PPE and testing capability, and if I see resources are scarce, the first surgeries that can be delayed with a managed risk to the patient. As staff material in ICU resources free up either by diverting patients to alternative sites of care or within the four walls of the hospital, program directors, triaged patients in need of surgery and ramp back up, the sites become less impacted. We have observed that outreach education and diagnostic visits and procedures come back. The surge of COVID in communities that represent our core markets, either from initial spread or secondary growth is occurring now. Add to the significant anecdotal evidence of delayed diagnostic visits for non-COVID illness, and we expect that the recovery tale of surgery will be a long one, likely to last many quarters. The ultimate timing and shape of a recovery remains uncertain. The drivers of a sustained recovery in surgery will likely vary regionally, and may be predicated on the extent and duration of COVID outbreaks, the availability of human, material and physical resources to concurrently treat both COVID and other disease, patient comfort in returning to care centers for diagnostics or treatment, and finally, the relative health of the broader economy and hospital finances. At Intuitive we're focused on those activities and priorities within our control. They are as follows: first, we're focused on the health and well-being of our customers, our employees and our communities. As COVID has ramped in our communities, we instituted employee health and safety protocols, and have been tracking our performance and refining our methods. We're also working with our foundation and others to produce and donate PPE for customers in the communities in which we work and live, having delivered to date to over 1 million pieces of PPE. Second, we focused on inventory and supply chain management. So far, product availability has been strong. Thanks to the relentless work of our supply chain teams and our partners. Third, we implemented our customer financial relief program in the quarter. The timeliness and the design of the program has been well received by our customers. Fourth, we continue to invest in our high priority programs, recognizing that high quality MIS is likely more important in the coming years post-COVID not less so. Fifth, we're evaluating those activities that should be accelerated in the incurrent environment, and for which demand is likely to be durable post-COVID. Finally, we're constraining spend where we believe it is suboptimal in the current environment. Turning to instruments, beginning Q4 this year, we plan to introduce an updated set of select and Arista instruments for use with da Vinci X and XI, that will enable increased use beyond the current 10 years lifespan, part of our extended use program. Extended use will vary from two to eight additional uses per instrument, and is the result of continuous and significant investment in the design and production of our instrument technologies that have resulted in improved quality and durability. In addition, we'll concurrently lower the price of some other instruments that are most commonly used in lower acuity procedures. We are dedicated to support our customers' pursuit of the quadruple aim, defined as better patient outcomes, better patient experiences, better care team experiences and lower total cost to treat per patient episode. The long-term opportunity for our products and services is substantial. Both in high acuity complex procedures and in shorter duration lower acuity cases, where customers are understandably more cost sensitive. Some under risk instruments are used in every procedure. So our extended use program helps all customers, and in particular those performing lower acuity cases, which are among the fastest growing procedures. As the program rolls out, I&A cost for customers performing lower acuity procedures will be highly competitive, with non-robotic MIS approaches. I have described our commitment to a virtuous cycle of value adjustment for our customers driving volume increases, allowing us to invest in design and manufacturing at scale, and giving us the opportunity to share these savings with our customers, to allow them to use our products more broadly. This program is another step in this journey. Our extended use program has been years in the making, and its timing is fortuitous relative to COVID. We're pleased to bring it to our customers now. The program will negatively impact our near-term revenue, but not substantially impact our gross margin for affected instruments. It is the right decision for our customers and therefore for Intuitive long-term. Marshall will take you through financial implications of this program later in the call. Turning to advanced instruments. Our da Vinci Energy platform, which includes our next generation energy instrument and system, SynchroSeal and E-100 have made surprisingly good commercial progress in the second quarter, in spite of current environmental challenges. A testament to customer reception to its speed and precision. We also initiated our first commercial cases for E-100 and SynchroSeal in Japan in the quarter. And lastly, our 45 millimeter SureForm stapler launched in Europe in the second quarter. Turning to other programs of interest. Our Ion program continues to march forward in the face of COVID headwinds. Three systems were placed in the quarter and our clinical trial is progressing. Design and manufacturing teams continue to make progress on incorporating learnings to allow us to drive towards wider distribution in the future. While our progress in our precise trial for Ion has been slowed, we're seeing a return to cases as our clinical trial partners come free. For our SP program, our teams continue to support our early customers. Average monthly utilization for SP in Korea continues to exceed that of XI, a strong positive that speaks to early interest in the platform by surgeons and their patients. In addition to our learning from Korea, we are working with regulatory agencies regarding expansion of indications. The regulatory environment in the U.S. and EU has become more complex for new systems over time, made more challenging by diversion of resources at hospitals and at regulators to fight COVID, which impacts clinical trials and regulatory reviews. We'll update progress on additional indications for SP, as we have greater clarity. In our intelligence and analytics programs, our teams are performing well. And we are leveraging our prior investments in cloud computing, training technologies and analytics prowess. We have focused on our integration of cloud technologies with InTouch to accelerate access to remote proctoring in certain regions. We had already moved to a network subscription model for our simulation technology platform called SimNow, which is helping us decrease travel for surgeons for some elements of surgical training. Use of our hospital analytics programs is accelerating, even through the turbulence of 2020, helping hospitals and us in planning for system use and dynamic times like these. Before concluding my prepared remarks, let's step back. We cannot yet see the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. When the lessons from this event are absorbed, I believe high quality minimally invasive care will be more important to the future, not less so. A balanced approach to improving the quadruple aim remains our North Star. Our priorities for the next few quarters are as follows: first, continued strong performance on customer employee and community safety, while ensuring supply chain stability. Second, continued support of our customers adapted to their specific conditions, different customers are at different stages in this period, and we'll support them according to their needs. Third, advancing our priority programs, instruments, accessories, endoscopy systems and intelligence programs. And finally disciplined spend management during a period of change. I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who'll take you through financial matters in greater detail. We can, David. Yes. Yes. Thank you. I appreciate the question. On the first question of do we think that it changes the volume of procedures that might be accessed by our technology? The answer to that is yes. I think the real question will be timeline. A little bit hard to predict the timeline in the near-term just because I think a lot of it will have to do with COVID and recovery. So that will kind of blur the speed with which it happens. But if you look out over a couple of years, we clearly think that customers want to use our products, they want to use them broadly and different procedure domains, like general surgery but also broadly regionally. And to the extent that we can help them with economics, we think they have a preference to use our products, and we think that will help, that's why we did it. On question two on timeline, we have been working at it for some time. These changes and manufacturing process improvements have taken years to get right. I think being a little too fancy in the timeline doesn't help the company or our customers, we think that it will be appreciated that we have done it, it will be appreciated that we have done it now. And overtime, I think we'll look back on it and be happy what we thought it as expeditiously as we could. Yes. So just sanding back to the capital, it's really variable regionally, so where they are not strongly affected by COVID or they're recovering strongly then capital rotates forward again you saw that in China. And there we feel good about leasing systems or selling systems. In China they buy them, they don't lease them, but in other markets, where they are interested in leasing, we're happy to do that. In regions that are being disrupted by COVID where the flow of patients is changing because of either delays like surgery, or delays in diagnostic pipelines, there they have capacity on the existing installed base. They may want to move those systems, they may want to upgrade them, but in general we have seen and we have seen this in years past, act one as an operator of a hospital was to use your existing capacity before expanding it. And there, I don't think leasing is the major issue. I think the real issue is them getting back to surgery and getting ready to the extent that they have demand, leasing helps us, so I think it's kind of secondary to recovery from COVID in the U.S. primarily. Yes, we get to ask like questions periodically. I don't see a philosophical shift by heads of perioperative services to try to shift share in response to COVID. In a really hard hit area, if they are doing everything they can and the only thing they have available is something other than MIS they might go that way, I don't think that's their r primary objective of the health system. And pretty quickly they want to return to what they believe is offering the patient the best outcome. Looking in the evidence, we don't see any evidence of share shifts at this time. Let's not say they aren't there, it's just that nothing has really come up. And what we do see is as much positive for robotics as anything else. Yes. We've seen -- it really depends regionally. So I guess what we've seen is variance regionally. And hard hit areas we'll see the implementation of deferrals again in other places that had kind of round one and it is starting to creep back in. They're assuming to manage it concurrently a little bit better. Netting it out the first few weeks in July looks really wavy, hard to call a good trend certainly would not call it a recovery in July in the United States. Yes, certainly true in the U.S. Sure. So, we did see -- as we reach the end of the quarter, we did see additional postponements of purchases. And we did hear from hospitals that they were back to evaluating their budget, thinking about what the ramifications of the costs of COVID treatment were, as well as thinking about the longer-term impacts of COVID in terms of potential recession and impact on their funds. And so I think, the quarter was affected. The capital quarter was affected by COVID. And going forward, you're right, there will be first, we think the impact of trying to bring back up systems to full utilization. 27% is a pretty steep decline. And we would expect that they will seek to fill that before they go out and buy more capital, particularly when they're already strained on the financial side. So, I think if we started to see it this quarter, and I think we're going to continue to see pressures on capital spend. Sure. On that system shifts in the quarter, I'll start to answer and I'll ask Marshall to jump in and provide a little additional color. I think a lot of what we saw in Q2, in the U.S. was around momentum. Capital pipelines are multi-month engagements for our sales teams and for our customers. They have long-term commitments. They're fairly far down the pipeline. And in some cases, I think they know they want to do this long-term. They went ahead and closed. Outside to us, we had strength because you're starting to see procedure recoveries. And they're looking to build capacity for additional procedures. With regard to whether a particular sales program or the introduction of a loaner program and so on that really drove that number. I would not guide you that way. I don't really think that's true. But Marshall wanted to step in. Over the last few years we've seen an increase in clinical data requirements and evidenced generation per new platform, as we come out and we've been talking to you about that over last several years. With regard to introducing new platforms us or anybody else, I think the pathway depends on the details of the claims, what's being claimed, what procedures are being done, and the details of the predicates being used. And that would guide any of the conversations we would have with FDA, or frankly, our competitors would have. So I really can't call out what direction it will go for everybody. We do see the discussions being pretty rational, and they just have required additional data sets as time goes on, and nothing we've heard from the last couple of weeks of earnings calls as kind of changed our perspective on what we've seen. I think we've seen both heroic effort on the part of our teams. We are blessed by having a medical office inside the company and surgeons and medical people who work for the company directly. So we implemented protocols that allowed us to stay at leading edge of where safety protocols ought to be for infectious disease, and do our best to be able to keep making work, making progress. Our engineering teams have been really creative and thoughtful about getting work done. So we have seen some delays for sure. I wish I would say otherwise, but it's just reality. That said, I think that the teams have thought pretty hard to keep our programs progressing and to not just accept slips because COVID exists. Where we are -- where those things are a little bit out of our control tend to be on things that are in clinical trials, as we mentioned, there you're going back and forth between hospital, institution on the frontlines. They are using the point of their resources and ways that are important to them to manage COVID, we fully understand that. So there sometime it's really us in the support mode. Where we can control it? We can control our environment, we can relay out our spaces, our labs and so on, and we can make a little more progress. So we see some slips but we also see great effort to manage the slips. I'm going to ask Marshall answer the first part of that question around have we seen acceleration in the data set and then I'll answer the second part of question around what do we think might happen going forward. So, Marshall if you would jump in on what we've seen so far? Yes, I'll jump in on my side. I think that surgery in those environments, what actually happens in the operating room is well understood. And robotics and all robotics can play a real role there. What really determines whether something's in an ambulatory setting, hospital-owned, outpatient department setting or inside a hospital and booked as the same day surgery the differences there are largely driven by reimbursement and reimbursement policy. To the extent that reimbursement policy stays as it is, then I don't think you'll see a huge move of the kind of procedures that Intuitive does into the ASCs. But if reimbursement policy were to change in the future, then we will change with it and go there. So there's a lot of same day surgery or outpatient surgery that's done on da Vinci devices, where they live has a lot to do with reimbursement. So for us, it's -- where does it make sense to be performed logistically, where does it make sense to be performed from a reimbursement perspective and then they have the right tools, technologies and training. And I think we can adjust to that over time. Yes. In Korea, the nice thing is that the regulatory clearance allows broad clinical application. As a result, they can do procedures in urology and thoracic and gynecology and head and neck. And they're also looking at procedures in the breast. There I think it's less about low acuity. And I think they're really exploring, where does the single incision or natural orifice approach really drive clinical value up. The surgeons are I think, thoughtful and innovative here. And that's exciting to us. In the U.S., we need to run trials and get additional data as we've said before for colorectal applications and for some of the other things that we have in the pipeline. So that will take us some time. So we look to Korea to say, okay, what does demand look like when not constrained by the regulatory setting? The nice utilization or high throughput sort of tells us two things. One is, there's a real interest in exploring the hypothesis that this creates better outcomes. We can also look at the data there and start to see where it does indeed. That's exciting. The second thing is it puts the product through the tests of high throughput high turnaround is a well-designed in that setting. And can they use it as much? And that's been powerful for learning but also encouraging for us as to the maturity of the product even at this early stage. So that's how we're looking at Korea and it will help inform our regulatory strategy in other parts of the world. Yes, I'll start and Marshall will help you. I'll ask you to jump in and add some color. It's clearly challenged, and one of the things that we're working on. First, right up front is particularly in the United States, doctors are focused on other things and travel which some training requires is strained. So for us, two things have been going on. One of them is to see if we can forward deploy our training assets to make travel easier or extremely convenient, travel by car for example rather than by plane or use of digital tools and cloud technologies to be able to get access to some of the materials that they might use. We're actually encouraged on that front, I think we have some investments we have made over the years that we can leverage to help and we're seeing the beginnings of that. So I think that side looks good. That said, training requires demand generation, requires interactions with our sales teams in addition to training once they get going. So its substantially below prior levels, we're starting to see the beginnings of it coming back, but I'll let Marshal give you a little bit of color there. Thanks, Rick. For us we have really focused on being tightly focused on really making measurable improvements to the quad aim, really looking forward looking through windshield rather than in the side mirrors as to what, we think is important. I guess what I'd say is the greatest limitation for us so far has not been opportunity, I think to do interesting things. There's an enormous amount of opportunity out there to make improvements and there's an enormous technology opportunity. I think the biggest challenge in the great limiting step for us has really been to continue to deploy our programs with excellence. And so that's been rate limiting step on growth. I think that other companies out there are investing in things that make sense that are interesting. I think the vision about where the world might be in 10 or 15 years is not a complicated one, I think it's reasonably shared. And I think what will differentiate Intuitive and other companies is really the ability to deliver these complex technologies at a very high quality level, and then ways that customers can really use to access their resources. So, I look around at what's going on outside, and I think they are engaging some of the both opportunities that are out there in the world and some of the challenges of doing this well and delivering it. So for us, I guess I didn't wake up this week and think that the world has changed because of somebody else's conference call. Okay. I think there's two drivers of additional capital. One of them is the need for additional capacity driven by surgeon and patient demand for da Vinci procedures. To the extent that that demand is suppressed because of COVID, fears about COVID or delays in diagnostic pipelines that will pressure the capital pipeline. That varies regionally. So where COVID is well-managed, we see knock on the usual types of sales activities, where COVID is very intense, not surprisingly, they were focused on other things. The second thing that can drive capital demand is new features, product that they want access to because they have older technology. And in that case, if they have the attention span to pursue it and the capital or leasing dollars to do something about it, then we can continue to make progress. The prior one, the issue of absorbing existing demand in the field -- procedure demand in the field will be the dominant one in my opinion in the next few months. How long that lasts has a lot to do with COVID and really none of us know how long that will be. So we'll be ready, we'll react. We are in a strong position from an organization point of view. I think we are able to run the business for the long-term. And so we'll do our best in that period. And we'll see it as it as it plays out. Well, that was our last question. Thank you. In closing, we continue to believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams, in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim:better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams, and ultimately a lower total cost to treat of care. We believe value creation, surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months."

            "name": "Marshall Mohr",
            "content": "Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Key business metrics for the second quarter were as follows: second quarter, 2020 procedures decreased approximately 19% compared with the second quarter of 2019, and decreased approximately 22% compared with last quarter. Second quarter system placements of 178 systems decreased 35% compared with 273 systems last year, and decreased 25% compared with 237 systems last quarter. We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems over last year by 9% to approximately 5,764 systems. This gross rate compares with 11% last quarter and 13% last year. Utilization of clinical systems in the field measured by procedures per system declined approximately 27% compared with last year, and declined 23% compared with last quarter. Let me walk through the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on procedures and system placements and how it varied by market. The impact of COVID-19 varied significantly among geographies. To assist in your understanding of this dynamic, we have posted a graph showing U.S., China, Japan, and Germany procedures in Investor Relations portion of our website. In that graph, we compare procedures to the average of the first two complete weeks of the first quarter, which we have characterized as pre-COVID-19 levels. In the U.S., procedure volume started the second quarter at around 30% of pre-COVID-19 levels, and grew by the middle of June to nearly the level measured in the first two weeks of the first quarter. However, with the resurgence of COVID-19 regionally in U.S., and related deferrals of elective surgeries, procedures began to decline in the last weeks of the quarter. We expect to see da Vinci surgeries decline further in July, as the pandemic continues to spread and hospitals dedicate human and physical resources to the treatment of COVID-19 in a way from other procedures. Second quarter procedures in China, Japan and Korea grew well year-over-year, as COVID had a lower impact on these markets. In Europe, the impact of COVID varied widely with Germany experiencing year-over-year single digit growth, while France, UK, and Italy experienced large declines. Capital sales in the U.S. and Europe reflected lower procedures and delayed capital spending, while hospitals revisit their capital budgets, given the impacts of COVID-19. On the other hand, capital sales in several of our Asia direct markets, including China, Japan, and Korea were better than anticipated. System placements will likely continue to be pressured by hospital spending, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 and the result into economic pressures. Also, as system utilization declined by 27% year-over-year, hospitals have excess capacity that they will likely seek to fill before purchasing additional systems. The extent and duration of COVID-19 and subsequent resurgences in the U.S. and other parts of the world is uncertain. The time and extent to which da Vinci procedures may recover will vary by market. However, as we believe surgery is durable and with the long-term worldwide opportunity for robotic assisted interventions remain significant. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. Second quarter revenue was $852 million, representing a 22% decrease from last year and a 23% decrease from last quarter. Under the previously announced customer relief program, we're providing service credits to customers related to lower use of their systems during the second and third quarters, as hospital treat COVID patients. Revenue reflects $59 million of service credits granted to customers in the second quarter. As procedures in the U.S. and Europe recovered more quickly in the second quarter, the credits issued were less than expected. We are now anticipating the total cost of the customer relief program will be in the range of $80 million to $110 million. Second quarter placements included 21 into China, representing a greater proportion of total placements relative to the prior year in prior quarter. As leasing is prohibited in China and most systems are placed within Greenfield hospitals, the worldwide percent of leasing and trade-ins has declined. Leasing represented 29% of current quarter placements compared with 32% last quarter. Trade-ins represented 40% of current quarter placements compared with 57% last quarter. We would anticipate in an environment of COVID-19 as economic pressures increase, more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than reflected in historical run rates. Trade-in activity can be fluctuate and be difficult to predict. We recognized $9 million of lease buyout revenue in the second quarter compared with $12 million last quarter and $27 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure declined to approximately $1,900 per procedure, compared with just over $2,000 procedure in the first quarter of 2020, reflecting hospital usage of existing inventory as procedures decline. We expect instrument and accessory revenue per procedure to fluctuate, as hospitals adjust inventories to reflect changes in procedure volumes. Earlier today, we announced our Extended Use Program, under which in October, we will launch selected X and Xi instruments possessing 12 to 18 uses, compared with our existing 10 use instruments. These extended use instruments represent our higher volume instruments excluding stapler, monopolar and advanced energy instruments that are used in a broad set of procedures. The announcement is posted on our website. Our ability to introduce instruments with extended uses as the result of significant investments in quality and manufacturing processes over a long period of time. The extended use instruments will generally be priced higher than our 10 life instruments, reflecting the investments we've made, but the cost per use will be lower for our customers. In addition and simultaneously, we will lower the price of certain instruments used commonly in lower acuity procedures and/or lower reimbursement procedures, like cholecystectomy, inguinal hernias and benign hysterectomies in the U.S. Combined with the savings associated with extended use instruments, the resultant instrument and accessory cost for these procedures will be competitive with non-robotic MIS approaches. Overall, extended use instruments and lower instrument pricing will result in lower I&A revenue per procedure to Intuitive. For example, had the extended use instruments been available and the lower instrument pricing been in place for all of 2019, revenue for 2019 would have been $150 million to $170 million less than reported, and I&A INA per procedure would have been 7% lower. The impact of these actions on future revenue will be depended upon procedure volumes, instrument usage, mix, and whether cost elasticity will enable greater penetration into available markets. Five of the systems placed in the second quarter were SP systems, reflecting both our measured rollout of SP and the impact of COVID-19. Our rollout of SP surgical system will continue to be measured, putting systems in the hands of experience da Vinci users, while we pursue additional indications and optimize training pathways in our supply chain. COVID-19 has delayed the ability to perform the clinical trial associate with an SP colorectal procedure. We placed three Ion systems in the quarter, Ion system placements were also impacted by COVID-19. Ion system placements procedures and related information is excluded from our overall systems and procedure accounts. Our rollout of Ion will continue to be measured, while we optimize training pathways in our supply chain. The completion of the PRECISE study is delayed due to COVID-19, and we cannot predict when the PRECISE clinical study will be completed. Outside the U.S., we placed 72 systems in the second quarter, compared with 80 in the second quarter of 2019 and 55 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 18 into Europe, 18 into Japan and 21 into China, compared with 30 into Europe, 24 into Japan and eight into China in the second quarter of 2019. Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 was 62.4%, compared with 71.3% for the second quarter of 2019, and 69.7% last quarter. The decrease compared with the second quarter of 2019 and last quarter, primarily reflects period costs associated with abnormally low production. The customer relief program and higher excess in obsolete inventory charges, partially offset by higher system ASPs reflecting a favorable geographic mix. Second quarter inventory charges were approximately $27 million, primarily reflecting last generation system, vision and instrument products, which as a result of decreased demand we are now able to fulfill customer needs with new or more capable products. As revenues have pressured by COVID-19, the production levels may operate at below normal levels, which may result in higher labor cost and under absorbed overhead in reduced product margins. Pro forma operating expenses increased 3% compared with the second quarter of 2019, and decreased 11% compared with last quarter. Spending in the second quarter reflected curtailment of costs associated with the impact of COVID-19, particularly training, marketing events and travel and related expenses, partially offset by cost associated with employee relief programs and other direct costs of COVID-19. Spending during this period of the pandemic will be as follows: we will work to ensure our employees safety and well-being, including investing in PP&E and employee program. We will continue to support our customers. We will continue to invest in innovation focused on the quadruple aim. We will invest in manufacturing in our supply chain to ensure supply for our customers. We will ensure that we are prepared for periods when the spread of COVID-19 is contained. Certain costs will be lower as the underlying activities are restricted by COVID-19, including travel and related expenses, clinical trials, surgeon training and marketing events. We will eliminate spending that is ineffective due to COVID-19, like surgeon and hospital events. We will reduce the hiring of volume-related roles like sales reps and manufacturing employees as appropriate. We continue to believe that we have a unique opportunity to expand the benefits of computer-aided surgery and acute interventions around the world, and we'll continue to invest in the business for the long-term. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 36.9% compared with our expectations of 20% to 21%, reflecting a $37 million or $0.31 per diluted share charge associated with the conclusion of a tax case between an independent third-party and the IRS, related to charging foreign subsidiaries for share based compensation. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of one-time items. Our second quarter 2020 pro forma net income was $132 million or a $1.11 per share, compared with $388 million or $3.25 per share for the second quarter of 2019, and $323 million or $2.69 per share last quarter. I'll now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $68 million or $0.57 per share for the second quarter of 2020, compared with GAAP net income of $318 million or $2.67 per share for the second quarter of 2019, and GAAP net income of $314 million or $2. 62 per share for the last quarter. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation and IP charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition related items, and legal settlements. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $6.1 billion compared with $5.9 billion at March 31, 2020. Cash generated from operations was partially offset by investment in working capital and our infrastructure. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. Our current thoughts on capital deployment are in the following order. We recognize the hardship that COVID places on our customers and we will work with customers, to ease the burden of lower da Vinci utilization, including providing customers with more flexible financing. We will ensure secure supply chain and build appropriate levels of inventory to ensure customer supply, particularly as procedures resume. We will invest in securing our customers. We will continue our open market repurchase program consistent with our prior practice. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Philip, who will go over our procedure performance. Sure. The margin on the products will be relatively consistent with current margins, so the impact is nominal in terms of 2019. It's a slight down only because you have less instrument and accessory revenue. And from a mix perspective, you wind up with more systems revenue, and systems revenue have lower margins, but the individual margins on the instruments are not that different. I think you characterized it right. I don't think there was any particular program that drove it. And I think that it really does reflect momentum. Gary alluded to a couple of larger IDN deals getting done. Those were months, if not a year in the making and so it takes time to get them closed out. And when you're getting close, even though there's COVID virus, they went ahead. And we do see strength outside the U.S., particularly in Asia where our COVID has started to recover. In terms of ASCs, again ASC is the number of da Vinci type procedures, procedures that da Vinci addresses in ASCs is actually not all the significant. What you really -- if you are talking about HOPDs or ASCs that are owned by hospital IDNs, then we have a large presence and we are addressing procedures that are presented there. We haven't seen -- I haven't, I'm not aware of movements of large patient quantities to ASCs during this period. I think hospitals are struggling to meet all needs in terms of COVID. So, I don't think I have anything else to add there. Yes, it has been below our historical levels. And the importance of it varies depending on the geography as well. So we're in -- let's say in Japan where you have newer procedures that you're trying to adopt, training becomes a more important element and let's say in the United States where people can otherwise be trained in their institutions or that we're talking about mature procedures where proctoring and so forth is more readily available. So, I think in the United States the contribution of new surgeons is much lower than let's say in geography like Japan. And so we did see quite a drop-off in training earlier in the United States, because of reluctance to travel and other COVID-related reasons. And as Gary said, we're finding other ways to perform in that training, and it could have some impact on us, but again, it's not as big a contributor in the United States as our existing surgeons."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Calvin Darling, Senior Director of Finance, Investor Relations for Intuitive Surgical. Please go ahead.\nCalvin Darling: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO and Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today\u2019s call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 7, 2020. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC\u2019s website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Latest Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today\u2019s press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. In addition, this quarter, we have also posted charts illustrating da Vinci procedure trends in Q1, which are intended to provide additional perspective and detail regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Today\u2019s format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter\u2019s business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our financial results. Then I will discuss procedure details. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.\nGary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. Our first quarter 2020 performance reflects the rise of COVID-19 and the global response to it. On this call, we will describe our experience in the quarter, our framework for engaging those who rely on us and our priorities and actions in these challenging times. Our focus now and in the past is the safety and well-being of patients, care teams, our communities and our employees. For the first 2.5 months of the quarter, procedure performance was at the high-end of our expectations with procedure trends consistent with the prior quarters. General surgery in the United States was strong as was urology outside the United States. As we disclosed previously, recommendations by surgical societies and healthcare organizations to delay certain surgeries to conserve resources for COVID Care are having a material impact on surgery broadly, including robotic-assisted surgery. We support government and hospital policies to direct resources to COVID Care and recognize these policies very greatly by region and by hospital system. We are analyzing customer procedure deferrals in response to COVID. Patients undergoing da Vinci procedures do so in response to an underlying disease. While these procedures maybe delayed in the short-term without treatment of some sort, the disease in its impairment persist and often worsens. Said simply, the vast majority of these patients will ultimately see treatment. We are analyzing both the clinical drivers of return to treatment and customer plans and processes to recover. The categories of benign disease and cancer are not entirely predictive of the urgency of surgical intervention. Clearly, aggressive cancers require treatment and are delayed at significant risk to patients. Likewise, some benign conditions require timely intervention as well. We are working internally and with customers to understand their needs to restart surgery for those patients whose condition requires action. The effect of COVID on the surgical market has impacted different regions differently. Starting with China, procedure performance was impacted by COVID earliest with sharp declines in surgery as resources were diverted to respond to COVID Care. Procedures in China have been recovering steadily since that time. However, steep declines in procedures that can be deferred are occurring in other regions, particularly Europe and the United States. For the quarter, procedures grew 10% over Q1 of 2019 given early strength followed by sharp declines in the last 2 weeks of the quarter. I refer you to the materials we posted to our website prior to this call to get a better picture of the dynamics in Q1. With regard to systems, our total number of placements for the quarter was below our expectations in spite of having strong capital performance in the first 2 months of the quarter. In March, rapid changes by hospitals delayed some system placements and are likely to significantly impact system contracts and placements in future quarters. Financial pressures exerted on hospitals in response to treating COVID patients and deferring other care, are likely to be significant and are unlikely to resolve quickly. Marshall and Calvin will take you through procedure and capital dynamics in the quarter in greater detail later in the call. To help articulate our priorities and actions during this period of change, we have adopted the phased framework described in the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s national coronavirus response. In Phase 1, which is the slow-the-spread phase of coronavirus response, Intuitive\u2019s priorities are as follows. First, we are focused on the health and safety of all those we serve, our customers, our communities, our employees and our suppliers implementing early and continuous updates to our health and safety policies and processes. Second, we are supporting our customers according to their priorities, clinical, operational and economic. Third, we are focused on continuity of supply by working with our suppliers and distributors. To-date, our delivery capability and inventory positions are on firm footing. Fourth, we are securing our workforce economically. We have built an outstanding team over the years and we believe their strength will be essential in the recovery that follows. Fifth, in partnership with our Intuitive Foundation, we are contributing material product and volunteers to the frontlines of COVID support. We have designed, produced and delivered PPE to local hospitals and our staff have volunteered in several communities. And sixth, we are eliminating avoidable spend during the stop-the-spread phase of the virus. The current situation in hospitals responding to viral care is fluid and the depth and duration of this disruption is difficult to predict. New issues are arising with respect to surgery that will require mitigation in time. Some hospital customers and some of our suppliers will experience significant financial stress in this period. Regulatory agency priorities and resources are shifting globally as they devote their resources to infectious disease detection and treatment needs. And lastly, surgeons are being dedicated to frontline COVID work or being idled by a lack of resources in this period. We are adjusting quickly to the issues described and we are confident in both the need for surgery and in our products as the response to COVID evolves. We are planning for Phase 2 to return to surgery for those patients who can\u2019t wait. Those countries that have been managing the disease the longest have returned to da Vinci surgery steadily over time or have been able to maintain da Vinci surgery concurrently with COVID Care. We are analyzing the order in which different procedures are likely to return and the strategies likely to be employed by hospital systems to manage surgical practices while still providing COVID Care. For example, some health systems are dedicating specific sites to COVID Care, while operating rooms for outpatient surgeries are dedicated in other locations. We will support customers closely as they bring capabilities back online. We are also adapting our training in Intuitive telepresence capabilities to support team training and skills retention in a Phase 2 world. We are optimizing our R&D facilities and methods to allow us to progress on important innovation programs while employing up-to-date workplace safety guidelines. Lastly, we look forward to accelerating clinical trial activities and the associated regulatory work as trial sites increased their surgical volume. In constructing our financial plans in the current environment, we are balancing five objectives that reflect our priorities mentioned above. They are: first, customer-focused economic policies that meet their needs during this disruption; second, employee policies that secure our valuable workforce needed for hospital recovery and to drive our innovation; third, securing and stabilizing critical supply chain resources; fourth, eliminating spending that is not effective during this period, for example, pausing, hiring and volume-related roles and spend on projects that cannot progress in the current phase; and finally, shareholder policies that don\u2019t interfere with the priorities mentioned above. We remain in close contact with our customers, our community representatives, our employees and our suppliers during this period. While the depth and duration of the current challenges are difficult to predict, the need for both COVID and non-COVID Care is clear. Given time and resources, health systems have continued to choose da Vinci. The collaborations and solutions orientation among our stakeholders is clear and inspiring. I believe our long-term opportunity is substantial and our business is well-positioned financially and organizationally to weather this COVID outbreak. And I will now turn the call over to Marshall who will take you through financial matters in greater detail.\nMarshall Mohr: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Procedures and shipments are consistent with our preliminary press release of April 8th. Key business metrics for the first quarter were as follows: First quarter 2020 procedures increased approximately 10% compared with the first quarter of 2019 and decreased approximately 9% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth continues to be driven by general surgery in the U.S. and urology worldwide. Calvin will review details of procedure growth later in this call. First quarter system placements of 237 systems increased 1% compared with 235 systems last year and decreased 29% compared with 336 systems last quarter. We expanded our install base of da Vinci systems by 11% to approximately 5,669 systems. This growth rate compares with 12% in the last quarter and 13% last year. Utilization of clinical systems in the field measured by procedures per system declined approximately 2% compared with 6% growth last quarter and 5% growth last year. Let me walk through the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on procedures and system placements and how it varied by market. Prior to the spread of COVID-19, we experienced procedure growth trends consistent with those experienced in the fourth quarter, including strength in general surgery, growth in mature procedures in U.S. and growth in O-U.S. urology. We also saw early strength in capital placements, particularly in U.S., with over half the systems placed in the quarter being arrangements where the sales cycle was mostly completed in the fourth quarter. Beginning in January, we saw substantial reduction in da Vinci procedures in China, and by early February, procedures per week in China had declined by 90% compared with the weekly rates experienced in early January. As the COVID-19 subsided in China in March, da Vinci procedures began to recover, and by the end of the quarter, China procedures per week were approximately 70% of the early January rate. We saw varied impacts on da Vinci procedures in some other early countries affected by COVID-19. COVID-19 had little impact in Korea and Japan in the quarter and severe impact in Italy. In summary, the COVID-19 disruption to da Vinci procedures varied by country and the disruption to worldwide da Vinci procedures was not significant through the middle of March. As the pandemic spread to Western Europe and to the U.S., we experienced a significant decline in da Vinci procedures in the last half of March. Procedures per week in the U.S., which represented approximately 70% of our procedures in 2019, declined approximately 65% relative to earlier in the quarter. Procedures in France, Germany and the UK also declined but to a lesser extent than the U.S. We have provided you with supplemental information on our website to enable you to understand the magnitude of the impacts on procedures and the variation between countries. As I indicated most of the sales cycle for approximately half of the system placements in the quarter were completed in the fourth quarter. As we progressed through the quarter and the impact of the pandemic progressed, customers deferred decisions to purchase or lease systems into future quarters and in some cases indefinitely. The depth and extent to which COVID-19 will impact individual markets will vary based on the availability of testing capabilities, PPE, ICUs and ORs, medical staff and government interventions. As COVID-19 continues to spread, it is likely that da Vinci procedures will decline from those experienced in the first quarter. In addition, we would expect that system placements will follow the decline in procedures. While some markets like China appear to be recovering, it is possible that a recurrence of COVID-19 will negatively impact da Vinci procedures. And not all markets will recover at the same pace. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: Utilization of the install base declined by 2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on procedures coupled with the fourth quarter system placement strength. When procedures increase, customers will first look to utilize existing da Vinci capacity, which is likely to depress capital placements. First quarter placements included a higher concentration of multiple system arrangements with hospitals and IDNs seeking to standardize on fourth generation systems. Many of these replacements were completed as capital leases. As a result, first quarter trade-ins were higher and operating leases were lower as a percentage of total placements than in the fourth quarter of 2019. We would anticipate in an environment of COVID-19 as economic pressures increase, more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than purchases. Trade-in activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict. However, given the impacts of COVID-19, we expect the number of trade-ins to decrease. We recognized $12 million of lease buyout revenue in the first quarter compared with $34 million last quarter and $12 million last year. There were no returns of da Vinci systems for leases that ended in the quarter. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly from quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure grew to just over $2,000 per procedure compared with $1,980 in the fourth quarter of 2019, reflecting instruments and accessory purchases prior to the decline in procedures. We expect that as hospitals adjust inventory levels for lower surgery volumes, instrument and accessory revenue will decrease. Three of the systems placed in the first quarter were SP systems reflecting both our measured rollout of SP and the impact of COVID-19. Our rollout of SP Surgical System will continue to be measured, putting systems in the hands of experienced da Vinci users while we pursue additional indications and optimize training pathways in our supply chain. Given the impact of COVID-19, our ability to perform clinical trial associated with an SP colorectal procedure is likely delayed. We placed eight Ion systems in the quarter. Ion system placements were also impacted by COVID-19. Ion system placements are excluded from our overall systems count and will be reported separately. Procedures and other information associated with Ion are excluded from our prepared remarks and will be reported separately when they become material. Our rollout of Ion will continue to be measured while we optimize training pathways in our supply chain. The completion of the PRECISE study will be delayed due to COVID-19. We cannot predict when the PRECISE clinical study will be completed. Outside the U.S., we placed 55 systems in the first quarter compared with 81 in the first quarter of 2019 and 140 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 25 in Europe, 10 into Japan and 9 into China compared with 49 into Europe, 13 into Japan and 3 into China in the first quarter of 2019. Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the first quarter was 69.7% compared with 71.2% for the first quarter of 2019 and 72.2% last quarter. The decrease compared with the first quarter of 2019 and last quarter primarily reflects product mix, higher fixed cost with on lower production and costs associated with Si product transitions partially offset by cost reductions. As revenues are pressured by COVID-19, we will reduce production levels, which will result in higher labor costs and under-absorbed overhead and a significant reduction of product margin. Pro forma operating expenses increased 15% compared with the first quarter 2019 and decreased 8% compared with last quarter. Spending in the first quarter reflected normal business activities into March and a curtailment of cost associated with impact of COVID-19. While certain spending will decrease in the second quarter as a result of the reduction in revenue and activities limited by the pandemic, much of our spending will continue. Major categories of spending and likely trends for the second quarter are as follows: We will continue to support our customers. We will continue to invest in innovation focused on the quadruple aim. We will invest in manufacturing in our supply chain to ensure supply for our customers. We will ensure we are prepared for periods when the spread of COVID-19 is contained. Certain costs will decline as underlying activities are restricted by COVID-19, including travel and related expenses, clinical trials, surgeon training and customer data collection. We will eliminate spending that is ineffective due to COVID-19 like surgeon and hospital events. We are pausing the hiring of volume-related roles like sales reps and manufacturing employees. We continue to believe that we have a unique opportunity to expand the benefit for computer-aided surgery and acute interventions around the world and will continue to invest in the business for the long-term. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 20% compared with our expectations of 20% to 21%, reflecting geographic mix. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities, and with the impact of one-time items. Our first quarter 2020 pro forma net income was $323 million or $2.69 per share compared with $312 million or $2.61 per share for the first quarter of 2019 and $417 million or $3.48 per share for last quarter. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $314 million or $2.62 per share for the first quarter of 2020 compared with GAAP net income of $307 million or $2.56 per share for the first quarter of 2019 and GAAP net income of $358 million or $2.99 per share for last quarter. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified in our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation and IP charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition-related items and legal settlements. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $5.9 billion compared with $5.8 billion at December 31, 2019. Cash generated from operations was partially offset by stock repurchases and investments in working capital and our infrastructure. We repurchased approximately 192,000 shares for $100 million at an average price of $522 per share. Our current thoughts on capital deployment are in the following order. We recognized the hardships that COVID places on our customers and we work with customers to ease the burden of lower da Vinci utilization, including providing customers with more flexible financing. We will work to secure our supply chain and build appropriate levels of inventory to ensure customer supply, particularly as procedures resume. We will invest in securing our employees. We will continue to our open market repurchase program consistent with our prior practice. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Calvin who will go over procedure performance.\nCalvin Darling: Thank you, Marshall. Our overall first quarter procedure growth was approximately 10% compared to 18% during the first quarter of 2019 and 19% last quarter. Our Q1 procedure growth was driven by 9% growth in U.S. procedures and 11% growth in o-U.S. markets. Our lower first quarter 2020 procedure growth rates were a direct result of hospitals reallocating resources to meet the increasing demands of managing COVID-19. Hospitals postponed deferrable surgical procedures to make more resources available to treat COVID-19 patients. Impacts to da Vinci procedure volumes were first felt in China in January and moved to other o-U.S. markets as the quarter progressed. As of mid-March, our overall procedures were trending towards the higher end of our expectations, including the benefit of an extra working day in Q1 2020. At this stage of the quarter, the impacts of COVID-19 in the earlier impacted countries were offset by strength in U.S. general surgery and mature procedures. Beginning in mid-March, we saw significant declines in procedure volume in the U.S. and Western Europe. On a worldwide basis, weekly procedures performed exiting Q1 were approximately 50% lower than the run-rate through mid-March. In the U.S., weekly procedures exiting the quarter were approximately 65% below the run-rate through mid-March. Procedures categories realizing significant declines were hernia repair, benign gynecology and bariatric procedures. Lesser impacted procedures were thoracic and colorectal surgeries. Outside of the United States, weekly procedures exiting the quarter were approximately 25% below the run-rate through mid-March. The lower o-U.S. decline primarily reflects procedure volume recoveries in China offset by broad declines in Western Europe. In Q1, procedures in Japan were less affected by COVID-19. Growth in Japan procedures continued at a growth rate over 40%. We provide these data points to inform investors of the procedure dynamics experienced during the first quarter, which were unprecedented. Due to the uncertain scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertain timing of global recovery and economic normalization, we withdrew our financial and procedure guidance on April 8, and these Q1 procedure results aren\u2019t necessarily indicative of any forward-looking trend. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDavid Lewis: Good afternoon. Can you hear me?\nGary Guthart: We can. Hi, David.\nDavid Lewis: Okay. Sorry about that. I am not sure what happened. So, Gary, just want to talk about capital cycle a little bit. I mean, I know we\u2019re not going to get specifics on 2020, but if I think about the 2008 financial crisis, the strain on hospitals is certainly different today than it was back in 2008 and your business model frankly is very different today than it was back in 2008. How would you compare and contrast sort of the impact on your business through COVID-19 relative to what we saw in the last major financial crisis impacting hospitals? And I had a quick follow-up.\nGary Guthart: Yes, thank you. I would start with I think they\u2019re apples and oranges from the underlying cause. So clearly this is healthcare related and policy driven in terms of deferrals, as a result a little bit hard to predict how the capital cycle will recover. You had mentioned and it\u2019s true, we have a lot more flexible approaches that are available to us with regard to making systems available. Marshall mentioned in his script they\u2019ll consume existing capacity first as they go. We\u2019ve been in contact with our customers routinely. There\u2019s a backlog growing for surgery. These folks are going to need surgery. And really our opportunity, our job as a company is to make sure we can support them however we can in terms of access to systems or motion of systems to allow them to use what they have out there, and as those systems become full again, we can think about how to increase capacity going forward and we have a few tools in the tool kit. Marshall, anything you would like to add?\nMarshall Mohr: No, I think you hit it. I think you will see more financing, more leases and alternative financing arrangements.\nDavid Lewis: Okay. That made perfect sense. And just a quick follow up on capital, Marshall, for you. You talked about in your script a couple of things, but you talked about certain orders that are being delayed or canceled versus sort of pushed indefinitely. Can you give us any sense from a percentage perspective what percent of the order book was in your mind delayed versus sort of what was either canceled or indefinitely delayed? And then you just mentioned lease rate, you\u2019ve been hovering around that 40% level. Is it reasonable to assume we should see a more material step-up in the lease rate? You said it would fluctuate as it has normally. But in my view would be that lease rate could hike up more materially now because you are incentivized to provide flexibility financing for hospitals to get these systems in. So, any color there would be very helpful, and I\u2019ll jump back in queue. Thank you.\nMarshall Mohr: Sure. For leasing, yes, in the quarter what happened, we had a number of customers that had started the sales cycle back in Q4 and were interested in standardizing on fourth generation systems and it so happens that a number of those customers wanted to do \u2013 wanted to structure the arrangement such as they were purchases, they were accounted for as purchases, and as a result, we had fewer leases this quarter. So, I don\u2019t think this quarter\u2019s indicative of our normal sort of run rate for leases as a result. Leasing going forward probably is more akin to what we were experiencing, more in the 38% range. That\u2019s under normal circumstances and I actually believe, given the COVID virus and its impacts that it will increase from there. But it\u2019s hard to predict depending on the customer and the circumstances. As far as how many customers may have postponed indefinitely or may have postponed a quarter, the conversations with them are always a little bit, hey, we are going to postpone and then they sort of throw in words about maybe another quarter, maybe another couple of quarters and some say, well, we\u2019ll get back to it but we don\u2019t have a specific timetable, and for those that say that they don\u2019t have a specific timetable that\u2019s what I\u2019m referring to as indefinitely. I don\u2019t think that there are customers running from robotic surgery. I think they actually want to do robotic surgery and I think that they will come back some time when COVID virus is handled and the procedures come back.\nDavid Lewis: Okay. Thank you so much.\nGary Guthart: Next question, please.\nOperator: Yes. The next question will come from Bob Hopkins, Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBob Hopkins: Sure. Thank you and good afternoon. I want to thank you for the incremental data that you provided this quarter on the trends throughout the quarter by geography. That was very helpful to see. And so my first question is really on the chart on China, was showing a pretty nice recovery from [indiscernible] to where you are right now. I was wondering if you could just walk through your views on how good a proxy China might be for a U.S. recovery, like why or why not. How could that be different? Just your general thoughts on that would be great. Thank you.\nGary Guthart: Thanks, Bob. Yes, you see in that chart China, you see other countries as well, Japan and so on, and what you can really see is that country policy changes the shape. I think we\u2019re encouraged by a couple of things. One is people\u2019s interest or customers\u2019 interest in using da Vinci is durable. That\u2019s been great. You had asked a specific question of how predictive is China and I think the answer there is too soon to tell for the rest of the regions. I\u2019m encouraged by it. I think it indicates the durability of demand. Having said that, I think policy matters and I think how people allocate their healthcare resources are going to change too. You can see in Japan already that the progress of their approach to disease is evolving and what that looks like on procedures will evolve. So, stay tuned is the short answer. Calvin, anything you\u2019d like to add?\nCalvin Darling: No, I think that described it pretty well.\nBob Hopkins: Okay. And then just one quick follow-up, yes, just maybe a comment on why Japan has been so resilient? And then you did mention in the prepared remarks something about \u2013 I think I missed it on one of the clinical trials that\u2019s been delayed, was wondering if you could highlight or reiterate exactly what you were communicating there? Thank you.\nGary Guthart: Okay. On the Japan side, I think that in general their system for managing their coronavirus is a little bit different than we\u2019ve seen in other countries and it\u2019s evolving in time. So, to-date, hospital operations were relatively lightly impacted as it relates to surgery relative to other countries. What that will look like in the future, I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see how that evolves. It\u2019s been interesting and instructive for us to look at data from Japan, look at data from Korea, from China, from Europe and Germany, Italy, UK, France. And that informs us going forward and in terms of getting prepared for the reopening of some of the hospital wings and surgical wings as they happen. So too soon to make the final call, but we have I think pretty good real-time information. I\u2019m going to refer to Marshall the question about clinical trial.\nMarshall Mohr: Clinical trial, what I was referring to was SP we had planned on doing a \u2013 we believe we have to do a clinical trial to get the next indication which is colorectal. Doing a clinical trial at this point in time is probably not going to happen right away. Having said that, I don\u2019t think we had plans to do it right away. We had several steps we had to go through before we got there so I say, it\u2019s delayed. It could be delayed and don\u2019t know exactly when it will get done.\nGary Guthart: Calvin, you had more to add?\nCalvin Darling: Yes, on the Ion side as well, data capture for the Ion PRECISE study we\u2019ve talked about on these calls is currently delayed. We believe that positive clinical data will be an important catalyst for broader usage of the platform, but given the lack of visibility, we\u2019re not in a position to provide a definitive revised timeline but it\u2019s unlikely that the PRECISE study will readout this year. But you look at the new platforms, both Ion and SP are both in the measured rollout phases of market introduction and early stage utilization rates for both platforms has been encouraging. Ion commercial procedure rates were up over 110% from Q4 of 2019 to Q1 of 2020. SP procedure rates grew 14% from the fourth quarter and they\u2019re up about 190% year-over-year. So really encouraging in these early phases, and Korea specifically where we have a broad clearance for SP, the utilization per system is at this point in time higher than it is for Xi.\nBob Hopkins: Thank you.\nGary Guthart: Thanks Bob.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. I am wondering if you could just talk a little bit about procedure mix, the types of procedures that may come back a little bit faster versus others presumably low score prostate cases may lag and non-emerging hernias may lag, but I am just curious even based on your experience in China in terms of the procedure that came back a little bit faster, if you could comment on that at all?\nGary Guthart: Sure. Just as a broad brush, clearly, high-risk cancers are things delayed at real risk to patients and emergent or inflamed benign disease likewise. One caution, each country has a little bit different mix of procedures going into 2020 prior to COVID becoming a bigger issue. So the mixes are a little bit different. Calvin, why don\u2019t you speak a little bit to what we have seen to-date?\nCalvin Darling: Yes. And then again, procedures, it\u2019s really they are following a continuum of urgency that are applied situationally. And like you say, clearly, the aggressive cancers require treatment and are delayed of significant risk to patients and likewise some benign conditions require timely intervention as well. We are working toward with customers to best understand the segments and we will elaborate further as the things progress. I mentioned in the prepared comments at least in the ending parts of the first quarter the more impacted procedures were things like hernia repair, benign gynecology and bariatrics with lesser impacts on things like thoracic procedures and colorectal procedures.\nGary Guthart: On my just personal channel checks, hospitals are now creating large backlogs of patients who are going to need surgery and there is \u2013 I am encouraged about their commitment to da Vinci as they go through that. So I think at some point the logistics of availability of PPE and other resources will start to free up a little bit and as they have time then they will have to attend to that group of patients and we will be there to support.\nTycho Peterson: And then maybe a follow-up on the capital comments, I appreciate the nature and the time of discussions may shift more toward alternative financing, but can you just talk maybe to the degree to which hospitals are actually engaging in capital discussions at this point as opposed to still dealing with COVID work and also curious to hear your thoughts on Europe just given capital outlook there? Thank you.\nMarshall Mohr: Like I said in our prepared remarks, capital demand, we saw deferral of purchase decisions at the end of the quarter. I would expect that to continue. I would expect also that hospitals as COVID as they are able to dedicate resources to the procedures that maybe in backlog that they will use up existing capacity and therefore it won\u2019t immediately result in capital demand. We still have conversations with some of the hospitals on capital. It\u2019s just not possible to predict exactly where it\u2019s going to come out for the quarter.\nGary Guthart: With regard to Europe, any color you want to give, Marshall?\nMarshall Mohr: Europe, we didn\u2019t see quite the same level of reduction in terms of procedures at the end of the quarter. That doesn\u2019t mean to say that it will sustain itself. It\u2019s possible that as the virus spreads that there could be additional pressures on procedures. And having said that, capital as you know we did 25 systems this quarter and what I reported in my prepared remarks, that\u2019s far lower than what we had anticipated for the quarter. And so we are still \u2013 we are seeing the same kinds of interactions with customers in Europe as we are in U.S.\nGary Guthart: Tycho, you have heard us say this before and it\u2019s really true in the data this quarter as well. Europe doesn\u2019t act as one. So what\u2019s happening in Italy feels and looks different than in Germany from our perspective, from France and from the UK. So, each will progress a little bit \u2013 on a little bit different pathway.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. Thank you.\nGary Guthart: Thanks, Tycho.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. One on procedures, one on \u2013 just on systems, on procedures, I appreciate the numbers, the percentages you provided us. I think those were exit rates from March and the slides look like those percentages continue to go down. So I apologize if I missed this, but would you be willing to provide any color on what you\u2019ve seen in the first couple of weeks here in April, just to give us a better sense to how to think about Q2? And I did have one follow-up.\nGary Guthart: Not ready to publish what\u2019s happened thus far in April. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s shockingly different from what the beginnings of what you\u2019re seeing in the charts we\u2019ve given you there. But I\u2019d also say that I don\u2019t think the next two weeks are particularly predictive of anything. I think this will flow globally here over the next weeks and months and we\u2019re really focused on how to make sure that we\u2019re supporting our customers well and flow out of it.\nLarry Biegelsen: And, Gary, thinking ahead, hospitals are going to be faced with two challenges. I think one is capacity constraints to handle postponed procedures. And second, moving procedures to alternative sites that I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks like ASCs potentially to isolate non-COVID patients or vice versa. What can you do to help hospitals with these two challenges? Thanks for taking the questions.\nGary Guthart: Yes. Appreciate it. Well a couple of things. We are well-represented in outpatient departments in hospitals already. We are absolutely able and willing to move systems to locations of care wherever they might be. We do have experience with systems in ASCs to the extent people want to move into ASC environments. We worked fine in those environments. We will be working on getting training and other resources geographically positioned where we think that folks can need additional support as they start to ramp up, recognizing that we don\u2019t think a lot of people will be jumping on planes in phase 2 so we can sort of forward deploy our resources to help people as they get ready. And lastly, it\u2019s staying in touch with our customers and surgery departments and making sure that we have inventory forward deployed for them for the kind of procedures they want to do.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thanks for taking the questions.\nGary Guthart: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Rick Wise, Stifel. Please go ahead.\nRick Wise: Hi. Good afternoon. Hi, Gary. Hi, Marshall. A couple of things. Maybe let\u2019s start with thinking about the slowdown in capital you have talked about and obviously related procedure declines. I know I\u2019m looking ahead, far ahead, and you\u2019re not comfortable really predicting the next quarter, but I just want to think about the recovery. Gary, how do we think about let\u2019s say if the slowdown in capital persists throughout 2020 or well into 2020, does that suggest that 2020 recovery won\u2019t be back to let\u2019s say 2019 levels and it\u2019s going to \u2013 it would take probably possibly until 2022 for us to see you get back at sort of a historical growth because of that slowdown in capital which might be slower to recover and therefore procedures slower to accelerate overall if you follow what I\u2019m trying to get at?\nGary Guthart: I think the way I\u2019d have you think about it is from the point of view of demand for surgery, demand for robotic assisted surgery, in that setting I think the world is queuing up a set of patients who will need care. Makes sense. I understand it. I think conserving of PPE and ICU\u2019s and other valuable resources at this time makes sense. As some of those constraints start to loosen, I think everybody will have to adjust and adapt to caring for patients who have other conditions. That is the demand that will drive everything behind it, from INA and other inventory, to access to capital and systems. We\u2019re well-positioned from an inventory point of view. We are well-positioned operationally and financially to move systems where they need to go, to put systems out on lease for usage-based models or other things to support customers the way they want to be supported and we\u2019ll be quite agile. So, on the capital side, you may see shifts in the way capital is deployed and the way that we\u2019re compensated for that capital relative to prior quarters, sort of historical norms. But we\u2019ll be leaning forward to help people when they need that help. How fast that happens, I think that has a lot to do with government policy and health system policy as to when they pivot to go treat other patients. That will determine everything else.\nRick Wise: Got it. And just sort of a separate but related question, Gary, several of our ongoing physician conversations suggested that as things recover, actually robotic capacity won\u2019t be sufficient to meet demand, which is an interesting thought and they suggested actually that on a recovery robotic surgery will lose market share so to speak of some of those deferred patients to laparoscopic surgery, to open surgery. I have no idea I would be curious to know if you have any high level thoughts about that, those physician comments? Thank you so much.\nGary Guthart: Yes. Thanks, Rick. It\u2019s possible. I think that folks rotating into open surgery, patients who are great candidates for MIS is doing that set of patients a disservice. So we will see. That may happen, hard for us to control. With regard to capacity for robotics, remember, there are a lot of robots out there and they are right now underutilized. As that flows back, we can help. Will some folks want to use lap? Maybe. From the point of view of surgeon preference, surgeon comfort what their choices are, just remember surgeons are intentional about the method of surgery they choose. They don\u2019t accidentally fall into robotic surgery training. They make those commitments and time investments for a reason and they have a preference. So, if we can fulfill their preference, great. That will be great. If we are unable to do so and they choose lap, because they couldn\u2019t get access where they wanted, well, that may happen, but that\u2019s really I think Intuitive\u2019s job to make those systems available to them if they would like to use them.\nRick Wise: Thanks so much.\nGary Guthart: Thanks, Rick.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Larry Keusch, Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nLarry Keusch: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I guess, Gary to start with just curious thinking about R&D, what changes are you making to allow the innovation engine to not stall out here? I am just curious how you are accomplishing that and what sort of processes, procedures you are putting in place?\nGary Guthart: Thank you. First thing has been to employ \u2013 to ensure, to protect the safety of our staff and those who supply us while we do our R&D. So step one has been to stay up-to-date on the latest employee work safety methods. We started our incident response team relatively early. We were up and running at full speed in terms of our incident response team in early January and so they start looking at best practice relaying out our onsite facilities as they need to be relayed out, enabling work from home where we can. We were pretty capable at remote work capabilities just given the distributed nature of our campuses. So, it\u2019s really flexing in that regard. And then we have put in place a robust process for allowing onsite work where we think it can\u2019t be done otherwise for training our staff and staying with it. And so we have done that. Of course, there is a loss of efficiency as you go through this and so there is no doubt that in the first weeks of this you start to slow down and then we are fighting hard to recover. Team attitudes have been fantastic. The agility and creativity of teams to get their work done, their willingness and desire to do so, has been really encouraging, so, so far, so good. Some things will go slower. To the extent that we have clinical trials out there and those are being conducted in hospitals that are being impacted by COVID, those things will slow down. The principal investigators in those places are highly committed first to patient care and then as a second priority to doing the research they would like to do and so that will come back as time permits for them to do so.\nLarry Keusch: Okay, terrific. And then I guess the other question is you guys are obviously having a lot of conversations with surgeons, with hospitals. I am just sort of curious if you can comment on what you are hearing relative to maybe some of the bigger geographies in Europe or in the U.S. when they maybe able to start to get some of these surgeries going? As you guys have indicated multiple times on this call, there is a continuum and there are procedures that can be deferred, but not for potentially long periods of time. So I am just curious, I know it\u2019s a fluid situation, but just anything you might be hearing as to when this might start to start up again?\nGary Guthart: Clearly, varies by country and is the reason that we put a couple of those charts on our website for you to look at is just to see the difference in how different countries are doing it. The places that are able to engage earliest have taken strategies where they have put COVID Care in one location and allowed surgery to occur in a different location or hot and cold zones within their own institutions that have allowed them to manage both concurrently so long as they have staff and PPE to do it. Giving you a general answer is really not possible at this time because of the puts and takes by region. What I will say is surgeons are there for a reason. They are \u2013 it\u2019s impressive. They are both community-oriented and clearly understanding the need to support their communities as they flex into this crisis. At the same time, they are surgeons and they are looking forward to going back to surgery. The backlogs that you hear about are significant and they are concerned about those patients who are surgical patients who need care. The last comment I would make is that very few of the procedures that are done using robotic-assisted surgery are easily resolved by non-surgical means. We are in a part of surgery that where surgery is by and large the first choice. And as a result, I don\u2019t think a lot of these procedures are going to dissolve in time just by waiting. I think they are going to have to be done surgically. So really will be a question of where do they get done, when do they get done and what kind of technology is used to do it.\nLarry Keusch: Okay, great. Appreciate the thoughts.\nGary Guthart: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Amit Hazan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAmit Hazan: Thanks. Hey, good afternoon. Just a quick follow-up on the European system side, just thinking about operating leases out there and how that situation might evolve, can you just kind of maybe remind us of the tendency of certain countries to adopt via leases out there and whether you are sensing any kind of a change or improvement in that outlook as we think about them being more constrained to spend on capital potentially over the next year or so?\nGary Guthart: Marshall?\nMarshall Mohr: Yes, there were \u2013 there are limitations as to what you can do within each European country. All of them have different rules as to registration and with different regulators around financing. Having said that, we really had launched leasing in Germany and the UK, a year, two years ago or so and France a little bit after that and we did see a nice uptick in leasing, particularly in Germany. I think going forward you will see leasing in all those markets. We are prepared to be able to offer it. We now understand structures we can do and what the requirements are from a reporting perspective and I think we are set. So I would anticipate given the impact of the COVID-19 that we would see additional leasing there.\nAmit Hazan: And then just one quick kind of bigger question, bigger picture, longer term one for Gary, it\u2019s early days, but how are you thinking if at all about secular changes for hospital systems and healthcare more broadly after this crisis is over as it kind of relates to your markets?\nGary Guthart: Okay, I think it\u2019s a little too soon to tell. We certainly are thinking about how customers might adapt and you can think about a few things. I guess I would focus you on really kind of Phase 2 and Phase 3 of this coronavirus response. The economy starts opening back up and we have a fair amount of testing, but you are still dealing with COVID as an uncured disease. How do hospitals manage that? I think that\u2019s a lot of where our thoughts are now that may have to do with site of care and other kind of flexible ways. We think minimally invasive surgery broadly and robotic-assisted surgery is important in that setting. Keeping people out of the hospital, allowing them to recover quickly at home, these are things that I think are generally good for the health care system and there may be some adaptation by health systems to be flexible about how to deliver that and we are working through that internally and with them and it gets exciting. What happens after that as this goes on a couple of years, I think we will all have to wait and see. Last questioner, please?\nOperator: Yes. That will come from Matt Taylor, UBS. Please go ahead.\nMatt Taylor: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So, I just wanted to ask a follow-up question on some of the things you were talking about qualitatively earlier in regards to helping systems when they get back to working normally and helping them be efficient and flex up on the upside. I know you\u2019ve done some work there with your internal consulting groups to make systems more efficient. Seems to be working and I was just wondering if you could offer some thoughts on how much more they could flex up in the short run? What are some of the best practices and what are the best systems doing with regards to utilization today?\nGary Guthart: Yes, if you think forward, the major things here have been really making sure that teams are consistent, teams that know how to work together, work together frequently, they know how to parallelize tasks and they use kind of best practices. It is not limited to robotic surgery but works really well therein. With regard to how we can help, making sure that training resources are available, we have been investing as in Intuitive Telemedicine Network. I\u2019m really pleased that we made that set of investments and in the future that allows us to project expertise in at a distance, that means people don\u2019t have to be on planes in a post-COVID world, that\u2019s probably helpful for us and something that we want to rotate towards as we go. As I said earlier in the call, I think we can forward deploy some of our training resources and help get teams up and running and trained that would help people work through backlogs as best as they can.\nMatt Taylor: Great. Thank you very much.\nGary Guthart: Alright. Well, thank you. That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there\u2019s a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. During this period, our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams to support them in their mission wherever that may lead. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. Thank you for your support. We look forward to talking with you again in three months. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for using AT&T event conferencing. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gary Guthart",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today. Our first quarter 2020 performance reflects the rise of COVID-19 and the global response to it. On this call, we will describe our experience in the quarter, our framework for engaging those who rely on us and our priorities and actions in these challenging times. Our focus now and in the past is the safety and well-being of patients, care teams, our communities and our employees. For the first 2.5 months of the quarter, procedure performance was at the high-end of our expectations with procedure trends consistent with the prior quarters. General surgery in the United States was strong as was urology outside the United States. As we disclosed previously, recommendations by surgical societies and healthcare organizations to delay certain surgeries to conserve resources for COVID Care are having a material impact on surgery broadly, including robotic-assisted surgery. We support government and hospital policies to direct resources to COVID Care and recognize these policies very greatly by region and by hospital system. We are analyzing customer procedure deferrals in response to COVID. Patients undergoing da Vinci procedures do so in response to an underlying disease. While these procedures maybe delayed in the short-term without treatment of some sort, the disease in its impairment persist and often worsens. Said simply, the vast majority of these patients will ultimately see treatment. We are analyzing both the clinical drivers of return to treatment and customer plans and processes to recover. The categories of benign disease and cancer are not entirely predictive of the urgency of surgical intervention. Clearly, aggressive cancers require treatment and are delayed at significant risk to patients. Likewise, some benign conditions require timely intervention as well. We are working internally and with customers to understand their needs to restart surgery for those patients whose condition requires action. The effect of COVID on the surgical market has impacted different regions differently. Starting with China, procedure performance was impacted by COVID earliest with sharp declines in surgery as resources were diverted to respond to COVID Care. Procedures in China have been recovering steadily since that time. However, steep declines in procedures that can be deferred are occurring in other regions, particularly Europe and the United States. For the quarter, procedures grew 10% over Q1 of 2019 given early strength followed by sharp declines in the last 2 weeks of the quarter. I refer you to the materials we posted to our website prior to this call to get a better picture of the dynamics in Q1. With regard to systems, our total number of placements for the quarter was below our expectations in spite of having strong capital performance in the first 2 months of the quarter. In March, rapid changes by hospitals delayed some system placements and are likely to significantly impact system contracts and placements in future quarters. Financial pressures exerted on hospitals in response to treating COVID patients and deferring other care, are likely to be significant and are unlikely to resolve quickly. Marshall and Calvin will take you through procedure and capital dynamics in the quarter in greater detail later in the call. To help articulate our priorities and actions during this period of change, we have adopted the phased framework described in the American Enterprise Institute's national coronavirus response. In Phase 1, which is the slow-the-spread phase of coronavirus response, Intuitive's priorities are as follows. First, we are focused on the health and safety of all those we serve, our customers, our communities, our employees and our suppliers implementing early and continuous updates to our health and safety policies and processes. Second, we are supporting our customers according to their priorities, clinical, operational and economic. Third, we are focused on continuity of supply by working with our suppliers and distributors. To-date, our delivery capability and inventory positions are on firm footing. Fourth, we are securing our workforce economically. We have built an outstanding team over the years and we believe their strength will be essential in the recovery that follows. Fifth, in partnership with our Intuitive Foundation, we are contributing material product and volunteers to the frontlines of COVID support. We have designed, produced and delivered PPE to local hospitals and our staff have volunteered in several communities. And sixth, we are eliminating avoidable spend during the stop-the-spread phase of the virus. The current situation in hospitals responding to viral care is fluid and the depth and duration of this disruption is difficult to predict. New issues are arising with respect to surgery that will require mitigation in time. Some hospital customers and some of our suppliers will experience significant financial stress in this period. Regulatory agency priorities and resources are shifting globally as they devote their resources to infectious disease detection and treatment needs. And lastly, surgeons are being dedicated to frontline COVID work or being idled by a lack of resources in this period. We are adjusting quickly to the issues described and we are confident in both the need for surgery and in our products as the response to COVID evolves. We are planning for Phase 2 to return to surgery for those patients who can't wait. Those countries that have been managing the disease the longest have returned to da Vinci surgery steadily over time or have been able to maintain da Vinci surgery concurrently with COVID Care. We are analyzing the order in which different procedures are likely to return and the strategies likely to be employed by hospital systems to manage surgical practices while still providing COVID Care. For example, some health systems are dedicating specific sites to COVID Care, while operating rooms for outpatient surgeries are dedicated in other locations. We will support customers closely as they bring capabilities back online. We are also adapting our training in Intuitive telepresence capabilities to support team training and skills retention in a Phase 2 world. We are optimizing our R&D facilities and methods to allow us to progress on important innovation programs while employing up-to-date workplace safety guidelines. Lastly, we look forward to accelerating clinical trial activities and the associated regulatory work as trial sites increased their surgical volume. In constructing our financial plans in the current environment, we are balancing five objectives that reflect our priorities mentioned above. They are: first, customer-focused economic policies that meet their needs during this disruption; second, employee policies that secure our valuable workforce needed for hospital recovery and to drive our innovation; third, securing and stabilizing critical supply chain resources; fourth, eliminating spending that is not effective during this period, for example, pausing, hiring and volume-related roles and spend on projects that cannot progress in the current phase; and finally, shareholder policies that don't interfere with the priorities mentioned above. We remain in close contact with our customers, our community representatives, our employees and our suppliers during this period. While the depth and duration of the current challenges are difficult to predict, the need for both COVID and non-COVID Care is clear. Given time and resources, health systems have continued to choose da Vinci. The collaborations and solutions orientation among our stakeholders is clear and inspiring. I believe our long-term opportunity is substantial and our business is well-positioned financially and organizationally to weather this COVID outbreak. And I will now turn the call over to Marshall who will take you through financial matters in greater detail. We can. Hi, David. Yes, thank you. I would start with I think they're apples and oranges from the underlying cause. So clearly this is healthcare related and policy driven in terms of deferrals, as a result a little bit hard to predict how the capital cycle will recover. You had mentioned and it's true, we have a lot more flexible approaches that are available to us with regard to making systems available. Marshall mentioned in his script they'll consume existing capacity first as they go. We've been in contact with our customers routinely. There's a backlog growing for surgery. These folks are going to need surgery. And really our opportunity, our job as a company is to make sure we can support them however we can in terms of access to systems or motion of systems to allow them to use what they have out there, and as those systems become full again, we can think about how to increase capacity going forward and we have a few tools in the tool kit. Marshall, anything you would like to add? Next question, please. Thanks, Bob. Yes, you see in that chart China, you see other countries as well, Japan and so on, and what you can really see is that country policy changes the shape. I think we're encouraged by a couple of things. One is people's interest or customers' interest in using da Vinci is durable. That's been great. You had asked a specific question of how predictive is China and I think the answer there is too soon to tell for the rest of the regions. I'm encouraged by it. I think it indicates the durability of demand. Having said that, I think policy matters and I think how people allocate their healthcare resources are going to change too. You can see in Japan already that the progress of their approach to disease is evolving and what that looks like on procedures will evolve. So, stay tuned is the short answer. Calvin, anything you'd like to add? Okay. On the Japan side, I think that in general their system for managing their coronavirus is a little bit different than we've seen in other countries and it's evolving in time. So, to-date, hospital operations were relatively lightly impacted as it relates to surgery relative to other countries. What that will look like in the future, I don't know. We'll see how that evolves. It's been interesting and instructive for us to look at data from Japan, look at data from Korea, from China, from Europe and Germany, Italy, UK, France. And that informs us going forward and in terms of getting prepared for the reopening of some of the hospital wings and surgical wings as they happen. So too soon to make the final call, but we have I think pretty good real-time information. I'm going to refer to Marshall the question about clinical trial. Calvin, you had more to add? Thanks Bob. Sure. Just as a broad brush, clearly, high-risk cancers are things delayed at real risk to patients and emergent or inflamed benign disease likewise. One caution, each country has a little bit different mix of procedures going into 2020 prior to COVID becoming a bigger issue. So the mixes are a little bit different. Calvin, why don't you speak a little bit to what we have seen to-date? On my just personal channel checks, hospitals are now creating large backlogs of patients who are going to need surgery and there is \u2013 I am encouraged about their commitment to da Vinci as they go through that. So I think at some point the logistics of availability of PPE and other resources will start to free up a little bit and as they have time then they will have to attend to that group of patients and we will be there to support. With regard to Europe, any color you want to give, Marshall? Tycho, you have heard us say this before and it's really true in the data this quarter as well. Europe doesn't act as one. So what's happening in Italy feels and looks different than in Germany from our perspective, from France and from the UK. So, each will progress a little bit \u2013 on a little bit different pathway. Thanks, Tycho. Not ready to publish what's happened thus far in April. I don't think it's shockingly different from what the beginnings of what you're seeing in the charts we've given you there. But I'd also say that I don't think the next two weeks are particularly predictive of anything. I think this will flow globally here over the next weeks and months and we're really focused on how to make sure that we're supporting our customers well and flow out of it. Yes. Appreciate it. Well a couple of things. We are well-represented in outpatient departments in hospitals already. We are absolutely able and willing to move systems to locations of care wherever they might be. We do have experience with systems in ASCs to the extent people want to move into ASC environments. We worked fine in those environments. We will be working on getting training and other resources geographically positioned where we think that folks can need additional support as they start to ramp up, recognizing that we don't think a lot of people will be jumping on planes in phase 2 so we can sort of forward deploy our resources to help people as they get ready. And lastly, it's staying in touch with our customers and surgery departments and making sure that we have inventory forward deployed for them for the kind of procedures they want to do. Thank you. I think the way I'd have you think about it is from the point of view of demand for surgery, demand for robotic assisted surgery, in that setting I think the world is queuing up a set of patients who will need care. Makes sense. I understand it. I think conserving of PPE and ICU's and other valuable resources at this time makes sense. As some of those constraints start to loosen, I think everybody will have to adjust and adapt to caring for patients who have other conditions. That is the demand that will drive everything behind it, from INA and other inventory, to access to capital and systems. We're well-positioned from an inventory point of view. We are well-positioned operationally and financially to move systems where they need to go, to put systems out on lease for usage-based models or other things to support customers the way they want to be supported and we'll be quite agile. So, on the capital side, you may see shifts in the way capital is deployed and the way that we're compensated for that capital relative to prior quarters, sort of historical norms. But we'll be leaning forward to help people when they need that help. How fast that happens, I think that has a lot to do with government policy and health system policy as to when they pivot to go treat other patients. That will determine everything else. Yes. Thanks, Rick. It's possible. I think that folks rotating into open surgery, patients who are great candidates for MIS is doing that set of patients a disservice. So we will see. That may happen, hard for us to control. With regard to capacity for robotics, remember, there are a lot of robots out there and they are right now underutilized. As that flows back, we can help. Will some folks want to use lap? Maybe. From the point of view of surgeon preference, surgeon comfort what their choices are, just remember surgeons are intentional about the method of surgery they choose. They don't accidentally fall into robotic surgery training. They make those commitments and time investments for a reason and they have a preference. So, if we can fulfill their preference, great. That will be great. If we are unable to do so and they choose lap, because they couldn't get access where they wanted, well, that may happen, but that's really I think Intuitive's job to make those systems available to them if they would like to use them. Thanks, Rick. Thank you. First thing has been to employ \u2013 to ensure, to protect the safety of our staff and those who supply us while we do our R&D. So step one has been to stay up-to-date on the latest employee work safety methods. We started our incident response team relatively early. We were up and running at full speed in terms of our incident response team in early January and so they start looking at best practice relaying out our onsite facilities as they need to be relayed out, enabling work from home where we can. We were pretty capable at remote work capabilities just given the distributed nature of our campuses. So, it's really flexing in that regard. And then we have put in place a robust process for allowing onsite work where we think it can't be done otherwise for training our staff and staying with it. And so we have done that. Of course, there is a loss of efficiency as you go through this and so there is no doubt that in the first weeks of this you start to slow down and then we are fighting hard to recover. Team attitudes have been fantastic. The agility and creativity of teams to get their work done, their willingness and desire to do so, has been really encouraging, so, so far, so good. Some things will go slower. To the extent that we have clinical trials out there and those are being conducted in hospitals that are being impacted by COVID, those things will slow down. The principal investigators in those places are highly committed first to patient care and then as a second priority to doing the research they would like to do and so that will come back as time permits for them to do so. Clearly, varies by country and is the reason that we put a couple of those charts on our website for you to look at is just to see the difference in how different countries are doing it. The places that are able to engage earliest have taken strategies where they have put COVID Care in one location and allowed surgery to occur in a different location or hot and cold zones within their own institutions that have allowed them to manage both concurrently so long as they have staff and PPE to do it. Giving you a general answer is really not possible at this time because of the puts and takes by region. What I will say is surgeons are there for a reason. They are \u2013 it's impressive. They are both community-oriented and clearly understanding the need to support their communities as they flex into this crisis. At the same time, they are surgeons and they are looking forward to going back to surgery. The backlogs that you hear about are significant and they are concerned about those patients who are surgical patients who need care. The last comment I would make is that very few of the procedures that are done using robotic-assisted surgery are easily resolved by non-surgical means. We are in a part of surgery that where surgery is by and large the first choice. And as a result, I don't think a lot of these procedures are going to dissolve in time just by waiting. I think they are going to have to be done surgically. So really will be a question of where do they get done, when do they get done and what kind of technology is used to do it. Thank you. Marshall? Okay, I think it's a little too soon to tell. We certainly are thinking about how customers might adapt and you can think about a few things. I guess I would focus you on really kind of Phase 2 and Phase 3 of this coronavirus response. The economy starts opening back up and we have a fair amount of testing, but you are still dealing with COVID as an uncured disease. How do hospitals manage that? I think that's a lot of where our thoughts are now that may have to do with site of care and other kind of flexible ways. We think minimally invasive surgery broadly and robotic-assisted surgery is important in that setting. Keeping people out of the hospital, allowing them to recover quickly at home, these are things that I think are generally good for the health care system and there may be some adaptation by health systems to be flexible about how to deliver that and we are working through that internally and with them and it gets exciting. What happens after that as this goes on a couple of years, I think we will all have to wait and see. Last questioner, please? Yes, if you think forward, the major things here have been really making sure that teams are consistent, teams that know how to work together, work together frequently, they know how to parallelize tasks and they use kind of best practices. It is not limited to robotic surgery but works really well therein. With regard to how we can help, making sure that training resources are available, we have been investing as in Intuitive Telemedicine Network. I'm really pleased that we made that set of investments and in the future that allows us to project expertise in at a distance, that means people don't have to be on planes in a post-COVID world, that's probably helpful for us and something that we want to rotate towards as we go. As I said earlier in the call, I think we can forward deploy some of our training resources and help get teams up and running and trained that would help people work through backlogs as best as they can. Alright. Well, thank you. That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. During this period, our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams to support them in their mission wherever that may lead. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. Thank you for your support. We look forward to talking with you again in three months. Thank you."

            "name": "Marshall Mohr",
            "content": "Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Procedures and shipments are consistent with our preliminary press release of April 8th. Key business metrics for the first quarter were as follows: First quarter 2020 procedures increased approximately 10% compared with the first quarter of 2019 and decreased approximately 9% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth continues to be driven by general surgery in the U.S. and urology worldwide. Calvin will review details of procedure growth later in this call. First quarter system placements of 237 systems increased 1% compared with 235 systems last year and decreased 29% compared with 336 systems last quarter. We expanded our install base of da Vinci systems by 11% to approximately 5,669 systems. This growth rate compares with 12% in the last quarter and 13% last year. Utilization of clinical systems in the field measured by procedures per system declined approximately 2% compared with 6% growth last quarter and 5% growth last year. Let me walk through the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on procedures and system placements and how it varied by market. Prior to the spread of COVID-19, we experienced procedure growth trends consistent with those experienced in the fourth quarter, including strength in general surgery, growth in mature procedures in U.S. and growth in O-U.S. urology. We also saw early strength in capital placements, particularly in U.S., with over half the systems placed in the quarter being arrangements where the sales cycle was mostly completed in the fourth quarter. Beginning in January, we saw substantial reduction in da Vinci procedures in China, and by early February, procedures per week in China had declined by 90% compared with the weekly rates experienced in early January. As the COVID-19 subsided in China in March, da Vinci procedures began to recover, and by the end of the quarter, China procedures per week were approximately 70% of the early January rate. We saw varied impacts on da Vinci procedures in some other early countries affected by COVID-19. COVID-19 had little impact in Korea and Japan in the quarter and severe impact in Italy. In summary, the COVID-19 disruption to da Vinci procedures varied by country and the disruption to worldwide da Vinci procedures was not significant through the middle of March. As the pandemic spread to Western Europe and to the U.S., we experienced a significant decline in da Vinci procedures in the last half of March. Procedures per week in the U.S., which represented approximately 70% of our procedures in 2019, declined approximately 65% relative to earlier in the quarter. Procedures in France, Germany and the UK also declined but to a lesser extent than the U.S. We have provided you with supplemental information on our website to enable you to understand the magnitude of the impacts on procedures and the variation between countries. As I indicated most of the sales cycle for approximately half of the system placements in the quarter were completed in the fourth quarter. As we progressed through the quarter and the impact of the pandemic progressed, customers deferred decisions to purchase or lease systems into future quarters and in some cases indefinitely. The depth and extent to which COVID-19 will impact individual markets will vary based on the availability of testing capabilities, PPE, ICUs and ORs, medical staff and government interventions. As COVID-19 continues to spread, it is likely that da Vinci procedures will decline from those experienced in the first quarter. In addition, we would expect that system placements will follow the decline in procedures. While some markets like China appear to be recovering, it is possible that a recurrence of COVID-19 will negatively impact da Vinci procedures. And not all markets will recover at the same pace. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: Utilization of the install base declined by 2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on procedures coupled with the fourth quarter system placement strength. When procedures increase, customers will first look to utilize existing da Vinci capacity, which is likely to depress capital placements. First quarter placements included a higher concentration of multiple system arrangements with hospitals and IDNs seeking to standardize on fourth generation systems. Many of these replacements were completed as capital leases. As a result, first quarter trade-ins were higher and operating leases were lower as a percentage of total placements than in the fourth quarter of 2019. We would anticipate in an environment of COVID-19 as economic pressures increase, more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than purchases. Trade-in activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict. However, given the impacts of COVID-19, we expect the number of trade-ins to decrease. We recognized $12 million of lease buyout revenue in the first quarter compared with $34 million last quarter and $12 million last year. There were no returns of da Vinci systems for leases that ended in the quarter. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly from quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure grew to just over $2,000 per procedure compared with $1,980 in the fourth quarter of 2019, reflecting instruments and accessory purchases prior to the decline in procedures. We expect that as hospitals adjust inventory levels for lower surgery volumes, instrument and accessory revenue will decrease. Three of the systems placed in the first quarter were SP systems reflecting both our measured rollout of SP and the impact of COVID-19. Our rollout of SP Surgical System will continue to be measured, putting systems in the hands of experienced da Vinci users while we pursue additional indications and optimize training pathways in our supply chain. Given the impact of COVID-19, our ability to perform clinical trial associated with an SP colorectal procedure is likely delayed. We placed eight Ion systems in the quarter. Ion system placements were also impacted by COVID-19. Ion system placements are excluded from our overall systems count and will be reported separately. Procedures and other information associated with Ion are excluded from our prepared remarks and will be reported separately when they become material. Our rollout of Ion will continue to be measured while we optimize training pathways in our supply chain. The completion of the PRECISE study will be delayed due to COVID-19. We cannot predict when the PRECISE clinical study will be completed. Outside the U.S., we placed 55 systems in the first quarter compared with 81 in the first quarter of 2019 and 140 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 25 in Europe, 10 into Japan and 9 into China compared with 49 into Europe, 13 into Japan and 3 into China in the first quarter of 2019. Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the first quarter was 69.7% compared with 71.2% for the first quarter of 2019 and 72.2% last quarter. The decrease compared with the first quarter of 2019 and last quarter primarily reflects product mix, higher fixed cost with on lower production and costs associated with Si product transitions partially offset by cost reductions. As revenues are pressured by COVID-19, we will reduce production levels, which will result in higher labor costs and under-absorbed overhead and a significant reduction of product margin. Pro forma operating expenses increased 15% compared with the first quarter 2019 and decreased 8% compared with last quarter. Spending in the first quarter reflected normal business activities into March and a curtailment of cost associated with impact of COVID-19. While certain spending will decrease in the second quarter as a result of the reduction in revenue and activities limited by the pandemic, much of our spending will continue. Major categories of spending and likely trends for the second quarter are as follows: We will continue to support our customers. We will continue to invest in innovation focused on the quadruple aim. We will invest in manufacturing in our supply chain to ensure supply for our customers. We will ensure we are prepared for periods when the spread of COVID-19 is contained. Certain costs will decline as underlying activities are restricted by COVID-19, including travel and related expenses, clinical trials, surgeon training and customer data collection. We will eliminate spending that is ineffective due to COVID-19 like surgeon and hospital events. We are pausing the hiring of volume-related roles like sales reps and manufacturing employees. We continue to believe that we have a unique opportunity to expand the benefit for computer-aided surgery and acute interventions around the world and will continue to invest in the business for the long-term. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 20% compared with our expectations of 20% to 21%, reflecting geographic mix. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities, and with the impact of one-time items. Our first quarter 2020 pro forma net income was $323 million or $2.69 per share compared with $312 million or $2.61 per share for the first quarter of 2019 and $417 million or $3.48 per share for last quarter. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $314 million or $2.62 per share for the first quarter of 2020 compared with GAAP net income of $307 million or $2.56 per share for the first quarter of 2019 and GAAP net income of $358 million or $2.99 per share for last quarter. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified in our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation and IP charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition-related items and legal settlements. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $5.9 billion compared with $5.8 billion at December 31, 2019. Cash generated from operations was partially offset by stock repurchases and investments in working capital and our infrastructure. We repurchased approximately 192,000 shares for $100 million at an average price of $522 per share. Our current thoughts on capital deployment are in the following order. We recognized the hardships that COVID places on our customers and we work with customers to ease the burden of lower da Vinci utilization, including providing customers with more flexible financing. We will work to secure our supply chain and build appropriate levels of inventory to ensure customer supply, particularly as procedures resume. We will invest in securing our employees. We will continue to our open market repurchase program consistent with our prior practice. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Calvin who will go over procedure performance. No, I think you hit it. I think you will see more financing, more leases and alternative financing arrangements. Sure. For leasing, yes, in the quarter what happened, we had a number of customers that had started the sales cycle back in Q4 and were interested in standardizing on fourth generation systems and it so happens that a number of those customers wanted to do \u2013 wanted to structure the arrangement such as they were purchases, they were accounted for as purchases, and as a result, we had fewer leases this quarter. So, I don't think this quarter's indicative of our normal sort of run rate for leases as a result. Leasing going forward probably is more akin to what we were experiencing, more in the 38% range. That's under normal circumstances and I actually believe, given the COVID virus and its impacts that it will increase from there. But it's hard to predict depending on the customer and the circumstances. As far as how many customers may have postponed indefinitely or may have postponed a quarter, the conversations with them are always a little bit, hey, we are going to postpone and then they sort of throw in words about maybe another quarter, maybe another couple of quarters and some say, well, we'll get back to it but we don't have a specific timetable, and for those that say that they don't have a specific timetable that's what I'm referring to as indefinitely. I don't think that there are customers running from robotic surgery. I think they actually want to do robotic surgery and I think that they will come back some time when COVID virus is handled and the procedures come back. Clinical trial, what I was referring to was SP we had planned on doing a \u2013 we believe we have to do a clinical trial to get the next indication which is colorectal. Doing a clinical trial at this point in time is probably not going to happen right away. Having said that, I don't think we had plans to do it right away. We had several steps we had to go through before we got there so I say, it's delayed. It could be delayed and don't know exactly when it will get done. Like I said in our prepared remarks, capital demand, we saw deferral of purchase decisions at the end of the quarter. I would expect that to continue. I would expect also that hospitals as COVID as they are able to dedicate resources to the procedures that maybe in backlog that they will use up existing capacity and therefore it won't immediately result in capital demand. We still have conversations with some of the hospitals on capital. It's just not possible to predict exactly where it's going to come out for the quarter. Europe, we didn't see quite the same level of reduction in terms of procedures at the end of the quarter. That doesn't mean to say that it will sustain itself. It's possible that as the virus spreads that there could be additional pressures on procedures. And having said that, capital as you know we did 25 systems this quarter and what I reported in my prepared remarks, that's far lower than what we had anticipated for the quarter. And so we are still \u2013 we are seeing the same kinds of interactions with customers in Europe as we are in U.S. Yes, there were \u2013 there are limitations as to what you can do within each European country. All of them have different rules as to registration and with different regulators around financing. Having said that, we really had launched leasing in Germany and the UK, a year, two years ago or so and France a little bit after that and we did see a nice uptick in leasing, particularly in Germany. I think going forward you will see leasing in all those markets. We are prepared to be able to offer it. We now understand structures we can do and what the requirements are from a reporting perspective and I think we are set. So I would anticipate given the impact of the COVID-19 that we would see additional leasing there."

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Brian King, Head of Investor Relations for Intuitive Surgical. Please go ahead.\nBrian King : Thank you. So good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive's fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; and Jamie Samath, our CFO. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 10, 2021, and Form 10-Q filed on October 20, 2021. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Latest Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our fourth quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights; Jamie will provide a review of our financial results; and I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our financial outlook for 2022. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. And with that, I'll turn it over to Gary.\nGary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. 2021 required agility as we drove through significant headwinds to support customers and manage our supply chain. Our teams performed well, helping customers return to surgery when COVID allowed them and maintaining the integrity of our supply chain and workforce. Given our recent press release updating procedures, capital placements and revenues, I'll be brief in describing our full year 2021 results and spend a little more time outlining our plans for 2022 and beyond. Putting 2021 in context, demand for our robotically-assisted interventions has been resilient during COVID. While these interventions get delayed during COVID peaks, they return as COVID wanes, and that is encouraging. Pandemic stresses on health care systems emphasize the need for the kind of high-quality, minimally invasive interventions or products enable. MIS procedures allow greater use of ambulatory surgery, free up resources and ORs relative to other approaches and often enable faster patient return to home and overall recovery. In 2021, da Vinci procedures grew 28% compared to full year 2020, reflecting a partial recovery in surgery after the first wave of the pandemic. Over the 2-year period, 2020 and 2021, the compound annual growth rate in procedures was 14%. Capital installs were healthy in 2021, with our team placing 1,347 da Vinci and 93 Ion systems in the year, driving da Vinci placement growth of 44% over 2020 and at a CAGR of 10% over the past 2 years. With a 2-year CAGR in procedures of 14% and installed base growth of 10% over the same period, utilization of installed systems continue to climb through the pandemic. We think this is good for our customers and good for us. Jamie will give regional capital trends and Brian will give detailed procedure dynamics later in the call. The past 2 years have stressed more than health systems. Our ability to attract, develop and retain outstanding staff remains a key focus for us. Our team has performed well, supporting our customers and each other. In the year, we added approximately 1,700 employees to our team with net headcount growth of approximately 180 in R&D, 920 in operations and 340 in our commercial force. Of the 1,700 net additions, 700 were outside of the United States. Looking out over the next decade, we believe that the method we have developed to identify clinical need, then design a technology-enabled ecosystem for improving the quadruple aim, then deliver and train customers on this ecosystem, can positively impact a broad set of minimally invasive interventions. The opportunity and challenge for Intuitive is to evolve our ecosystem to support our customers and ourselves at scale and to choose procedural opportunities and platform architectures that made sense. Turning to investments in the mid-term. Our priority for use of our capital is to reinvest in the business, to develop new opportunities that improve the quadruple aim and to strengthen our operating capabilities at global scale. We are focused on driving a vital set of initiatives, and I'd like to describe the dynamics for you in a little more detail. In multiport, we believe our Gen 4 architecture is outstanding and we've been adding capability to this product line since launch, including significant expansion and upgrades to energy and stapling product lines, improved endoscopic imaging, the introduction of da Vinci X, the introduction of Extended Use Instruments, training technologies and finally, the introduction of new and upgraded connectivity and data management tools. Given the precision, robustness and overall performance of our Generation 4 robotics architecture, we will continue to innovate on this platform, bringing additional value to those customers who have standardized on Generation 4 fleets. We are also investing in new core capabilities for our multiport systems, both Generation 4 and beyond that we'll describe as they get closer to market. You should expect continued innovation from us here. Turning to Ion. Our first indication addresses a large unmet need in lung cancer biopsy and our focus is fully enabling our production capability and customer ecosystem for this indication. There is strong demand for lung biopsy, and we are working to expand manufacturing capacity of all processes for greater quality and lower costs at scale and run trials and address regulatory requirements that enable global expansion. Over time, we plan for total Ion program profitability to approach that of our corporate average as we execute against our volume, design and process improvement goals. We are pursuing additional applications for Ion, and we'll describe them as we get closer to market. For our single-port system, da Vinci SP has the opportunity to change the standard of care in 2 different types of soft tissue surgery: those that require the extraction of tissue that can be done through a small single port and those procedures that benefit from narrow entry into the body as a whole. Where Ion, at its current stage of launch, has a single indication that represents a large patient population, SP's opportunity is the aggregation of several midsized indications. For example, SP used in Transoral Robotic Surgery is growing steadily in the U.S. To broaden SP's applicability in the U.S. and other markets, we are undertaking clinical trials to support regulatory review. We believe that SP will serve several additional surgical specialties, which will allow our customers and us to leverage capital investments in the program. Like Ion, we plan for SP platform profitability to approach that of historical platforms over time, and we're encouraged by recent progress. Our customer digital efforts now represent roughly 5% of our total operating expenses and drive the business in 4 ways. First, the use of data and digital tools by customers to analyze their operations helps improve outcomes, reduce costs and increase customer satisfaction and retention. Second, digital and internal investments can decrease our cost to serving our customer. Third, some of our digital tools generate revenue themselves and finally, use of data and analytics internally can help our teams make better decisions. Because digital and data tools span our platforms and are used externally and internally, we do not account for them using the same financial models as our platforms, nor do we break them out as stand-alone financial engines. That said, we do evaluate digital and data projects against internal strategic and return analysis. Over the past 5 years, the annual number of instruments we produce has grown roughly 200% and the annual number of systems we produce has more than doubled. The number of customer professionals trained annually has nearly doubled, and our engineering staff has nearly tripled. Our product volume growth has also allowed us to in-source some of our high-volume accessories while investing in automation. This has a threefold benefit: improving supply chain robustness, improving manufacturing quality and lowering unit costs. As our training, R&D and manufacturing efforts move to scale, we're investing in infrastructure, factory builds, training center expansion and automation. These infrastructure investments are lumpy, and our current growth cycle requires building capacity. These projects have been planned over the past couple of years and will start amortizing first moderately in 2022 and more substantially in 2023 and '24, then normalizing over the next few years. For example, over the next 4 years, we'll be growing and consolidating facilities for operations, R&D and customer training space in Atlanta; doubling our Mexicali manufacturing footprint; doubling our R&D design space and operations space as our California headquarters; and finally, consolidating and growing our commercial training operations and R&D space in Germany. In summary, we'll build on our Generation 4 capabilities in multiport while innovating in clinical utility for multiport surgery broadly. We'll continue to bring our flexible endoscopy platform Ion to scale and drive capacity, quality and cost improvements while seeking to broaden access to new markets. In SP, we expect to expand indications in regional markets while driving manufacturing quality and scale. We will invest in regional training, R&D and manufacturing centers globally to support the growth of the business and pursue opportunities for operating leverage given volume, some of which we'll share with customers to catalyze elastic markets. Finally, we will continue to advance our digital efforts to enable fast, accurate and actionable decisions with our customers and for our company. Lastly, for 2022, particularly, we're focused on the following: first, outstanding customer support in the face of continued pandemic disruption; second, execution of our robotic and digital platform expansion in pursuit of new indications and new markets; third, general surgery growth in the United States; and finally, diversified growth outside the U.S. beyond urology. As we turn to our financial report, I'd like to formally thank Marshall Mohr, our outgoing CFO and new Head of Global Business Services, for his outstanding stewardship over the past 15 years, and turn the time over to our incoming CFO, Jamie Samath, who will take you through financial matters in greater detail.\nJamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. Reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Q4 and 2021 revenue and procedures are in line with our preliminary press release of January 12. Before I dive into our Q4 results, let me start with a summary of our full year 2021 performance. Given the significant impact of COVID, we believe it's appropriate to review our 2021 results on both a year-over-year and a 2-year compound annual growth rate basis. Procedures increased by 28% as compared to 2020 and increased by approximately 14% using a 2-year CAGR. We placed 1,347 systems of customers during the year, an increase of 44% as compared to 2020 and up 10% using a 2-year CAGR. As a result of this procedure and system placement performance, 2021 revenue increased by 31% year-over-year and increased by 13% using a 2-year CAGR. Key business metrics for the fourth quarter were as follows: fourth quarter procedures increased approximately 19% compared with the fourth quarter of 2020 and increased approximately 13% using a 2-year CAGR. During the quarter, procedures continued to recover in October and November from the impact of the Delta variant in Q3. However, in December, procedures were adversely impacted by the increase in hospitalizations in the U.S. and parts of Europe as the Omicron variant spread rapidly. This trend has worsened so far into January. Fourth quarter system placements of 385 increased 18% from the 326 systems placed last year. As a result, net of trade-ins and retirements, we expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems over the last year by 12%. On a 2-year CAGR, our installed base is up 10%. Utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, increased approximately 7% compared to last year and increased approximately 3% using a 2-year CAGR. During the quarter, the supply chain environment became more challenging and remains highly dynamic. Our supply chain teams continue to work tirelessly with our supply chain partners to fulfill customer demand. In Q4, we experienced minor constraints in our ability to meet customer demand. For example, we had some limitations on supply of skill simulators. While these constraints were relatively minor and were immaterial to our overall Q4 financial results, they highlight the risk of potential significant disruption to our manufacturing operations due to the current supply chain challenges. U.S. procedures grew approximately 16% over Q4 of 2020 with relative strength in bariatrics, cholecystectomy and hernia repair. The December impact of the current wave of COVID on U.S. procedures varied by region, with a greater impact in the Northeast and Midwest. Benign procedures such as benign hysterectomy experienced a more significant impact in December, reflecting the deferrability of certain elective surgeries. In Europe, the impact on COVID on procedures in December was most notable in France and Italy. Despite the fact that hospitals are generally better equipped to handle COVID patients today compared to the outset of the pandemic, COVID-19 resurgences like those currently being experienced in the U.S. and parts of Europe have challenged hospital resources and have negatively impacted da Vinci procedures. In the U.S., high COVID-related hospitalization rates have been exacerbated by staffing shortages. According to data reported by the Department of Health and Human Services, the proportion of hospitals reporting a critical staffing shortage doubled between July and December. In addition, delays in diagnosis and treatment of underlying conditions have and will also negatively impact da Vinci procedures. Q4 procedures in Asia were not significantly impacted by a resurgence in COVID, and we saw strong procedure growth across multiple specialties in China, Korea and Japan. While it is difficult to predict how long the current wave of COVID will last or the extent to which it will impact additional geographies, we expect that da Vinci procedures will be significantly adversely impacted in Q1. Brian will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call. Overall system placement results in Q4 were solid with U.S. placements of 235, up 20% from 196 in Q4 of 2020. System placements at greenfield customers were strong, up approximately 45% as compared to Q4 of 2020, driven by U.S. IDNs and new customers in OUS markets. Outside the U.S., we placed 150 systems in the fourth quarter compared with 130 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Current quarter system placements included 63 into Europe, 37 into Japan and 14 into China, compared with 54 into Europe, 22 into Japan and 13 into China in the fourth quarter of 2020. Capital strength in Japan was driven primarily by new customers in the private sector. As of the end of 2021, there were 63 systems remaining under the current quarter in China, which may be accessible to competitors should they receive local regulatory clearance. Globally, trade and transactions represented 30% of placements in the quarter, down from 40% last quarter and 49% for 2020. The remaining installed base of SI systems in the U.S. is approximately 343 systems. We expect the volume of trade-ins to be significantly lower in 2022 as compared to 2021. Macroeconomic conditions created by COVID, including supply chain constraints and staffing shortages, are challenging and could impact hospital capital spending. In addition, as competition progresses in various markets, we will likely experience longer selling cycles and price pressure. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: total fourth quarter revenue was $1.55 billion, an increase of 17% from last year. Leasing represented 37% of Q4 placements compared with 41% last quarter and flat to Q4 of 2020. The lower leasing mix in Q4 relative to last quarter reflected higher multisystem placements with a couple of IDNs who prefer to purchase systems. While leasing will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will continue to increase over time. Fourth quarter system average selling prices were $1.45 million, similar to $1.43 million last year and lower than $1.57 million last quarter. The sequential decline was primarily driven by a higher mix of bulk buy transactions with large customers. We recognized $26 million of lease buyout revenue in the fourth quarter compared with $25 million last quarter and $14 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,940 per procedure compared with $1,900 per procedure in the third quarter of 2021 and down 6% from $2,060 realized in the fourth quarter of last year. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the benefit of stocking orders in Q4 of 2020 and associated with the launch of our Extended Use Instruments program in the U.S. and Europe. The sequential increase primarily reflects continued growth of our advanced instrument portfolio. As we highlighted recently, revenue for our advanced instrument portfolio has grown over a 5-year period at a compound annual growth rate of 35%, and we are starting to see early and accelerating adoption in OUS markets. 10 of the systems placed in the fourth quarter were SP systems, including 3 systems placed at customers in Korea. Our installed base of SP systems is now 99. During the quarter, we further developed our SP ecosystem, receiving 510(k) clearance for our Firefly Imaging Technology. We also received 510(k) clearance for enhancements to our SP instruments, including an extension of lives to 6 of our 8 instruments. Growth of the SP platform will continue to be gated by additional clinical indications and clearances in markets beyond the U.S. and Korea. We placed 31 Ion systems in the quarter, bringing the installed base to 129 systems. Looking at the 93 Ion systems placed in 2021, 54% of those systems were placed under operating lease arrangements. For reference, the list price of our Ion system is $600,000 with ASPs generally a little below that level. As a reminder, Ion system placements and procedures are excluded from our overall system and procedure counts. The entirety of our Ion installed base is with an existing da Vinci customers, the majority of which have large pulmonary and thoracic departments. Our Ion platform is also installed the majority of accounts that have an IP fellowship program. We continue to be encouraged by customer feedback and look forward to the completion of our next major milestone, the full results from the PRECIsE study, which is expected in the second half of 2022. Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 70.1% compared with 69.7% for the fourth quarter of 2020 and 71.3% last quarter. The fourth quarter of 2020 included higher period costs associated with lower production and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges. Pro forma gross margin was lower than last quarter primarily as a result of manufacturing inefficiencies and higher logistics costs associated with the supply chain environment, lower system ASPs and a higher mix of systems revenue. Pro forma operating expenses increased 27% compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. The fourth quarter of 2021 included a $30 million contribution to the Intuitive Foundation compared with a $25 million contribution in the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase in fourth quarter operating expenses from a year ago reflected an increase in headcount, increased variable compensation and higher travel costs. We finished 2021 with almost 9,800 employees, an increase of 21% from the end of 2020. We believe the opportunity in robotic-assisted interventions to be significant and are planning to increase our investments significantly in 2022. We are at the early stages of our newer platforms, SP and Ion, and we will continue to invest in our digital and data capabilities. Brian will provide operating expense guidance later in this call. As Gary described, we are also investing in our infrastructure to support our growth objectives and facilitate our ability to scale. In 2022, we expect a significant increase in capital expenditures in the range of $700 million to $1 billion of capital investment for the year. A significant portion of this investment involves construction of facilities to provide incremental space for growth, to consolidate operations to enhance efficiency and to replace lease spaces with own spaces. These capital investments also expand our OUS footprint in support of opportunities for growth in key international markets, where da Vinci procedures are in earlier stages of adoption. These are multiyear investments. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 19.5% lower than our expectation, primarily due to a favorable U.S./OUS income mix. We expect that our pro forma tax rate will increase in 2022 and due to a previous change in U.S. tax law that became effective on January 1, 2022. Brian will provide details later in this call. Our fourth quarter 2021 pro forma net income was $477 million or $1.30 per share compared with $434 million or $1.19 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $381 million or $1.04 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with GAAP net income of $365 million or $1.01 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and IP charges, acquisition-related items and legal settlements. We ended the year with cash and investments of $8.6 billion compared with $6.9 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase in cash in the fourth quarter primarily reflected cash generated from operations. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian, who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our outlook for 2022.\nBrian King: Thank you, Jamie. Overall procedure growth for the full year 2021 was approximately 28% as compared to 1% in 2020 and increased 14% using a 2-year compound annual growth rate. Overall procedure growth was comprised of 27% growth in the U.S. and 32% growth in OUS markets. In the U.S., fourth quarter growth was driven by growth in procedures within general surgery. Bariatrics, cholecystectomy and hernia repair were the largest contributors to procedure growth within the quarter. Fourth quarter OUS procedure volume grew approximately 28% compared with 11% for the fourth quarter of 2020 and 30% last quarter. In 2021, we non-urology specialties approached half of all OUS procedures and grew faster than urologic procedures. More specifically, at a region and country level, in China, Q4 procedures also had broad-based growth in urology, thoracic, general surgery and gynecology. General surgery, thoracic and gynecology procedures grew faster than urology and combined, made up more than total urology procedures in the fourth quarter. In Japan, da Vinci prostatectomy has emerged as standard of care for the surgical treatment of prostate cancer. We've also gained significant market share in other urologic procedures, including partial nephrectomy and cystectomy. The robust growth that we continue to see in Japan is now attributable to growth in general surgery, thoracic and gynecology procedures that were granted reimbursement status subsequent to urologic procedures. In Europe, procedure performance varied by country, but in procedures outside of urology, growth was driven by colorectal, hysterectomy for cancer and thoracic procedures. Now turning to the clinical side of our business. I'll highlight 2 recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. During the quarter, researchers from the University Hospital of Southern Jutland and the University of Southern Denmark published results from a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the short-term outcomes of robotic-assisted and laparoscopic colon surgery for patients with cancer. This analysis included 20 studies from 2005 to 2020, describing comparing outcomes from over 13,000 subjects with over 1,500 robotic-assisted procedures and over 12,000 laparoscopic procedures. Between the 2 groups, a significant difference favoring the robotic-assisted approach demonstrated a 46% lower risk of anastomotic leakage -- sorry, in addition, robotic-assisted colon surgery showed a 69% lower risk of conversion to open when compared to the laparoscopic approach, while also demonstrating a 15% reduction in the overall complication rate favoring the robotic-assisted approach and a 7-hour reduction in time to regular diet. Interestingly, a subgroup analysis was performed analyzing right-sided hemicolectomies, noting the prevalence of this procedure in the studies analyzed. And with over 850 subjects in the robotic-assisted group and over 3,000 subjects in the laparoscopic group, the robotic-assisted approach was similarly favored with regards to anastomotic leakage, rate of conversion to open and the length of stay. The authors concluded in part, \"Robotic-assisted colon surgery showed advantages in colon cancer surgery regarding surgical efficacy and morbidity compared to laparoscopic colon surgery.\" In November of last year, Christopher Seder from Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, published propensity adjusted analysis comparing robotic-assisted and thoracoscopic anatomic lung resection in obese patients. Leveraging data from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons general thoracic database, Epithor, a French national database and McMaster University thoracic surgical database, over 8,000 subjects were identified for analysis with over 2,100 robotic-assisted subjects and over 5,900 VATS subjects included. After propensity score adjustments of the populations, the VATS patient showed a 15% rate of conversion to open compared to only 3% in the robotic cohort, which corresponded to risk of conversion 5x higher for the VATS approach. In addition, the robotic-assisted group demonstrated a shorter mean length of stay of approximately 0.7 days, 1% lower risk of respiratory failure and were more likely to be to start home after the procedure. Of note, this analysis is the first propensity-adjusted analysis comparing VATS and robotic-assisted anatomic lung resection in obese patients as well as the first to pull contemporary international patient level data. The authors concluded in part, \"Overall, these data suggest that obese patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer undergoing minimally invasive anatomic lung resection with VATS, have a higher rate of conversion to thoracotomy when compared to patients undergoing anatomic loan resection with robotic-assisted surgery.\" I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2022. Starting with procedures. As described in our announcement earlier this month, total 2021 da Vinci procedures grew approximately 28% year-over-year and 14% at a 2-year compound annual growth rate to roughly 1,594,000 procedures performed worldwide. During 2022, we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 11% to 15%. This range reflects the uncertainty associated with the course of the pandemic. The low end of this range assumes ongoing COVID pressure and hospital staffing shortages, while the high end assumes no significant new surges after the current wave. In addition, this range does not contemplate any material supply chain disruptions throughout the year. We expect 2022 procedure growth to continue to be driven by U.S. general surgery and procedure growth in OUS markets where we are at earlier stages of adoption. We expect similar seasonal timing of procedures in 2022 as we have experienced in previous years prior to COVID, with Q1 being seasonally -- the seasonally weakest quarter as patient deductibles are reset. We expect Omicron to have a significant adverse impact on procedures in the first quarter. With respect to revenue, as we have mentioned previously, capital sales are ultimately driven by procedure demand, catalyzing hospitals to establish or expand robotic system capacity. Capital sales can vary substantially from period-to-period based upon many factors, including U.S. health care policy, hospital capital spending cycles, reimbursement and government quotas, product cycles, economic cycles and competitive factors. Within this framework, we'd expect 2022 capital placement seasonality to generally follow historical patterns by quarter, but could also be impacted by hospital staff shortages and the allocation of resources to managing current care. During Q3 and Q4, 40% and 30%, respectively, of systems placements involve trade-ins of older systems to our da Vinci Xi. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect the volume of trade-ins to be significantly lower in 2022 as compared to 2021. Turning to gross profit. Our full year 2021 pro forma gross profit margin was 71.2%. In 2022, we expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 69.5% and 70.5% of net revenue. The slightly lower gross profit margin anticipated in 2022 reflects higher fixed costs from investments to drive growth of the business, strengthen our operating capabilities and also reflects the impact of higher supply chain costs. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions. Turning to operating expenses. In 2021, our pro forma operating expenses grew 19%. In 2022, we expect pro forma operating expense growth to be between 21% and 27%. The operating expense growth reflects increased investment in R&D for our new product platforms, expanding OUS capabilities and the return of other spending that was previously restricted by COVID. We expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $510 million to $550 million in 2022 compared to $452 million in 2021. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $45 million and $55 million in 2022. With regard to income tax, in 2021, our pro forma income tax rate was 22.2%. As we look forward, we estimate our 2022 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pre-tax income, with the increase primarily due to a change in U.S. tax treatment of certain expenditures that was enacted in 2017, but became effective on January 1, 2022. Lastly, we'd like to highlight that our Annual Sustainability Report will be available after this call on our Investor Relations website. In the latest report, we provide an overview of the current state of our sustainability strategy, areas of focus, key actions taken over the past year to develop sustainable solutions that meet our customer needs in new ways and our results achieved to date. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.\nOperator: . Our first question is going to come from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: Two questions for me. Gary, I wanted to start with a high-level question. You started using the slogan at the point of possibility recently, and you've talked about being at the point of possibility to build what's needed next. Can you talk about why you started using this new slogan? And what are the needs you're trying to address? And I had one follow-up.\nGary Guthart: No. I think we have -- thanks, Larry. I think we have a broad opportunity as a company here to take the methods that we have designed around identifying clinical need, doing the design and development of tech-enabled ecosystems to address that need and then working with customers to deliver it and train it. And there's, I think, long term, a lot of opportunity. As we look out there is substantial opportunity in existing markets and in new ones to do better for the quad aim. Doing this set, getting that set of ecosystem investments ready is heavy work. It's a multiyear effort. But we think we've shown that it can be done. And I think that's really what we're talking about here is the ability to start to impact other opportunities in international markets as we go forward. And Ion is such an example.\nLarry Biegelsen: And it seems like so far, you've mitigated potential supply constraints well. How are you trying to mitigate them going forward? And would you describe the situation is getting better or worse? And how concerned are you about that?\nGary Guthart: Yes. Kind of -- I'll take the top and then I'll let Jamie take some more. At the very top part, it's kind of 3 big buckets. One of them is specific products themselves, semiconductors come to mind. The second bucket is some raw material constraints and the kinds of things we build. And the third is just logistics and motion of materials. Jamie, I'll let you fill in that perspective.\nJamie Samath: Larry, so I think we said in our prepared remarks, we saw the supply chain environment actually get worse in Q4, and we highlighted that we actually had some, as I call it, minor constraints in our ability to fulfill customer demand. You have a set of metrics there in the supply chain. One example we've given is on-time delivery from our suppliers was worse in Q4 as compared to Q3. As you look forward, I'd say that at this point, visibility is still not great, kind of the best that we have is the Q1 will be similar to Q4, but I think we have to see -- wait and see what the impact of Omicron might be on our suppliers and just broadly. So I think we're continuing to navigate through it. As I said, our supply chain teams are really still in hand-to-hand combat every day working with our partners.\nOperator: Our next question now will come from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. \nTycho Peterson: Gary, you talked about being at the end of the replacement cycle for a little while now. And obviously, you're retiring the S models. I'm curious how we should interpret that comment about being near the end of the replacement cycle. And as we think about maybe where you could be headed from an innovation standpoint, is it all about kind of driving down the line of procedures, making procedures easier with less training and expanding into newer indications? Or maybe just I'm curious from a technology standpoint, if you could talk a little bit about at a high level where you're headed?\nGary Guthart: Yes. Let's talk for a moment about replacement cycles. I think you're referring to the SI, Jamie had mentioned it in his prepared remarks, and Brian had touched on it. I think they were pretty clear, and I won't go through that. I do think that from a business model point of view, we don't think that we need to drive capital upgrades on Intuitive's calendar to have a healthy business. What we look at is where can we drive the quadruple aim and how can we effectively do that for our customers. And in that setting, we have been investing in our Gen 4 platform and expansion, I talked about that in my prepared remarks as well. And it's been great for the customers and for us. That's not the only thing we'll do, but it's an important thing that we do. You had mentioned a little bit on the technology stack, what are the kinds of things we care about. And a lot of what we were driven by are what kinds of things can we do inside the body, in imaging, in informatics that will dramatically change outcomes or the experience of the patients or the care team. And that has -- you can see that in the kinds of things that we've brought to market. We have fantastic teams. We have things that we're working on that we have not yet discussed that we think will drive differences in outcomes. So it's not just working on new indications or just working on ease of use. I think those things are both important, but it's not limited to that. There are other things that are going on that we think can change the nature of our interaction with tissue and drive outcomes again and raise the bar there once more. Jamie, anything you'd want to add on the issue of SR replacement cycle?\nJamie Samath: I would just maybe give you some numbers. In 2021, globally, we did about 510 trade-ins. About 80%-ish of those were in the U.S. U.S. has been driving those trade-ins. And so then if you compare that to the remaining installed base of 343, it's why we provided the commentary that we expect overall trading volume in '22 to be significantly lower than '21 just because the remaining store base is being depleted.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. That's helpful. And speaking of innovation, can you touch on some of the SP enhancements? You talked about 510 clearance for extension of life for some of the instruments. Can you just clarify exactly what you got through?\nJamie Samath: Yes. So we've received, obviously, customer feedback along the way since we launched SP and some of our customers have asked for greater ability to do extraction. That's really around the range of motion within the anatomy of our instruments that do extraction and grip strength. As you grasp tissue, we've had customer feedback that we could improve the grip strength. And so along with the extension of lives, we responded to customer feedback and improve the instruments accordingly, as described.\nGary Guthart: We've done some other things, too. We have, as you know, dual console that helps with training of new surgeons and teaching environments. We extended the dual console capability into the SP space. Recently, we've launched and then upgraded some of the accessories that go with SP. So part of the process, for those of you who've been with us for a while, is continuous innovation that these things don't end where they start, and that's been true for SP.\nTycho Peterson: Great. One last one, just on the headcount. You started to call off highlighting all the additions last year. Should we think about a kind of similar magnitude of increase in '22?\nJamie Samath: I think if you look at the OpEx increase range that Brian provided, I think you can kind of draw a correlation between how headcount has kind of correlated to spending increase and I think that's a relevant starting point for '22.\nGary Guthart: We also gave you a mix in the script of kind of where they're headed, how much is R&D, how much is operations, commercial, and that's not a bad guide either as to kind of where the mix is going.\nOperator: Our next question then will come from the line of Amit Hazan from Goldman Sachs.\nAmit Hazan: I'll start with a shorter-term one, and then a longer-term one for Gary. Shorter term, just on the first quarter, just realizing the moving parts and it's fluid inside of the quarter. But how much help can you give us as to what you've seen so far? How do we model procedures in this environment? You said severely impacted, but we got to -- we have to put a number out there. So I'm curious, how much help you can give us for where the procedures are down at the moment or how much they're down, that would be terrific. And then also, on capital. If you're seeing anything quite yet in terms of delays in capital spending because of everything going on at hospital level and how we should think about '22 for capital spending relative to last year, what you feel the environment is like?\nJamie Samath: I mean I'll give you a couple of data points. So the greatest correlation we've seen historically on procedures is rates of hospitalizations. I believe that currently, U.S. hospitalizations related to COVID are beyond any of the previous ways. So I think you can kind of track how that has progressed so far and what some of the third parties are projecting for the remainder of the quarter. There's some modeling benefit to doing that. What I would point to is if you look at pre-COVID, so 2017, '18, '19, those -- the sequential change between Q4 and Q1 was about even, meaning it was about the same Q1 as Q4. So that's in a normal quarter. Most of the current wave will be in Q1. The impact of Omicron in Q4 was kind of later in the quarter. So I kind of start with a normal quarter would be flat sequentially and then model the rest of Q1 based on just hospitalization rates. With respect to capital, there's nothing at this point that we would call out. I do think that the combination of what's happening right now with COVID, along with staffing shortages, along with the extent to which the supply chain environment broadly could impact hospitals could make it challenging for hospital capital spending. They may manage that more carefully in such an environment. But there's nothing specific that we would call out at this point. What was the third part of your question, Amit?\nAmit Hazan: No, that was actually -- I just have a longer-term one for Gary on, just given some of your comments that you made, it just kind of brings up in my mind just to ask you about what your thoughts generally are about a SaaS-type model and more specifically, the SimNow. We've talked to some of your customers over the past year or so. And it seems like some of them are being charged for SimNow software is somewhere around $20,000 a year in the service line. And so I wanted to see how you would frame that specific opportunity inside of kind of thinking about it with your installed base? And then more broadly and more importantly, just to see -- if you could just talk to this kind of SaaS type of model and whether you'll -- we'll be seeing more of these types of offerings from you in the future?\nGary Guthart: Sure. On the issue of kind of recurring revenue or service models versus kind of capital single charge, we have taken a posture of being really flexible with what our customer wants. There are some really nice things about as the transition -- as the company has transitioned to a recurring model that customers can come to choose when they're ready to engage us and it doesn't require large upfront capital expenditures. For some things that are inherently services and if you think about simulation, it's not really about the hardware in the case of simulation. It's really about access to modules and modules that improve over time and modules that get built to be specific to competency-based training. Subscriptions make a lot of sense because you're not really trying to sell a piece of hardware, you're really helping them develop a training program over time. So we think increasingly, as our business in software and analytics and some of the digital tools that we're bringing come up, then subscriptions may make sense. And to the extent that they align with customers, we're happy to do it. I also like the idea of recurring revenue in that it focuses the organization on earning the customer's business every day that it's a lot less lumpy for them and it's a lot less lumpy for us. And if we're bringing value and helping them achieve their quadruple aim goals, then they're happy to stay with us in those events. So I would expect that the recurring revenue portion of our business keeps creeping up as a percentage of total revenue over time. So long as customers are aligned to that, that, that makes sense from their finances point of view, then that's what we'll pursue. And to the extent that they're interested in other models, then we are open-minded.\nOperator: Our next question now comes from the line of Rick Wise from Stifel.\nRick Wise: Gary, I thought I'd follow up on a couple of things. You highlighted very specifically for both Ion and da Vinci SP this concept of margins aren't where they will be. And over time, you're going to bring the business to scale. I was wondering if you could expand on that, maybe give us a flavor for where margins are now? And how do we think about is this 2 years away? Is it 5 years away? How do we think about the trajectory going forward there?\nGary Guthart: Thanks for the question. On the -- kind of where we're headed, we look at those architectures. And we think based on our experiences, understanding our supply chains, understanding what iterations and engineering and manufacturing look like that both of those platforms should be able to hit historical norms in the future years, and not forever in future years. That said, in the early innings here, you're at lower volumes relative to where you're going to be. You're also working through some manufacturing process improvements and doing some of the capital investments that you need to do in order to get unit cost down. I'll look to Jamie in terms of characterizing kind of roughly where they are. SP is a little more mature product line in our hands in terms of manufacturing and our GM and her team over there doing a really nice job identifying those opportunities and sequentially knocking them down over time, feels really good. It's a little earlier, and it's going through a little bit different growth ramp and so it's going to have to work its way down that process. Although we also feel good about kind of the core architectures that would give us some confidence that we can hit those objectives. Jamie, anything that you would want to add?\nJamie Samath: Rick, I would split the question kind of into 2 categories. There's gross margin and then there's, let's call it, the equivalent of operating margin. On a gross margin basis, kind of the actions that we have to take to get both Ion and SP to kind of, let's call it, target gross margins are well understood and it's really about execution over a period of time, a component of that will obviously be building scale. But I think those actions are well defined. They're a multiple-year effort.  On the operating margin side, it's really, what's revenue in relation to the amounts that we're investing. And that's obviously going to be a function of, in the case of Ion, how we adopt in lung cancer biopsy over time. And with SP, it's the additional indications and new geographies in terms of clearances. I don't have a scale for when we might reach those corporate average margins. I would say, though, for '22, given that SP and Ion are newer products, the gross margins there are dilutive as you'd expect.\nRick Wise : Yes. And just a follow-up for me. I mean it's clear you highlighted multi -- multiple ways that Asia from well this quarter, if I understood you correctly, procedures, I think you said were robust. And I'm just thinking about that thought in conjunction with your comments about where you're investing. And it sounds like a lot of the investments were in Asia. And I was just wondering if we should just -- how do I ask this? Does this suggest that you're thinking as we look over the next 3 to 5 years that there's more growth or more growth opportunity for Intuitive in the Asia Pacific region? Or how do we -- how do I think about those 2 facts and those initiatives, if that makes any sense? \nGary Guthart: I'd characterize it a little bit differently, Rick. The starting point on Asia, it is clearly an interesting market, country by country. We are making investments in Asia. I don't think I'd say that they are the dominant investments, but they're substantial because we think there's substantial opportunity there to make a difference in those markets. So it's a leg of growth, but not the only one. There are opportunities for us in other regions, whether it's Europe or elsewhere. There are also opportunities for us in other clinical indications and some of the clinical trial work we're doing as well as the expansion of platforms and other technologies that we're working on. So I'd characterize it as one of the legs, not necessarily the dominant leg. Jamie, anything you would like to add?\nJamie Samath: I would just say both regions are attractive to us. It's fair to say that at least in the last couple of years, Asia procedure growth has been a little ahead of Europe. But on a strategic view, both of those regions are attractive, and we're investing accordingly. \nOperator: Our next question now comes from the line of Matt Taylor from UBS.\nMatthew Taylor: So I wanted to ask one on innovation and one on competition. So on innovation, I appreciate some of the color that you gave on multiport. And I guess I've also noticed that you've, on your website, you've been hiring a lot of folks in kind of these endoluminal roles and looking at roles around things like node surgery. Could you talk about some of your investments there? Is there anything beyond what you're doing with SP and Ion that we should look out for? And overall, are there any bigger launches that we should expect this year, even if you're not going to tell them what they are, could you characterize what the cadence could look like of any kind of system upgrades or launches?\nGary Guthart: Yes. On the -- with regard to kind of forecasting future launches, of course, we won't give you any detail here. We'll launch them when we're ready to launch. In terms of the framing of your question, we are routinely developing applications for the platforms we have, whether it's bariatric, thoracic surgery in our multiport indications to new indications in SP and we're doing some trials in thoracic surgery and colorectal to new opportunities and flexible robotics and Ion.  And other platform investments that are currently not disclosed, the things that we're working on. So we're going to continue to do that. And some of them will come to fruition and be fantastic. And some of them may be things that we assess and then pivot as we learn more. So there's all of those things going on. And somebody was out scanning what we're hiring and scanning the kinds of patent applications we have, you'll see a great diversity of things we're interested. And it's a little bit like the first question on the call, when we say what are we talking about in terms of possibility. We really scour the acute intervention opportunity from the bottom of your feet to the top of your head and everything in between and start asking questions about whether we think there's a real opportunity for improvements in the quad aim and whether we could design a tech-enabled ecosystem to do something about it. And that's what informs a lot of that hiring. Some of it is near term and existing platforms. And some of it is future-oriented on platforms that may come to pass. So that's kind of how we think about it.\nMatthew Taylor: Okay. And maybe just one on competition.\nGary Guthart: Matt, we'll give you one follow-up.\nMatthew Taylor: Okay. Just on competition, you mentioned there's a potential for that to prolong selling cycle. It certainly doesn't seem like you're seeing any of that so far. Could you characterize whether there's been any change in the competitive environment to date versus a few quarters ago?\nJamie Samath: Certainly, you can see the competition is active at accounts. I think we've characterized that mostly as kind of reciprocal arrangements with respect to training center investments or reciprocal research investments. I don't think we call out any specific significant impact yet on selling cycles. But certainly, you can see the potential for over time.\nGary Guthart: All right. Well, thank you all. That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim: better, more predictable patient outcomes; better experiences for patients; better experiences for their care teams; and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in 3 months.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation for using AT&T Event Services. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gary Guthart",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today. 2021 required agility as we drove through significant headwinds to support customers and manage our supply chain. Our teams performed well, helping customers return to surgery when COVID allowed them and maintaining the integrity of our supply chain and workforce. Given our recent press release updating procedures, capital placements and revenues, I'll be brief in describing our full year 2021 results and spend a little more time outlining our plans for 2022 and beyond. Putting 2021 in context, demand for our robotically-assisted interventions has been resilient during COVID. While these interventions get delayed during COVID peaks, they return as COVID wanes, and that is encouraging. Pandemic stresses on health care systems emphasize the need for the kind of high-quality, minimally invasive interventions or products enable. MIS procedures allow greater use of ambulatory surgery, free up resources and ORs relative to other approaches and often enable faster patient return to home and overall recovery. In 2021, da Vinci procedures grew 28% compared to full year 2020, reflecting a partial recovery in surgery after the first wave of the pandemic. Over the 2-year period, 2020 and 2021, the compound annual growth rate in procedures was 14%. Capital installs were healthy in 2021, with our team placing 1,347 da Vinci and 93 Ion systems in the year, driving da Vinci placement growth of 44% over 2020 and at a CAGR of 10% over the past 2 years. With a 2-year CAGR in procedures of 14% and installed base growth of 10% over the same period, utilization of installed systems continue to climb through the pandemic. We think this is good for our customers and good for us. Jamie will give regional capital trends and Brian will give detailed procedure dynamics later in the call. The past 2 years have stressed more than health systems. Our ability to attract, develop and retain outstanding staff remains a key focus for us. Our team has performed well, supporting our customers and each other. In the year, we added approximately 1,700 employees to our team with net headcount growth of approximately 180 in R&D, 920 in operations and 340 in our commercial force. Of the 1,700 net additions, 700 were outside of the United States. Looking out over the next decade, we believe that the method we have developed to identify clinical need, then design a technology-enabled ecosystem for improving the quadruple aim, then deliver and train customers on this ecosystem, can positively impact a broad set of minimally invasive interventions. The opportunity and challenge for Intuitive is to evolve our ecosystem to support our customers and ourselves at scale and to choose procedural opportunities and platform architectures that made sense. Turning to investments in the mid-term. Our priority for use of our capital is to reinvest in the business, to develop new opportunities that improve the quadruple aim and to strengthen our operating capabilities at global scale. We are focused on driving a vital set of initiatives, and I'd like to describe the dynamics for you in a little more detail. In multiport, we believe our Gen 4 architecture is outstanding and we've been adding capability to this product line since launch, including significant expansion and upgrades to energy and stapling product lines, improved endoscopic imaging, the introduction of da Vinci X, the introduction of Extended Use Instruments, training technologies and finally, the introduction of new and upgraded connectivity and data management tools. Given the precision, robustness and overall performance of our Generation 4 robotics architecture, we will continue to innovate on this platform, bringing additional value to those customers who have standardized on Generation 4 fleets. We are also investing in new core capabilities for our multiport systems, both Generation 4 and beyond that we'll describe as they get closer to market. You should expect continued innovation from us here. Turning to Ion. Our first indication addresses a large unmet need in lung cancer biopsy and our focus is fully enabling our production capability and customer ecosystem for this indication. There is strong demand for lung biopsy, and we are working to expand manufacturing capacity of all processes for greater quality and lower costs at scale and run trials and address regulatory requirements that enable global expansion. Over time, we plan for total Ion program profitability to approach that of our corporate average as we execute against our volume, design and process improvement goals. We are pursuing additional applications for Ion, and we'll describe them as we get closer to market. For our single-port system, da Vinci SP has the opportunity to change the standard of care in 2 different types of soft tissue surgery: those that require the extraction of tissue that can be done through a small single port and those procedures that benefit from narrow entry into the body as a whole. Where Ion, at its current stage of launch, has a single indication that represents a large patient population, SP's opportunity is the aggregation of several midsized indications. For example, SP used in Transoral Robotic Surgery is growing steadily in the U.S. To broaden SP's applicability in the U.S. and other markets, we are undertaking clinical trials to support regulatory review. We believe that SP will serve several additional surgical specialties, which will allow our customers and us to leverage capital investments in the program. Like Ion, we plan for SP platform profitability to approach that of historical platforms over time, and we're encouraged by recent progress. Our customer digital efforts now represent roughly 5% of our total operating expenses and drive the business in 4 ways. First, the use of data and digital tools by customers to analyze their operations helps improve outcomes, reduce costs and increase customer satisfaction and retention. Second, digital and internal investments can decrease our cost to serving our customer. Third, some of our digital tools generate revenue themselves and finally, use of data and analytics internally can help our teams make better decisions. Because digital and data tools span our platforms and are used externally and internally, we do not account for them using the same financial models as our platforms, nor do we break them out as stand-alone financial engines. That said, we do evaluate digital and data projects against internal strategic and return analysis. Over the past 5 years, the annual number of instruments we produce has grown roughly 200% and the annual number of systems we produce has more than doubled. The number of customer professionals trained annually has nearly doubled, and our engineering staff has nearly tripled. Our product volume growth has also allowed us to in-source some of our high-volume accessories while investing in automation. This has a threefold benefit: improving supply chain robustness, improving manufacturing quality and lowering unit costs. As our training, R&D and manufacturing efforts move to scale, we're investing in infrastructure, factory builds, training center expansion and automation. These infrastructure investments are lumpy, and our current growth cycle requires building capacity. These projects have been planned over the past couple of years and will start amortizing first moderately in 2022 and more substantially in 2023 and '24, then normalizing over the next few years. For example, over the next 4 years, we'll be growing and consolidating facilities for operations, R&D and customer training space in Atlanta; doubling our Mexicali manufacturing footprint; doubling our R&D design space and operations space as our California headquarters; and finally, consolidating and growing our commercial training operations and R&D space in Germany. In summary, we'll build on our Generation 4 capabilities in multiport while innovating in clinical utility for multiport surgery broadly. We'll continue to bring our flexible endoscopy platform Ion to scale and drive capacity, quality and cost improvements while seeking to broaden access to new markets. In SP, we expect to expand indications in regional markets while driving manufacturing quality and scale. We will invest in regional training, R&D and manufacturing centers globally to support the growth of the business and pursue opportunities for operating leverage given volume, some of which we'll share with customers to catalyze elastic markets. Finally, we will continue to advance our digital efforts to enable fast, accurate and actionable decisions with our customers and for our company. Lastly, for 2022, particularly, we're focused on the following: first, outstanding customer support in the face of continued pandemic disruption; second, execution of our robotic and digital platform expansion in pursuit of new indications and new markets; third, general surgery growth in the United States; and finally, diversified growth outside the U.S. beyond urology. As we turn to our financial report, I'd like to formally thank Marshall Mohr, our outgoing CFO and new Head of Global Business Services, for his outstanding stewardship over the past 15 years, and turn the time over to our incoming CFO, Jamie Samath, who will take you through financial matters in greater detail. No. I think we have -- thanks, Larry. I think we have a broad opportunity as a company here to take the methods that we have designed around identifying clinical need, doing the design and development of tech-enabled ecosystems to address that need and then working with customers to deliver it and train it. And there's, I think, long term, a lot of opportunity. As we look out there is substantial opportunity in existing markets and in new ones to do better for the quad aim. Doing this set, getting that set of ecosystem investments ready is heavy work. It's a multiyear effort. But we think we've shown that it can be done. And I think that's really what we're talking about here is the ability to start to impact other opportunities in international markets as we go forward. And Ion is such an example. Yes. Kind of -- I'll take the top and then I'll let Jamie take some more. At the very top part, it's kind of 3 big buckets. One of them is specific products themselves, semiconductors come to mind. The second bucket is some raw material constraints and the kinds of things we build. And the third is just logistics and motion of materials. Jamie, I'll let you fill in that perspective. Yes. Let's talk for a moment about replacement cycles. I think you're referring to the SI, Jamie had mentioned it in his prepared remarks, and Brian had touched on it. I think they were pretty clear, and I won't go through that. I do think that from a business model point of view, we don't think that we need to drive capital upgrades on Intuitive's calendar to have a healthy business. What we look at is where can we drive the quadruple aim and how can we effectively do that for our customers. And in that setting, we have been investing in our Gen 4 platform and expansion, I talked about that in my prepared remarks as well. And it's been great for the customers and for us. That's not the only thing we'll do, but it's an important thing that we do. You had mentioned a little bit on the technology stack, what are the kinds of things we care about. And a lot of what we were driven by are what kinds of things can we do inside the body, in imaging, in informatics that will dramatically change outcomes or the experience of the patients or the care team. And that has -- you can see that in the kinds of things that we've brought to market. We have fantastic teams. We have things that we're working on that we have not yet discussed that we think will drive differences in outcomes. So it's not just working on new indications or just working on ease of use. I think those things are both important, but it's not limited to that. There are other things that are going on that we think can change the nature of our interaction with tissue and drive outcomes again and raise the bar there once more. Jamie, anything you'd want to add on the issue of SR replacement cycle? We've done some other things, too. We have, as you know, dual console that helps with training of new surgeons and teaching environments. We extended the dual console capability into the SP space. Recently, we've launched and then upgraded some of the accessories that go with SP. So part of the process, for those of you who've been with us for a while, is continuous innovation that these things don't end where they start, and that's been true for SP. We also gave you a mix in the script of kind of where they're headed, how much is R&D, how much is operations, commercial, and that's not a bad guide either as to kind of where the mix is going. Sure. On the issue of kind of recurring revenue or service models versus kind of capital single charge, we have taken a posture of being really flexible with what our customer wants. There are some really nice things about as the transition -- as the company has transitioned to a recurring model that customers can come to choose when they're ready to engage us and it doesn't require large upfront capital expenditures. For some things that are inherently services and if you think about simulation, it's not really about the hardware in the case of simulation. It's really about access to modules and modules that improve over time and modules that get built to be specific to competency-based training. Subscriptions make a lot of sense because you're not really trying to sell a piece of hardware, you're really helping them develop a training program over time. So we think increasingly, as our business in software and analytics and some of the digital tools that we're bringing come up, then subscriptions may make sense. And to the extent that they align with customers, we're happy to do it. I also like the idea of recurring revenue in that it focuses the organization on earning the customer's business every day that it's a lot less lumpy for them and it's a lot less lumpy for us. And if we're bringing value and helping them achieve their quadruple aim goals, then they're happy to stay with us in those events. So I would expect that the recurring revenue portion of our business keeps creeping up as a percentage of total revenue over time. So long as customers are aligned to that, that, that makes sense from their finances point of view, then that's what we'll pursue. And to the extent that they're interested in other models, then we are open-minded. Thanks for the question. On the -- kind of where we're headed, we look at those architectures. And we think based on our experiences, understanding our supply chains, understanding what iterations and engineering and manufacturing look like that both of those platforms should be able to hit historical norms in the future years, and not forever in future years. That said, in the early innings here, you're at lower volumes relative to where you're going to be. You're also working through some manufacturing process improvements and doing some of the capital investments that you need to do in order to get unit cost down. I'll look to Jamie in terms of characterizing kind of roughly where they are. SP is a little more mature product line in our hands in terms of manufacturing and our GM and her team over there doing a really nice job identifying those opportunities and sequentially knocking them down over time, feels really good. It's a little earlier, and it's going through a little bit different growth ramp and so it's going to have to work its way down that process. Although we also feel good about kind of the core architectures that would give us some confidence that we can hit those objectives. Jamie, anything that you would want to add? I'd characterize it a little bit differently, Rick. The starting point on Asia, it is clearly an interesting market, country by country. We are making investments in Asia. I don't think I'd say that they are the dominant investments, but they're substantial because we think there's substantial opportunity there to make a difference in those markets. So it's a leg of growth, but not the only one. There are opportunities for us in other regions, whether it's Europe or elsewhere. There are also opportunities for us in other clinical indications and some of the clinical trial work we're doing as well as the expansion of platforms and other technologies that we're working on. So I'd characterize it as one of the legs, not necessarily the dominant leg. Jamie, anything you would like to add? Yes. On the -- with regard to kind of forecasting future launches, of course, we won't give you any detail here. We'll launch them when we're ready to launch. In terms of the framing of your question, we are routinely developing applications for the platforms we have, whether it's bariatric, thoracic surgery in our multiport indications to new indications in SP and we're doing some trials in thoracic surgery and colorectal to new opportunities and flexible robotics and Ion.  And other platform investments that are currently not disclosed, the things that we're working on. So we're going to continue to do that. And some of them will come to fruition and be fantastic. And some of them may be things that we assess and then pivot as we learn more. So there's all of those things going on. And somebody was out scanning what we're hiring and scanning the kinds of patent applications we have, you'll see a great diversity of things we're interested. And it's a little bit like the first question on the call, when we say what are we talking about in terms of possibility. We really scour the acute intervention opportunity from the bottom of your feet to the top of your head and everything in between and start asking questions about whether we think there's a real opportunity for improvements in the quad aim and whether we could design a tech-enabled ecosystem to do something about it. And that's what informs a lot of that hiring. Some of it is near term and existing platforms. And some of it is future-oriented on platforms that may come to pass. So that's kind of how we think about it. Matt, we'll give you one follow-up. All right. Well, thank you all. That was our last question.

            "name": "Jamie Samath",
            "content": "Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. Reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Q4 and 2021 revenue and procedures are in line with our preliminary press release of January 12. Before I dive into our Q4 results, let me start with a summary of our full year 2021 performance. Given the significant impact of COVID, we believe it's appropriate to review our 2021 results on both a year-over-year and a 2-year compound annual growth rate basis. Procedures increased by 28% as compared to 2020 and increased by approximately 14% using a 2-year CAGR. We placed 1,347 systems of customers during the year, an increase of 44% as compared to 2020 and up 10% using a 2-year CAGR. As a result of this procedure and system placement performance, 2021 revenue increased by 31% year-over-year and increased by 13% using a 2-year CAGR. Key business metrics for the fourth quarter were as follows: fourth quarter procedures increased approximately 19% compared with the fourth quarter of 2020 and increased approximately 13% using a 2-year CAGR. During the quarter, procedures continued to recover in October and November from the impact of the Delta variant in Q3. However, in December, procedures were adversely impacted by the increase in hospitalizations in the U.S. and parts of Europe as the Omicron variant spread rapidly. This trend has worsened so far into January. Fourth quarter system placements of 385 increased 18% from the 326 systems placed last year. As a result, net of trade-ins and retirements, we expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems over the last year by 12%. On a 2-year CAGR, our installed base is up 10%. Utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, increased approximately 7% compared to last year and increased approximately 3% using a 2-year CAGR. During the quarter, the supply chain environment became more challenging and remains highly dynamic. Our supply chain teams continue to work tirelessly with our supply chain partners to fulfill customer demand. In Q4, we experienced minor constraints in our ability to meet customer demand. For example, we had some limitations on supply of skill simulators. While these constraints were relatively minor and were immaterial to our overall Q4 financial results, they highlight the risk of potential significant disruption to our manufacturing operations due to the current supply chain challenges. U.S. procedures grew approximately 16% over Q4 of 2020 with relative strength in bariatrics, cholecystectomy and hernia repair. The December impact of the current wave of COVID on U.S. procedures varied by region, with a greater impact in the Northeast and Midwest. Benign procedures such as benign hysterectomy experienced a more significant impact in December, reflecting the deferrability of certain elective surgeries. In Europe, the impact on COVID on procedures in December was most notable in France and Italy. Despite the fact that hospitals are generally better equipped to handle COVID patients today compared to the outset of the pandemic, COVID-19 resurgences like those currently being experienced in the U.S. and parts of Europe have challenged hospital resources and have negatively impacted da Vinci procedures. In the U.S., high COVID-related hospitalization rates have been exacerbated by staffing shortages. According to data reported by the Department of Health and Human Services, the proportion of hospitals reporting a critical staffing shortage doubled between July and December. In addition, delays in diagnosis and treatment of underlying conditions have and will also negatively impact da Vinci procedures. Q4 procedures in Asia were not significantly impacted by a resurgence in COVID, and we saw strong procedure growth across multiple specialties in China, Korea and Japan. While it is difficult to predict how long the current wave of COVID will last or the extent to which it will impact additional geographies, we expect that da Vinci procedures will be significantly adversely impacted in Q1. Brian will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call. Overall system placement results in Q4 were solid with U.S. placements of 235, up 20% from 196 in Q4 of 2020. System placements at greenfield customers were strong, up approximately 45% as compared to Q4 of 2020, driven by U.S. IDNs and new customers in OUS markets. Outside the U.S., we placed 150 systems in the fourth quarter compared with 130 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Current quarter system placements included 63 into Europe, 37 into Japan and 14 into China, compared with 54 into Europe, 22 into Japan and 13 into China in the fourth quarter of 2020. Capital strength in Japan was driven primarily by new customers in the private sector. As of the end of 2021, there were 63 systems remaining under the current quarter in China, which may be accessible to competitors should they receive local regulatory clearance. Globally, trade and transactions represented 30% of placements in the quarter, down from 40% last quarter and 49% for 2020. The remaining installed base of SI systems in the U.S. is approximately 343 systems. We expect the volume of trade-ins to be significantly lower in 2022 as compared to 2021. Macroeconomic conditions created by COVID, including supply chain constraints and staffing shortages, are challenging and could impact hospital capital spending. In addition, as competition progresses in various markets, we will likely experience longer selling cycles and price pressure. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: total fourth quarter revenue was $1.55 billion, an increase of 17% from last year. Leasing represented 37% of Q4 placements compared with 41% last quarter and flat to Q4 of 2020. The lower leasing mix in Q4 relative to last quarter reflected higher multisystem placements with a couple of IDNs who prefer to purchase systems. While leasing will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will continue to increase over time. Fourth quarter system average selling prices were $1.45 million, similar to $1.43 million last year and lower than $1.57 million last quarter. The sequential decline was primarily driven by a higher mix of bulk buy transactions with large customers. We recognized $26 million of lease buyout revenue in the fourth quarter compared with $25 million last quarter and $14 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,940 per procedure compared with $1,900 per procedure in the third quarter of 2021 and down 6% from $2,060 realized in the fourth quarter of last year. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the benefit of stocking orders in Q4 of 2020 and associated with the launch of our Extended Use Instruments program in the U.S. and Europe. The sequential increase primarily reflects continued growth of our advanced instrument portfolio. As we highlighted recently, revenue for our advanced instrument portfolio has grown over a 5-year period at a compound annual growth rate of 35%, and we are starting to see early and accelerating adoption in OUS markets. 10 of the systems placed in the fourth quarter were SP systems, including 3 systems placed at customers in Korea. Our installed base of SP systems is now 99. During the quarter, we further developed our SP ecosystem, receiving 510(k) clearance for our Firefly Imaging Technology. We also received 510(k) clearance for enhancements to our SP instruments, including an extension of lives to 6 of our 8 instruments. Growth of the SP platform will continue to be gated by additional clinical indications and clearances in markets beyond the U.S. and Korea. We placed 31 Ion systems in the quarter, bringing the installed base to 129 systems. Looking at the 93 Ion systems placed in 2021, 54% of those systems were placed under operating lease arrangements. For reference, the list price of our Ion system is $600,000 with ASPs generally a little below that level. As a reminder, Ion system placements and procedures are excluded from our overall system and procedure counts. The entirety of our Ion installed base is with an existing da Vinci customers, the majority of which have large pulmonary and thoracic departments. Our Ion platform is also installed the majority of accounts that have an IP fellowship program. We continue to be encouraged by customer feedback and look forward to the completion of our next major milestone, the full results from the PRECIsE study, which is expected in the second half of 2022. Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 70.1% compared with 69.7% for the fourth quarter of 2020 and 71.3% last quarter. The fourth quarter of 2020 included higher period costs associated with lower production and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges. Pro forma gross margin was lower than last quarter primarily as a result of manufacturing inefficiencies and higher logistics costs associated with the supply chain environment, lower system ASPs and a higher mix of systems revenue. Pro forma operating expenses increased 27% compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. The fourth quarter of 2021 included a $30 million contribution to the Intuitive Foundation compared with a $25 million contribution in the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase in fourth quarter operating expenses from a year ago reflected an increase in headcount, increased variable compensation and higher travel costs. We finished 2021 with almost 9,800 employees, an increase of 21% from the end of 2020. We believe the opportunity in robotic-assisted interventions to be significant and are planning to increase our investments significantly in 2022. We are at the early stages of our newer platforms, SP and Ion, and we will continue to invest in our digital and data capabilities. Brian will provide operating expense guidance later in this call. As Gary described, we are also investing in our infrastructure to support our growth objectives and facilitate our ability to scale. In 2022, we expect a significant increase in capital expenditures in the range of $700 million to $1 billion of capital investment for the year. A significant portion of this investment involves construction of facilities to provide incremental space for growth, to consolidate operations to enhance efficiency and to replace lease spaces with own spaces. These capital investments also expand our OUS footprint in support of opportunities for growth in key international markets, where da Vinci procedures are in earlier stages of adoption. These are multiyear investments. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 19.5% lower than our expectation, primarily due to a favorable U.S./OUS income mix. We expect that our pro forma tax rate will increase in 2022 and due to a previous change in U.S. tax law that became effective on January 1, 2022. Brian will provide details later in this call. Our fourth quarter 2021 pro forma net income was $477 million or $1.30 per share compared with $434 million or $1.19 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $381 million or $1.04 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with GAAP net income of $365 million or $1.01 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and IP charges, acquisition-related items and legal settlements. We ended the year with cash and investments of $8.6 billion compared with $6.9 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase in cash in the fourth quarter primarily reflected cash generated from operations. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian, who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our outlook for 2022. Larry, so I think we said in our prepared remarks, we saw the supply chain environment actually get worse in Q4, and we highlighted that we actually had some, as I call it, minor constraints in our ability to fulfill customer demand. You have a set of metrics there in the supply chain. One example we've given is on-time delivery from our suppliers was worse in Q4 as compared to Q3. As you look forward, I'd say that at this point, visibility is still not great, kind of the best that we have is the Q1 will be similar to Q4, but I think we have to see -- wait and see what the impact of Omicron might be on our suppliers and just broadly. So I think we're continuing to navigate through it. As I said, our supply chain teams are really still in hand-to-hand combat every day working with our partners. I would just maybe give you some numbers. In 2021, globally, we did about 510 trade-ins. About 80%-ish of those were in the U.S. U.S. has been driving those trade-ins. And so then if you compare that to the remaining installed base of 343, it's why we provided the commentary that we expect overall trading volume in '22 to be significantly lower than '21 just because the remaining store base is being depleted. Yes. So we've received, obviously, customer feedback along the way since we launched SP and some of our customers have asked for greater ability to do extraction. That's really around the range of motion within the anatomy of our instruments that do extraction and grip strength. As you grasp tissue, we've had customer feedback that we could improve the grip strength. And so along with the extension of lives, we responded to customer feedback and improve the instruments accordingly, as described. I think if you look at the OpEx increase range that Brian provided, I think you can kind of draw a correlation between how headcount has kind of correlated to spending increase and I think that's a relevant starting point for '22. I mean I'll give you a couple of data points. So the greatest correlation we've seen historically on procedures is rates of hospitalizations. I believe that currently, U.S. hospitalizations related to COVID are beyond any of the previous ways. So I think you can kind of track how that has progressed so far and what some of the third parties are projecting for the remainder of the quarter. There's some modeling benefit to doing that. What I would point to is if you look at pre-COVID, so 2017, '18, '19, those -- the sequential change between Q4 and Q1 was about even, meaning it was about the same Q1 as Q4. So that's in a normal quarter. Most of the current wave will be in Q1. The impact of Omicron in Q4 was kind of later in the quarter. So I kind of start with a normal quarter would be flat sequentially and then model the rest of Q1 based on just hospitalization rates. With respect to capital, there's nothing at this point that we would call out. I do think that the combination of what's happening right now with COVID, along with staffing shortages, along with the extent to which the supply chain environment broadly could impact hospitals could make it challenging for hospital capital spending. They may manage that more carefully in such an environment. But there's nothing specific that we would call out at this point. What was the third part of your question, Amit? Rick, I would split the question kind of into 2 categories. There's gross margin and then there's, let's call it, the equivalent of operating margin. On a gross margin basis, kind of the actions that we have to take to get both Ion and SP to kind of, let's call it, target gross margins are well understood and it's really about execution over a period of time, a component of that will obviously be building scale. But I think those actions are well defined. They're a multiple-year effort.  On the operating margin side, it's really, what's revenue in relation to the amounts that we're investing. And that's obviously going to be a function of, in the case of Ion, how we adopt in lung cancer biopsy over time. And with SP, it's the additional indications and new geographies in terms of clearances. I don't have a scale for when we might reach those corporate average margins. I would say, though, for '22, given that SP and Ion are newer products, the gross margins there are dilutive as you'd expect. I would just say both regions are attractive to us. It's fair to say that at least in the last couple of years, Asia procedure growth has been a little ahead of Europe. But on a strategic view, both of those regions are attractive, and we're investing accordingly. Certainly, you can see the competition is active at accounts. I think we've characterized that mostly as kind of reciprocal arrangements with respect to training center investments or reciprocal research investments. I don't think we call out any specific significant impact yet on selling cycles. But certainly, you can see the potential for over time."

The rise of the Delta variant and stresses in some hospitals pressured the demand for surgery. Global supply chain disruption has yet to abate, necessitating redirection of internal resources to continue to meet our customers demand.  Despite these challenges, growth in the use of our products continued in the quarter and capital demand remained robust. Our new platforms advanced in their commercialization, in their innovation, and in their clinical programs. Turning first to procedures, the increased COVID burden tempered the recovery we saw in the second quarter, particularly in the month of August.  The impact of the Delta variant drove procedures in the United States below our expectations at the start of the quarter with run rate stabilizing the last couple of weeks of September. Adoption continues in the United States, driven particularly by benign general surgery procedures including bariatric surgery, cholecystectomy, and hernia repair.  A trend in malignant procedures remains solid, including prostatectomy, hysterectomy, lobectomy, and colon resection. Two trends that have emerged over the past few years are the increased use of da Vinci in benign procedures, and rising use of our advanced instrumentation and targeted procedures.  Both are the result of focusing on our customers\u2019 needs and delivering product and economic solutions to match. Outside the United States, procedure performance varied as a function of regional pandemic impact. In China, growths in the quarter were strong and span multiple specialties reflecting continued adoption.  In Japan and Korea, our procedure business remains healthy, with slight sequential procedure growth Q2 to Q3, despite COVID -related surgery disruption. Germany, the UK and France had reasonable year-over-year procedure growth and our customers are having success in diversifying procedure categories beyond urology.  Regarding the capital environment, new system placements continued to be robust. The United States had an outstanding capital quarter with a balanced mix of hospitals new to da Vinci, as well as healthy incremental placements for existing customers, and trade-ins of older technology.  This performance has been driven by collaboration with U.S. integrated delivery networks, as they thoughtfully manage and expand the capacity of their da Vinci fleets. Elsewhere, China, Japan, and Europe had solid placements in the quarter, and our placements in Brazil showed strength. Turning to our newer platforms. Our single-port system da Vinci SP had a solid quarter as we pursue additional indications. Placements of our flexible bronchoscopy platform Ion grew nicely sequentially in Q2 to Q3, powered by continued strong customer experiences in the field. Our finances were strong again this quarter though they followed an unusual path.  System strength and favorable system sales mix drove strong system revenue. Procedures grew at the low end of our expectations as a result of the Delta variant. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure moved down modestly as benign procedures continued to make up more of the procedure mix and our extended-use instrument program reaches equilibrium in the field.  Our spending grew sequentially and year-over-year as we continue to invest in expanding our new platforms and digital programs, as well as builds our go-to-market capabilities globally. Our expense growth was again modestly lower than planned, driven by some increase in time to fill open positions in a tight labor market, lower travel-related spending given the pandemic, and some under-spending in prototypes.  We will continue to invest in programs that fulfill the mission and build the Company. Turning to our innovation efforts, we developed and deployed technology-enabled solutions to support our customer\u2019s pursuit with the : better outcomes, better patient experiences, better care team experiences, and lower total cost to treat per patient episode. I would like to take a moment to overview the clinical status of our programs.  For our da Vinci system, there are now over 9.7 million lifetime procedures performed with over 28,000 peer-reviewed clinical publications. Da Vinci X and XI now have over 70 representative clinical usages allowing broad use across multiple clinical specialties from urology to gynecology, thoracic surgery, general surgery, and trends oral surgery. Tens of thousands of surgeons routinely use our multi-port systems.  We continue to invest in our multi-port products, instruments, and services to further expand our capabilities and indications. Many surgeons continue to work with us to pursue new learning with several prospective studies ongoing. Our flexible bronchoscopy system, Ion, continues to build momentum clinically and commercially, with several presentations and manuscripts updating Ion clinical progress at the 2021 CHEST conference this weekend.  As described in yesterday's press release, early clinical trial results point to outstanding capability allowing for definitive diagnosis of harder to reach body regions. Our teams are hard at work building our manufacturing and supply capabilities to meet rising demand. Our single-port system SP has a clinical database of 28 peer-reviewed clinical publications.  There are currently several ongoing prospective studies for SP in Korea and the United States, including our IDE trial for colorectal indications. This quarter, we received FDA approval of our unit portal thoracic IDE. Broad SP adoption will be paced by additional regional and clinical clearances, which remain our focus for the SP program.  Our digital solutions provide data-driven insights to surgeons, operative services and hospital administration. For virtual reality training to efficiency insights, to custom comparative outcomes analysis, these tools are now routinely employed by our customers and our teams to improve programs. Our analytics program supported thousands of customers in the quarter.  Turning to machine learning, our teams are at the leading edge of  -based clinical science for surgery through our collaborations with leading academic centers, informing algorithmic and scientific discovery. Taken together, these programs allow our customers to quantify our collective impact on the quadrupling quarter .  Before turning the time over to Marshall, today we announced some changes in responsibilities of our senior executive team. These changes are the result of a structured process over the past few years, and they are driven by our need to support growth in our product lines, commercial reach, operations capabilities and business infrastructure, as we scale to meet the global opportunity to advance minimum invasive care.  Starting January 1st, 2022, our Executive Vice President and Chief Business Officer, Dave Rosa, will take on an important new role of Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy and Growth Officer, leading our efforts to identify and realize long-term business opportunities, continuing to build the value of our integrated product offerings, and ensuring our customers clearly understand the value of our ecosystem in creating successful, minimally-invasive programs.  Henry Charlton, currently General Manager of the U.S. and Europe, will succeed Dave as Chief Commercial Officer overseeing global commercial sales, regional marketing, and commercial enablement. Also, Marshall Mohr will take on an important new position as Executive Vice President Global Business Services, bidding Intuitive 's continued growth in information technology, and our enterprise process, data and systems, and global facilities.  Jamie Samath, we will succeed Marshall as Chief Financial Officer. They are each outstanding proven leader and will report to me. We expect them to spearhead our efforts to achieve our mission and continue to position Intuitive as first choice of our customers in a growing marketplace. I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will take you through our financial highlights in greater detail.\nMarshall Mohr: Good afternoon. I want to describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance, later in my prepared remarks. Reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP result is posted on our website.  The information in our earnings release and within our prepared remarks reflects the 3-for-1 stock split completed earlier in October. Overall, third quarter procedures grew 20% year-over-year and reflect the impact of Delta variant resurgence. COVID also impacted third quarter 2020 procedures, making year-over-year comparisons complicated.  In the U.S., procedures grew 16%, reflecting the impact that COVID resurgence had on hospital resources regionally, the impact of the resurgence was most pronounced in August and early September, and regionally in the south and southeast. Later in the quarter, as COVID cases began to slow, procedures began to recover.  However, it is difficult to estimate the extent to which this resurgence or future resurgences will impact da Vinci procedures. Year-over-year, OUS procedures grew 30% with the impact of COVID varying regionally. In Europe, COVID had a greater impact in Italy and France, and less in UK and Germany.  While there continued to be COVID hotspots within some of our Asia-Pacific markets, overall procedures in the region performed well. China growth in the third quarter continued to be far higher than other regions, primarily reflecting system installation growth over the past year. Relative to the beginning of the pandemic, many hospitals are able to better manage increased COVID patient hospitalization.  However, staffing shortages and hospital supply chain issues are challenging some hospital capacities and could impact deferrable procedures, including da Vinci procedures, going forward. Jamie will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call. Key business metrics for the third quarter were as follows.  Third quarter 2021 procedures increased approximately 20% compared with third quarter 2020 and decreased approximately 3% compared to the last quarter. Compound annual growth between the second quarters of 2019 and 2021 was 13.5%. Third quarter system placements of 336 systems increased 72% compared with 195 systems for the third quarter of 2020, and increased 2% compared with 328 systems last quarter.  We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems over the last year by 11% to approximately 6,525 systems. This growth rate compares with 8% last year and 10% last quarter. Utilization of clinical systems in the field measured by procedures per system, increased approximately 9% compared with last year, and decreased 6% compared with last quarter.  Compounded annual utilization growth rate between the third quarters of 2019 and 2021 was 3%. Moving on to capital placements, system placements in the quarter reflected a continued trend of IDN multi-system purchases and were driven by procedure growth and hospitals upgrading in order to access our standardized and fourth-generation capabilities.  Looking forward, we see the following capital revenue dynamics. Procedure growth drives capital purchases in many of our markets, to the extent that COVID impacts procedures, it will also impact capital purchases. The trading cycle has been a tailwind to system placements. However, as the installed base of older generation product declines, the number of trade-ins will decline over time.  Leasing and alternative financing arrangements enabled customer access to our systems. While the percentage of systems placed under operating leases fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we believe leasing will increase as a percentage of sales over time, which will result in the deferral of otherwise current revenue into future periods.  Macroeconomic conditions created by COVID could regionally impact hospital capital spending, and as competition progresses in various markets, we will likely experience longer selling cycles and price pressure. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. Third quarter revenue was 1.4 billion, representing a 30% increase from last year and a 4% decrease from last quarter.  The compound annual revenue growth rate between the third quarters of 2019 and 2021 was 12%. The year-over-year revenue increase reflected growth in both procedures and system placements. The decrease relative to the second quarter of 2021 reflects lower instrument and accessory revenue associated with lower procedures and increased leasing as a percentage of placements.  Leasing represent 41% of current quarter placements compared with 35% last year and 33% last quarter. Leasing as a percentage of total sales has and will continue to fluctuate with customer and geographic mix. However, we anticipate more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than reflected in historical run rates.  40% of systems placed in the third quarter involve trade-ins, which is consistent with the 40% last year and higher than the 38% last quarter. As customers continue to upgrade to fourth-generation capabilities, the population of installed SI is decreasing, particularly in U.S. where 97 trade-ins were completed in the third quarter, leaving an installed base of SIs of approximately 425 systems.  As a result, we expect lower trade-out transactions over time. Trading activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict. Third quarter average selling prices increased to 1.57 million from 1.55 million for both the third quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2021. Average selling prices will fluctuate with geographic and product mix.  Consistent with historical patterns, we expect a higher mix and systems sold to distributors in the fourth quarter, which carry lower prices. We recognized 25 million of lease buyout revenue in the third quarter compared to 17 million last year and 26 million last quarter. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter, and will likely continue to do so.  Instrument accessory revenue per procedure of $1,900 decreased slightly compared with $1,910 per procedure for the third quarter of last year, and decreased compared with $1,940 per procedure in the second quarter. The year-over-year change reflects increased usage of extended-use instruments, mostly offset by increased usage of our advanced instruments.  The decrease from the previous quarter reflects customers continuing to adjust their instrument buying patterns to reflect the additional uses per instrument included in extended-use instruments. Ten of the systems placed in the third quarter were SP Systems. Our installed base of SP Systems is now 89, 10 in Korea, and 79 in the U.S.  We continue our measured roll out of SP as we work on gathering clinical data to gain additional procedure clearances in the U.S. We placed 28 Ion systems in the quarter, bringing the installed base to 98 systems. There were approximately 2,000 Ion procedures completed in the third quarter. Ion system placements and procedures are excluded from our overall da Vinci system and procedure counts.  Our rollout of  Progressing well. Outside the U.S. we placed 109 systems in the third quarter compared with 79 in the third quarter of 2020 and 115 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 47 into Europe, 20 into Japan, and 17 into China, compared with 39 into Europe, 15 into Japan, and 12 into China in the third quarter of 2020.  We also placed 9 systems in Brazil in the third quarter and now have placed 23 systems in Brazil over the past four quarters. Moving on to gross margin, and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2021 was 71.3% compared with 70.2% for the third quarter of 2020 and 71.7% last quarter.  The third quarter of 2020 included 23 million of service credits issued in conjunction with our customer relief program, higher period costs associated with lower production levels, and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges. The decline in gross margin relative to the second quarter primarily reflects product mix.  Product and customer mix fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, which can cause fluctuations in gross margins. COVID has impacted global supplier of semiconductors and other materials used in our products. While to date we've been able to secure supply necessary to ensure fulfillment of customer demand, our teams are expending significant time and effort to bridge future supply with demand.  To date we've experienced immaterial component increase, cost increases, and freight expedition fees. However, global shortages could result in future supply disruptions as well as delayed development and regulatory activities. We also expect supply issues to result in higher production costs.  Pro forma operating expenses increased 21% compared with the third quarter of 2020, and increased 2% compared with last quarter. The increase, compared to the prior year, reflects costs associated with higher headcount, increased variable compensation, and increased spending in areas impacted by COVID.  Third quarter spending was below our expectations due to delays in headcount hiring and lower spending on activities restricted by COVID, including clinical development, marketing events, and travel costs. In addition, COVID delayed some R&D work resulting in under spend on prototypes. We expect spending on activities restricted by COVID to increase as the impacts of the pandemic decline.  We also expect spending to increase as a percentage of revenue as investments in headcount infrastructure and other support area s catch-up to the growth of the business. Finally, we expect to continue to invest in expanding and accelerating our ecosystem of products and capabilities. Jamie will provide spend guidance later in this call. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 24%.  We recorded expense of 11 million associated with periods prior to 2020 related to guidance recently provided by the IRS associated with stock-based compensation. We expect our pro forma tax rate for the fourth quarter to be approximately 21.5%. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities, and with the impact of one-time items.  Our third quarter pro forma net income was 435 million, or $1.19 per share, compared with 334 million, or $0.92 per share, for the third quarter of 2020, and 477 million or $1.31 per share for the last quarter. Third quarter 2021 and 2020 included pre -tax gains of approximately 8 million and 62 million associated with investments in companies that resulted from development agreements entered into in prior years. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was 381 million or $1.04 per share for the third quarter of 2021 compared with GAAP net income of 314 million or $0.87 per share for the third quarter of 2020 and GAAP net income of 517 million or $1.42 per share for the last quarter.  We ended the quarter with cash and investments of 8.2 billion compared with 7.7 billion last quarter. The increase in cash in the third quarter primarily reflected cash from operations and stock exercises. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jamie.\nJamie Samath: Thank you, Marshall. Our overall third quarter procedure growth was approximately 20% compared to growth of 7% during the third quarter of 2020. Q3 procedure growth reflected 16% growth in U.S. procedures, and 30% growth in all U.S. markets. In the U.S. procedures in Q3 were adversely impacted by an increase in COVID related hospitalizations due to the Delta variant.  Procedures were particularly impacted in those states with relatively lower vaccination rates. As the number of COVID-related hospitalizations peaked and began to improve in September, we saw U.S. procedures start to recover. Q3 growth reflected relative strength in bariatric procedures, cholecystectomy, and hernia repair.  In the more mature procedure categories, year-over-year growth in prostatectomy was strong relative to historical averages and benign hysterectomy grew in the low single-digits range. Third quarter OUS procedure volume grew approximately 30% compared with 9% growth for the third quarter of 2020.  Third quarter of 2021 OUS procedures were driven by growth in prostatectomy and earlier stage growth in general surgery, gynecology, kidney cancer procedures, and thoracic surgery. China procedure growth remain strong and broad-based as a result of continued expansion of the installed base under the current quarter and the addition and training of surgeons new to the da Vinci platform.  Growth in Japan was solid, but was impacted by localized lockdowns stemming from ongoing efforts to prevent resurgences of COVID. Growth in Korea was also solid, primarily driven by gynecology, urology, and head and neck procedures. A little more than half of the procedures in these three key Asian markets are outside of urology.  In Europe, procedure growths vary by country based on the relative impact of the Delta variant and the impact of COVID -related mitigation measures. Growth in the UK and Germany was solid, with procedure growth in France and Italy impacted by reduced capacity for surgery as hospitals reserved resources for potential increases in COVID patients.  During Q3, customers in the U.S. and Europe effectively consumed their remaining inventory of 10 life instruments following the launch of extended-use instruments in those regions in Q4 of last year. With this full adoption in the U.S., customers are benefiting from INA per procedure costs that reduce by approximately 10% in lower acuity procedures such as cholecystectomy and hernia repair.  In Europe, customers are benefiting from an even larger reduction in NIA costs for target procedures. While recent procedure trends are confounded by the various waves of the pandemic, we believe based on customer feedback that the adoption of extended-use instruments is having a positive impact on targeted procedures.  In our new platform, Ion procedures increased almost 4 folds as compared to Q3 of 2020, driven by significant expansion of the number of systems of customers and an increase in usage in the existing installed base. Our single-port platform, which is gauged by additional regional and clinical clearances, showed solid performance with almost 50% year-over-year procedure growth.  Now, turning to the clinical side of our business, each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deemed to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive details of scientific studies that have been published over the years.  During the quarter, Dr. Michael Kent from Beth Israel Deaconess Center, Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, published results from a landmark multi-center Pulmonary Open, Robotic and Thoracoscopic Lobectomy or PORTaL study in y the annals of surgery.  This retrospective study sponsored by Intuitive compared lobectomy outcomes associated with open, VATS, and robotic assisted da Vinci surgery with over 6,000 cases included in this analysis. After 1-to-1 propensity score matching, a comparison of open and da Vinci lobectomies with approximately 800 patients in each group, showed a two-day shorter length of stay, and a 9.5% lower rate of prolonged hospital stay associated with da Vinci lobectomies.  The da Vinci cohort also had an approximately 8-minute shortened  time for cases without a concomitant procedure. Post - operative complications were approximately 9% lower with the da Vinci robotic approach.  With regards to the propensity score match comparison of minimally invasive approaches with over 1,700 patients in each group, the da Vinci approach evidenced of 1.1 day shorter mean length of stay, and a 6.1% low rate of conversion to thoracotomy when compared to VATS, with the differences in conversion rates report for each tumor stage in the analysis.  The authors concluded in part, \"In this retrospective multi-institutional data analysis, both robotic-assisted and VATS lobectomy were associated with improved peri -operative outcomes compared to open lobectomy. \" Robotic-assisted lobectomy was associated with additional differences compared to VATS, such as a reduced length of stay and conversion rate.  In August of this year, Professor Umberto Bracale from the University of Naples Federico II in Naples, Italy published a systematic review with meta-analysis of transversus abdominis release (TAR) for ventral hernia repair, assessing short-term outcomes of the open and robotic-assisted approaches.  The macroanalysis combined six studies, containing over 800 patients, of whom just over 200 patients underwent robotic - assisted da Vinci surgery, and just under 600 patients who underwent the open approach. Results of this macroanalysis found that robotic-assisted approach was associated with a full point 4 day shorter length of stay, 64% lower risk of post-operative complications, and 79% low risk of developing systemic complications.  Readmission and reoperations were comparable between both groups. The office concluded in part, \"Based on the data for the metro analysis, the robotic approach for TAR seem safe and feasible, even in more difficult cases. Robotic assisted TAR shows the common advantages of minimally invasive procedures that improve short-term outcomes with significant benefits in the early post-operative period. \" Lastly, as noted in yesterday's press release, preliminary results from the precise study evaluating outcomes associated with the Ion endoluminal system will present into the Annual CHEST Conference. This preliminary analysis of 69 subjects showed a diagnostic yield of 83% with a sensitivity of malignancy of 84% to 88% from the biopsy of peripheral pulmonary nodules with a mean size of 17 millimeters.  These initial outcomes regarding the performance of the Ion system are encouraging and we look forward to the full study being published in the second half of 2022. I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2021. During Q3, we experienced a more challenging supply chain environment for the deterioration in on-time delivery performance from our suppliers. We also saw increased supply chain costs.  While this did not have a material impact to our operating results in Q3, the outlook we are providing does not reflect any potential significant disruption or additional costs related to supply constraints. Starting with procedures, last quarter we forecast 2021 procedure growth of 27% to 30%. Given Q3 results and the impact of the Delta variant, we are now narrowing our full cost and expect full-year 2021 procedure growth of 27% to 29%.  This procedure outlook does not reflect a significant impact from a  stopping shortages or a resurgence of COVID-19. The high-end of the range assumes the COVID-19 related hospitalizations in the U.S. continued the recovery that began in September, and the COVID -related mitigation measures in OUS markets continued to ease.  Turning to gross profit, on our last call, we forecast our 2021 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 70.5% and 71.5% of revenue. We now expect 2021 pro forma gross profit margin to be within 71% and 71.5% of revenue. This range does not reflect any significant disruption associated with the current supply chain challenges.  Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter, depending largely on product, regional, and trade-in mix, the impact of product cost reductions in manufacturing efficiencies, and competitive pricing pressure. With respect to operating expenses, on our last call, we forecast to grow full-year pro forma 2021 operating expenses between 17% and 21% above 2020 levels.  We are refining our estimate and now expect a full-year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 17% and 19%. We expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between 450 and 460 million in 2021. With regard to pro forma other income which is comprised mostly of interest income, we expect a range of between 50, 55 million in 2021.  Finally, with respect to income tax, we expect our Q4 2021 pro forma tax rate to be approximately 21.5% of pre - tax income. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to ask a question . We'll go first to Amit Hassan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAmit Hazan: Hello. Thanks and good afternoon. I want to come back to the supply chain comment first. Just ask you how visibility looks for componentry now versus maybe a little bit earlier this year, what lead times look like now, it sounds tighter, just a little more color around that and to what extent have you already been able to either double order, for lack of a better term, I guess, or stockpile this year, and how viable of an option does that remain for you?\nMarshall Mohr: Yes. I think -- Amit, it's Marshall. The environment, as it relates to supply chain, has deteriorated and got more difficult over time. And as we said, we've dedicated substantial resources to dealing with those shortages. And it has not, to-date, created an issue with us supplying customer demand. But there is a risk, and it's a real risk until we call it out to make sure that everybody is aware of that.  From the perspective of costs, we talked some cost increased material costs last quarter. They were not significant. And we also incurred some expediting fees associated with freight. Again, not material. But going forward, we do expect increased costs, and that will probably hit the margin in Q4 or Q1. It's hard to predict exactly how much until -- I think that summarizes it for you. It's difficult environment right now.\nJamie Samath: I just -- I think our supply chain and manufacturing teams are doing great. I think they're working in a tough macro-environment, and that macro-environment will clear up when it clears up.\nOperator: Our next question we go to Larry Biegelstein with Wells Fargo. Go ahead, please.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two for me: one on Ion, Gary, and then one on procedures. So the precise data look good. Yesterday, I guess the question is do you think the early data suggests your shape sensing technology can lead to better yields and lower pneumothorax rates versus your main competitor, which uses a different technology? And how much of a catalyst do you think the data from yesterday will be for Ion? And I just have one follow-up.\nGary Guthart: Yeah. I think that the architecture as a whole, the shape sensor, the way it works, the design choices about making a soft catheter that's quite and can go deep into the  been really strong for us. And I think the data speaks for itself.  You can compare for yourself the data that focuses and that for Monarch, and we feel great about where we are. I think it is catalyzing. As we speak, I think that those results are helping us in the market. Our customers are giving us really good feedback. And we continue to invest in operations part of that program as well as the innovation side. We feel really good about.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Thanks for that, Gary. And then on procedures, I guess it sounds like most or if not all major markets are moving in the right direction. I'd love to hear a little bit more color, particularly on the U.S. and it sounds like Jamie, and by the way congratulations on the new role, it sounds like we should expect normal seasonality in Q4.  When we look at 2018 and 2019, the sequential procedure growth was very similar worldwide U.S. and OUS, is it possible that it could be a little stronger given that we're seeing a recovery? Thanks for taking the question.\nJamie Samath: Thank you, Larry, by the way. I would say this, what are reflected in the high-end of our procedure guidance are really two things. Those COVID-19 related hospitalizations in the U.S. continued the recovery that began in September, and that was in the middle part of September that that recovery commenced. So there's a progression there that continues through Q4.  It also assumes that the mitigation measures in OUS markets, which are typically a little more conservative than we see in the U.S., continued to ease, and those also started to ease in September. At the low end, what we see is a slower recovery in the U.S. from what we saw in Q3 and choppiness OUS in terms of the on-off of mitigation measures in various markets. And so that range of 27% to 29% that we provided, really it's just a function of the rate at which we recover from what occurred in Q3 with the Delta variant. That was a little color on that.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Thanks so much. Yeah. Go ahead.\nGary Guthart: Just jumping in. I think there are two things that are going on. One is, what will pace us is hospital availability for surgery  it. It's not infection rate, it's going to be resourced consumption at the hospital and their ability to pivot their resources, both human capital and facilities, back towards surgery.  As you double-click on that, some of it is regional variance, but some of it is actually just hospital system variance. There are differences in how each hospital has managed it. So it's hard to generalize, I think, beware of averages.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Got it. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Go ahead, please.\nRobert Hopkins: Thank you and good afternoon. Just to follow up on that last question. So for Jamie or Marshall, I guess, therefore, do the procedure volumes that you are forecasting for Q4, is that assuming improving year-over-year growth in Q4 versus the year-over-year growth in Q3, or about the same?\nJamie Samath: Yes. The -- I think what's implied by the guidance that we provided at the low-end of Q4 year-over-year growth will be 15%. At the high end, it will be 22%. So you compare that to what we showed in Q3 of '20, and you see the range is above and below what we recorded in Q3. And I think again, it just reflects both the year-over-year comparison in terms of the base for Q4 in 2020 as well as the range of scenarios in terms of what actually occurs with procedures in Q4.\nRobert Hopkins: Okay. Thank you for that. And then just one quick one for Gary, I was struck by your comments in your opening remarks about your -- how your multi-port systems now have 70 clinical uses. And I was curious, you just elaborate on that a little bit. Is that 70 different surgical procedures or how are you characterizing clinical usage? I found that an interesting number.\nGary Guthart: Yeah, that's right. It's the number of different procedures that's described in our labeling as to where this might be used in the body or in sub-specialties. So if you look in urology, there's a handful of different procedures that it can be used for and likewise gynecology general surgery. And as you just walk through, that's a set of procedures for which we've engaged the agency and put in our labeling. So they are quite broadly applied.\nRobert Hopkins: Okay. My model only has 10, so I guess I have some work to do. Thank you.\nGary Guthart: You got 10. And we're not done. I think surgeons and we and regulatory agencies around the world continue to explore where else technologies like ours can go.\nRobert Hopkins: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTycho Peterson: Good afternoon. I wanted -- I think you can elaborate a little bit more on the staffing shortage comments. I know this isn't maybe fully baked into guidance, but how much risk do you think this presents? How widespread it did? Obviously, there's very tight labor market, but just something you're seeing across most of your customers or how would you characterize it?\nGary Guthart: On the -- you're referring to the customer side?\nTycho Peterson: Correct.\nGary Guthart: Yeah. Jamie wanted to talk a little bit about it.\nJamie Samath: Yeah. We've had anecdotal inputs from some customers that they're facing staffing shortages. Other customers have said to us that they're able to overcome those risks. And so given the mix dynamics and the lack of clear evidence in terms of its impact on procedures, what we've said is the remainder of the year guidance does not reflect any significant disruption from the last staffing shortages, meaning that there's no deterioration in the phenomena for hospitals.\nTycho Peterson: And then another dynamic you flagged was just the selling cycle. Obviously, early days on the competitive front, but on the back of the CE Mark for Medtronic, I'm just curious, out of your -- what you're hearing from your sales reps just in terms of early interest, potential demos things like that.\nGary Guthart: Yeah. I think with several of the other systems that are on the market, and as you say, the most recent one, we see early engagement. Those first engagements tend to be a placement of clinical trial sites and training centers and so on. So they are not surprising. They're their early access programs to get into the market up.  So far there are far a number of claims about what these new systems will do and I think the reality is time will tell the genuine systems. I think evidenced has to be generated to backup those claims. And so far, we don't see anything yet that looks like evidence. Just the said claims, so we'll keep serving our customer, doing what we can to make sure that they can achieve the quadrupling. And we'll see how other companies do.\nTycho Peterson: Maybe last one, we have we always get the question about new system for you guys. It feels like that you picked up a little bit lately. You're putting up good system numbers. I'm curious in your view, is that something the market needs right now? What do you wanted to say, if anything at all, about the appetite for another system from you guys or anything you may be working on?\nGary Guthart: First thing is that we think there is room for innovation on all the platforms we have. So whether it's multi-port and Gen 4, we continue to innovate. We've done a lot of sequential innovation on Gen 4, so our X and XI are different  we continue to invest both in incremental opportunities and in deeper, bigger opportunities on multi-port.  And as we're ready to roll those out, you'll hear about it. We brought to market SP, we continue to innovate on SP, and get sequential products and clearances globally for SP. And likewise Ion, which is having great success early in its first indication but we think has opportunities deeper in the body and different locations in the body, which will proceed and describe over time.  So yeah, I think you should expect continued innovation from us. As to whether we think that we're in immediate need of something, we are innovating at a pace where we think we can bring things that matter to the quadrupling, not so much an idea of what's our retail strategy, but more can we do something that changes quadrupling or otherwise improves the customer experience, and that's what we're focused on.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. Go ahead, please.\nFrederick Wise: Good afternoon, everybody. One focused question and then a larger picture when Gary when you -- in your opening comments, you mentioned that extended life instruments, if I understood, have reached I thinks the urban forward was equilibrium.  I just want to make sure I understood what you were implying that suggest that the initial phase of adoption has happened and we're going to see better growth X, sort of initial stocking ASP impact. And is there a second round of instruments? This has been so successful. How all should we think about all that?\nGary Guthart: Well, with regard to what I meant by equilibrium, it was really that the initial stocking orders and the transition from older instruments to newer is largely taking place, but I'll let Jamie answer that more carefully than I just did.\nJamie Samath: Actually, I think that's right, Gary. There's a period of time when as we launched extended-use instruments, customers in the U.S. and Europe in particular were ordering those instruments array higher than their usage as they consume the 10 life instruments that took some time to gain to parity. And so you saw in the end of positive benefit to Ion per procedure in Q1 and Q2.  Q3 for those regions that largely came to parity. We did launch extended-use instruments later in Asia and some of the rest of the world countries. And so they are still working their way to parity. So there will be small downward pressure on NIA per procedure holding everything else equal as they get to parity looking forward.\nFrederick Wise: Thank you.\nGary Guthart: The second half of your question, just to finish it, you talked about are we done, is that it for these kinds of ideas and extended-use instruments and da Vinci, these were design and process investments that we made to pursue what we think of is the virtuous cycle. The idea that if we can improve quality and lower cost for our customers, that they can use our products in more and different procedures.  And we're not done doing that. It may not look exactly like what we've done in the past, there are other things that we think we can do with it. Allow them high-value systems at different price points, or value instruments at different price points, so that line of reasoning has not exhausted.\nFrederick Wise: And Gary, just one last big picture question. Obviously, you've created 2 new senior leadership roles here, for Marshall and for Dave Rosa. Maybe just -- if you could just flush out your thinking.  Is it simply -- and it would be enough that Intuitive has gotten so large and complex in the future, to survive, you just need more senior leadership -- focused leadership? Or what are you charging? What are you expecting? What should we expect from Marshall and Dave in the coming years? Thank you.\nGary Guthart: Thank you for that question. Over the last few years, we've had an expansion of business and expansions of opportunity, both are happening. On the business side, we want to make sure that we serve our customers at very high-quality quickly in local regions where we can, and that we take advantage of a lot of the systems enterprise data that we have to help drive the business and help our customer.  And that's something that Marshall has been doing and I've asked them to double down on that to make sure that we can really take advantage of our global scale and serve our customers in our business really well at that scale. And it's an opportunity and it's a real work. The flip side is I have never been more positive about the long-term opportunity for companies like ours that can master the kinds of things that we have to do to help minimum invasive care and interventions.  And so there's real opportunity there. And I'd like us to get there quickly to have the agility and focus to be able to open new ideas and new architectures and new markets. And I can think of nobody more qualified to lead that effort than Dave Rosa, who is visited just about all parts of the Company.  He started off as an engineer and scientist and has done many things for us. So we're really trying to get the advantages of scale to help our global customer and also be agile in capitalizing on growth opportunities as we see them.\nFrederick Wise: Thank you so much, Gary.\nOperator: Next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS. Go ahead, please.\nMatt Taylor: Hey. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping maybe, Marshall, you could talk a little bit more about the supply chain issues from the standpoint of just helping us get visibility or understand how close you are to the edge there. And meaning, you keep calling out this risk that exists but it sounds like you've been doing a really good job with managing things so far.  Is there any benchmark numbers you can give us to help us understand what the lead times are in some of the key things that could get disrupted or the likelihood that it will happen? Is it getting better or is there a real risk of you not being able to ship some product is I guess the core of the question?\nMarshall Mohr: I don't think I can say it's getting better. I actually think that it's difficult situation and will continue for some time. If you think about the one that's been talked about the most, the semiconductors, you've seen it in the auto industry, it's an issue in computers. And if you had to order any home goods that contained chips, you would know that there's a problem there.  That will take a long time to remedy. It takes a long time to build fabs, it takes a long time to produce product, and so I think that will go well into next year the predictions that we're hearing. I think Gary told you our team has done a marvelous job so far. So I think there are issues on a regular basis, and the issues so far that our team has been able to resolve those.  I don't have any statistics to provide you on how often, or what it means. I would just say that some -- anecdotally, some lead times have extended beyond 6 months. That's not all our products, and it's not an average you should apply to everything, but in some cases it's pretty long. And so I think it's a problem we highlight as just to make sure that you're aware of the risk.\nMatt Taylor: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And we have a follow-up question from Amit Hazan with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please.\nAmit Hazan: Thank you for that. I thought maybe just to follow up on the spiky question was just a little bit more on just inflationary headwinds generally. And Marshall, just how you're seeing labor costs growth today versus early in the year or more normal times and raw material cost growth versus normal times.  And it's just hard for us to start thinking about these things along with what you commented on the supply chain for next year is just qualitatively as we start to think about where operating margins might go.\nMarshall Mohr: We've seen some cost increases. Again, they haven't been that significant. And frankly, our teams have done a marvelous job of sort with efficiency and effectiveness to offset those increased costs. But we're hearing from suppliers that they're going to raise their prices.  And so we're saying that hey, we expect that costs will go up more. Not sure. I want to say that the inflation where it is has hit us and am here to stay, but we are seeing some supplier's raise costs.\nAmit Hazan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from  Evercore ISI. Evercore ISI,? go ahead, please.\nVijay Kumar: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Gary, maybe 2 quick one\u2019s for you. The precise study 80% diagnostic resolution. Could you -- is that good enough, Gary? Certainly, when -- the headline numbers, when we look at other studies, it's a good number. But I'm just curious, is the point where the market beckon to these new numbers and should we see an inflection in adoption of Ion?  And just one quick one on 3Q. I know you called out the Delta but was there any labor shortage impact in 3Q itself? Because historically we haven't seen the pandemic impact or Intuitive has outperformed peers. It just perhaps a little excessive in 3Q. Was there something else going on? Thank you.\nGary Guthart: Okay. On the first one, in terms of diagnostic yield, you had said 82% and I guess what I'd advise everybody is, there's a couple of numbers that are important and they stay linked together. And that is what the size of the lesion is? And then what's the positive diagnostic rate, the ability to definitively diagnose? That's what the interventional pulmonologists are looking at.  So the bigger the lesion, if it's 3-centimeter lesion, your diagnostic yield rate is going to go up your definitive because it's easier to hit. So you got to look at both numbers. It's not a single metric. So 82 for smaller lesions are leading, as far as I can tell for endobronchial approaches for that approach. Some folks can get to higher yield rates, but they are hitting bigger targets.  So you need to look at both, and that's what I encourage you to do. The second thing that I advise you is that there are other ways to examine or get a biopsy. There can be outside the body, CT-guided needle biopsies, and those outside the body CT-guided needle biopsies have high success rates at gathering the tissue, but they have a lower safety profile than the endobronchial approach.  So there's a third dimension, which is, did you get the tissue you needed to get a definitive diagnosis? How big was the lesion you were trying to target? Then what was the complication rate. And we think that Ion is really good at managing all 3 of those relative to competitive approaches, and we're seeing a nice uptick as a result. And is that a tipping point? We'll see. So far, so good. That's what we had expected.  This kind of performance, that's what we were targeting. We're pleased to see it being borne out over multiple sites and multiple customers, and we think that's going to be helpful. With regard to your second question, you were talking a little bit about are we seeing an unusual or more aggressive slowdown because of Delta, then perhaps others.  What I'd encourage you to think about there is where in the world everybody is exposed and where they are seeing their growth. So in our case, we have a certain regional profile where our procedures are being done. Other companies may have much bigger exposure to say markets or countries that have a lower impact having to do with Delta. Frankly, I think it's as simple as that, but time will tell on that as well.  So let's go ahead and conclude. That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions.  Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians, and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed a Quadruple Aim: better more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams, and ultimately a lower total cost of care.  We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It falls from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs, and their environment. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to speaking with you again in three months.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T event conferencing. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Gary Guthart",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today. Our team performed well in the third quarter in the face of pandemic-related headwinds. The rise of the Delta variant and stresses in some hospitals pressured the demand for surgery. Global supply chain disruption has yet to abate, necessitating redirection of internal resources to continue to meet our customers demand.  Despite these challenges, growth in the use of our products continued in the quarter and capital demand remained robust. Our new platforms advanced in their commercialization, in their innovation, and in their clinical programs. Turning first to procedures, the increased COVID burden tempered the recovery we saw in the second quarter, particularly in the month of August.  The impact of the Delta variant drove procedures in the United States below our expectations at the start of the quarter with run rate stabilizing the last couple of weeks of September. Adoption continues in the United States, driven particularly by benign general surgery procedures including bariatric surgery, cholecystectomy, and hernia repair.  A trend in malignant procedures remains solid, including prostatectomy, hysterectomy, lobectomy, and colon resection. Two trends that have emerged over the past few years are the increased use of da Vinci in benign procedures, and rising use of our advanced instrumentation and targeted procedures.  Both are the result of focusing on our customers' needs and delivering product and economic solutions to match. Outside the United States, procedure performance varied as a function of regional pandemic impact. In China, growths in the quarter were strong and span multiple specialties reflecting continued adoption.  In Japan and Korea, our procedure business remains healthy, with slight sequential procedure growth Q2 to Q3, despite COVID -related surgery disruption. Germany, the UK and France had reasonable year-over-year procedure growth and our customers are having success in diversifying procedure categories beyond urology.  Regarding the capital environment, new system placements continued to be robust. The United States had an outstanding capital quarter with a balanced mix of hospitals new to da Vinci, as well as healthy incremental placements for existing customers, and trade-ins of older technology.  This performance has been driven by collaboration with U.S. integrated delivery networks, as they thoughtfully manage and expand the capacity of their da Vinci fleets. Elsewhere, China, Japan, and Europe had solid placements in the quarter, and our placements in Brazil showed strength. Turning to our newer platforms. Our single-port system da Vinci SP had a solid quarter as we pursue additional indications. Placements of our flexible bronchoscopy platform Ion grew nicely sequentially in Q2 to Q3, powered by continued strong customer experiences in the field. Our finances were strong again this quarter though they followed an unusual path.  System strength and favorable system sales mix drove strong system revenue. Procedures grew at the low end of our expectations as a result of the Delta variant. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure moved down modestly as benign procedures continued to make up more of the procedure mix and our extended-use instrument program reaches equilibrium in the field.  Our spending grew sequentially and year-over-year as we continue to invest in expanding our new platforms and digital programs, as well as builds our go-to-market capabilities globally. Our expense growth was again modestly lower than planned, driven by some increase in time to fill open positions in a tight labor market, lower travel-related spending given the pandemic, and some under-spending in prototypes.  We will continue to invest in programs that fulfill the mission and build the Company. Turning to our innovation efforts, we developed and deployed technology-enabled solutions to support our customer's pursuit with the:better outcomes, better patient experiences, better care team experiences, and lower total cost to treat per patient episode. I would like to take a moment to overview the clinical status of our programs.  For our da Vinci system, there are now over 9.7 million lifetime procedures performed with over 28,000 peer-reviewed clinical publications. Da Vinci X and XI now have over 70 representative clinical usages allowing broad use across multiple clinical specialties from urology to gynecology, thoracic surgery, general surgery, and trends oral surgery. Tens of thousands of surgeons routinely use our multi-port systems.  We continue to invest in our multi-port products, instruments, and services to further expand our capabilities and indications. Many surgeons continue to work with us to pursue new learning with several prospective studies ongoing. Our flexible bronchoscopy system, Ion, continues to build momentum clinically and commercially, with several presentations and manuscripts updating Ion clinical progress at the 2021 CHEST conference this weekend.  As described in yesterday's press release, early clinical trial results point to outstanding capability allowing for definitive diagnosis of harder to reach body regions. Our teams are hard at work building our manufacturing and supply capabilities to meet rising demand. Our single-port system SP has a clinical database of 28 peer-reviewed clinical publications.  There are currently several ongoing prospective studies for SP in Korea and the United States, including our IDE trial for colorectal indications. This quarter, we received FDA approval of our unit portal thoracic IDE. Broad SP adoption will be paced by additional regional and clinical clearances, which remain our focus for the SP program.  Our digital solutions provide data-driven insights to surgeons, operative services and hospital administration. For virtual reality training to efficiency insights, to custom comparative outcomes analysis, these tools are now routinely employed by our customers and our teams to improve programs. Our analytics program supported thousands of customers in the quarter.  Turning to machine learning, our teams are at the leading edge of  -based clinical science for surgery through our collaborations with leading academic centers, informing algorithmic and scientific discovery. Taken together, these programs allow our customers to quantify our collective impact on the quadrupling quarter .  Before turning the time over to Marshall, today we announced some changes in responsibilities of our senior executive team. These changes are the result of a structured process over the past few years, and they are driven by our need to support growth in our product lines, commercial reach, operations capabilities and business infrastructure, as we scale to meet the global opportunity to advance minimum invasive care.  Starting January 1st, 2022, our Executive Vice President and Chief Business Officer, Dave Rosa, will take on an important new role of Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy and Growth Officer, leading our efforts to identify and realize long-term business opportunities, continuing to build the value of our integrated product offerings, and ensuring our customers clearly understand the value of our ecosystem in creating successful, minimally-invasive programs.  Henry Charlton, currently General Manager of the U.S. and Europe, will succeed Dave as Chief Commercial Officer overseeing global commercial sales, regional marketing, and commercial enablement. Also, Marshall Mohr will take on an important new position as Executive Vice President Global Business Services, bidding Intuitive 's continued growth in information technology, and our enterprise process, data and systems, and global facilities.  Jamie Samath, we will succeed Marshall as Chief Financial Officer. They are each outstanding proven leader and will report to me. We expect them to spearhead our efforts to achieve our mission and continue to position Intuitive as first choice of our customers in a growing marketplace. I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will take you through our financial highlights in greater detail. Yeah. I think that the architecture as a whole, the shape sensor, the way it works, the design choices about making a soft catheter that's quite and can go deep into the  been really strong for us. And I think the data speaks for itself.  You can compare for yourself the data that focuses and that for Monarch, and we feel great about where we are. I think it is catalyzing. As we speak, I think that those results are helping us in the market. Our customers are giving us really good feedback. And we continue to invest in operations part of that program as well as the innovation side. We feel really good about. Just jumping in. I think there are two things that are going on. One is, what will pace us is hospital availability for surgery  it. It's not infection rate, it's going to be resourced consumption at the hospital and their ability to pivot their resources, both human capital and facilities, back towards surgery.  As you double-click on that, some of it is regional variance, but some of it is actually just hospital system variance. There are differences in how each hospital has managed it. So it's hard to generalize, I think, beware of averages. Yeah, that's right. It's the number of different procedures that's described in our labeling as to where this might be used in the body or in sub-specialties. So if you look in urology, there's a handful of different procedures that it can be used for and likewise gynecology general surgery. And as you just walk through, that's a set of procedures for which we've engaged the agency and put in our labeling. So they are quite broadly applied. You got 10. And we're not done. I think surgeons and we and regulatory agencies around the world continue to explore where else technologies like ours can go. On the -- you're referring to the customer side? Yeah. Jamie wanted to talk a little bit about it. Yeah. I think with several of the other systems that are on the market, and as you say, the most recent one, we see early engagement.

Well, with regard to what I meant by equilibrium, it was really that the initial stocking orders and the transition from older instruments to newer is largely taking place, but I'll let Jamie answer that more carefully than I just did. The second half of your question, just to finish it, you talked about are we done, is that it for these kinds of ideas and extended-use instruments and da Vinci, these were design and process investments that we made to pursue what we think of is the virtuous cycle. The idea that if we can improve quality and lower cost for our customers, that they can use our products in more and different procedures.  And we're not done doing that. It may not look exactly like what we've done in the past, there are other things that we think we can do with it. Allow them high-value systems at different price points, or value instruments at different price points, so that line of reasoning has not exhausted. Thank you for that question. Over the last few years, we've had an expansion of business and expansions of opportunity, both are happening. On the business side, we want to make sure that we serve our customers at very high-quality quickly in local regions where we can, and that we take advantage of a lot of the systems enterprise data that we have to help drive the business and help our customer.  And that's something that Marshall has been doing and I've asked them to double down on that to make sure that we can really take advantage of our global scale and serve our customers in our business really well at that scale. And it's an opportunity and it's a real work. The flip side is I have never been more positive about the long-term opportunity for companies like ours that can master the kinds of things that we have to do to help minimum invasive care and interventions.  And so there's real opportunity there. And I'd like us to get there quickly to have the agility and focus to be able to open new ideas and new architectures and new markets. And I can think of nobody more qualified to lead that effort than Dave Rosa, who is visited just about all parts of the Company.  He started off as an engineer and scientist and has done many things for us. So we're really trying to get the advantages of scale to help our global customer and also be agile in capitalizing on growth opportunities as we see them. Okay. On the first one, in terms of diagnostic yield, you had said 82% and I guess what I'd advise everybody is, there's a couple of numbers that are important and they stay linked together. And that is what the size of the lesion is? And then what's the positive diagnostic rate, the ability to definitively diagnose? That's what the interventional pulmonologists are looking at.  So the bigger the lesion, if it's 3-centimeter lesion, your diagnostic yield rate is going to go up your definitive because it's easier to hit. So you got to look at both numbers. It's not a single metric. So 82 for smaller lesions are leading, as far as I can tell for endobronchial approaches for that approach. Some folks can get to higher yield rates, but they are hitting bigger targets.  So you need to look at both, and that's what I encourage you to do. The second thing that I advise you is that there are other ways to examine or get a biopsy. There can be outside the body, CT-guided needle biopsies, and those outside the body CT-guided needle biopsies have high success rates at gathering the tissue, but they have a lower safety profile than the endobronchial approach.  So there's a third dimension, which is, did you get the tissue you needed to get a definitive diagnosis? How big was the lesion you were trying to target? Then what was the complication rate. And we think that Ion is really good at managing all 3 of those relative to competitive approaches, and we're seeing a nice uptick as a result. And is that a tipping point? We'll see. So far, so good. That's what we had expected.  This kind of performance, that's what we were targeting. We're pleased to see it being borne out over multiple sites and multiple customers, and we think that's going to be helpful. With regard to your second question, you were talking a little bit about are we seeing an unusual or more aggressive slowdown because of Delta, then perhaps others.  What I'd encourage you to think about there is where in the world everybody is exposed and where they are seeing their growth. So in our case, we have a certain regional profile where our procedures are being done. Other companies may have much bigger exposure to say markets or countries that have a lower impact having to do with Delta. Frankly, I think it's as simple as that, but time will tell on that as well.  So let's go ahead and conclude. That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions.  Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians, and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed a Quadruple Aim: better more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams, and ultimately a lower total cost of care.  We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It falls from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs, and their environment. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to speaking with you again in three months."

            "name": "Marshall Mohr",
            "content": "Good afternoon. I want to describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance, later in my prepared remarks. Reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP result is posted on our website.  The information in our earnings release and within our prepared remarks reflects the 3-for-1 stock split completed earlier in October. Overall, third quarter procedures grew 20% year-over-year and reflect the impact of Delta variant resurgence. COVID also impacted third quarter 2020 procedures, making year-over-year comparisons complicated.  In the U.S., procedures grew 16%, reflecting the impact that COVID resurgence had on hospital resources regionally, the impact of the resurgence was most pronounced in August and early September, and regionally in the south and southeast. Later in the quarter, as COVID cases began to slow, procedures began to recover.  However, it is difficult to estimate the extent to which this resurgence or future resurgences will impact da Vinci procedures. Year-over-year, OUS procedures grew 30% with the impact of COVID varying regionally. In Europe, COVID had a greater impact in Italy and France, and less in UK and Germany.  While there continued to be COVID hotspots within some of our Asia-Pacific markets, overall procedures in the region performed well. China growth in the third quarter continued to be far higher than other regions, primarily reflecting system installation growth over the past year. Relative to the beginning of the pandemic, many hospitals are able to better manage increased COVID patient hospitalization.  However, staffing shortages and hospital supply chain issues are challenging some hospital capacities and could impact deferrable procedures, including da Vinci procedures, going forward. Jamie will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call. Key business metrics for the third quarter were as follows.  Third quarter 2021 procedures increased approximately 20% compared with third quarter 2020 and decreased approximately 3% compared to the last quarter. Compound annual growth between the second quarters of 2019 and 2021 was 13.5%. Third quarter system placements of 336 systems increased 72% compared with 195 systems for the third quarter of 2020, and increased 2% compared with 328 systems last quarter.  We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems over the last year by 11% to approximately 6,525 systems. This growth rate compares with 8% last year and 10% last quarter. Utilization of clinical systems in the field measured by procedures per system, increased approximately 9% compared with last year, and decreased 6% compared with last quarter.  Compounded annual utilization growth rate between the third quarters of 2019 and 2021 was 3%. Moving on to capital placements, system placements in the quarter reflected a continued trend of IDN multi-system purchases and were driven by procedure growth and hospitals upgrading in order to access our standardized and fourth-generation capabilities.  Looking forward, we see the following capital revenue dynamics. Procedure growth drives capital purchases in many of our markets, to the extent that COVID impacts procedures, it will also impact capital purchases. The trading cycle has been a tailwind to system placements. However, as the installed base of older generation product declines, the number of trade-ins will decline over time.  Leasing and alternative financing arrangements enabled customer access to our systems. While the percentage of systems placed under operating leases fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we believe leasing will increase as a percentage of sales over time, which will result in the deferral of otherwise current revenue into future periods.  Macroeconomic conditions created by COVID could regionally impact hospital capital spending, and as competition progresses in various markets, we will likely experience longer selling cycles and price pressure. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. Third quarter revenue was 1.4 billion, representing a 30% increase from last year and a 4% decrease from last quarter.  The compound annual revenue growth rate between the third quarters of 2019 and 2021 was 12%. The year-over-year revenue increase reflected growth in both procedures and system placements. The decrease relative to the second quarter of 2021 reflects lower instrument and accessory revenue associated with lower procedures and increased leasing as a percentage of placements.  Leasing represent 41% of current quarter placements compared with 35% last year and 33% last quarter. Leasing as a percentage of total sales has and will continue to fluctuate with customer and geographic mix. However, we anticipate more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than reflected in historical run rates.  40% of systems placed in the third quarter involve trade-ins, which is consistent with the 40% last year and higher than the 38% last quarter. As customers continue to upgrade to fourth-generation capabilities, the population of installed SI is decreasing, particularly in U.S. where 97 trade-ins were completed in the third quarter, leaving an installed base of SIs of approximately 425 systems.  As a result, we expect lower trade-out transactions over time. Trading activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict. Third quarter average selling prices increased to 1.57 million from 1.55 million for both the third quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2021. Average selling prices will fluctuate with geographic and product mix.  Consistent with historical patterns, we expect a higher mix and systems sold to distributors in the fourth quarter, which carry lower prices. We recognized 25 million of lease buyout revenue in the third quarter compared to 17 million last year and 26 million last quarter. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter, and will likely continue to do so.  Instrument accessory revenue per procedure of $1,900 decreased slightly compared with $1,910 per procedure for the third quarter of last year, and decreased compared with $1,940 per procedure in the second quarter. The year-over-year change reflects increased usage of extended-use instruments, mostly offset by increased usage of our advanced instruments.  The decrease from the previous quarter reflects customers continuing to adjust their instrument buying patterns to reflect the additional uses per instrument included in extended-use instruments. Ten of the systems placed in the third quarter were SP Systems. Our installed base of SP Systems is now 89, 10 in Korea, and 79 in the U.S.  We continue our measured roll out of SP as we work on gathering clinical data to gain additional procedure clearances in the U.S. We placed 28 Ion systems in the quarter, bringing the installed base to 98 systems. There were approximately 2,000 Ion procedures completed in the third quarter. Ion system placements and procedures are excluded from our overall da Vinci system and procedure counts.  Our rollout of  Progressing well. Outside the U.S. we placed 109 systems in the third quarter compared with 79 in the third quarter of 2020 and 115 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 47 into Europe, 20 into Japan, and 17 into China, compared with 39 into Europe, 15 into Japan, and 12 into China in the third quarter of 2020.  We also placed 9 systems in Brazil in the third quarter and now have placed 23 systems in Brazil over the past four quarters. Moving on to gross margin, and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2021 was 71.3% compared with 70.2% for the third quarter of 2020 and 71.7% last quarter.  The third quarter of 2020 included 23 million of service credits issued in conjunction with our customer relief program, higher period costs associated with lower production levels, and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges. The decline in gross margin relative to the second quarter primarily reflects product mix.  Product and customer mix fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, which can cause fluctuations in gross margins. COVID has impacted global supplier of semiconductors and other materials used in our products. While to date we've been able to secure supply necessary to ensure fulfillment of customer demand, our teams are expending significant time and effort to bridge future supply with demand.  To date we've experienced immaterial component increase, cost increases, and freight expedition fees. However, global shortages could result in future supply disruptions as well as delayed development and regulatory activities. We also expect supply issues to result in higher production costs.  Pro forma operating expenses increased 21% compared with the third quarter of 2020, and increased 2% compared with last quarter. The increase, compared to the prior year, reflects costs associated with higher headcount, increased variable compensation, and increased spending in areas impacted by COVID.  Third quarter spending was below our expectations due to delays in headcount hiring and lower spending on activities restricted by COVID, including clinical development, marketing events, and travel costs. In addition, COVID delayed some R&D work resulting in under spend on prototypes. We expect spending on activities restricted by COVID to increase as the impacts of the pandemic decline.  We also expect spending to increase as a percentage of revenue as investments in headcount infrastructure and other support area s catch-up to the growth of the business. Finally, we expect to continue to invest in expanding and accelerating our ecosystem of products and capabilities. Jamie will provide spend guidance later in this call. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 24%.  We recorded expense of 11 million associated with periods prior to 2020 related to guidance recently provided by the IRS associated with stock-based compensation. We expect our pro forma tax rate for the fourth quarter to be approximately 21.5%. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities, and with the impact of one-time items.  Our third quarter pro forma net income was 435 million, or $1.19 per share, compared with 334 million, or $0.92 per share, for the third quarter of 2020, and 477 million or $1.31 per share for the last quarter. Third quarter 2021 and 2020 included pre -tax gains of approximately 8 million and 62 million associated with investments in companies that resulted from development agreements entered into in prior years. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was 381 million or $1.04 per share for the third quarter of 2021 compared with GAAP net income of 314 million or $0.87 per share for the third quarter of 2020 and GAAP net income of 517 million or $1.42 per share for the last quarter.  We ended the quarter with cash and investments of 8.2 billion compared with 7.7 billion last quarter. The increase in cash in the third quarter primarily reflected cash from operations and stock exercises. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jamie. Yes. I think -- Amit, it's Marshall. The environment, as it relates to supply chain, has deteriorated and got more difficult over time. And as we said, we've dedicated substantial resources to dealing with those shortages. And it has not, to-date, created an issue with us supplying customer demand. But there is a risk, and it's a real risk until we call it out to make sure that everybody is aware of that.  From the perspective of costs, we talked some cost increased material costs last quarter. They were not significant. And we also incurred some expediting fees associated with freight. Again, not material. But going forward, we do expect increased costs, and that will probably hit the margin in Q4 or Q1. It's hard to predict exactly how much until -- I think that summarizes it for you. It's difficult environment right now. I don't think I can say it's getting better. I actually think that it's difficult situation and will continue for some time. If you think about the one that's been talked about the most, the semiconductors, you've seen it in the auto industry, it's an issue in computers. And if you had to order any home goods that contained chips, you would know that there's a problem there.  That will take a long time to remedy. It takes a long time to build fabs, it takes a long time to produce product, and so I think that will go well into next year the predictions that we're hearing. I think Gary told you our team has done a marvelous job so far. So I think there are issues on a regular basis, and the issues so far that our team has been able to resolve those.  I don't have any statistics to provide you on how often, or what it means. I would just say that some -- anecdotally, some lead times have extended beyond 6 months. That's not all our products, and it's not an average you should apply to everything, but in some cases it's pretty long. And so I think it's a problem we highlight as just to make sure that you're aware of the risk. We've seen some cost increases. Again, they haven't been that significant. And frankly, our teams have done a marvelous job of sort with efficiency and effectiveness to offset those increased costs. But we're hearing from suppliers that they're going to raise their prices.  And so we're saying that hey, we expect that costs will go up more. Not sure. I want to say that the inflation where it is has hit us and am here to stay, but we are seeing some supplier's raise costs."

This is a restricted line. Any unauthorized party in this meeting or any unauthorized use of the information communicated in this meeting is subject to prosecution to the fullest extent of the law. Any unauthorized person including the media that is on the line at this time, please disconnect. Please note today's call is being recorded.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon and good morning to folks on the West Coast. I'm Larry Biegelsen, the medical device analyst at Wells Fargo, and it's my pleasure to host this session with the management team from Intuitive Surgical. With us, we have Marshall Mohr, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Philip Kim, Head of Investor Relations. In terms of format, it's going to be a fireside chat. If anyone has a question they want me to ask on their behalf, please email it to me. I think we're going to try to get in one or two polling questions. And I think before we jump in, Phil, you wanted to make some opening remarks.\nPhilip Kim: Sure. Before we get started, I'd like to mention that comments made this morning maybe deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our SEC filings. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.\nLarry Biegelsen: All right. So, gentlemen, thanks so much for being here. Really appreciate you guys participating in our conference again this year.\nMarshall Mohr: Thanks for having us, Larry. We're happy to be here.\nQ - Larry Biegelsen: Marshall, I hope next year, we don't have to ask you about COVID. But we feel like we're starting almost all of these conversations with just kind of, any qualitative color you can provide on the Delta variant and what was embedded in your guidance? I went back and looked at kind of your transcript, the low end assumes some impact of resurgence in the U.S. but I'm just curious if you can qualitatively talk about any trends you're seeing.\nMarshall Mohr: Yes. Thanks Larry. Let me say good afternoon to everybody, and thanks for having us at the conference. Yes, we saw in Q2, it was actually a rebound that was quicker than we had expected. And if you look at the compound annual growth rate relative to 2019, so pre-COVID, it was 16.5%. Growth rates back in 2018 and 2019 were in the 18% to 19% range. And so, a little lower then. But if you were to have drawn a line looking at adoption curves and so forth, 16.5% was nearly a recovery. So it was quite nice. Having said that, going into this quarter, obviously we've seen a resurgence of the Delta variant that has had a significant impact on household resources over the past month or so, regionally. You see most severe in places like Texas and Florida and some of the South where vaccination rates are lower. And in those areas, you're actually seeing some level that hospital resources are strained and you're seeing some level of deferral of procedures again. And there is a direct correlation between hospital resource availability and how strained it is and deferrable procedures and da Vinci procedures for that matter, and there are a number of da Vinci procedures that are deferrable in the short-term. Now they\u2019re chronic conditions, so, they -- eventually the patients have to be treated, but they can be things like hernias and cholecystectomies and bariatric procedures can be deferred in the short-term. So, given the resurgence, you should expect that it is having some impact on our procedures. How deep, how much of an impact is really difficult to predict. You have access to the various models out there that the various professionals put out there about what will happen with resurgence. So, you have access to that data, and we're not going to try to predict what the extent or the length of this is going to be. But -- and I would also comment that it varies by region within the U.S. You see more severe conditions in the South, and in geographies I mentioned, and much less severe in some of the other geographies like the Northeast and then it varies around the world as well. You see less of an impact in China right now. Little bit of impact in Japan, although the hospitals seem be getting through things pretty well. You see some impacts in places like the UK and India. So anyway, I don't have something specific to give you. But I can just tell you, just in general what we're saying.\nLarry Biegelsen: And just a couple follow-ups. One is, maybe, if you can't disclose this, I understand. But is it worse than you kind of expected when you gave your guidance? I mean, it seems like most people didn't expect it to be this bad. Is that a fair conclusion?\nMarshall Mohr: Yes, it is. Yes. Going back to our guidance, you said it, so I didn't repeat it, but I'll repeat it now. And that is, our guidance didn't assume any significant disruption or additional costs associated with supply constraints, which, frankly, supply constraints has dealt with potential problems. And then the second one is, I didn't assume any significant or widespread impact of COVID in the United States. And I think we are indeed seeing that.\nLarry Biegelsen: And it's interesting, because you talked about the 16.5% CAGR in the first half, to your CAGR I think. So big picture, we know whole COVID\u2019s transient, you see these procedures whenever COVID does wane, these procedures coming back? And you can get back to kind of the underlying trajectory, Marshall, just to kind of bring home the point that this is transient, and the underlying trends for your business are still strong.\nMarshall Mohr: I think that's right. I think we still believe that the opportunity for computer aided interventions is significant that robotics that you'll see -- long-term, we've talked about a line of sight market of 6 million procedures, there's many more procedures than that, that could be done robotically. And we believe that opportunity has not changed. All COVID has done is disrupt sort of the pace at which you get there.\nLarry Biegelsen: And you've talked about on the call -- you just mentioned it a minute ago, and you talked about the call, inflation and potential supply constraints. And you've called that out as a risk before. But I believe until through the second quarter call that it was more of a risk as opposed to something that was materializing. Can you talk about kind of what you're seeing, I guess, on both fronts, one is inflation, one is supply constraints, and how those might be impacting you?\nMarshall Mohr: Yes. Frankly, it's hand to hand combat on when it comes to supply and I don't think we're unusual. I think you\u2019re reading it in the papers, the car industry, the computer industry and if any of you are trying to order products that contain semiconductors, you see that the lead times have been extended significantly for all products. So when I say hand to hand combat, our teams are working hard with our suppliers to make sure that we have the supplies necessary to be able to supply our customers' needs. And so far they were successful, certainly through Q2 and if I had something significant to say today, I would. But having said that, the risk is still there and the risk is so significant that at some point in time there is the potential that a supplier is unable to supply what we need. We also through Q2 had not seen, you call out, inflation. Either inflation caused by demand supply, normal pressures or inflation in terms of suppliers just trying to charge us more because the opportunity is there. So, it hasn't had much of an impact at all. I would say that, as we go forward, though, one area that will likely see increased costs is freight. And the reason is that you're having to expedite parts either into the factory or from the factory out to customer. And so we'll see some of that, price is not a huge part of our costs but nonetheless we'll see increased freight.\nLarry Biegelsen: When we think about kind of next year Marshall, what are some of the puts and takes to think about on the top line and bottom line?\nMarshall Mohr: Yes, I think at a top line level, again, it's hard to predict at this point in time what COVID will do to procedures. We'll give our views on procedures at the end of January for 2022. As far as system placements, we've actually -- through Q2 we saw a nice pickup in systems, on that surprised us actually, because we had expected the hospital finances and resources would be constrained. And yet they came out of the COVID at least to that point in better shape. We could see going forward the COVID has an impact on that going forward. The gives and takes on the top line also will have to do with the replacement cycle. We've had a tailwind for systems in terms of replacements. You've seen nice trade-outs of third generation product to fourth generation and but over time that third generation population out in the field, the installed base actually declines and therefore you'll see less trade-ins take place. Top line, also leasing impacts the top line in the short-term. In the long-term, it's actually very beneficial. We would expect leasing to fluctuate quarter to quarter but to increase as a percentage of total sales over time. So that'll have a negative impact. On the bottom line, know that we think that the opportunity in front of us like we said earlier is the same and therefore we're going to continue to invest in both innovation, digital innovation, expanded instrumentation and accessory capabilities. And so you'll see us invest in Ion and SP. And so from a cost perspective, we will continue to spend. So all I would say is that those of you that are thinking that the profitability you saw last quarter will either sustain itself or will increase, I wouldn't think that. Last quarter, what you did see was that the recovery of revenue took place faster than the recovery of costs. And what I mean by that is, costs that were eliminated or minimized by virtue of COVID, travel, marketing events and so forth were still being constrained in Q2, but we saw a rebound in the overall business. And so, that profitability in Q2 was I think a bit of an anomaly. And you'll see again us continue to spend in this environment.\nLarry Biegelsen: Marshall, a lot to unpack there.\nMarshall Mohr: Yes. Sorry. Didn't mean to go on\u2026\nLarry Biegelsen: So, on procedures we've talked about earlier. I think we covered that pretty well. On placements and COVID, actually a lot of companies have talked about the capital environment remaining healthy, even recently. I've heard companies talk about a favorable capital environment. Can we -- is that -- I mean can you give us any color on whether you've seen changes in the capital environment or not?\nMarshall Mohr: Yes. We won't talk about the inter-quarter play here. We can say that at the end of Q2, things had gone, like I said, better than our expectations. And it was reflective of, frankly, I think that a lot of what happened in Q2 was expansion of existing programs at large IDNs, and that's an endorsement of robotics being beneficial in both in terms of treatment of patients meeting their quadruple aim, reducing their overall cost of care. And so -- and then they were preparing, I think, for -- at that point, everybody thought we had COVID licked in and things were going to continue to improve. And so I think they were also preparing for a post-COVID environment. They're going forward. Capital is driven by -- so I won't comment on expectations. We don't provide guidance on capital because of short-term swings that can occur. But the -- I would just tell you the factors that could impact it. Number one is, know that procedures drive capital in our mature markets. And so we talk about utilization statistic. That is an indication of whether capital is getting ahead or behind procedures. And I think that it was in tune. They were in tune with each other through Q2. But if procedures are significantly curtailed as a result of COVID, then it could have an impact on capital. I mentioned the trade-in cycle. The trade-in cycle will decline as the population of third-generation product out in the field declines. I mentioned leasing. And I think we don't know what will happen from a COVID perspective to hospital financing going forward. And then finally, I think as competition comes out, we do expect to see longer sales cycles and potential price degradation.\nLarry Biegelsen: Marshall, when does the trade-in -- or when does that become a headwind for you guys? Is there a way to be more precise? And how many are still in the field? And when does that become -- go from a tailwind to a headwind?\nMarshall Mohr: I'll let Philip provide you the statistics.\nPhilip Kim: Yes, Larry, over time, you should expect the percentage of trade-ins to come down as the installed base of Gen 3 declines and upgrades. Roughly 20% of the worldwide installed base is Gen 3 or older. And so has a lot of large numbers. As we work through that, that should be less of a tailwind. More broadly, with leasing, we've always said in the past that we expect that to continue to be a larger percentage of our placements as time increases and we're just trying to provide our customers as much flexibility as possible.\nMarshall Mohr: And there's about 600 systems in the U.S. that are third generation or older, unlike a number outside the U.S. Outside the U.S., there are places like China where those systems haven't been installed for very long. Xi was not approved, regulatory was until about 1.5 years, 2 years ago in China. So we expect that element, that set of systems to return more slowly over a longer period of time. In the U.S., what we saw last quarter was that, that decreased the trade-in cycle. It was roughly 20% of the systems outstanding have been traded-in in that quarter. So if that pace were to continue, then you'll see a substantial decline certainly through the end of next year.\nLarry Biegelsen: Got it. Marshall, you talked about leverage in the P&L a minute ago. Historically, you guys have delivered 1x to 1.5x leverage. Is that ratio come to the lower end next year, should we be thinking based on your commentary? Or I don't know if you can comment on that at all. But the Street right now is kind of has kind of the low end of that for 2022.\nMarshall Mohr: Yes. We'll give you a specific guidance for '22 when we get to the end of January. I think what we're foreshadowing is that this is a period of investment for us. We think we still have to invest in both Ion and SP, which are in their earlier stages. In the case of Ion, we have regulatory approvals. We'll seek in outside the United States, we have also -- it's in other potential indications and uses for it. In the case of SP, we'll be investing heavily in clinical trials to be able to obtain additional indications and to attain clearances in other markets outside of the U.S. So I think those are 2 big investment areas. Again, data is probably the greatest area of increased investment and will continue to be. And then you'll see a return in certain expenses that just as COVID wanes, you'll see increased travel, marketing events and other activities that have before now been caused by COVID. So as far as leverage goes, like I said earlier, you should not expect profitability at the level that you saw in Q2 going forward, Q2 was an anomaly, and we will continue to invest.\nLarry Biegelsen: Got it. You touched upon competition, Marshall, a couple of times. Obviously, we -- Medtronic potentially coming to the market in Europe in the second half of this calendar year. When -- if the selling cycle is elongated, what would you expect -- when would you expect that to happen, if it were to occur?\nMarshall Mohr: It's happened to a certain extent. As you see some of the smaller competitors out there, the hospitals and in parts of where you have government systems like NHS in UK or some of the public hospitals in France and Germany, you -- they're bound to go through tender activities. When it was just us, they actually could -- they had to issue a tender, but they could circumvent the time frame and get it done more quickly. Now they have to go through the full length of time if one of those competitors jumps in the game. Going forward, we expect that more and more of those tenders will see multiple competitors, including companies like Medtronic. And so as that happens, then timelines elongate. What do they elongate to? Think of more like 6-month timeframes OUS versus 3-month timeframes. And in the U.S., you'll probably get some level of contemplation about whether competitive products versus ours make sense. And even though they don't have to go through these formal tender approaches, it could still elongate cycles here, too.\nLarry Biegelsen: And do you think this starts once they get CE Mark? Or people will -- might start hesitating or waiting before it\u2019s done?\nMarshall Mohr: That's a great question. I think you're already seeing competition trying to get customers to slow down their purchases or wait until their product is ready. That's happened for the last 4 years, frankly, when companies thought they might be coming to market more quickly than they actually have been able to. So I don't know. My expectation is they'll continue to try to get customers to slow down and install, but it hasn't had a significant impact to date.\nLarry Biegelsen: That's helpful. You\u2019ve talked about kind of the ecosystem really being the key basis for competition. What -- can you elaborate on how you think about the ecosystem you've built relative to the competition?\nMarshall Mohr: Sure. I'll let Philip take the first step at it, and then I'll jump in.\nPhilip Kim: Sure, Larry. So you've heard us frame the ecosystem in the past as really driving outcomes, and we are focused on clinical -- driving clinical outcome. So firstly, we make sure that we understand the customer base deeply. We make sure that we have the right technologies that help them. We have the right instruments and accessories, systems and imaging systems and so on. And we make sure that the operating processes work well, that we have training optimization, service and support, marketing, sales coordination. We make all these investments, they take time. You've seen us put up the slide before at various conferences. It's an entire ecosystem, and it takes time to build these ecosystems. It's not just a robot, it's not just having systems and the instruments, you need to also engage with regulatory agencies to get clearances, decision by indication, get the sanction, you need to know how to train and build the training pathways and you need to build clinical evidence. You need to go country by country. The build has to be engaged with surgical societies, get economic validation. It's all hard work country-by-country, procedure-by-procedure, as you know, Larry. And so we're continuing to invest in that ecosystem, and we're a mission-driven company. We're focused on the better patient outcomes, better surgeon experience, better treatment experience and lowering cost fee. So at the end of the day, we're trying to add value to the ecosystem.\nLarry Biegelsen: All right. That's helpful. Let's try 1 polling question, but go to the second one, if you can. And if you can't, just we'll move on. The second one. Okay. Good. All right. So the second question is basically, Medtronic plans to launch its Hugo surgical robot in Europe in the second half of calendar 2021. What impact do you expect you guys to have on Intuitive Surgical? A, expect Hugo to reduce Intuitive placements at least in the near term? B, I expect Hugo to be a catalyst for robotic surgery and ISRG, a so-called rising tide? And C, not sure? There's a bit of a lag. It takes time for them to fill it out. So Marshall, I might ask you another question before we get those results. And I wanted to shift the conversation more to kind of the opportunities you guys have, new procedures, new platforms. And maybe just starting with procedures, Marshall. So when we look at the next years, which procedures do you expect to drive the most growth for Intuitive?\nMarshall Mohr: Yes. I think there are procedures that are already in flight, we're really talking about growth over the next couple of years will be driven by general surgery in the U.S. And in that category, you're really talking about continuation of adoption for bariatrics, cholecystectomy and hernia has been probably the big 3. But there are other areas of general surgeries that also are adopting for that, procedures that are smaller categories, but those will be the primary drivers. And then outside the United States, we're at the top of the urology curve in a number of countries, particularly in Europe. And so what we're seeing as drivers going forward will be thoracic procedures. And by the way, thoracic procedures growing quite nicely in places like China, and then -- and also the general surgery procedures. And in those cases, it probably starts with cancer procedures. And over time then into benign procedures. Reimbursements for benign procedures outside the U.S. are strained, are low. And so that's why we think cancer procedures adapt before the benign.\nLarry Biegelsen: Are there new procedures that we should be following?\nMarshall Mohr: Well, I think we have 3 platforms now, right? And so if we're talking about multiport procedures, I think that there's lots of room in what we have, and I don't know that other than thoracic procedures that I would throw in anything else, look to Philip to tell me if I'm right or wrong. And -- but when it comes to the other 2 platforms, meaning Ion, yes, we expect to see nice growth in interventions to do lung biopsies, and we're seeing nice growth there. And in the case of SP where you got to have clinical data to be able to get clearances in the United States as well as outside the United States, that will take time. And we're focused on procedures where we think we can contribute the most value, which in a lot of cases, are procedures that are in part done by multiport systems. Longer term, we've talked about the potential of maybe some breast procedures or other things that we'll chase. But right now it's all about colorectal -- getting a colorectal indication as well as expanding in urology and thoracic.\nLarry Biegelsen: That's helpful. Did you want to add something, Phil? Or do you want to go to the poll results?\nPhilip Kim: Let's go to the poll results. I think Marshall covered it perfect.\nLarry Biegelsen: Okay. What do we have? Marshall, catalysts for robotics surgery, 42%, 33% near-term headwind. And not sure -- sorry, 25%. Any reaction, Marshall?\nMarshall Mohr: I think the first 2 are probably -- I wouldn't disagree with either of them. In other words, I do think that the more you see entrants of competitors and competitors talking about robotics and the benefits of robotics that, that really does expand the market or at least make the parts of the market more accessible. And so I think it does. It is a rising tide with everybody jumping in. We've seen it already. When back in 2000 -- it's probably, what, 2018, '19 when these companies started talking about robotics as something that should be used for surgeries that you saw attitude start to change. And then as far as Hugo reducing ISRG placements, there is no question that there will be surgeons that want to try Hugo. There will be institutions that want to try Hugo. And we'll see how that trialing goes. But initially, they'll do their trial. And does that mean that they delay a placement of ISRG? It's possible. Longer term, we'll see how it turns out and what they choose. I\u2019d find it hard to believe that they would -- that you have hospitals where you have both products and expect surgeons to jump from 1 to the other. So it's probably either or -- but we're not sure. And so that last category is right, too. We're not sure. We have to see what exactly it is they deliver, to Philip's point earlier, how broadly they address the ecosystem of things necessary to be successful and we'll see.\nLarry Biegelsen: Okay. Marshall, a couple of minutes left here, but those are very helpful comments. I wanted to sneak a few more in. So Ion, you touched upon it. You're having a lot of success from the placements we've seen early on. How should we think about the pace of adoption of Ion?\nMarshall Mohr: Yes. You'll still see us in a measured sort of rollout right now. We're -- the clinical data from the PRECISE trial will be made available at the end of next year. I think what that does is that really opens up the next level of -- in the adoption curve. So you see early adopters doing it now. And then you'll see once that data is out and assuming it's as positive as we believe it will be, then maybe you see a little opening of the majority and then you'll see a broader pace of adoption. But for now, it will be a gradual increase over time. We\u2019re really pleased with how things went last quarter, particularly, almost 1,500 procedures and 20 systems, that was quite a nice performance in our view. So anyway, that's how I kind of think of it. And we are going to start looking at how to obtain clearances outside the U.S. And we'll tell you as we go through time, whether we're filing or where our expectations are for growth.\nLarry Biegelsen: In China, it probably is a big opportunity for Ion.\nMarshall Mohr: It is. Philip?\nPhilip Kim: Yes. So with respect to China, we have that partnership with Fosun. But right now, the pathway for China is quite long and complex. And so we'll end up sharing timelines, when we have something that's worth sharing.\nLarry Biegelsen: Okay. And Marshall, when do you think we'll know the impact of the Extended Use Instrument Program? I mean, obviously, it's hard -- probably a little bit difficult because of COVID. But when do you think you'll be able to kind of tell us about that -- the impact?\nMarshall Mohr: Yes. Thank you. You're right. It is complicated by COVID, and the ability to measure what is COVID versus what is extended use instruments and so forth is really difficult to parse apart right now. What we're hearing from our customers, though, is really positive feedback on the fact that they can do some of these procedures at a lower cost and competitively with other minimally invasive approaches. So we do believe that there will be some elasticity. It's hard for me to answer your question because I really don't know how long COVID is going to have an impact on us. But I think it's probably not for another year that we aren't able to measure it.\nLarry Biegelsen: Okay. We're out of time. Marshall, I'm going to give you the last word. Anything -- we covered a lot of ground. But we can a minute or so here if you had any closing remarks or anything, you really wanted to cover that we didn't get to.\nMarshall Mohr: No. I think we covered the things -- the key things that I think are important for investors to understand. One is that this is a -- the opportunity is the same. COVID disrupts the pace at which you get there but the opportunity is the same. And as a result, that we will continue to invest in the infrastructure and in the innovation in order to capture as much of that opportunity as possible. And in the meantime, we'll see at the revenue level, what happens.\nLarry Biegelsen: Okay. Perfect. Really appreciate you guys being here. I hope the rest of the day goes well for you, and we'll be in touch. Thanks, again.\nMarshall Mohr: Thank you, Larry.\nPhilip Kim: Thanks, Larry.\nMarshall Mohr: Bye, everybody.",

Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our SEC filings. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Yes, Larry, over time, you should expect the percentage of trade-ins to come down as the installed base of Gen 3 declines and upgrades. Roughly 20% of the worldwide installed base is Gen 3 or older. And so has a lot of large numbers. As we work through that, that should be less of a tailwind. More broadly, with leasing, we've always said in the past that we expect that to continue to be a larger percentage of our placements as time increases and we're just trying to provide our customers as much flexibility as possible.

            "name": "Marshall Mohr",
            "content": "Thanks for having us, Larry. We're happy to be here. Yes. Thanks Larry. Let me say good afternoon to everybody, and thanks for having us at the conference. Yes, we saw in Q2, it was actually a rebound that was quicker than we had expected. And if you look at the compound annual growth rate relative to 2019, so pre-COVID, it was 16.5%. Growth rates back in 2018 and 2019 were in the 18% to 19% range. And so, a little lower then. But if you were to have drawn a line looking at adoption curves and so forth, 16.5% was nearly a recovery. So it was quite nice. Having said that, going into this quarter, obviously we've seen a resurgence of the Delta variant that has had a significant impact on household resources over the past month or so, regionally. You see most severe in places like Texas and Florida and some of the South where vaccination rates are lower. And in those areas, you're actually seeing some level that hospital resources are strained and you're seeing some level of deferral of procedures again. And there is a direct correlation between hospital resource availability and how strained it is and deferrable procedures and da Vinci procedures for that matter, and there are a number of da Vinci procedures that are deferrable in the short-term. Now they're chronic conditions, so, they -- eventually the patients have to be treated, but they can be things like hernias and cholecystectomies and bariatric procedures can be deferred in the short-term. So, given the resurgence, you should expect that it is having some impact on our procedures. How deep, how much of an impact is really difficult to predict. You have access to the various models out there that the various professionals put out there about what will happen with resurgence. So, you have access to that data, and we're not going to try to predict what the extent or the length of this is going to be. But -- and I would also comment that it varies by region within the U.S. You see more severe conditions in the South, and in geographies I mentioned, and much less severe in some of the other geographies like the Northeast and then it varies around the world as well. You see less of an impact in China right now. Little bit of impact in Japan, although the hospitals seem be getting through things pretty well. You see some impacts in places like the UK and India. So anyway, I don't have something specific to give you. But I can just tell you, just in general what we're saying. Yes, it is. Yes. Going back to our guidance, you said it, so I didn't repeat it, but I'll repeat it now. And that is, our guidance didn't assume any significant disruption or additional costs associated with supply constraints, which, frankly, supply constraints has dealt with potential problems. And then the second one is, I didn't assume any significant or widespread impact of COVID in the United States. And I think we are indeed seeing that. I think that's right. I think we still believe that the opportunity for computer aided interventions is significant that robotics that you'll see -- long-term, we've talked about a line of sight market of 6 million procedures, there's many more procedures than that, that could be done robotically. And we believe that opportunity has not changed. All COVID has done is disrupt sort of the pace at which you get there. Yes. Frankly, it's hand to hand combat on when it comes to supply and I don't think we're unusual. I think you're reading it in the papers, the car industry, the computer industry and if any of you are trying to order products that contain semiconductors, you see that the lead times have been extended significantly for all products. So when I say hand to hand combat, our teams are working hard with our suppliers to make sure that we have the supplies necessary to be able to supply our customers' needs. And so far they were successful, certainly through Q2 and if I had something significant to say today, I would. But having said that, the risk is still there and the risk is so significant that at some point in time there is the potential that a supplier is unable to supply what we need. We also through Q2 had not seen, you call out, inflation. Either inflation caused by demand supply, normal pressures or inflation in terms of suppliers just trying to charge us more because the opportunity is there. So, it hasn't had much of an impact at all. I would say that, as we go forward, though, one area that will likely see increased costs is freight. And the reason is that you're having to expedite parts either into the factory or from the factory out to customer. And so we'll see some of that, price is not a huge part of our costs but nonetheless we'll see increased freight. Yes, I think at a top line level, again, it's hard to predict at this point in time what COVID will do to procedures. We'll give our views on procedures at the end of January for 2022. As far as system placements, we've actually -- through Q2 we saw a nice pickup in systems, on that surprised us actually, because we had expected the hospital finances and resources would be constrained. And yet they came out of the COVID at least to that point in better shape. We could see going forward the COVID has an impact on that going forward. The gives and takes on the top line also will have to do with the replacement cycle. We've had a tailwind for systems in terms of replacements. You've seen nice trade-outs of third generation product to fourth generation and but over time that third generation population out in the field, the installed base actually declines and therefore you'll see less trade-ins take place. Top line, also leasing impacts the top line in the short-term. In the long-term, it's actually very beneficial. We would expect leasing to fluctuate quarter to quarter but to increase as a percentage of total sales over time. So that'll have a negative impact. On the bottom line, know that we think that the opportunity in front of us like we said earlier is the same and therefore we're going to continue to invest in both innovation, digital innovation, expanded instrumentation and accessory capabilities. And so you'll see us invest in Ion and SP. And so from a cost perspective, we will continue to spend. So all I would say is that those of you that are thinking that the profitability you saw last quarter will either sustain itself or will increase, I wouldn't think that. Last quarter, what you did see was that the recovery of revenue took place faster than the recovery of costs. And what I mean by that is, costs that were eliminated or minimized by virtue of COVID, travel, marketing events and so forth were still being constrained in Q2, but we saw a rebound in the overall business. And so, that profitability in Q2 was I think a bit of an anomaly. And you'll see again us continue to spend in this environment. Yes. Sorry. Didn't mean to go on... Yes. We won't talk about the inter-quarter play here. We can say that at the end of Q2, things had gone, like I said, better than our expectations. And it was reflective of, frankly, I think that a lot of what happened in Q2 was expansion of existing programs at large IDNs, and that's an endorsement of robotics being beneficial in both in terms of treatment of patients meeting their quadruple aim, reducing their overall cost of care. And so -- and then they were preparing, I think, for -- at that point, everybody thought we had COVID licked in and things were going to continue to improve. And so I think they were also preparing for a post-COVID environment. They're going forward. Capital is driven by -- so I won't comment on expectations. We don't provide guidance on capital because of short-term swings that can occur. But the -- I would just tell you the factors that could impact it. Number one is, know that procedures drive capital in our mature markets. And so we talk about utilization statistic. That is an indication of whether capital is getting ahead or behind procedures. And I think that it was in tune. They were in tune with each other through Q2. But if procedures are significantly curtailed as a result of COVID, then it could have an impact on capital. I mentioned the trade-in cycle. The trade-in cycle will decline as the population of third-generation product out in the field declines. I mentioned leasing. And I think we don't know what will happen from a COVID perspective to hospital financing going forward. And then finally, I think as competition comes out, we do expect to see longer sales cycles and potential price degradation. I'll let Philip provide you the statistics. And there's about 600 systems in the U.S. that are third generation or older, unlike a number outside the U.S. Outside the U.S., there are places like China where those systems haven't been installed for very long. Xi was not approved, regulatory was until about 1.5 years, 2 years ago in China. So we expect that element, that set of systems to return more slowly over a longer period of time. In the U.S., what we saw last quarter was that, that decreased the trade-in cycle. It was roughly 20% of the systems outstanding have been traded-in in that quarter. So if that pace were to continue, then you'll see a substantial decline certainly through the end of next year. Yes. We'll give you a specific guidance for '22 when we get to the end of January. I think what we're foreshadowing is that this is a period of investment for us. We think we still have to invest in both Ion and SP, which are in their earlier stages. In the case of Ion, we have regulatory approvals. We'll seek in outside the United States, we have also -- it's in other potential indications and uses for it. In the case of SP, we'll be investing heavily in clinical trials to be able to obtain additional indications and to attain clearances in other markets outside of the U.S. So I think those are 2 big investment areas. Again, data is probably the greatest area of increased investment and will continue to be. And then you'll see a return in certain expenses that just as COVID wanes, you'll see increased travel, marketing events and other activities that have before now been caused by COVID. So as far as leverage goes, like I said earlier, you should not expect profitability at the level that you saw in Q2 going forward, Q2 was an anomaly, and we will continue to invest. It's happened to a certain extent. As you see some of the smaller competitors out there, the hospitals and in parts of where you have government systems like NHS in UK or some of the public hospitals in France and Germany, you -- they're bound to go through tender activities. When it was just us, they actually could -- they had to issue a tender, but they could circumvent the time frame and get it done more quickly. Now they have to go through the full length of time if one of those competitors jumps in the game. Going forward, we expect that more and more of those tenders will see multiple competitors, including companies like Medtronic. And so as that happens, then timelines elongate. What do they elongate to? Think of more like 6-month timeframes OUS versus 3-month timeframes. And in the U.S., you'll probably get some level of contemplation about whether competitive products versus ours make sense. And even though they don't have to go through these formal tender approaches, it could still elongate cycles here, too. That's a great question. I think you're already seeing competition trying to get customers to slow down their purchases or wait until their product is ready. That's happened for the last 4 years, frankly, when companies thought they might be coming to market more quickly than they actually have been able to. So I don't know. My expectation is they'll continue to try to get customers to slow down and install, but it hasn't had a significant impact to date. Sure. I'll let Philip take the first step at it, and then I'll jump in. Yes. I think there are procedures that are already in flight, we're really talking about growth over the next couple of years will be driven by general surgery in the U.S. And in that category, you're really talking about continuation of adoption for bariatrics, cholecystectomy and hernia has been probably the big 3. But there are other areas of general surgeries that also are adopting for that, procedures that are smaller categories, but those will be the primary drivers.

And Jaime will review our financial outlook. Finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.\nGary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. Our first quarter of 2021 was a step in the right direction. In the quarter, we saw a healthy recovery of surgery and use of our products. Strong capital placements continued in Q1 2021 and utilization of installed systems increased through the quarter, indicating a need by our customers to return to surgery. We are in the early innings of commercialization of two new platforms for Intuitive, while advancing digital enablement of our ecosystem. Our teams are making good progress in all three areas. Overall, we are seeing some pandemic recovery, but improvement has been uneven with significant regional variation. Our experience shows that our business rebounds as COVID drops. Starting with procedures, general surgery in the United States was a source of strength in the quarter, driven by bariatric surgery, cholecystectomy and other procedures. Bariatric surgery has been on a multi-quarter gross trajectory, the result of a line development in commercial activities, starting with a capable systems, using Advanced Instruments and combined with a focused commercial team. Ventral hernia surgery is recovering with inguinal hernia tracking behind, aligned to hospital and patient prioritization. In the U.S. gynecology and urology returned to growth after pandemic-related declines. Growth in our second largest market, China, continued to be strong, with multiple specialties contributing. Lastly, procedures that have long diagnostic journeys, such as prostatectomy and thoracic surgery, remain below historical levels. Philip will take you through procedure dynamics in more detail later in the call. On the capital side, new system placements continued to exceed our expectations, with the United States, China, France and the U.K. standing out in the quarter. We know that new system placements are closely tied to anticipated procedure volumes and system utilization in mature markets. System utilization grew in the quarter on average, with significant regional variance due to pandemic differences. Overall, capital strength indicates anticipation of future procedure opportunities by our customers, a significant number systems were part of multisystem deals by hospitals and integrated delivery networks, supporting a theme in which customers who know robotic-assisted surgery well continue to invest with us. Lastly, the use of leasing and other alternative capital placement models ticked up again this quarter. Marshall will take you through capital placements in more detail later in the call. Surveying our business around the world, our business in China is growing quickly from a small base and we are pleased with the performance of our joint venture with Fosun Pharma. We believe there is significant long-term opportunity in China and remind you that it is currently a quota-controlled market. We expect China to be dynamic and competitive in coming years and we are investing in the market to bolster our place as a leading provider to the Chinese healthcare system. In Japan, growth remains healthy, although below pre-pandemic levels. In Europe, our business in France and Germany had performed well considering the pandemic. In the U.K., tightly control surgery resulted in procedure declines, but we have also seen an increased commitment to robotic-assisted surgery in the form of increased capital placements, anticipating a return of da Vinci surgery post-pandemic. Italy and Spain are rapidly returning to growth after substantial pandemic impacts. Speaking to our finances in the quarter, procedures recovered nicely in Q1. System placements came in above plan and I&A revenue per procedure was above our expectations, together driving 18% revenue growth over Q1 2020. Product gross margins were strong in the quarter, largely due to above average system ASPs, lower than expected excess and obsolescence charges, and higher volumes through our factory. Other spending was constrained in the quarter driven by three factors. First, travel and associated costs did not recur at pre-pandemic levels. This spend will increase as COVID wanes and our customers and our staff reach immunity. Second, COVID delayed some work in R&D, leading to some under spend in prototypes. We expect these programs to ramp up as COVID wanes and our labs and development programs recover efficiency. Third, we differed some investments in infrastructure that were unnecessary during the pandemic. We think most of these factors will normalize over time and we consider them one-time events related to the pandemic. We are still in the early stages of developing robotic-assisted surgery globally, and we will continue investing in R&D and our regional capabilities to realize these opportunities. As I mentioned at the start of the call, we are in the early phases of our commercialization efforts for new platforms, which we expect to play out over future quarters. Our single-port surgery platform, da Vinci SP, we performed our first cases in the U.S. and Korea of an important accessory, our SP access port, which enables surgery close to the body wall and eases assistant surgeon access through the single incision. The access port is important in the SP ecosystem, facilitating access and workflow in many procedures in which SP is used. We have had very strong customer feedback on the port to-date. We are also increasing our investments to accelerate new indications in key countries. In the U.S. we have two cleared indications for SP and expect to initiate cases as part of our colorectal IDE this quarter. We have seen strong interest in SP use in various specialties and we are in the process of designing trials for additional indications, including thoracic surgery and other surgical disciplines. Overall, we have received robust customer feedback for SP use under existing clearances. Turning to our flexible robotics platform, Ion, we installed 14 systems in the quarter. We are covering for our from our supply backlog and are meeting demand for Ion procedures at all our installed accounts, while working to fill customer inventory stocking requests and our internal inventory goals, which we expect to complete around midyear. Our PRECISE trial evaluating the ability to reach and diagnosis suspicious pulmonary legions is on track to finish enrollment by Q2 this year. Our Ion clinical performance is meeting our expectations and customer acceptance remains highly encouraging. In our digital ecosystem enablement, we broadened access to our mobile surgeon portal, the My Intuitive app this April as part of our phase launch. My Intuitive is a mobile app that allows surgeons to manage their da Vinci experience, log into da Vinci systems, manage their training and view their operative data from the palm of their hand. Our Intuitive telepresence program supported 45% of all case observations in Q1 2021, up from less than 5% a year ago, a significant achievement accelerated by the pandemic, improving convenience for our customers and reducing costs for our team. Year-over-year surgical simulation usage in the quarter grew roughly 46% over Q1 2020, validating the power of digital tools. Finally, our team made significant progress in automating customer-facing analytics as part of our robotics program consulting services, which allow our customers to analyze the relative performance of their da Vinci programs, now a routine part of customer engagement in the United States. In conclusion, we are seeing adjustments in the healthcare system that favor our offerings, increased appreciation of high quality MIS in the current and post-pandemic environment, increased openness to digital technologies, increased use of analytics to assess care and increasing sensitivity by health systems to total cost to treat. We have and will continue to position ourselves to perform well in this environment. I will now turn the time over to Marshall to take you through our financial performance in greater detail.\nMarshall Mohr: Good afternoon. I would describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted to our website. Key business metrics for the first quarter were as follows. First quarter 2021 procedures increased approximately 16% compared with the first quarter of 2020, was approximately the same as last quarter. On a day adjusted basis, procedures grew 18% year-over-year. First quarter system placements of 298 systems increased 26%, compared with 237 systems for the first quarter of 2020 and decreased 9%, compared with 326 systems last quarter. We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems over the last year by 8% to approximately 6,142 systems. This growth rate compares with 11% last year and 7% last quarter. Utilization of clinical systems in the field measured by procedures per system increased approximately 8%, compared with last year and decreased 2% compared with last quarter. The impact of COVID on da Vinci procedures varied by region. In the U.S., COVID resurgence that affected procedures later in the fourth quarter continued well into January. Then, as COVID subsided, procedures experienced a steady improvement through February and March. In Europe, the spread of COVID varied regionally and procedure growth rates were mixed, with strength in France and a year-over-year decline in the U.K. While there have been COVID hotspots within some of our Asia-Pacific markets, they tended to be isolated, and in general, procedures performed well. China growth was far higher than other regions, reflecting the severity of the COVID impact on China in the first quarter of last year and the additional system installations over the past year. Philip will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call. Despite the fact that hospitals are better equipped to handle COVID patients today compared with the outset of the pandemic, resurgences of COVID-19 and its variants like those currently being experienced in parts of Europe and U.S. have challenged hospital care capabilities and have negatively impacted da Vinci procedures. In addition, delays in diagnosis and treatment of underlying conditions have continued to negatively impact da Vinci procedures. While there is a backlog of patients, it is unpredictable when those patients will ultimately seek diagnosis and treatment, and whether they will be treated with surgery. Jamie will be providing procedure guidance later in this call. That guidance is based on our experience in the first quarter and the pace at which vaccines have been and are forecasted to be rolled out. Changes in the spread of COVID and its variants in the pace of vaccine rollouts could significantly impact our guidance. Moving on to capital placements, placements in the quarter reflected procedure growth, hospitals purchasing systems in preparation for a post-pandemic environment and hospitals upgrading in order to access or standardize on fourth-generation capabilities. First quarter capital placements exceeded our expectations. We believe that generally COVID has had less of an impact on hospital capital spending capacity and that customers recognize that da Vinci surgery meets their quadruple aim objectives better than other surgical approaches. Looking forward, we see the following capital revenue dynamics. Procedure growth drives capital purchases in many of our markets, to the extent that COVID impacts procedures, it will also impact capital purchases. Leasing and alternative financing arrangements have enabled customer\u2019s access to capital. We believe leasing will increase as a percentage of sales over time, which will result in a deferral of otherwise current revenue into future periods. The trade-in cycle has been a tailwind to system placements. However, as the installed base of older generation product declines, the number of trade-ins will decline. Macroeconomic conditions created by COVID could regionally impact hospital capital spending and as we face competition in various markets, we may experience longer selling cycles and price pressures. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. Total first quarter revenue was $1.292 billion, representing an 18% increase from last year and a 3% decrease from last quarter. First quarter revenue growth reflected procedure growth and higher than expected system placements. Leasing represented 43% of current quarter placements, compared with 32% last year and 37% last quarter. Leasing as a percentage of total sales has and will continue to fluctuate with core -- with customer and geographic mix. However, given hospital like -- we anticipate more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than reflected in historical run rates. 44% of systems placed in the first quarter involve trade-ins, which is lower than the 57% last year and the 49% last quarter. Trade-in activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict. First quarter system average selling prices increased to $1.65 million from $1.44 million last year and $1.43 million in the fourth quarter. The increase relative to last year reflects a higher mix of systems placed in China and our direct markets relative to our indirect markets, a higher mix of dual console systems and the lower proportion of trade-in transactions. The increase relative to last quarter reflects a higher mix of dual consoles and a lower proportion of trade-in transactions. We recognized $19 million of lease buyout revenue in the first quarter, compared with $12 million last year and $14 million last quarter. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure for the first quarter of $1,950 decreased compared with $1,990 per procedure for the first quarter of last year and $2,060 per procedure in the fourth quarter of 2020. Extended Use Instruments were introduced in the U.S. and Europe in the fourth quarter. While we saw increased usage of Extended Use Instruments in these markets, full adoption will occur over the next few quarters as customer\u2019s burn off lower use product. In addition, we saw customers begin to adjust their instrument buying patterns to reduce their inventory levels to reflect the additional uses per instrument. Increased usage of Extended Use Instruments and customer buying patterns are the primary reasons for the decrease in instrument and accessory revenue per procedure in the first quarter relative to prior quarters. We expect this trend to continue over the next few quarters. While we expect price elasticity associated with Extended Use Instruments, to enable greater penetration into available markets, that benefit is delayed by COVID and otherwise will take time. 6% of the systems placed in the first quarter were SP systems, reflecting a continued measured rollout of SP. Our installed base of SP systems is now 75, eight in Korea and 67 in the U.S. Our rollout of the SP surgical system continues to be measured, putting systems in the hands of experienced da Vinci users, while we pursue additional indications and optimize training pathways in our supply chain. We expect to initiate first cases associated with the U.S. colorectal trial in the next few months. We placed 14 Ion systems in the quarter, bringing the installed base to 50 systems. Ion system placements and procedures are excluded from our overall system and procedure counts. The supply issues we called out last quarter had less of an impact on Ion placements and procedures this quarter. We expect to have resolved those supply issues this quarter. Our rollout of Ion will continue to be measured while we optimize training pathways in our supply chain. Procedures under the PRECISE study are expected to complete this quarter. Outside of the U.S., we placed 108 systems in the first quarter, compared with 55 in the first quarter of 2020 and 130 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 59 into Europe, eight into Japan and 23 into China, compared with 25 into Europe, 10 into Japan and nine into China in the first quarter of 2020. 22 systems -- 22 of the 59 systems placed in Europe this quarter were in the U.K. Placements in many markets like the U.K. can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter. While we were pleased with the performance of the U.K. team, we do not anticipate this level of placements in the U.K. in future quarters Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the first quarter of 2020 was 71.8%, compared with 69.7% for both the first and fourth quarters of 2020. The first and fourth quarters of 2020 included higher period costs associated with lower production and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges. In addition, the first quarter of 2021 reflected leveraging fixed costs over higher production levels. Product and customer mix fluctuate quarter to quarter, which can cause fluctuations in gross margins. In addition, if revenues are pressured by COVID-19, production levels may operate at below normal levels, which may result in higher labor costs and under absorbed overhead and reduced product margins. COVID has impacted global supplies of semiconductors and other materials used in our products. While we carry safety stocks of critical components and are otherwise working to secure supply necessary to ensure fulfillment of customer demand, global shortages could result in higher production costs or production delays. Pro forma operating expenses increased 5% compared with the first quarter of 2020 and increased 2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. The fourth quarter of 2020 included a $25 million contribution to the Intuitive Foundation, while there were no contributions in the first quarters of 2021 and 2020. The increase compared to the prior year reflects costs associated with higher headcount and increased variable compensation, partially offset by lower spending in areas impacted by COVID. First quarter spending was below our expectations for the reasons outlined by Gary in his opening remarks. Looking to the remainder of the year, we expect spending impacted by COVID-19 including clinical development, in-person training, marketing events and travel costs to increase as COVID\u2019s impacts decrease and spending deferred due to COVID and other timing matters to increase. Jamie will provide spend guidance later in this call. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 20% meeting our expectations. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of one-time items. Our pro forma 2020 -- our first quarter 2020 pro forma net income was $427 million or $3.52 per share, compared with $323 million or $2.69 per share for the first quarter of 2020 and $434 million or $3.58 per share for last quarter. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $426 million or $3.51 per share for the first quarter of 2021, compared with GAAP net income of $314 million or $2.62 per share for the first quarter of 2020 and GAAP net income of $365 million or $3.02 per share for last quarter. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock award, employee stock-based compensation and IP charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition-related items and legal settlements. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 also included pretax gains of $4.7 million and $14.3 million on our investments in private companies resulting from our purchases of certain technologies. The EPS impact of these gains net of tax was $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.09 per share in the first quarter. These gains are excluded from our pro forma results. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.2 billion, compared with $6.9 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase in cash in the first quarter primarily reflected cash from operations and stock exercises. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Philip who will go over procedure performance.\nPhilip Kim: Thank you, Marshall. Our overall first quarter procedure growth was 16% year-over-year, compared to 10% growth during the first quarter of 2020 and 6% growth last quarter. Our Q1 procedure growth was driven by 14% year-over-year growth in the U.S. and 23% growth OUS. Procedures in the U.S. recovered steadily after January as COVID cases declined and the associated impact on hospital resources improved. In the U.S. within general surgery, bariatric, cholecystectomy and hernia were the largest contributors to procedure growth within the quarter. Bariatrics growth remained strong with positive customer feedback on our Advanced Instrument portfolio. Cholecystectomy growth was driven by the continued expansion of robotic procedures by general surgeons throughout their total practice. Inguinal hernia growth trailed ventral growth in the quarter. With respect to our more mature procedure categories in the U.S., Q1 gynecology procedures grew double-digit against the prior year growth comparison that was negative due to COVID. While dVP in the U.S. stabilized in Q1 from previous declines, it remains unclear when patients who have been impacted from delays in diagnosis and treatment will ultimately come back. In aggregate, on a worldwide basis, prostatectomy in the first quarter largely stabilized. More broadly OUS procedure growth was driven by urology, earlier stage growth in general surgery, gynecology and thoracic procedures. With respect to OUS markets, China procedure growth was strong and benefited from the severe first quarter of 2020 impact of COVID-19 and an increase in the installed base over the past year. China had broad-based growth in all procedure categories. In Japan, procedure growth moderated somewhat due to restrictions associated with COVID. Procedure growth in South Korea was encouraging, with SP utilization continuing to be above Xi. In Europe, France had a solid quarter, with broad-based strength in a wide range of procedure categories. The U.K. remained challenged due to COVID. Now turning to the clinical side of our business, each quarter on these calls we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. A recent article by Dr. Mohamed A Abd El Aziz, Fabian Grass and David Larson with colleagues from the Mayo Clinic published in Surgical Endoscopy provided results from a real world study aimed to analyze national trends of conversion during elective colectomies in addition to MIS utilization trends. Using the ATF national surgical quality improvement program database for elective laparoscopic or robotic-assisted colectomy between January 2013 and December 2018, a total of 66,652 patients were identified. Overall conversion rates from MIS to open were approximately 42% lower for robotic-assisted procedures when compared to laparoscopic procedures, 4.9% versus 8.5%. The rate was also lower for obese patients with a BMI greater than or equal to 30, 6% versus 10.3%. The authors concluded in part, quote, this large scale study identified a decreasing trend in conversion rates over the six-year inclusion period, both overall and in patients with obesity paralleling increased utilization of the robotics platform. Given the potential negative impact of conversion on patient outcomes, individual institutions should consider a review of their own conversion data, as this may represent an opportunity for quality improvement, unquote. In February of this year, Dr. Amir Bastawrous of the Swedish Cancer Institute in Seattle Washington and Dr. Robert Cleary of St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor, Michigan, published a real-world observational study, which compared the rates of long-term opioid prescriptions for patients who underwent minimally invasive and open colectomies. This study utilized the IBM market scan research database and analyzed 14,887 eligible patients who underwent the colon resection via the open laparoscopic or robotic-assisted approach between 2013 and 2017. In the one-to-one propensity score matched analysis comparing the MIS and open approaches with over 5,000 patients in each arm, the MIS approach has significantly lower incident rates of long-term prescriptions of any opioid by approximately 36%, 13.3% versus 20.9%, Schedule 2 and 3opioids by approximately 39%, 11.7% versus 19.2%, and high-dose opioids by approximately 44%, 4.3% versus 7.7% from 90 days to 180 days postoperatively. Looking at the matched analysis between robotic-assisted surgery and laparoscopy with overall 1,100 subjects in each group, the robotic-assisted approach demonstrated approximately 45% lower long-term prescription rates of high-dose opioids, 2.1% versus 3.8% when compared to the laparoscopic approach. Furthermore, in subgroup analyses, the robotic-assisted approach showed significant lower rates of long-term prescriptions in any opioids, Schedule 2 and 3 opioids, and high-dose opioids compared to the laparoscopic approach for subjects undergoing a colectomy for nonmalignant conditions. The authors concluded in part, quote, choosing an MIS option in robotic-assisted surgery for some colorectal operations is a modifiable factor that may contribute to less long-term opioid use, unquote. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Jamie who will review our financial outlook.\nJamie Samath: Good afternoon. While there continues to be uncertainty regarding the ongoing impact of COVID-19, given moderating COVID-19 hospitalization trends and vaccination progress particularly in the U.S. which accounted for approximately 70% of our 2020 procedures, we are reestablishing our financial guidance. In providing this guidance, we know that there are emerging supply constraints in our supply chain, for example, in the semiconductor industry. The outlook we are providing does not reflect any potential significant disruption or additional costs related to the supply constraints. Our financial outlook for 2021 is as follows. Starting with procedures, total 2020 da Vinci procedures grew approximately 1% to roughly 1,243,000 procedures performed worldwide. For 2021, we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 22% to 26%. We expect 2021 procedure growth to continue to be driven by U.S. general surgery and procedures outside the United States where we were at earlier stages of adoption. The high end of the range assumes that COVID cases and their impact on da Vinci procedures to continue to decline throughout the year, the vaccine rollouts continue at the level currently expected by governments around the world and that recovery of patient backlogs will progress. Modeling quarterly results is difficult, given the impact that COVID had on 2020 procedures. Therefore, with respect to seasonality, we expect similar quarterly patterns to 2019. With respect to capital, system placements are generally driven by procedure demand, prompting hospitals to establish or expand robotic system capacity. System placement demand is also the result of customers standardizing our fourth generation technology through trade-ins. Capital sales can vary substantially from period to period based upon many factors, including government healthcare policies, hospital capital spending cycles, reimbursement and government quotas, product cycles, economic cycles and competitive factors. Within this framework, we expect 2021 capital placements to generally be driven by procedures and the adequacy of existing capacity in the installed base. During the first quarter of 2021, 43% of system shifts were under operating leases. We expect that the proportion of systems placed under operating leases will vary from quarter-to-quarter and could continue to trend up in the future. Turning to gross profit, our full year 2020 pro forma gross profit margin was 68.4%, reflecting the impact of fixed -- higher fixed overhead costs relative to revenue, higher excess and obsolete inventory charges and the customer relief program that was implemented in the second quarter of 2020. Our full year 2019 pro forma gross profit margin was 71.7%. In 2021, we expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71% of revenue. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix, the impact of current cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies and competitive pricing pressure. With respect to operating expenses, in 2019, our pro forma operating expenses grew 27%, and in 2020, given the impact of the pandemic they grew 3%. In 2021, we expect pro forma full-year operating expense growth to be between 18% and 22%, reflecting increases in investments in our digital ecosystem, Ion, SP, OUS expansion, higher regulatory-related costs and infrastructure investments to allow us to scale. 2021 spending also expected to be impacted by a return over the course of the year to higher rates of travel, increased customer training and a greater proportion of marketing events being held in-person and by a variable compensation. We expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $450 million and $470 million in 2021, compared to $396 million in 2020. We expect pro forma other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $45 million and $55 million in 2021, reflecting lower interest rates relative to 2020. With regard to income tax, in 2020, our pro forma income tax rate was 22.5%. As we look forward, we estimate our 2021 pro forma tax rate to be between 20% and 21% of pretax income. Our 2021 outlook for the pro forma tax rate does not reflect any potential change in U.S. tax rates. That concludes our prepared comments and we will now open the call to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First, we are going to the line of Amit Hazan. Please go ahead.\nAmit Hazan: Thanks very much. Can you hear me okay?\nGary Guthart: We can.\nAmit Hazan: Great. I will maybe burn the first question on just the guide. Obviously appreciate that just given all the uncertainty on the procedure side. And so given that you gave that number, we will see if you would go a step further and just give us a little bit more color as to how you got there. We are obviously all kind of trying to figure out recovery back to normal, but also these potential buckets of recapturing backlog of procedure categories for you, particularly in prostate I\u2019d suspect. Can you just talk to how you thought about those backlog of patients and that return to normal as you developed this guide for the rest of the year on the procedure side?\nJamie Samath: Yeah. So maybe I will start with -- this is Jamie. I will start with the low end of the procedure guidance. So we considered three factors in the low end. We see the possibility of extended impact of COVID in certain OUS geographies, with slower vaccine rollouts and resurgences in some of these geographies. We see that in parts of Europe currently. Secondly, we embedded in the lower end of the procedure guidance a slower recovery of diagnostic pipelines that have been impacted during the pandemic. And then the third item in the low end of the guidance is the possibility of regionalized resurgence of COVID in the U.S. as we race towards the rollout of vaccines and ultimately at some point achieve herd immunity in the U.S. With respect to the backlog, the backlog has accumulated really for three factors, lower diagnostic pipelines, deferred elective surgery as hospital systems get inundated with COVID cases and patient reluctance to undergo surgery during COVID resurgences. These subcomponents we think get recovered over different periods of time. The backlog is actually constantly netting between increases and recovery. So the total accumulated backlog is difficult to predict. The rate of recovery is also difficult to predict, but we expect it to go through into 2022. And so -- the 2021 procedure guidance that we provided reflects our best estimate of the range of the impact of backlog in the year.\nAmit Hazan: Okay. I appreciate that. And I want to come back with the second question just to a topic that\u2019s been discussed before, but I figured in light of COVID to bring it up again, which is just this question of ambulatory surgery centers and lower acuity procedures generally. I mean, especially given COVID, it just seems like there\u2019s just never been more of an optimal time for Intuitive to discuss and go after this part of the market? And we still don\u2019t hear you talking about it that much. It just -- it begs the question of what\u2019s holding you back and we know that the reflex answers -- reflex kind of answer seemed to be on the reimbursement side and that it may not be optimal. When I think about your advantages that you pitch to hospitals on the marketing side, the surgeon benefit, frankly the outcomes, that seems to be a lot more important and potentially beneficial than wherever reimbursement lies. So help us out here. Why are ambulatory surgery centers not a bigger opportunity for you right now?\nGary Guthart: Yeah. This is Gary. We are already in ambulatory surgery environments with our customers, different types and we see healthy programs there. I don\u2019t think we are struggling from the point of view of having a product that can help them or services that can help them or a way to have a conversation. I think all those things are in place. I do believe that over time reimbursement matters, particularly in customers that operate in both environments, hospitals and ASCs. For them, reimbursement matters. If they are going to move a patient, but they get a big difference in the revenue, then they are going to make those decisions. It may change over time and that what payers ultimately decide to do and whether they want to create some incentives to help things move into ASCs, we will be ready. Long-term, I am bullish on that. I think the environment makes sense, but economics and incentives really matter. It doesn\u2019t clear up your question, it reinforces our position.\nAmit Hazan: Okay. Thank you for that. I will step back in queue.\nOperator: Thank you. And next we will go to the line of Larry Biegelsen. Please go ahead.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Gary, can you please provide more color on the Intuitive telepresence feature that you mentioned on this call? It\u2019s the first time I\u2019d heard you talk about it and that 45% of procedures was a pretty impressive number. Is that through your agreement with InTouch? How is it being used by customers? What are the benefits And how do you see that playing out post-COVID And I have one follow-up?\nGary Guthart: Yeah. So, you are right, it is the result of the technology and a collaborative agreement we signed with InTouch many years ago. We brought a team over, as well as some of the technology and have put it in our hands. The use case I was talking about there is the ability for people who are interested in observing a case by an expert to log in online through a secure network, high speed streaming and view that case on da Vinci accounts. And that\u2019s an important part of both knowledge transfer from those high volume accounts, as well as an introductory exposure for surgeons who are thinking about it. So that has been great. There are other use cases for streaming connections, video streaming connections, into our products that I won\u2019t detail now. It\u2019s pretty neat and so prior we had started that, I was a believer, or we as a company were believers that those kinds of access, think of it as kind of surgical FaceTime or surgical Skype over a distance. That kind of access would be important to folks, and the pandemic really accelerated it. So we had the technology infrastructure in place and as people started to be more open to the use of digital tools to do their learning and exposure and wanted to stay off of planes and out of cars, we saw it really accelerate and that\u2019s what we have been touching on there.\nLarry Biegelsen: That\u2019s very helpful. And then lastly, what response are you getting from the Extended Use Program you introduced in Q4 2020, any changes to kind of the impact that we could see from that and any color yet on demand elasticity? Thanks for taking the questions.\nMarshall Mohr: Yeah. Sure. So we introduced Extended Use Instruments into Europe and into the U.S. in Q4. We did see increased usage of Extended Use Instruments. They still have some level of inventory of shorter life used instruments and they are burning that off. We also had commented last quarter that we saw stocking orders of Extended Use Instruments and we are seeing some adjustment of their buying patterns to recognize the increased number of uses per instrument. So, this quarter, as I called out, instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was lower than last quarter and that primarily reflects those factors, like the turn of use of Extended Instruments and adjustments of inventory buying patterns. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s exhausted the whole impact and 130 if you go back to our previous script, you see that we said that had you implemented this in 2019, it would have affected total revenue by about $150 million to $170 million or about 7% of INA per procedure and we have only seen a part of that so far. When the rest of it will hit is questionable. It will roll out over time as they continue to use those instruments and as we roll it out to other countries.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thanks, Marshall.\nOperator: Thank you. And next we are going to the line of Bob Hopkins. Please go ahead.\nBob Hopkins: Great. Thank you and good afternoon. I wanted to ask a question or a few questions on just the first quarter procedure volume numbers that you provided, because it was obviously a lot stronger than consensus estimates. And so, Gary, I was just wondering, a couple quick things. Is it safe to assume that the end of the quarter was materially stronger than the beginning and middle of the quarter in terms of procedure growth? And then I was just wondering what stood out to you, Gary, either geographically or by procedure type in the quarter that you think is worth calling out?\nGary Guthart: To your -- thanks for the question. To the first one, we definitely saw growth through the quarter, which was encouraging. In terms of procedure types, I think, there\u2019s this interesting mix, the prioritization that folks are making as they come back into hospitals. I think is a mixture of patient desire depending on what they think their condition might be, for example bariatrics, and the hospital and surgeons prioritization around urgency, for example diagnosed cancers and changes that are challenges to the diagnostic pipeline. I was pleased by U.S. general surgery. I think that that has shown some resilience, a lot of that is benign procedures and I think that that has been kind of on the upside of our models. So so far so good.\nBob Hopkins: And then one follow-up just on that also to get a little bit of a better flavor for procedure volumes in the quarter by geography, I am just curious on Europe, what\u2019s your take on, how bad are things there in your view and just curious maybe how far below 16% was Europe in the quarter?\nGary Guthart: I won\u2019t quantify it for you but just to give you a little bit of qualitative color and Marshall, please jump in and help. In the U.K., we have seen NHS make priority decisions firmly and that reflects what we see in the procedure performance itself, which has been suppressed. That said, we are also seeing commitments to MIS in the form of capital acquisition and other things that indicate to us that they are rotating toward it. So there is kind of a mixed conversation. France and Germany have been surprisingly good despite complexity with regard to the way COVID is rolling out. And then as we look at Spain and Italy, we see it really just follow as COVID eases surgery comes back and we come back with it. Overall, we feel like we have really good leadership teams in place in country. We feel like we are in good connection with the healthcare systems. I think we are being agile and adaptable to meet their needs, which is really controlling what we can control. And in that sense, I think the company is doing all right. Marshall, anything you would add?\nMarshall Mohr: I think that was great color. I think the only other thing I would add is the, we have talked about in the past that a lot of the procedures we are performing are urologic and we are in the process in certain countries of pivoting. And we are starting to see some adoption in GYN and general surgeries in some countries but we still have work to do.\nBob Hopkins: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And next we are going to the line of Tycho Peterson. Please go ahead.\nTycho Peterson: Hey. Thanks. A couple follow-ups. I am curious what\u2019s baked into guidance on utilization given the Extended Use Instruments in the commentary before. What are you kind of modeling for utilization for the year?\nGary Guthart: Yeah. I think I would refer, Tycho, back to 2019 patterns in terms of utilization. Obviously, we knew capital was going to be driven by procedure performance. So I think I would just refer to seasonal patterns in 2019 as a starting point.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. And then you have commented a couple times on this call and other calls on the diagnostic pipelines being under pressure. Can you just talk a little bit about how are they are looking as a leading indicator to some of the more mature procedures, dVP in particular?\nGary Guthart: Yeah. Jamie, why don\u2019t you jump in?\nJamie Samath: Yeah. We have -- so we have some market data actually for the U.S. What we see is -- and that\u2019s through February 2021, what we see is most of the diagnostic tests, PSA testing, for example, CT scans and lung cancer. We see that those have been suppressed during this period. So we haven\u2019t seen them start to recover at least in the data that we have seen so far. And we see that reasonably correlated to the associated procedures, so PSA dVP has been relatively weak during that period, so as lobectomy. So so far we haven\u2019t seen any evidence of a recovery in diagnostic testing at least in the U.S.\nGary Guthart: There are some anecdotes that it\u2019s starting to get better in March. We will see as it plays out. Even after the diagnostic gets done there is a workup pipeline that has to be done. That said, I don\u2019t feel like we have any evidence that it\u2019s moving away from surgery. So it appears in those kind of cases that it\u2019s building a backlog that ultimately will flow through. If PSA testing back in 2012 is a guide, it will take several quarters for that to work its way out.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. And then last one on SP, two quick ones actually. Can you confirm you started the IDE trial for colorectal in the quarter? And then, Gary, you mentioned thoracic surgery and other disciplines, I am just curious if you could talk a little bit about the roadmap other areas you might go after with SP?\nGary Guthart: Sure. On the SP side, on the IDEs, the first cases are scheduled. We have got all the paperwork done in our research institutions that we are working through, at least the first starting ones and we expect that to happen. The first cases have not yet gone through. They should have it here in the next few weeks. Thoracic, that\u2019s the first time we been telling you that we think that\u2019s interesting. There are single port opportunities for thoracic surgery and we are excited by them. We are working through what those trials look like and having conversations with regulatory bodies to get it going and given the current environment, we will have concurrent trials for the colorectal and then thoracic. There are a couple more indications beyond that. For competitive and other reasons, we are not yet ready to guess what those are going to be for us. But SP is a platform, and we are excited by it. So as we get closer and those things get closer to being filed as IDEs and trials then we will describe them more fully.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And next we are going to the line of Rick Wise. Please go ahead.\nRick Wise: Good afternoon, everybody. I was hoping we could talk a little bit more, Gary, about Ion. We would get a bunch of physician calls a month or so ago and heard really fantastic feedback that doctors are telling us about early signs of higher diagnostic yields, best in complex cases, noticeable functional benefits and features. All that left me optimistic about the PRECISE trial. So a couple things, are you optimistic and hopeful about PRECISE? I think you said it would be wrapped up -- I just want to make sure I understand by midyear. When might we see the data, all the docs are anxious to see the data? And with some of the logistical issues resolved, could we, should we expect an acceleration, is it reasonable to think about anticipate the acceleration Ion uptake in the second half and into 2022? Thanks.\nGary Guthart: Sure. On the issue of the PRECISE trial, Philip, I will turn to you in terms of timing.\nPhilip Kim: Sure. So we confirmed that we expect enrollment to end this quarter in Q2 and then you would have final data readout in the back half of next year, 2022.\nGary Guthart: On the issue of, you had said, how are we feeling about it. I think we are reading and hearing what you are reading and hearing also in terms of talking to our customer about the ability of Ion to deliver on its promises, to reach into the lung to get to diagnostic yields that folks have not seen with other technologies and to work in complex cases. So I am feeling enthusiastic and bullish on it. With regard to ramp, we are expecting Ion to continue to ramp through the year and into next year. I don\u2019t see a step function change. I think it\u2019s a sequential ramp as we go and that\u2019s because it\u2019s been interesting and sophisticated technology. So a lot of what we are working on is making sure that we can get the manufacturability to where we need it, getting supply chain stability, quality and predictability where we need it, iterating our design for manufacturing and working on additional indications because it\u2019s a platform and we are doing all four of those things. But I don\u2019t think investors, because of the way these things work, should expect that you flip a switch and it just goes to the next level. I think that it will climb each quarter and that\u2019s what we are working on. That beats our expectation and our experience in these kind of function.\nRick Wise: Thanks very much.\nGary Guthart: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And next we are going to the line of Richard Newitter. Please go ahead.\nRichard Newitter: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just one on operating expense guidance. Thanks for the full year outlook. Just could you give us an extent of the quarterly pacing or would it be safe to assume the 2019 cadence commentary for procedures applies to OpEx too?\nMarshall Mohr: Yeah. I think you should see sequentially operating expenses generally increase across the rest of the year. It\u2019s really going to be a function of the extent to which COVID continues to impact our ability to travel, accelerate customer training and hold marketing events in person. But generally, I would expect it to radically increase across the balance of the year.\nRichard Newitter: Got it. And just same kind of topic here, on geographic investment and expansion that you started to get more aggressive on pre-pandemic, especially in India, just in light of what\u2019s been going on in that region specifically with the COVID problem. Should we be thinking of some of those initiatives postponed even further out to 2022 and beyond or are those things that could resume as early as this year? Thanks.\nGary Guthart: Yeah. I am sorry. I had a little bit of a hard time hearing you with regard to the referenced trial. So go ahead and re-ask the question, if you would.\nRichard Newitter: Sorry. My connection is off. But just India, should we think of reinvestment in that region starting now or in light of COVID and the situation there something 2022 and beyond? Is that part of the spending and geographic expansion you referred today?\nGary Guthart: Yeah. So with regard to India, clearly, the current situation there is such that current procedures are impacted. That said, I think that the long-term commitment we have to market is intact. Our teams are making really nice progress building a footprint in relationships to hospital systems. And so I expect as COVID starts to become managed there a little bit more forcefully and it starts to recover we will see a recovery on our side. It has not had a retreat. Other places around the world, whether it\u2019s Japan or China or Europe, we continue to be interested and committed, so not just India, but others as well. And if you have just asked your last question then we will go from there. Rich, any follow-ups or Operator, one more question please.\nOperator: Okay. Next we are going to the line of Matt Taylor. Please go ahead.\nMatt Taylor: Hi. Yeah. Thank you very much for taking the question. I guess it was good to see the strong return of capital spending. You are talking about customers looking forward to prepare for volumes and commitment to robotic surgeries. Do you think that there was a little bit of a bolus of kind of pent-up spending that came through in Q1 or do you think this is the start of a new pattern of purchasing based on your backlog and what you are seeing with your orders?\nGary Guthart: That is a subject of fearsome debate amongst us as a company. Marshall, why don\u2019t you share your opinion?\nMarshall Mohr: Well, I give you a few different dynamics to consider as we go forward. It\u2019s always hard to project out based on one quarter results. I guess we have had a couple quarters that have been decent. Is there -- was there -- I think part of your question was, is there pent-up spending? I would just say, I don\u2019t know if it was pent-up spending, but I would say, that clearly the hospitals had more capital to spend than we had anticipated. And as a -- and what\u2019s really driving them, their spending on da Vinci procedure -- on da Vinci capital is procedure growth. Procedure growth is the number one thing that drives capital. But also the trade-in cycle and the desire to access fourth generation product, including the Extended Use Instruments we mentioned earlier. And then, finally, I think that, you also have them getting ready for the post-pandemic environment and just a general recognition that da Vinci Surgery meets their quadruple aim objectives better than other approaches now.\nMatt Taylor: Great. Okay, guys. Thanks. I will leave it there. Appreciate it.\nGary Guthart: All right. Well, thank you. Okay. Well, that was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there\u2019s a substantial and durable opportunity of fundamentally improved surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim, better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It follows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their need and their environments. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey and we look forward to talking with you again in three months.\nOperator: And that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Conferencing Service. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Gary Guthart",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today. Our first quarter of 2021 was a step in the right direction. In the quarter, we saw a healthy recovery of surgery and use of our products. Strong capital placements continued in Q1 2021 and utilization of installed systems increased through the quarter, indicating a need by our customers to return to surgery. We are in the early innings of commercialization of two new platforms for Intuitive, while advancing digital enablement of our ecosystem. Our teams are making good progress in all three areas. Overall, we are seeing some pandemic recovery, but improvement has been uneven with significant regional variation. Our experience shows that our business rebounds as COVID drops. Starting with procedures, general surgery in the United States was a source of strength in the quarter, driven by bariatric surgery, cholecystectomy and other procedures. Bariatric surgery has been on a multi-quarter gross trajectory, the result of a line development in commercial activities, starting with a capable systems, using Advanced Instruments and combined with a focused commercial team. Ventral hernia surgery is recovering with inguinal hernia tracking behind, aligned to hospital and patient prioritization. In the U.S. gynecology and urology returned to growth after pandemic-related declines. Growth in our second largest market, China, continued to be strong, with multiple specialties contributing. Lastly, procedures that have long diagnostic journeys, such as prostatectomy and thoracic surgery, remain below historical levels. Philip will take you through procedure dynamics in more detail later in the call. On the capital side, new system placements continued to exceed our expectations, with the United States, China, France and the U.K. standing out in the quarter. We know that new system placements are closely tied to anticipated procedure volumes and system utilization in mature markets. System utilization grew in the quarter on average, with significant regional variance due to pandemic differences. Overall, capital strength indicates anticipation of future procedure opportunities by our customers, a significant number systems were part of multisystem deals by hospitals and integrated delivery networks, supporting a theme in which customers who know robotic-assisted surgery well continue to invest with us. Lastly, the use of leasing and other alternative capital placement models ticked up again this quarter. Marshall will take you through capital placements in more detail later in the call. Surveying our business around the world, our business in China is growing quickly from a small base and we are pleased with the performance of our joint venture with Fosun Pharma. We believe there is significant long-term opportunity in China and remind you that it is currently a quota-controlled market. We expect China to be dynamic and competitive in coming years and we are investing in the market to bolster our place as a leading provider to the Chinese healthcare system. In Japan, growth remains healthy, although below pre-pandemic levels. In Europe, our business in France and Germany had performed well considering the pandemic. In the U.K., tightly control surgery resulted in procedure declines, but we have also seen an increased commitment to robotic-assisted surgery in the form of increased capital placements, anticipating a return of da Vinci surgery post-pandemic. Italy and Spain are rapidly returning to growth after substantial pandemic impacts. Speaking to our finances in the quarter, procedures recovered nicely in Q1. System placements came in above plan and I&A revenue per procedure was above our expectations, together driving 18% revenue growth over Q1 2020. Product gross margins were strong in the quarter, largely due to above average system ASPs, lower than expected excess and obsolescence charges, and higher volumes through our factory. Other spending was constrained in the quarter driven by three factors. First, travel and associated costs did not recur at pre-pandemic levels. This spend will increase as COVID wanes and our customers and our staff reach immunity. Second, COVID delayed some work in R&D, leading to some under spend in prototypes. We expect these programs to ramp up as COVID wanes and our labs and development programs recover efficiency. Third, we differed some investments in infrastructure that were unnecessary during the pandemic. We think most of these factors will normalize over time and we consider them one-time events related to the pandemic. We are still in the early stages of developing robotic-assisted surgery globally, and we will continue investing in R&D and our regional capabilities to realize these opportunities. As I mentioned at the start of the call, we are in the early phases of our commercialization efforts for new platforms, which we expect to play out over future quarters. Our single-port surgery platform, da Vinci SP, we performed our first cases in the U.S. and Korea of an important accessory, our SP access port, which enables surgery close to the body wall and eases assistant surgeon access through the single incision. The access port is important in the SP ecosystem, facilitating access and workflow in many procedures in which SP is used. We have had very strong customer feedback on the port to-date. We are also increasing our investments to accelerate new indications in key countries. In the U.S. we have two cleared indications for SP and expect to initiate cases as part of our colorectal IDE this quarter. We have seen strong interest in SP use in various specialties and we are in the process of designing trials for additional indications, including thoracic surgery and other surgical disciplines. Overall, we have received robust customer feedback for SP use under existing clearances. Turning to our flexible robotics platform, Ion, we installed 14 systems in the quarter. We are covering for our from our supply backlog and are meeting demand for Ion procedures at all our installed accounts, while working to fill customer inventory stocking requests and our internal inventory goals, which we expect to complete around midyear. Our PRECISE trial evaluating the ability to reach and diagnosis suspicious pulmonary legions is on track to finish enrollment by Q2 this year. Our Ion clinical performance is meeting our expectations and customer acceptance remains highly encouraging. In our digital ecosystem enablement, we broadened access to our mobile surgeon portal, the My Intuitive app this April as part of our phase launch. My Intuitive is a mobile app that allows surgeons to manage their da Vinci experience, log into da Vinci systems, manage their training and view their operative data from the palm of their hand. Our Intuitive telepresence program supported 45% of all case observations in Q1 2021, up from less than 5% a year ago, a significant achievement accelerated by the pandemic, improving convenience for our customers and reducing costs for our team. Year-over-year surgical simulation usage in the quarter grew roughly 46% over Q1 2020, validating the power of digital tools. Finally, our team made significant progress in automating customer-facing analytics as part of our robotics program consulting services, which allow our customers to analyze the relative performance of their da Vinci programs, now a routine part of customer engagement in the United States. In conclusion, we are seeing adjustments in the healthcare system that favor our offerings, increased appreciation of high quality MIS in the current and post-pandemic environment, increased openness to digital technologies, increased use of analytics to assess care and increasing sensitivity by health systems to total cost to treat. We have and will continue to position ourselves to perform well in this environment. I will now turn the time over to Marshall to take you through our financial performance in greater detail. We can. Yeah. This is Gary. We are already in ambulatory surgery environments with our customers, different types and we see healthy programs there. I don't think we are struggling from the point of view of having a product that can help them or services that can help them or a way to have a conversation. I think all those things are in place. I do believe that over time reimbursement matters, particularly in customers that operate in both environments, hospitals and ASCs. For them, reimbursement matters. If they are going to move a patient, but they get a big difference in the revenue, then they are going to make those decisions. It may change over time and that what payers ultimately decide to do and whether they want to create some incentives to help things move into ASCs, we will be ready. Long-term, I am bullish on that. I think the environment makes sense, but economics and incentives really matter. It doesn't clear up your question, it reinforces our position. Yeah. So, you are right, it is the result of the technology and a collaborative agreement we signed with InTouch many years ago. We brought a team over, as well as some of the technology and have put it in our hands. The use case I was talking about there is the ability for people who are interested in observing a case by an expert to log in online through a secure network, high speed streaming and view that case on da Vinci accounts. And that's an important part of both knowledge transfer from those high volume accounts, as well as an introductory exposure for surgeons who are thinking about it. So that has been great. There are other use cases for streaming connections, video streaming connections, into our products that I won't detail now. It's pretty neat and so prior we had started that, I was a believer, or we as a company were believers that those kinds of access, think of it as kind of surgical FaceTime or surgical Skype over a distance. That kind of access would be important to folks, and the pandemic really accelerated it.

            "name": "Jamie Samath",
            "content": "Good afternoon. While there continues to be uncertainty regarding the ongoing impact of COVID-19, given moderating COVID-19 hospitalization trends and vaccination progress particularly in the U.S. which accounted for approximately 70% of our 2020 procedures, we are reestablishing our financial guidance. In providing this guidance, we know that there are emerging supply constraints in our supply chain, for example, in the semiconductor industry. The outlook we are providing does not reflect any potential significant disruption or additional costs related to the supply constraints. Our financial outlook for 2021 is as follows. Starting with procedures, total 2020 da Vinci procedures grew approximately 1% to roughly 1,243,000 procedures performed worldwide. For 2021, we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 22% to 26%. We expect 2021 procedure growth to continue to be driven by U.S. general surgery and procedures outside the United States where we were at earlier stages of adoption. The high end of the range assumes that COVID cases and their impact on da Vinci procedures to continue to decline throughout the year, the vaccine rollouts continue at the level currently expected by governments around the world and that recovery of patient backlogs will progress. Modeling quarterly results is difficult, given the impact that COVID had on 2020 procedures. Therefore, with respect to seasonality, we expect similar quarterly patterns to 2019. With respect to capital, system placements are generally driven by procedure demand, prompting hospitals to establish or expand robotic system capacity. System placement demand is also the result of customers standardizing our fourth generation technology through trade-ins. Capital sales can vary substantially from period to period based upon many factors, including government healthcare policies, hospital capital spending cycles, reimbursement and government quotas, product cycles, economic cycles and competitive factors. Within this framework, we expect 2021 capital placements to generally be driven by procedures and the adequacy of existing capacity in the installed base. During the first quarter of 2021, 43% of system shifts were under operating leases. We expect that the proportion of systems placed under operating leases will vary from quarter-to-quarter and could continue to trend up in the future. Turning to gross profit, our full year 2020 pro forma gross profit margin was 68.4%, reflecting the impact of fixed -- higher fixed overhead costs relative to revenue, higher excess and obsolete inventory charges and the customer relief program that was implemented in the second quarter of 2020. Our full year 2019 pro forma gross profit margin was 71.7%. In 2021, we expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71% of revenue. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix, the impact of current cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies and competitive pricing pressure. With respect to operating expenses, in 2019, our pro forma operating expenses grew 27%, and in 2020, given the impact of the pandemic they grew 3%. In 2021, we expect pro forma full-year operating expense growth to be between 18% and 22%, reflecting increases in investments in our digital ecosystem, Ion, SP, OUS expansion, higher regulatory-related costs and infrastructure investments to allow us to scale. 2021 spending also expected to be impacted by a return over the course of the year to higher rates of travel, increased customer training and a greater proportion of marketing events being held in-person and by a variable compensation. We expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $450 million and $470 million in 2021, compared to $396 million in 2020. We expect pro forma other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $45 million and $55 million in 2021, reflecting lower interest rates relative to 2020. With regard to income tax, in 2020, our pro forma income tax rate was 22.5%. As we look forward, we estimate our 2021 pro forma tax rate to be between 20% and 21% of pretax income. Our 2021 outlook for the pro forma tax rate does not reflect any potential change in U.S. tax rates. That concludes our prepared comments and we will now open the call to your questions. Yeah. So maybe I will start with -- this is Jamie. I will start with the low end of the procedure guidance. So we considered three factors in the low end. We see the possibility of extended impact of COVID in certain OUS geographies, with slower vaccine rollouts and resurgences in some of these geographies. We see that in parts of Europe currently. Secondly, we embedded in the lower end of the procedure guidance a slower recovery of diagnostic pipelines that have been impacted during the pandemic. And then the third item in the low end of the guidance is the possibility of regionalized resurgence of COVID in the U.S. as we race towards the rollout of vaccines and ultimately at some point achieve herd immunity in the U.S. With respect to the backlog, the backlog has accumulated really for three factors, lower diagnostic pipelines, deferred elective surgery as hospital systems get inundated with COVID cases and patient reluctance to undergo surgery during COVID resurgences. These subcomponents we think get recovered over different periods of time. The backlog is actually constantly netting between increases and recovery. So the total accumulated backlog is difficult to predict. The rate of recovery is also difficult to predict, but we expect it to go through into 2022. And so -- the 2021 procedure guidance that we provided reflects our best estimate of the range of the impact of backlog in the year. Yeah. We have -- so we have some market data actually for the U.S. What we see is -- and that's through February 2021, what we see is most of the diagnostic tests, PSA testing, for example, CT scans and lung cancer. We see that those have been suppressed during this period. So we haven't seen them start to recover at least in the data that we have seen so far. And we see that reasonably correlated to the associated procedures, so PSA dVP has been relatively weak during that period, so as lobectomy. So so far we haven't seen any evidence of a recovery in diagnostic testing at least in the U.S."

            "content": "Good afternoon. I would describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted to our website. Key business metrics for the first quarter were as follows. First quarter 2021 procedures increased approximately 16% compared with the first quarter of 2020, was approximately the same as last quarter. On a day adjusted basis, procedures grew 18% year-over-year. First quarter system placements of 298 systems increased 26%, compared with 237 systems for the first quarter of 2020 and decreased 9%, compared with 326 systems last quarter. We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems over the last year by 8% to approximately 6,142 systems. This growth rate compares with 11% last year and 7% last quarter. Utilization of clinical systems in the field measured by procedures per system increased approximately 8%, compared with last year and decreased 2% compared with last quarter. The impact of COVID on da Vinci procedures varied by region. In the U.S., COVID resurgence that affected procedures later in the fourth quarter continued well into January. Then, as COVID subsided, procedures experienced a steady improvement through February and March. In Europe, the spread of COVID varied regionally and procedure growth rates were mixed, with strength in France and a year-over-year decline in the U.K. While there have been COVID hotspots within some of our Asia-Pacific markets, they tended to be isolated, and in general, procedures performed well. China growth was far higher than other regions, reflecting the severity of the COVID impact on China in the first quarter of last year and the additional system installations over the past year. Philip will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call. Despite the fact that hospitals are better equipped to handle COVID patients today compared with the outset of the pandemic, resurgences of COVID-19 and its variants like those currently being experienced in parts of Europe and U.S. have challenged hospital care capabilities and have negatively impacted da Vinci procedures. In addition, delays in diagnosis and treatment of underlying conditions have continued to negatively impact da Vinci procedures. While there is a backlog of patients, it is unpredictable when those patients will ultimately seek diagnosis and treatment, and whether they will be treated with surgery. Jamie will be providing procedure guidance later in this call. That guidance is based on our experience in the first quarter and the pace at which vaccines have been and are forecasted to be rolled out. Changes in the spread of COVID and its variants in the pace of vaccine rollouts could significantly impact our guidance. Moving on to capital placements, placements in the quarter reflected procedure growth, hospitals purchasing systems in preparation for a post-pandemic environment and hospitals upgrading in order to access or standardize on fourth-generation capabilities. First quarter capital placements exceeded our expectations. We believe that generally COVID has had less of an impact on hospital capital spending capacity and that customers recognize that da Vinci surgery meets their quadruple aim objectives better than other surgical approaches. Looking forward, we see the following capital revenue dynamics. Procedure growth drives capital purchases in many of our markets, to the extent that COVID impacts procedures, it will also impact capital purchases. Leasing and alternative financing arrangements have enabled customer's access to capital. We believe leasing will increase as a percentage of sales over time, which will result in a deferral of otherwise current revenue into future periods. The trade-in cycle has been a tailwind to system placements. However, as the installed base of older generation product declines, the number of trade-ins will decline. Macroeconomic conditions created by COVID could regionally impact hospital capital spending and as we face competition in various markets, we may experience longer selling cycles and price pressures. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. Total first quarter revenue was $1.292 billion, representing an 18% increase from last year and a 3% decrease from last quarter. First quarter revenue growth reflected procedure growth and higher than expected system placements. Leasing represented 43% of current quarter placements, compared with 32% last year and 37% last quarter. Leasing as a percentage of total sales has and will continue to fluctuate with core -- with customer and geographic mix. However, given hospital like -- we anticipate more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than reflected in historical run rates. 44% of systems placed in the first quarter involve trade-ins, which is lower than the 57% last year and the 49% last quarter. Trade-in activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict. First quarter system average selling prices increased to $1.65 million from $1.44 million last year and $1.43 million in the fourth quarter. The increase relative to last year reflects a higher mix of systems placed in China and our direct markets relative to our indirect markets, a higher mix of dual console systems and the lower proportion of trade-in transactions. The increase relative to last quarter reflects a higher mix of dual consoles and a lower proportion of trade-in transactions. We recognized $19 million of lease buyout revenue in the first quarter, compared with $12 million last year and $14 million last quarter. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure for the first quarter of $1,950 decreased compared with $1,990 per procedure for the first quarter of last year and $2,060 per procedure in the fourth quarter of 2020. Extended Use Instruments were introduced in the U.S. and Europe in the fourth quarter. While we saw increased usage of Extended Use Instruments in these markets, full adoption will occur over the next few quarters as customer's burn off lower use product. In addition, we saw customers begin to adjust their instrument buying patterns to reduce their inventory levels to reflect the additional uses per instrument. Increased usage of Extended Use Instruments and customer buying patterns are the primary reasons for the decrease in instrument and accessory revenue per procedure in the first quarter relative to prior quarters. We expect this trend to continue over the next few quarters. While we expect price elasticity associated with Extended Use Instruments, to enable greater penetration into available markets, that benefit is delayed by COVID and otherwise will take time. 6% of the systems placed in the first quarter were SP systems, reflecting a continued measured rollout of SP. Our installed base of SP systems is now 75, eight in Korea and 67 in the U.S. Our rollout of the SP surgical system continues to be measured, putting systems in the hands of experienced da Vinci users, while we pursue additional indications and optimize training pathways in our supply chain. We expect to initiate first cases associated with the U.S. colorectal trial in the next few months. We placed 14 Ion systems in the quarter, bringing the installed base to 50 systems. Ion system placements and procedures are excluded from our overall system and procedure counts. The supply issues we called out last quarter had less of an impact on Ion placements and procedures this quarter. We expect to have resolved those supply issues this quarter. Our rollout of Ion will continue to be measured while we optimize training pathways in our supply chain. Procedures under the PRECISE study are expected to complete this quarter. Outside of the U.S., we placed 108 systems in the first quarter, compared with 55 in the first quarter of 2020 and 130 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 59 into Europe, eight into Japan and 23 into China, compared with 25 into Europe, 10 into Japan and nine into China in the first quarter of 2020. 22 systems -- 22 of the 59 systems placed in Europe this quarter were in the U.K. Placements in many markets like the U.K. can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter. While we were pleased with the performance of the U.K. team, we do not anticipate this level of placements in the U.K. in future quarters Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the first quarter of 2020 was 71.8%, compared with 69.7% for both the first and fourth quarters of 2020. The first and fourth quarters of 2020 included higher period costs associated with lower production and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges. In addition, the first quarter of 2021 reflected leveraging fixed costs over higher production levels. Product and customer mix fluctuate quarter to quarter, which can cause fluctuations in gross margins. In addition, if revenues are pressured by COVID-19, production levels may operate at below normal levels, which may result in higher labor costs and under absorbed overhead and reduced product margins. COVID has impacted global supplies of semiconductors and other materials used in our products. While we carry safety stocks of critical components and are otherwise working to secure supply necessary to ensure fulfillment of customer demand, global shortages could result in higher production costs or production delays. Pro forma operating expenses increased 5% compared with the first quarter of 2020 and increased 2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. The fourth quarter of 2020 included a $25 million contribution to the Intuitive Foundation, while there were no contributions in the first quarters of 2021 and 2020. The increase compared to the prior year reflects costs associated with higher headcount and increased variable compensation, partially offset by lower spending in areas impacted by COVID. First quarter spending was below our expectations for the reasons outlined by Gary in his opening remarks. Looking to the remainder of the year, we expect spending impacted by COVID-19 including clinical development, in-person training, marketing events and travel costs to increase as COVID's impacts decrease and spending deferred due to COVID and other timing matters to increase. Jamie will provide spend guidance later in this call. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 20% meeting our expectations. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of one-time items. Our pro forma 2020 -- our first quarter 2020 pro forma net income was $427 million or $3.52 per share, compared with $323 million or $2.69 per share for the first quarter of 2020 and $434 million or $3.58 per share for last quarter. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $426 million or $3.51 per share for the first quarter of 2021, compared with GAAP net income of $314 million or $2.62 per share for the first quarter of 2020 and GAAP net income of $365 million or $3.02 per share for last quarter. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock award, employee stock-based compensation and IP charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition-related items and legal settlements. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 also included pretax gains of $4.7 million and $14.3 million on our investments in private companies resulting from our purchases of certain technologies. The EPS impact of these gains net of tax was $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.09 per share in the first quarter. These gains are excluded from our pro forma results. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.2 billion, compared with $6.9 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase in cash in the first quarter primarily reflected cash from operations and stock exercises. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Philip who will go over procedure performance. Yeah. Sure. So we introduced Extended Use Instruments into Europe and into the U.S. in Q4. We did see increased usage of Extended Use Instruments. They still have some level of inventory of shorter life used instruments and they are burning that off. We also had commented last quarter that we saw stocking orders of Extended Use Instruments and we are seeing some adjustment of their buying patterns to recognize the increased number of uses per instrument. So, this quarter, as I called out, instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was lower than last quarter and that primarily reflects those factors, like the turn of use of Extended Instruments and adjustments of inventory buying patterns. I don't think it's exhausted the whole impact and 130 if you go back to our previous script, you see that we said that had you implemented this in 2019, it would have affected total revenue by about $150 million to $170 million or about 7% of INA per procedure and we have only seen a part of that so far. When the rest of it will hit is questionable. It will roll out over time as they continue to use those instruments and as we roll it out to other countries. I think that was great color. I think the only other thing I would add is the, we have talked about in the past that a lot of the procedures we are performing are urologic and we are in the process in certain countries of pivoting. And we are starting to see some adoption in GYN and general surgeries in some countries but we still have work to do. Yeah. I think you should see sequentially operating expenses generally increase across the rest of the year. It's really going to be a function of the extent to which COVID continues to impact our ability to travel, accelerate customer training and hold marketing events in person. But generally, I would expect it to radically increase across the balance of the year. Well, I give you a few different dynamics to consider as we go forward. It's always hard to project out based on one quarter results. I guess we have had a couple quarters that have been decent. Is there -- was there -- I think part of your question was, is there pent-up spending? I would just say, I don't know if it was pent-up spending, but I would say, that clearly the hospitals had more capital to spend than we had anticipated. And as a -- and what's really driving them, their spending on da Vinci procedure -- on da Vinci capital is procedure growth. Procedure growth is the number one thing that drives capital. But also the trade-in cycle and the desire to access fourth generation product, including the Extended Use Instruments we mentioned earlier. And then, finally, I think that, you also have them getting ready for the post-pandemic environment and just a general recognition that da Vinci Surgery meets their quadruple aim objectives better than other approaches now."

And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. And with that, I will turn it over to Gary.\nGary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. The fundamentals of our business were healthy in Q4 and for the full year 2022. Procedure growth for the full year approached pre-pandemic levels. Installed base growth was solid, and customers concurrently increase utilization of existing systems. Our investments in product development extended our multi-port, single-port and flexible robotics ecosystems through new instruments, accessories, digital products and indication expansions. Finally, the fine work of our operations teams and supply partners largely mitigated the supply chain challenges that persisted through the year. Turning first to procedures. We saw 18% procedure growth for the quarter and the full year. Areas of strength included general surgery in the United States, particularly benign procedures such as bariatric surgery, cholecystectomy and hernia repair. Colon and rectal procedure growth also continued. Strong growth beyond urology outside the US was accretive to our global performance. We attribute this diversification to the value of our ecosystems and our strategic investments in organization, clinical trials, data products and market access. Regionally, the United States, Japan, Europe and India stood out in the quarter and year. Procedure growth in China was hampered by the COVID wave in Q4, with procedures progressively declining starting in November through the end of 2022. Ion procedures showed continued strength, with 218% growth in 2022 compared with 2021, and SP procedures grew 38% over the same period, with the majority of its growth coming from Korea. Global core procedure areas of urology and gynecology moved toward recovery in the year, both exceeding their three-year compound annual growth rates in 2022. On the capital front, we placed 369 systems in Q4 compared with 385 in Q4 2021. For the full year, we placed 1,264 systems compared with 1,347 in 2021. Our installed base growth rate was 12% for multiport, 149% for Ion and 22% for SP in 2022. Overall, our capital placement trends showed sustained demand for additional capacity in multiport and strong interest in expanding capacity for Ion with several hospitals now operating multiple Ion systems in their programs and variable demand for SP as we continue to pursue our additional indications. System utilization is an important predictor of future demand and utilization grew 5% for multiport in the year and 10% for Ion. Utilization was roughly flat for SP over the year, however, utilization increased by 9% in Q4 measured year-over-year as our organization incorporated learnings. Touching on our finances, revenue grew 9% in 2022. Revenue was impacted by the strength of the dollar in the year and the decline of the trade-in population of third-generation multiport systems. Our expenses landed at the higher end of our spend guidance reflecting continued R&D investments that support the growth of our platforms and digital products, expansion of our manufacturing and commercial capabilities, and capital amortization driven by expansion of our global footprint. Structurally, we have been increasing our own capital expenditures as we continue to build the company to supply the globe at industrial scale. This is an important investment as several procedures using our systems have become the standard of care in several countries. We have been vertically integrating key technologies to develop a more robust supply chain and bring important products to market at attractive price points. These investments include increased ownership of our imaging pipelines, strategic instrument and accessory technologies, and software and digital products that allow us to serve our customers. The investments make our business more capital-intensive than years past, in support of industrial dependability, a more robust supply chain, and lower product costs. I'd also like to take a moment to walk through our platform investments. Intuitive starts with the end in mind. Coordinating our efforts to enable our customers' pursuit of the quadruple aim in specific procedures, for example, those in general surgery. We design all our systems to allow for the addition of new functionality over time. For our multiport platform, this design philosophy has enabled us to continuously strengthen our fourth generation da Vinci Xi by adding new regulatory clearances, a new model with the da Vinci X, new instruments and accessories, new imaging capabilities, and new software products. These products include our stapling lot of instruments as well as our advanced energy instruments, which contributed approximately $890 million in revenue in 2022 with revenue growth of 18% in the year and are a key enabler of the general surgery growth discussed a minute ago. We added 65 representative clinical procedure indications in the United States to our fourth-generation multiport platform since its launch. Our multiport indications now spans six surgical categories and total over 70 procedure indications for multiport platforms in the United States today. We routinely improve our platform operating systems with roughly 10 significant fourth-generation OS releases since launch and dozens of smaller software upgrades. We launched our next-generation Xi visualization, Endoscope Plus, and have been integrating digital products, including virtual reality training Intuitive Hub and the My Intuitive app. We expect to launch additional Gen 4 compatible products and operating system software this year. Concurrently, we invest in new generations of our multiport platform that bring new and significantly enhanced capabilities. For our multi-port system development programs, we prioritize as follows. Our highest priority is the improvement of core surgical capability targeting improved patient outcomes, often through innovation in robot and instrument precision, imaging and sensing while focusing on dependability and product quality. Next, we designed to improve usability, care team's skill acquisition and analytic power, including digital products for the operating room, personalized learning for care teams and efficiency analysis and services for surgical programs. Next, we design platforms and their ecosystems that can lower the total cost to treat per patient episode. And finally, we designed with the flexibility to add future capability to systems post launch. Given the time required to design and validate new architectures at any given moment, we're typically developing more than one system architecture beyond that in the market. In the current global regulatory environment, core technology changes often require human clinical trials and substantial review. These are multiyear investment cycles, and we're making good progress. As we start this year, we do not currently expect a new multi-port system launch in 2023. Turning to Ion. Adoption has been healthy based on its ability to meet an unmet clinical need in lung biopsy. We're focused on improving the manufacturability, cost and robustness of iron products to support its rapid growth in the US. We have also submitted a regulatory dossier for a review in Europe, Korea and in China's green channel. We expect clearance in Europe in 2023. We don't have a firm forecast on the time for Ion clearance in China at this time given pandemic related adjustments ongoing in the Chinese healthcare system. Ion is also a platform with strong opportunities for future clinical applications. We're conducting advanced development and clinical research to extend Ion to other indications in the lung. While our Ion flexible robotics offers an opportunity to provide value in the body outside the lung, our focus is on completing what we started for pulmonologists and thoracic surgeons. Our single-port platform, da Vinci SP, has supported strong adoption in Korea and has recently obtained PMDA clearance with broad indications in Japan. We expect first installs of SP in Japan in the coming months. Next, we plan to submit our dossier on da Vinci SP to our notified body in Europe midyear 2023. So far, customer feedback on the clinical utility for SP has been healthy with strong multi-specialty use of SP in Korea. In the United States, some indications have required prospective clinical trials, and we're currently conducting IDE trials in colorectal surgery and thoracic surgery. We're pursuing additional indications for SP beyond these two, and we'll share more information on these indications in 2023 as the requirements for our regulatory pathway for them are established. We're continuing to invest significant resources in R&D, where the portfolio we have under development is positioned to support leadership in existing categories and expansion into new ones. Our capital investments will increase to support supply chain robustness, product cost reduction and global industrial scale. On the SG&A front, we are making some foundational investments, and we'll turn to pursue leverage in enabling functions. Recognizing economic conditions for 2023 are hard to forecast, we're targeting a deceleration of fixed cost growth rate in 2023 relative to 2022. We expect pro forma operating margins to fluctuate in the next several quarters and then improve over the mid-term. In closing, our priorities for 2023 are as follows; first, increased adoption and focused procedures defined by country through outstanding training, commercial and market access execution; second, pursuit of expanded indications and launches for our new platforms; third, excellent performance in the continuity of supply, product quality and services provision as we emerge from pandemic stresses; and finally, pursuit of increased productivity and our functions that benefit from scale. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie, who will take you through our finances in greater detail.\nJamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Q4 and 2022 revenue and procedures are in line with our preliminary press release of January 11. I will briefly review full year 2022 performance before describing our Q4 results in greater detail. 2022 procedures grew by 18% as compared to 2021, or 15% on a three-year compound annual growth rate basis. During the year, we placed 1,264 systems at customers, down 6% year-over-year, driven by a decline in trading volumes of 165 systems due to the declining population of SIs in the field. Recurring revenue, which is correlated to ongoing use of our products represented 79% of total revenue and grew 15% over the prior year. Total revenue of $6.2 billion increased 9% year-over-year and grew approximately 12% on a constant currency basis. Pro forma operating margin was 35% of revenue and reflected the impact of several headwinds, FX, supply chain challenges and inflation together adversely impacted 2022 pro forma operating margin by approximately 1 percentage point. During the year, we repurchased $2.6 billion of our stock or approximately 11.2 million shares, and we have a remaining authorization to repurchase our shares of $1.5 billion. Turning to Q4. With respect to capital performance, we placed 369 systems, 4% lower than the 385 systems we placed in the fourth quarter of last year. There were 110 trading transactions in the quarter, as compared to 117 last year. 51 of the 110 trading transactions were with OUS customers, higher than recent trends primarily driven by customers in Japan and Brazil. As of the end of Q4, there were approximately 620 SIs remaining in the installed base, of which 134 are in the US. Given the continuing decline of older generation systems in the field, we expect trading volumes to decline significantly in 2023. Q4 revenue was $1.66 billion, an increase of 7% from last year. On a constant currency basis, fourth quarter revenue grew approximately 10%. For full year 2022, revenue denominated in non-USD currencies represented 24% of total revenue. The US dollar has weakened recently, and as a result, on a revenue-weighted basis, using current rates, the US dollar is approximately 100 basis points stronger than the average rates realized in 2022. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: in the US we placed 181 systems in the fourth quarter, lower than the 235 systems we placed last year, reflecting cautious capital spending by customers, given the macroeconomic environment and a decline of 21 systems associated with trade-in transactions. Average system utilization in the US increased by 6%, reaching an all-time high. Outside the US we placed 188 systems in Q4 compared with 150 systems last year. Current quarter system placements included 70 into Europe, 51 into Japan, and 14 into China compared with 63 into Europe, 37 into Japan, and 14 into China in the fourth quarter of 2021. As of the end of 2022, there were 34 systems remaining under the current quota in China. There are now four local competitors that are registered in China and they're active in tenders under the existing quota. Delays in the granting of a new quota in China will constrain our ability to further grow the installed base and limit capacity for procedure growth. Leasing represented 42% of Q4 placements compared with 37% last quarter and last year. The higher lease mix was primarily driven by the mix of customers in the US who prefer to lease and reflected in part an increase in placements acquired under usage-based arrangements. While leasing will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time. Q4 system average selling prices were $1.43 million as compared to $1.45 million last year. System ASPs were negatively impacted by FX, partially offset by a favorable regional mix and a higher mix of Xi jewel placements. We recognized $17 million of lease buyout revenue in the fourth quarter compared with $17 million last quarter and $26 million in Q4 of 2021. da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,820 compared with approximately $1,800 last quarter and $1,940 last year. On a year-over-year basis, FX negatively impacted I&A per procedure by approximately $50 and customer ordering patterns had a negative impact of approximately $40 per procedure as customers, particularly in the US and China, reduced their inventory levels. Turning to our Ion platform. In 2022, we tripled procedures to just over 23,000 and double system placements to 192 as compared to 2021. In Q4, we placed 67 Ion systems as compared to 31 in Q4 of 2021. The installed base of Ion systems is now 321 systems, of which 132 are under operating lease arrangements. Fourth quarter Ion procedures of approximately 7,900 increased 169% as compared to last year. Leveraging previous investments we have made in our da Vinci ecosystem, during the quarter, we commenced the launch of My Intuitive app for Ion users, providing them real-time access and insights to their Ion usage statistics. Moving on to the rest of the P&L, pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2022 was 68.2% compared with 70.1% for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 69.8% last quarter. As a reminder, last quarter's gross margin included a one-time benefit of approximately 50 basis points relating to the favorable conclusion of certain indirect tax matters. Pro forma gross margin was lower than last year, primarily due to increased fixed costs relative to revenue, the stronger US dollar and higher component pricing. The supply chain environment was challenging in Q4 and indicators of supply and inventory health did not improve as compared to last quarter. Higher fixed costs relative to revenue reflect a combination of manufacturing related inefficiencies given the environment and investments for future growth. Fourth quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 19% compared with last year, driven by increased headcount, higher travel costs, increased customer training activities and higher R&D related project costs. Fourth quarter 2021 operating expenses included a $30 million contribution to the Intuitive Foundation, which can support their efforts for the next couple of years and did not repeat in 2022. The pace at which we are increasing headcount continued to moderate in Q4 with net additions of about 330 employees in the quarter compared to a net increase of approximately 530 employees last quarter. More than half of the employees we added in Q4 were production staff in our instrument factory in Mexico to support procedure growth. While we are slowing our hiring pace and pursuing leverage in our enabling functions, we are planning for balanced growth in operating expenses in 2023 given the opportunity to advance our next-generation robotics capabilities and the relatively earlier stage of our investments in Ion, SP and digital. In 2023, we expect a significant increase in expenses related to clinical trials. Brian will provide our outlook for operating expenses later in this call. As we look forward to our growth plans over the next several years, we are planning to make significant capital expenditures. Capital expenditures for 2022 were $532 million, and we expect 2023 capital expenditures in a range of $800 million to $1 billion, of which approximately two-thirds will be for facilities to expand our manufacturing capacity. Our manufacturing investment plans include advanced proprietary facilities for production of new products and the Ion platform in California and da Vinci systems in Georgia. Internationally, we are increasing our product development capacity in Germany, building a new low-cost endoscope manufacturing facility in Bulgaria and establishing manufacturing capacity for domestic Xi production in China. We will also be expanding the footprint of our high-volume, low-cost instrument site in Mexico to support procedure growth across all of our platforms. These investments allow us to consolidate our manufacturing into larger centralized hubs, such as our headquarter campus in Sunnyvale, California and our East Coast hub just outside of Atlanta, while we will co-locate surgeon training, technology development and manufacturing capacity. These are multiyear investments. And as a result, we expect depreciation expense to increase in 2023 and increase more significantly in 2024. Pro forma other income was $21.8 million for Q4, higher than $7.2 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to lower foreign exchange losses from remeasurement of the balance sheet and higher interest income. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 18.2%, lower than prior quarters, primarily as a result of a more favorable geographical earnings mix and a discrete tax benefit of $7 million associated with the foreign tax matter. Fourth quarter 2022 pro forma net income was $439 million, or $1.23 per share compared with $473 million or $1.29 per share for the fourth quarter of last year. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $325 million or $0.91 per share for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared with GAAP net income of $381 million or $1.04 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, litigation charges and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended the year with cash and investments of $6.7 billion compared with $7.4 billion at the end of Q3. The sequential reduction in cash and investments reflected share repurchases of $1 billion and capital expenditures, partially offset by cash from operating activities. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian, who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our outlook for 2023.\nBrian King: Thank you, Jamie. Overall procedure growth for the full year 2022 was 18% and increased 15% on a three-year compound annual growth basis. Overall procedure growth was comprised of 16% growth in the US and 22% growth outside of the US. In the US, fourth quarter 2022 procedures grew 18% year-over-year, compared to 16% for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 18% last quarter. The US procedure growth rate reflected a favorable comparison to the quarter a year ago, given the impact of the Omicron variant in December of last year. On a three-year compound annual growth basis, US procedure growth was 13%. Outside of the US, fourth quarter procedure volume grew approximately 18% year-over-year, compared to 28% for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 24% last quarter. On a three-year compound annual growth basis, procedure growth was 19%. Turning to Europe. Procedure growth in the quarter was led by strong growth in UK, Germany and Italy. In the regions noted, procedure growth outside of urology was strong in general surgery and gynecology categories. Specifically in the UK, we experienced strong early-stage growth in colorectal surgery and continued strong growth in hysterectomy. Turning to Asia. Growth outside of China continued to be solid, with notable strength in capital and procedure growth in Japan. Procedure growth in Korea was healthy and India and Taiwan continue to experience strong early-stage growth. In Japan, as Jamie noted earlier, 51 systems were placed in the country, the most in a single quarter. Overall procedure growth in Japan for the quarter was led by general surgery, with strong early stage growth in colon resection and hysterectomy and also in urology with newly reimbursed nephrectomy procedures. In China, midway through the fourth quarter, we observed the decline in procedures. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw a significant decline in procedure volume as hospitals were dealing with increase in COVID cases once the Zero-COVID policy was removed. As a result, China procedures experienced a modest year-over-year decline in Q4. Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. While still in the early stages of adoption in the US, robotic-assisted bariatric surgery has been one of the fastest-growing procedures in general surgery for Intuitive. In October 2022, the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery and International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders released major updates to the 1991 National Institute of Health guidelines that recommended lowering the BMI for metabolic and bariatric surgery, or MBS, from 40 to 35, regardless of the presence, absence or severity of comorbidities. These guidelines note that, 'MBS is now preferably performed using minimally invasive surgical approaches, laparoscopical robotic'. And that 'MBS is the most effective evidence-based treatment for obesity across all BMI classes.' In another bariatric analysis, Dr. Wayne Barley from St. Luke's University Hospital in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, recently published a descriptive analysis from the NBA SIP database identifying the proportion of MBS procedures in the US performed between 2015 and 2020. Using a robotic or laparoscopic approach and found up to a threefold difference in the proportion of various robotic-assisted MBS cases per year. We believe our investments in advanced instruments and surgeon training are helping to drive adoption of robotic-assisted surgery in bariatrics. We look forward to continuing to support surgeons and their care teams as they provide high-quality robotic minimally invasive care for an even greater portion of the population under the new guidelines. A recent rectal cancer study by Dr. Fang from Fudan University in Shanghai and on behalf of the RealStudy Group, published short-term outcomes from a multicenter randomized controlled trial in the Lancet. This study impaired robotic-assisted and laparoscopic approaches performed by experienced surgeons for middle and low rectal cancer across 11 hospitals in China, with approximately 580 cases included in each approach. With respect to very operative outcomes, the rate of patients with a positive circumferential margin was 3.2% lower in the robotic-assisted group as well as a 3.6% higher rate of complete macroscopic resection. Furthermore, patient laparoscopic arm experienced a 2.2% higher rate of conversion to open. A 3.3% higher rate of intraoperative complications was also reported in the laparoscopic group. Notably, 5.8% less abdominal perineal resections were performed in the robotic group. Postoperatively, patients in the robotic-assisted arm also had a faster gastrointestinal recovery postoperatively as well as a one-day shorter length of stay an approximately 7% lower rate of postoperative complications with the Clavien-Dindo of 2 or higher. In summary, the authors concluded that short-term outcomes suggests that for middle and low rectal cancer, Robotic surgery by experienced surgeons resulted in better quality resection than conventional laparoscopic surgery with less surgical trauma and better postoperative recovery. I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2023. Starting with procedures. For 2023, we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 12% to 16%. The low end of the range assumes continued choppiness with COVID hospitalizations and staffing pressure at hospitals globally throughout the year. In addition, it assumes ongoing staffing, significant challenges with COVID in China and uncertainty with the timing of the new capital quota. At the high end of the range, we assume no new significant impact from COVID throughout 2023, and assume continued growth in general surgery in the US and diversified growth beyond urology outside of the US. The range does not reflect significant material, supply chain disruptions or hospital capacity constraints similar to what we experienced at the start of the pandemic. Beyond the uncertainty with COVID in China, we expect similar seasonal timing of procedures in 2023 as we have experienced before the pandemic, with the first quarter being the seasonally weakest quarter as patient deductibles are reset. With respect to revenue, as we have mentioned previously, capital sales are ultimately driven by procedure demand, catalyzing hospitals to establish or expand robotic system capacity. Capital sales can vary substantially from period to period based upon many factors, including national health care policies, hospital capital spending cycles, reimbursement and government quotas, product cycles, economic cycles and competitive factors. Turning to gross profit. Our full year 2022 pro forma gross profit margin was 69.2%. In 2023, we expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within 68% and 69% of net revenue. The lower estimate of pro forma gross profit margin in 2023 reflects the impact of higher infrastructure investment costs, higher supply chain costs, and a greater mix of new products, in particular, from our Ion platform. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix, procedure mix and volumes, fluctuations in foreign currency rates and the potential impact of competitive pricing. Turning to operating expenses. In 2022, our pro forma operating expenses grew 23%. In 2023, we expect pro forma operating expense growth to be between 9% and 13%. The operating expense growth reflects investments to advance our platform capabilities, digital products, along with continued expansion into markets outside of the US and spending to support regulatory clearances and clinical trials. We expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $610 million to $640 million in 2023. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $140 million and $160 million in 2023. With regard to income tax, in 2022, our pro forma income tax rate was 21.8%. As we look forward, we estimate our 2023 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pre-tax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Robbie Marcus, representing JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Appreciate it. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe to start, the OpEx guide came in a lot better than expected, but balance that with taking it longer to get through the regulatory cycles and bring to market with a new robot. So maybe you could talk about what exactly is taking longer? Are there certain trials that maybe had to be done in the past that are now being required? And is this global regulatory lengthening of time, or are there specific markets that are taking longer to come with a new robot?\nGary Guthart: All right. Thanks, Robbie. I think, we've been sharing with you over several quarters now. In terms of new technologies and new indications, we've seen in many of the core markets, not every single one, but many of them, additional data requirements. That changed probably four years ago, but has been playing all the way through. So it's not so much that the environment has changed over that period, just the implications of that. And you see that in things like SP, our SP trials, five or six years ago would have come to market differently and they're requiring some prospective human clinical work. That's not unique to SP. It really has to do with what the underlying technologies are and what new indications might be. So I think that is playing through relative to prior iterations of systems and features. That's true. Certainly in the United States, we've seen with the European regulatory changes over the years, increased data requirements in Europe and then it kind of varies by country from there. In terms of OpEx, perhaps I'll let you ask a follow-up question for Jamie on that one.\nRobbie Marcus: Yes. And Jamie, maybe to follow up on the OpEx and I'll tie in CapEx here, because there is a good investment there for the future. Maybe talk to where you're seeing the decrease in OpEx, SG&A versus R&D? And where the lower spending growth rate year-over-year is coming from? Thanks.\nJamie Samath: Yes. It's fair, Robbie, that we're investing differentially across the areas of investment and the functions within the company. Our priorities for 2023 with respect to operating expenses to drive growth in the areas of focus, and we're being focused there. We're looking to execute some opportunities to expand markets by gaining additional clinical indications and geographical clearances. And obviously, we want to advance our technology. Within SG&A, what you see in subsets of the G&A functions is us looking to pursue leverage as we've described. And generally, from an R&D perspective, there are some investments that, as Gary has previously referenced were sequencing, and that's partly motivated by the way in which headcount has expanded over, let's say, the last year or two, and we've moderated our headcount growth as described, and that gives us the opportunity to absorb some of that headcount. So there's differential investment within SG&A and R&D. If I look at R&D and SG&A kind of in aggregate, they're likely to grow at relatively similar rates next year.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. I appreciate you taking the questions.\nOperator: Then we'll go to the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please, go ahead.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. One, on your -- Gary, your new system comments and one on the industrial scale comments that you made today at JPMorgan. So you talked about core technology changes often requiring the clinical trials and that you won't launch a multi-port system in 2023. So Gary, my question is A, will you start a clinical trial and a new system in 2023; and B, if you did start a clinical trial, would you disclose that publicly even if the trial were outside the US, say, in a developing market?\nGary Guthart: Across our systems, we are doing trials in all sorts of places for all sorts of reasons, whether it's SPI or otherwise. And -- so the answer there is we have some places where those are publicly disclosed per normal rules. For competitive reasons, we don't try to detail them too much, and that's the position we'll take going forward.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good. Fair enough. And Gary, you talked a lot about -- you used the term industrial scale a lot recently. What does that mean exactly? And what are the implications for Intuitive financially? Thank you.\nGary Guthart: I'll take what does it mean and I'll ask Jamie to help me on detailing on the finance side. One of the things that's going on is that we are becoming well integrated into many surgical practices in several countries. I think that's a great opportunity for us and a serious responsibility. As we've seen in the last couple of years with regard to supply chain robustness and other things, making sure that -- we have supply chain stability that we want vertically integrating where we can. We have been doing that. A lot of the imaging pipeline work that we've done. We think that both gives us higher quality. It allows us to lower cost to the customer and it gives us robustness. We can plan for that robustness. That's true not only in imaging, but in some core technologies and instruments and accessories. And we think those are good long-term investments. So, that's been really positive. There's another place where our digital tools and our digital products, one of the things that's going on that I think is powerful for the company is not just product architecture, but business architecture. And what I mean by that is that our supply chain can support multiple platforms in multiple countries around the world. It can -- by that, I mean, multiport, single-port and Ion, our digital products architecture also is seamless and can integrate and support those platforms. So, that gives us a great quality advantage, it gives us a leverage capability, and allows us to lower the total cost for our customers and the cost to serve for our customers. Those things take some planning and some forward investment and it can be in core technology. For example, in digital, it can be in facilities, in manufacturing base, so we can build our products. But it's that opportunity. It's a global opportunity to help support the standard of care in multiple countries. I think that the customer advantages are quite clear and I think the cost robustness and long-term durability advantages for the company are quite clear. But that takes some play out over time. Jamie, any help you'll give?\nJamie Samath: I would just say industrial operating -- industrial scale is linked to the capital expenditure plans that we've described, the $800 million to $1 billion of investment in 2023. I'd just add the financial ROI calculations on those investments are relatively straightforward. And we think there are real advantages in having large, highly automated factories that run at scale and that's an advantage both for us and for our customers. So, the return calculations are relatively straightforward and they're essentially the incremental gross margin dollars we can drive from growth.\nLarry Biegelsen: All right. Thank you very much.\nGary Guthart: Thanks Larry.\nOperator: Next we'll go to line of Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nTravis Steed: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just curious, Gary, I mean, you mentioned no new multi-port platform in 2023, but curious how you're thinking about upgrades to Gen 4, but that's mostly just around the software upgrades you mentioned, or if we could see something more material with capability upgrades on hardware, imaging or things that bring the customer procedure down?\nGary Guthart: Yeah. We continue to add capabilities into Gen 4. We expect to do so this year as well. Some of it will be in advanced instrumentation. We are doing some nice work in our energy systems on the -- both on the hardware side and some of the software side, and we think there's some capability improvements that we're going to be developing over time around core imaging capability in Gen 4. So we continue to make progress.\nTravis Steed: Okay. But not saying if anything to come to 2023 or not on that front? And then while I have you, just any early comments on the capital funnel in 2023. I think last year, kind of, January, February time frame is when customers are evaluating budget. So I just want to make sure things seem fairly stable with the capital funnel?\nJamie Samath: On the capital funnel side, what I'd say is, given the macro inputs from customers are our sense is that they are still relatively cautious. I think there's quite a bit of uncertainty still in the macro. And while, for example, staffing shortages have improved, they're still quite a bit worse than pre-pandemic levels in terms of labor costs, vacancy rates for hospitals. So they are being careful from a financial perspective and they're cautious given macroeconomic uncertainty. I think our experiences in the second half of 2022 has been where customers are seeing nice growth in their robotics programs. da Vinci stays as a relatively high priority in terms of their capital budgets. But beyond the fact that they're cautious, I wouldn't say there's anything specific I'd highlight in terms of 2023 outlook.\nTravis Steed: All right, great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nRick Wise: Good afternoon. Hi, Gary. Starting off maybe with the new system, thank you for being so clear about your thoughts about the timing of a new system, i.e., not in 2023. But at a high level, could you talk to us about your thinking about why or why not? I mean, I know obviously, you've -- you're always -- the company -- for your entire history, you're always thinking about what's next and getting ready for it. But how are you -- is it the technology that you wanted to have isn't ready yet, or this is more about competitive positioning or the difficult external environment on capital makes you hesitant to go ahead this year. Just trying to understand your thinking about it and what that might say about the future?\nGary Guthart: Yeah. Thank you for the question. We think mostly about what can we do that changes the experience of surgery for the patient in terms of outcomes and the care teams in terms of how they deliver that set of outcomes. And what we can do in terms of technology basis, products and services and training that can help that happen. That is the primary thing. That's the thing that is front and center. And we do design studies, research, usability effort, all the things you would expect for us to make progress. And then we try to advance that as quickly as reasonably we can, given the environment that we're in. We don't do too much perfection of timing about what we think the hospital capital environment is going to be. We don't -- you can imagine somebody doing that, that is not my highest motivation. I think these things are sophisticated enough and complex enough to bring to market, that trying to time it perfectly with regard to the macroeconomic environment is not what we're really driven by. We work closely with our technologists who are, I think, spectacular. We work closely with regulatory bodies around the world to understand what their needs and requirements are. And of course, we work very closely with key customers to understand whether the things we think matter, matter. And those are the things that we really do and once we find a pathway, then we work down that pathway. I have to say that supply chain disruptions that have happened in the last three years have impacted not only production capability, but impact new product development as well, because that puts waves and ripples into what kind of items people can procure for prototypes and other forms of focus. So there's a little bit of that in there, too.\nRick Wise: Thank you. And just as a follow-up, just if you could expand further on your China comments, particularly related to new tender quota expectations. And I just want to make sure I'm understanding carefully or we're all understanding your thoughts or your embedded thoughts about procedure recovery as flow as the year unfolds? Thank you, very much.\nJamie Samath: Yes. I think what we're saying is, we saw China procedures impacted in November. That got more severe in December, has continued so far in the early part of January, and we expect, therefore, procedures in China to be at least impacted in Q1 and perhaps beyond. And I think it's difficult for us to predict, given the relatively unique situation China is in relative to the Zero-COVID policy that they have had. So we're not making any specific predictions as to when and how that might recover. Brian laid out how that's reflected in the procedure guidance that we provided. Separately, on the quota, we're in the third year again of kind of new quota period, the last two quotas have been issued in the third year. We only use that as a historical reference, nothing more. We don't have any particular insight as to when a new quota might come.\nRick Wise: Thank you, Jamie.\nOperator: And our next question will be from the line of Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Please, go ahead.\nMatt Taylor: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask one on China. You talked about the uncertainty with refreshing the quota and then some new local competitors that are competing for tenders. I wondered if you could kind of flesh that out a little bit and talk about any insight you have into when and how much the quota could be? And then, could you give us a flavor for how competitive you think the local competitors will be to compete for the tenders in China and beyond?\nJamie Samath: I would just say that, underlying demand for robotic technology in China, if you take a mid- and long-term view, is quite strong. And our experience so far has been that surgeons care about the capability and feature set of the products that they use there. Again, we don't have any particular insight with respect to timing and size of quota. We saw the last quota we received was higher than the previous one, but we have no ability to predict that it will be larger again. So we'd love to be able to give you greater clarity than that. But what's the second part of your question, Matt?\nGary Guthart: Why don't I take that one? That was a little bit about local competition and what kinds of things we're seeing. First, I think the entry of competitors in China is natural and should be expected. I think in some ways, it's probably a net positive in terms of how people think about the quota. That's more people advocating for the value of this in the market, it's probably a net positive over time, therefore, for market development also. In the near-term, early markets, we've seen this everywhere around the world with new systems entering. The very early entry is different than the middle is different than the late. And the early, there tend to be a lot of placements, a lot of things around clinical trials, a lot of things around setting up early capacity that are, in some sense, not indicative of value-based or feature-based competition, and we're going to see some of that early on. And then after that wave goes through putting your clinical trial systems out, then it starts to settle down, and you see a little bit more of what the core competitive dynamics look like. So, we're really, really in the early innings with what we're seeing in China competitors. I expect them to be active and assertive.\nMatt Taylor: Okay, clear. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Next we'll go to line of Anthony Petrone, representing the Mizuho Group. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Petrone: Thanks. One, on overall pricing as it relates to just the update here on the multiport system and then a follow-up on procedure volumes, specifically in the US. On pricing, just trying to understand the dynamics here. We have higher input costs as it relates to R&D, there's inflation, and there's a heavy CapEx cycle. So, you can sort of, on the one hand, push that through the higher pricing for NextGen robot. But on the other side, we have, obviously, hospitals somewhat constrained here and Intuitive now has a licensing model. So, when we think about an elongated regulatory cycle, how does that influence the pricing strategy on the next-gen robot? And then just quickly on procedures, the lower BMI threshold, the new guideline, 40 to 35, it seems like a big deal. Is that contemplated in the 12% to 16% procedure guidance? Thanks.\nJamie Samath: Just with respect to pricing, I'll only comment on current products in the portfolio, as you described. What we're seeing is core costs in our supply chain, the prices we pay our suppliers, the wage costs we pay our production staff. They have gone up, and that looks sticky. We have a routine process we use to monitor pricing on an ongoing basis. We'll continue that process. There's nothing that we would highlight at this point with respect to any specific decisions that we've made relative to pricing, but it's something that we're monitoring carefully through the existing processes that we have. With respect to your question on bariatrics and the change in BMI guidelines, I think it's really early to determine what effect, if anything, that might have in terms of the total surgical term for bariatrics. And so therefore, there's nothing reflected in the 12% to 16% guidance that we provided, and I wouldn't expect it to move that quickly. And there are -- by the way, in bariatrics, there are kind of real protocols patients have to go through with respect to a set of activities that they undertake before they become eligible for surgery, even with this change in guidelines.\nGary Guthart: Maybe I'd add a tiny bit on pricing and margin. On the pricing side, we look all the way across the total cost of ownership for our customers and make sure that's matched to value. So what's the value we bring and then what is the pricing that does that. We do that, as Jamie said, routinely, and we do it by country. It's a global look. With regard to some of the pressures on margin, whether they're inflationary or what have you, Jamie's point, some of those are sticky. We understand the levers that we have, whether it's in design or scale or production or other opportunities. And we're in pursuit of those. I don't think we're confused about where to go from here. Some of them take a little while. So some of the investments we're making, some of the automation that we talked about, some of the factory automation we\u2019re talking about those are things that give us better control of cost over time. And so I don't think we're confused or really caught off guard by some of the changes of the cost influence.\nAnthony Petrone: Thank you.\nOperator: And we have a question from the line of Shagun Singh with RBC. Please go ahead.\nShagun Singh: Great. Thank you for taking the question. Just a clarification and then one on Ion. On the new system, you said not 2023, but could we expect something in 2024, or if you have to initiate a clinical trial and depending on the size of fed et cetera, are we looking at a launch beyond the 2024 time line? Just any preliminary color would be helpful. And then you did talk about the lowering the total cost to treat, as well as expansion in different kinds of procedures. Any color beyond what you provided on the call on what, kind of, advancements or any look into what could allow you to achieve that in the new system? And then on Ion, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the expected impact of the full set of the PRECIsE two-year results. And also any progress that you're making on indication expansion and the ablation technology? Thank you for taking the questions.\nGary Guthart: Okay. Nothing further to detail on multi-port beyond what we've discussed already. With regard to opportunities for our platforms period, we have opportunities across our set. We'll -- I talked to you a little bit about what we're doing in SP already. We'll detail that more as it unfolds in 2023 as to where we see opportunity for SP to create indication expansions and to open new procedure markets for us, which we're excited about. On the Ion front, you asked a little bit about the PRECIsE tier data. I don't have anything more to detail on that. Feedback from the field we have outside of that specific study has been that it's delivering on the promise. Folks are finding that it's usable that it is supplying the outcome that they had hoped and we're seeing that reflected in the adoption. So we're pleased with that. With regard to ablation, we are -- as we said last quarter, we're just at the early innings of engaging customers in Europe and looking at the trial data. We're excited by it. I think there are several indications in the long that we'll pursue over time. We'll detail those more as we get more experience and more time. There are opportunities outside the long too, I want to be clear. We think those are interesting, but they're not areas of current focus. We really think finish the job we started. We have great engagement with pulmonologists and thoracic surgeons. We have opportunity to continue to support them to make our products ever easier, more robust and to move the margin structure where we want it to go. We're going to focus on that. And then we'll move to other indications in the lung. And then from after that, we'll have earned our opportunity to do the next step.\nGary Guthart: So thank you for the questions there. That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim: better, more predictable patient outcomes; better experiences for patients; better experiences for their care teams; and, ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better, where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly, so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation and using the AT&T Event Services. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Gary Guthart",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today. The fundamentals of our business were healthy in Q4 and for the full year 2022. Procedure growth for the full year approached pre-pandemic levels. Installed base growth was solid, and customers concurrently increase utilization of existing systems. Our investments in product development extended our multi-port, single-port and flexible robotics ecosystems through new instruments, accessories, digital products and indication expansions. Finally, the fine work of our operations teams and supply partners largely mitigated the supply chain challenges that persisted through the year. Turning first to procedures. We saw 18% procedure growth for the quarter and the full year. Areas of strength included general surgery in the United States, particularly benign procedures such as bariatric surgery, cholecystectomy and hernia repair. Colon and rectal procedure growth also continued. Strong growth beyond urology outside the US was accretive to our global performance. We attribute this diversification to the value of our ecosystems and our strategic investments in organization, clinical trials, data products and market access. Regionally, the United States, Japan, Europe and India stood out in the quarter and year. Procedure growth in China was hampered by the COVID wave in Q4, with procedures progressively declining starting in November through the end of 2022. Ion procedures showed continued strength, with 218% growth in 2022 compared with 2021, and SP procedures grew 38% over the same period, with the majority of its growth coming from Korea. Global core procedure areas of urology and gynecology moved toward recovery in the year, both exceeding their three-year compound annual growth rates in 2022. On the capital front, we placed 369 systems in Q4 compared with 385 in Q4 2021. For the full year, we placed 1,264 systems compared with 1,347 in 2021. Our installed base growth rate was 12% for multiport, 149% for Ion and 22% for SP in 2022. Overall, our capital placement trends showed sustained demand for additional capacity in multiport and strong interest in expanding capacity for Ion with several hospitals now operating multiple Ion systems in their programs and variable demand for SP as we continue to pursue our additional indications. System utilization is an important predictor of future demand and utilization grew 5% for multiport in the year and 10% for Ion. Utilization was roughly flat for SP over the year, however, utilization increased by 9% in Q4 measured year-over-year as our organization incorporated learnings. Touching on our finances, revenue grew 9% in 2022. Revenue was impacted by the strength of the dollar in the year and the decline of the trade-in population of third-generation multiport systems. Our expenses landed at the higher end of our spend guidance reflecting continued R&D investments that support the growth of our platforms and digital products, expansion of our manufacturing and commercial capabilities, and capital amortization driven by expansion of our global footprint. Structurally, we have been increasing our own capital expenditures as we continue to build the company to supply the globe at industrial scale. This is an important investment as several procedures using our systems have become the standard of care in several countries. We have been vertically integrating key technologies to develop a more robust supply chain and bring important products to market at attractive price points. These investments include increased ownership of our imaging pipelines, strategic instrument and accessory technologies, and software and digital products that allow us to serve our customers. The investments make our business more capital-intensive than years past, in support of industrial dependability, a more robust supply chain, and lower product costs. I'd also like to take a moment to walk through our platform investments. Intuitive starts with the end in mind. Coordinating our efforts to enable our customers' pursuit of the quadruple aim in specific procedures, for example, those in general surgery. We design all our systems to allow for the addition of new functionality over time. For our multiport platform, this design philosophy has enabled us to continuously strengthen our fourth generation da Vinci Xi by adding new regulatory clearances, a new model with the da Vinci X, new instruments and accessories, new imaging capabilities, and new software products. These products include our stapling lot of instruments as well as our advanced energy instruments, which contributed approximately $890 million in revenue in 2022 with revenue growth of 18% in the year and are a key enabler of the general surgery growth discussed a minute ago. We added 65 representative clinical procedure indications in the United States to our fourth-generation multiport platform since its launch. Our multiport indications now spans six surgical categories and total over 70 procedure indications for multiport platforms in the United States today. We routinely improve our platform operating systems with roughly 10 significant fourth-generation OS releases since launch and dozens of smaller software upgrades. We launched our next-generation Xi visualization, Endoscope Plus, and have been integrating digital products, including virtual reality training Intuitive Hub and the My Intuitive app. We expect to launch additional Gen 4 compatible products and operating system software this year. Concurrently, we invest in new generations of our multiport platform that bring new and significantly enhanced capabilities. For our multi-port system development programs, we prioritize as follows. Our highest priority is the improvement of core surgical capability targeting improved patient outcomes, often through innovation in robot and instrument precision, imaging and sensing while focusing on dependability and product quality. Next, we designed to improve usability, care team's skill acquisition and analytic power, including digital products for the operating room, personalized learning for care teams and efficiency analysis and services for surgical programs. Next, we design platforms and their ecosystems that can lower the total cost to treat per patient episode. And finally, we designed with the flexibility to add future capability to systems post launch. Given the time required to design and validate new architectures at any given moment, we're typically developing more than one system architecture beyond that in the market. In the current global regulatory environment, core technology changes often require human clinical trials and substantial review. These are multiyear investment cycles, and we're making good progress. As we start this year, we do not currently expect a new multi-port system launch in 2023. Turning to Ion. Adoption has been healthy based on its ability to meet an unmet clinical need in lung biopsy. We're focused on improving the manufacturability, cost and robustness of iron products to support its rapid growth in the US. We have also submitted a regulatory dossier for a review in Europe, Korea and in China's green channel. We expect clearance in Europe in 2023. We don't have a firm forecast on the time for Ion clearance in China at this time given pandemic related adjustments ongoing in the Chinese healthcare system. Ion is also a platform with strong opportunities for future clinical applications. We're conducting advanced development and clinical research to extend Ion to other indications in the lung. While our Ion flexible robotics offers an opportunity to provide value in the body outside the lung, our focus is on completing what we started for pulmonologists and thoracic surgeons. Our single-port platform, da Vinci SP, has supported strong adoption in Korea and has recently obtained PMDA clearance with broad indications in Japan. We expect first installs of SP in Japan in the coming months. Next, we plan to submit our dossier on da Vinci SP to our notified body in Europe midyear 2023. So far, customer feedback on the clinical utility for SP has been healthy with strong multi-specialty use of SP in Korea. In the United States, some indications have required prospective clinical trials, and we're currently conducting IDE trials in colorectal surgery and thoracic surgery. We're pursuing additional indications for SP beyond these two, and we'll share more information on these indications in 2023 as the requirements for our regulatory pathway for them are established. We're continuing to invest significant resources in R&D, where the portfolio we have under development is positioned to support leadership in existing categories and expansion into new ones. Our capital investments will increase to support supply chain robustness, product cost reduction and global industrial scale. On the SG&A front, we are making some foundational investments, and we'll turn to pursue leverage in enabling functions. Recognizing economic conditions for 2023 are hard to forecast, we're targeting a deceleration of fixed cost growth rate in 2023 relative to 2022. We expect pro forma operating margins to fluctuate in the next several quarters and then improve over the mid-term. In closing, our priorities for 2023 are as follows; first, increased adoption and focused procedures defined by country through outstanding training, commercial and market access execution; second, pursuit of expanded indications and launches for our new platforms; third, excellent performance in the continuity of supply, product quality and services provision as we emerge from pandemic stresses; and finally, pursuit of increased productivity and our functions that benefit from scale. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie, who will take you through our finances in greater detail. All right. Thanks, Robbie. I think, we've been sharing with you over several quarters now. In terms of new technologies and new indications, we've seen in many of the core markets, not every single one, but many of them, additional data requirements. That changed probably four years ago, but has been playing all the way through. So it's not so much that the environment has changed over that period, just the implications of that. And you see that in things like SP, our SP trials, five or six years ago would have come to market differently and they're requiring some prospective human clinical work. That's not unique to SP. It really has to do with what the underlying technologies are and what new indications might be. So I think that is playing through relative to prior iterations of systems and features. That's true. Certainly in the United States, we've seen with the European regulatory changes over the years, increased data requirements in Europe and then it kind of varies by country from there. In terms of OpEx, perhaps I'll let you ask a follow-up question for Jamie on that one. Across our systems, we are doing trials in all sorts of places for all sorts of reasons, whether it's SPI or otherwise. And -- so the answer there is we have some places where those are publicly disclosed per normal rules. For competitive reasons, we don't try to detail them too much, and that's the position we'll take going forward. I'll take what does it mean and I'll ask Jamie to help me on detailing on the finance side. One of the things that's going on is that we are becoming well integrated into many surgical practices in several countries. I think that's a great opportunity for us and a serious responsibility. As we've seen in the last couple of years with regard to supply chain robustness and other things, making sure that -- we have supply chain stability that we want vertically integrating where we can. We have been doing that. A lot of the imaging pipeline work that we've done. We think that both gives us higher quality. It allows us to lower cost to the customer and it gives us robustness. We can plan for that robustness. That's true not only in imaging, but in some core technologies and instruments and accessories. And we think those are good long-term investments. So, that's been really positive. There's another place where our digital tools and our digital products, one of the things that's going on that I think is powerful for the company is not just product architecture, but business architecture. And what I mean by that is that our supply chain can support multiple platforms in multiple countries around the world. It can -- by that, I mean, multiport, single-port and Ion, our digital products architecture also is seamless and can integrate and support those platforms. So, that gives us a great quality advantage, it gives us a leverage capability, and allows us to lower the total cost for our customers and the cost to serve for our customers. Those things take some planning and some forward investment and it can be in core technology. For example, in digital, it can be in facilities, in manufacturing base, so we can build our products. But it's that opportunity. It's a global opportunity to help support the standard of care in multiple countries. I think that the customer advantages are quite clear and I think the cost robustness and long-term durability advantages for the company are quite clear. But that takes some play out over time. Jamie, any help you'll give? Thanks Larry. Yeah. We continue to add capabilities into Gen 4. We expect to do so this year as well. Some of it will be in advanced instrumentation. We are doing some nice work in our energy systems on the -- both on the hardware side and some of the software side, and we think there's some capability improvements that we're going to be developing over time around core imaging capability in Gen 4. So we continue to make progress. Yeah. Thank you for the question. We think mostly about what can we do that changes the experience of surgery for the patient in terms of outcomes and the care teams in terms of how they deliver that set of outcomes. And what we can do in terms of technology basis, products and services and training that can help that happen. That is the primary thing. That's the thing that is front and center. And we do design studies, research, usability effort, all the things you would expect for us to make progress. And then we try to advance that as quickly as reasonably we can, given the environment that we're in. We don't do too much perfection of timing about what we think the hospital capital environment is going to be. We don't -- you can imagine somebody doing that, that is not my highest motivation. I think these things are sophisticated enough and complex enough to bring to market, that trying to time it perfectly with regard to the macroeconomic environment is not what we're really driven by. We work closely with our technologists who are, I think, spectacular. We work closely with regulatory bodies around the world to understand what their needs and requirements are. And of course, we work very closely with key customers to understand whether the things we think matter, matter. And those are the things that we really do and once we find a pathway, then we work down that pathway. I have to say that supply chain disruptions that have happened in the last three years have impacted not only production capability, but impact new product development as well, because that puts waves and ripples into what kind of items people can procure for prototypes and other forms of focus. So there's a little bit of that in there, too. Why don't I take that one? That was a little bit about local competition and what kinds of things we're seeing. First, I think the entry of competitors in China is natural and should be expected. I think in some ways, it's probably a net positive in terms of how people think about the quota. That's more people advocating for the value of this in the market, it's probably a net positive over time, therefore, for market development also. In the near-term, early markets, we've seen this everywhere around the world with new systems entering. The very early entry is different than the middle is different than the late. And the early, there tend to be a lot of placements, a lot of things around clinical trials, a lot of things around setting up early capacity that are, in some sense, not indicative of value-based or feature-based competition, and we're going to see some of that early on. And then after that wave goes through putting your clinical trial systems out, then it starts to settle down, and you see a little bit more of what the core competitive dynamics look like. So, we're really, really in the early innings with what we're seeing in China competitors. I expect them to be active and assertive. Maybe I'd add a tiny bit on pricing and margin. On the pricing side, we look all the way across the total cost of ownership for our customers and make sure that's matched to value. So what's the value we bring and then what is the pricing that does that. We do that, as Jamie said, routinely, and we do it by country. It's a global look. With regard to some of the pressures on margin, whether they're inflationary or what have you, Jamie's point, some of those are sticky. We understand the levers that we have, whether it's in design or scale or production or other opportunities. And we're in pursuit of those. I don't think we're confused about where to go from here. Some of them take a little while. So some of the investments we're making, some of the automation that we talked about, some of the factory automation we're talking about those are things that give us better control of cost over time. And so I don't think we're confused or really caught off guard by some of the changes of the cost influence. Okay. Nothing further to detail on multi-port beyond what we've discussed already. With regard to opportunities for our platforms period, we have opportunities across our set. We'll -- I talked to you a little bit about what we're doing in SP already. We'll detail that more as it unfolds in 2023 as to where we see opportunity for SP to create indication expansions and to open new procedure markets for us, which we're excited about. On the Ion front, you asked a little bit about the PRECIsE tier data. I don't have anything more to detail on that. Feedback from the field we have outside of that specific study has been that it's delivering on the promise. Folks are finding that it's usable that it is supplying the outcome that they had hoped and we're seeing that reflected in the adoption. So we're pleased with that. With regard to ablation, we are -- as we said last quarter, we're just at the early innings of engaging customers in Europe and looking at the trial data. We're excited by it. I think there are several indications in the long that we'll pursue over time. We'll detail those more as we get more experience and more time. There are opportunities outside the long too, I want to be clear. We think those are interesting, but they're not areas of current focus. We really think finish the job we started. We have great engagement with pulmonologists and thoracic surgeons. We have opportunity to continue to support them to make our products ever easier, more robust and to move the margin structure where we want it to go. We're going to focus on that. And then we'll move to other indications in the lung. And then from after that, we'll have earned our opportunity to do the next step. So thank you for the questions there. That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim: better, more predictable patient outcomes; better experiences for patients; better experiences for their care teams; and, ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better, where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly, so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months."

            "name": "Jamie Samath",
            "content": "Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Q4 and 2022 revenue and procedures are in line with our preliminary press release of January 11. I will briefly review full year 2022 performance before describing our Q4 results in greater detail. 2022 procedures grew by 18% as compared to 2021, or 15% on a three-year compound annual growth rate basis. During the year, we placed 1,264 systems at customers, down 6% year-over-year, driven by a decline in trading volumes of 165 systems due to the declining population of SIs in the field. Recurring revenue, which is correlated to ongoing use of our products represented 79% of total revenue and grew 15% over the prior year. Total revenue of $6.2 billion increased 9% year-over-year and grew approximately 12% on a constant currency basis. Pro forma operating margin was 35% of revenue and reflected the impact of several headwinds, FX, supply chain challenges and inflation together adversely impacted 2022 pro forma operating margin by approximately 1 percentage point. During the year, we repurchased $2.6 billion of our stock or approximately 11.2 million shares, and we have a remaining authorization to repurchase our shares of $1.5 billion. Turning to Q4. With respect to capital performance, we placed 369 systems, 4% lower than the 385 systems we placed in the fourth quarter of last year. There were 110 trading transactions in the quarter, as compared to 117 last year. 51 of the 110 trading transactions were with OUS customers, higher than recent trends primarily driven by customers in Japan and Brazil. As of the end of Q4, there were approximately 620 SIs remaining in the installed base, of which 134 are in the US. Given the continuing decline of older generation systems in the field, we expect trading volumes to decline significantly in 2023. Q4 revenue was $1.66 billion, an increase of 7% from last year. On a constant currency basis, fourth quarter revenue grew approximately 10%. For full year 2022, revenue denominated in non-USD currencies represented 24% of total revenue. The US dollar has weakened recently, and as a result, on a revenue-weighted basis, using current rates, the US dollar is approximately 100 basis points stronger than the average rates realized in 2022. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: in the US we placed 181 systems in the fourth quarter, lower than the 235 systems we placed last year, reflecting cautious capital spending by customers, given the macroeconomic environment and a decline of 21 systems associated with trade-in transactions. Average system utilization in the US increased by 6%, reaching an all-time high. Outside the US we placed 188 systems in Q4 compared with 150 systems last year. Current quarter system placements included 70 into Europe, 51 into Japan, and 14 into China compared with 63 into Europe, 37 into Japan, and 14 into China in the fourth quarter of 2021. As of the end of 2022, there were 34 systems remaining under the current quota in China. There are now four local competitors that are registered in China and they're active in tenders under the existing quota. Delays in the granting of a new quota in China will constrain our ability to further grow the installed base and limit capacity for procedure growth. Leasing represented 42% of Q4 placements compared with 37% last quarter and last year. The higher lease mix was primarily driven by the mix of customers in the US who prefer to lease and reflected in part an increase in placements acquired under usage-based arrangements. While leasing will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time. Q4 system average selling prices were $1.43 million as compared to $1.45 million last year. System ASPs were negatively impacted by FX, partially offset by a favorable regional mix and a higher mix of Xi jewel placements. We recognized $17 million of lease buyout revenue in the fourth quarter compared with $17 million last quarter and $26 million in Q4 of 2021. da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,820 compared with approximately $1,800 last quarter and $1,940 last year. On a year-over-year basis, FX negatively impacted I&A per procedure by approximately $50 and customer ordering patterns had a negative impact of approximately $40 per procedure as customers, particularly in the US and China, reduced their inventory levels. Turning to our Ion platform. In 2022, we tripled procedures to just over 23,000 and double system placements to 192 as compared to 2021. In Q4, we placed 67 Ion systems as compared to 31 in Q4 of 2021. The installed base of Ion systems is now 321 systems, of which 132 are under operating lease arrangements. Fourth quarter Ion procedures of approximately 7,900 increased 169% as compared to last year. Leveraging previous investments we have made in our da Vinci ecosystem, during the quarter, we commenced the launch of My Intuitive app for Ion users, providing them real-time access and insights to their Ion usage statistics. Moving on to the rest of the P&L, pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2022 was 68.2% compared with 70.1% for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 69.8% last quarter. As a reminder, last quarter's gross margin included a one-time benefit of approximately 50 basis points relating to the favorable conclusion of certain indirect tax matters. Pro forma gross margin was lower than last year, primarily due to increased fixed costs relative to revenue, the stronger US dollar and higher component pricing. The supply chain environment was challenging in Q4 and indicators of supply and inventory health did not improve as compared to last quarter. Higher fixed costs relative to revenue reflect a combination of manufacturing related inefficiencies given the environment and investments for future growth. Fourth quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 19% compared with last year, driven by increased headcount, higher travel costs, increased customer training activities and higher R&D related project costs. Fourth quarter 2021 operating expenses included a $30 million contribution to the Intuitive Foundation, which can support their efforts for the next couple of years and did not repeat in 2022. The pace at which we are increasing headcount continued to moderate in Q4 with net additions of about 330 employees in the quarter compared to a net increase of approximately 530 employees last quarter. More than half of the employees we added in Q4 were production staff in our instrument factory in Mexico to support procedure growth. While we are slowing our hiring pace and pursuing leverage in our enabling functions, we are planning for balanced growth in operating expenses in 2023 given the opportunity to advance our next-generation robotics capabilities and the relatively earlier stage of our investments in Ion, SP and digital. In 2023, we expect a significant increase in expenses related to clinical trials. Brian will provide our outlook for operating expenses later in this call. As we look forward to our growth plans over the next several years, we are planning to make significant capital expenditures. Capital expenditures for 2022 were $532 million, and we expect 2023 capital expenditures in a range of $800 million to $1 billion, of which approximately two-thirds will be for facilities to expand our manufacturing capacity. Our manufacturing investment plans include advanced proprietary facilities for production of new products and the Ion platform in California and da Vinci systems in Georgia. Internationally, we are increasing our product development capacity in Germany, building a new low-cost endoscope manufacturing facility in Bulgaria and establishing manufacturing capacity for domestic Xi production in China. We will also be expanding the footprint of our high-volume, low-cost instrument site in Mexico to support procedure growth across all of our platforms. These investments allow us to consolidate our manufacturing into larger centralized hubs, such as our headquarter campus in Sunnyvale, California and our East Coast hub just outside of Atlanta, while we will co-locate surgeon training, technology development and manufacturing capacity. These are multiyear investments. And as a result, we expect depreciation expense to increase in 2023 and increase more significantly in 2024. Pro forma other income was $21.8 million for Q4, higher than $7.2 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to lower foreign exchange losses from remeasurement of the balance sheet and higher interest income. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 18.2%, lower than prior quarters, primarily as a result of a more favorable geographical earnings mix and a discrete tax benefit of $7 million associated with the foreign tax matter. Fourth quarter 2022 pro forma net income was $439 million, or $1.23 per share compared with $473 million or $1.29 per share for the fourth quarter of last year. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $325 million or $0.91 per share for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared with GAAP net income of $381 million or $1.04 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, litigation charges and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended the year with cash and investments of $6.7 billion compared with $7.4 billion at the end of Q3. The sequential reduction in cash and investments reflected share repurchases of $1 billion and capital expenditures, partially offset by cash from operating activities. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian, who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our outlook for 2023. Yes. It's fair, Robbie, that we're investing differentially across the areas of investment and the functions within the company. Our priorities for 2023 with respect to operating expenses to drive growth in the areas of focus, and we're being focused there. We're looking to execute some opportunities to expand markets by gaining additional clinical indications and geographical clearances. And obviously, we want to advance our technology. Within SG&A, what you see in subsets of the G&A functions is us looking to pursue leverage as we've described. And generally, from an R&D perspective, there are some investments that, as Gary has previously referenced were sequencing, and that's partly motivated by the way in which headcount has expanded over, let's say, the last year or two, and we've moderated our headcount growth as described, and that gives us the opportunity to absorb some of that headcount. So there's differential investment within SG&A and R&D. If I look at R&D and SG&A kind of in aggregate, they're likely to grow at relatively similar rates next year. I would just say industrial operating -- industrial scale is linked to the capital expenditure plans that we've described, the $800 million to $1 billion of investment in 2023. I'd just add the financial ROI calculations on those investments are relatively straightforward. And we think there are real advantages in having large, highly automated factories that run at scale and that's an advantage both for us and for our customers. So, the return calculations are relatively straightforward and they're essentially the incremental gross margin dollars we can drive from growth. On the capital funnel side, what I'd say is, given the macro inputs from customers are our sense is that they are still relatively cautious. I think there's quite a bit of uncertainty still in the macro. And while, for example, staffing shortages have improved, they're still quite a bit worse than pre-pandemic levels in terms of labor costs, vacancy rates for hospitals. So they are being careful from a financial perspective and they're cautious given macroeconomic uncertainty. I think our experiences in the second half of 2022 has been where customers are seeing nice growth in their robotics programs. da Vinci stays as a relatively high priority in terms of their capital budgets. But beyond the fact that they're cautious, I wouldn't say there's anything specific I'd highlight in terms of 2023 outlook. Yes. I think what we're saying is, we saw China procedures impacted in November. That got more severe in December, has continued so far in the early part of January, and we expect, therefore, procedures in China to be at least impacted in Q1 and perhaps beyond. And I think it's difficult for us to predict, given the relatively unique situation China is in relative to the Zero-COVID policy that they have had. So we're not making any specific predictions as to when and how that might recover. Brian laid out how that's reflected in the procedure guidance that we provided. Separately, on the quota, we're in the third year again of kind of new quota period, the last two quotas have been issued in the third year. We only use that as a historical reference, nothing more. We don't have any particular insight as to when a new quota might come. I would just say that, underlying demand for robotic technology in China, if you take a mid- and long-term view, is quite strong. And our experience so far has been that surgeons care about the capability and feature set of the products that they use there. Again, we don't have any particular insight with respect to timing and size of quota. We saw the last quota we received was higher than the previous one, but we have no ability to predict that it will be larger again. So we'd love to be able to give you greater clarity than that. But what's the second part of your question, Matt? Just with respect to pricing, I'll only comment on current products in the portfolio, as you described. What we're seeing is core costs in our supply chain, the prices we pay our suppliers, the wage costs we pay our production staff. They have gone up, and that looks sticky. We have a routine process we use to monitor pricing on an ongoing basis. We'll continue that process. There's nothing that we would highlight at this point with respect to any specific decisions that we've made relative to pricing, but it's something that we're monitoring carefully through the existing processes that we have. With respect to your question on bariatrics and the change in BMI guidelines, I think it's really early to determine what effect, if anything, that might have in terms of the total surgical term for bariatrics. And so therefore, there's nothing reflected in the 12% to 16% guidance that we provided, and I wouldn't expect it to move that quickly. And there are -- by the way, in bariatrics, there are kind of real protocols patients have to go through with respect to a set of activities that they undertake before they become eligible for surgery, even with this change in guidelines."

Gary will present the quarter\u2019s business and operational highlights, Jamie will provide a review of our financial results, and I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2022, and finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.\nGary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. Our business fundamentals strengthened in Q3 with 20% procedure growth in da Vinci procedures compared with Q3 of last year and solid performance in each of our global regions. Our capital placements reflected 13% growth in our installed base to meet procedure demand accompanied by continued increases in utilization per system per year, healthy indicators for our customers and for us. Ion also experienced increases in installs, procedures performed and annualized system utilization. Supply chain challenges while still present are abating from their pandemic peaks. Looking more closely at procedures, 20% growth is up from 14% last quarter and above our three-year compound annual growth rate of 16% during the pandemic. General surgery, our largest procedure category, is growing at the fastest rate of any category fueled by bariatric surgery, cholecystectomy, hernia repair and other foregut procedures in the United States. In Europe, several countries are growing nicely with diversified use beyond urology. Germany, the UK and Ireland, Italy and Spain stood out in the quarter. In Asia, Japanese procedure growth accelerated relative to Q2 and Korean growth remained solid. Procedures in both countries are also diversifying beyond urology. In China, procedure growth was just above our global average, hampered in part by regional rolling lockdowns that continue to impact procedures and utilization. Turning to capital, we placed 305 systems in the quarter compared with 336 in Q3 a year ago and 279 last quarter. Strong procedure demand is supporting da Vinci installed base growth of 13% in the quarter. Per system utilization grew 7% in the quarter, up from our three-year compound annual growth of 5% over the pandemic. Utilization was aided by recovery from a softer U.S. procedure quarter last year, as well as customer performance of more types of procedures and higher volume categories and increases in customer efficiency. SI trade-ins continued to slow given the decline in remaining trade-in opportunity. Ion placements grew to 50 this quarter, up from 28 last year and 41 last quarter, reflecting continued growth in an early market. Overall, our customers are acquiring systems where there is opportunity for procedure growth. On the investment front, we continue to focus on our platforms in multiport endoluminal, single port and digital through indication and regional regulatory expansions, innovation in products and services that meet customer needs and product quality and cost refinements. We expect our new platforms to approach our historical levels of contribution margin over time, progress year-to-date has met our expectations. With regard to our expenses this quarter, we moderated headcount growth to focus on deeply integrating those employees who joined us in the past several quarters. Going into 2023, we expect the rate of growth in fixed expenses to slow as we pursue leverage in our enabling functions and sequence some of our forward investments. We have had a solid quarter achieving product and services milestones. We continue to expand access to our multiport products, training and services globally. Standouts in the quarter include record global quarterly new surgeon training completions to first case and accreditation of our technology training pathway by the Royal College of Surgeons in the UK. For Ion, we submitted our registration application in China, and we obtained German regulatory clinical study approval for ion ablation technology, which start -- which starts our clinical journey towards enabling interventions beyond biopsy. Ion procedures grew 211% in the quarter. Turning to our single-port platform, da Vinci SP, procedures grew 46% year-over-year, with particular strength in Korea, where our SP team launched next-generation SP instruments and our Firefly-enabled endoscope. We also received PMDA clearance in the quarter, market SP in Japan across a broad set of clinical indications similar to the indications SP has in Korea. In our digital portfolio, our My Intuitive app and PORTaL are being adopted broadly in regions in which they are released as the go-to digital portal for da Vinci customers. Installs of our in-room computing platform, Intuitive Hub grew 21% over the third quarter last year and software updates to our Hub installed base improved usability and enabled telepresence. In summary, our core business strengthened in the quarter as acute pandemic impact softened. We are managing spend growth, while investing in core growth opportunities for the future. I will now pass the time over to Jamie to take us through our finances and some persistent macroeconomic issues in greater detail.\nJamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. In Q3, growth in procedures, the installed base of da Vinci systems and average system utilization was healthy. The strength of these key business drivers resulted in a pro forma operating margin of 36% and pro forma EPS of $1.19. Simultaneously, we saw headwinds from the strong U.S. dollar, lingering supply chain issues and inflation, which together negatively impacted pro forma operating margin by approximately 2 percentage points compared to the third quarter of last year. I will take you through these details. Q3 procedure growth of 20% reflected an increase in U.S. procedures of 18% and OUS procedure growth of 24%. U.S. procedure growth reflected a favorable comparison to the year ago quarter given the impact of the Delta variant last year. On a three-year compound annual growth rate basis, U.S. procedures grew approximately 13%. In China, our second largest market during the quarter procedures continued to recover from the impact of COVID-related lockdowns that we described on last quarter\u2019s earnings call. However, we continue to see regional lockdowns occur as COVID cases rise. Turning to capital, we placed 305 systems in the third quarter, 9% lower than the 336 systems we placed last year. Third quarter system placements included approximately 15 systems that were delayed at the end of last quarter due to component supply delays. There were 71 trading transactions in the quarter, as compared to 136 in Q3 of 2021, reflecting the decline in the number of SIs remaining in the installed base. As of the end of Q3, there were approximately 739 SIs remaining in the installed base, of which 191 are in the U.S. Excluding trade-in transactions global system placements grew 17% from last year. The installed base of da Vinci systems grew approximately 13% year-over-year, consistent with recent trends. The utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, increased almost 7% compared to last year. Using a three-year compound annual growth rate, third quarter utilization was consistent with historical averages, increasing almost 5%. Average system utilization in the U.S. grew 6% year-over-year, an improvement from the 1% decline in utilization in Q2. As a result of our procedure and capital performance, Q3 revenue was $1.56 billion, an increase of 11% from the third quarter of 2021. On a constant currency basis, third quarter revenue grew approximately 15%. In the third quarter, revenue denominated in non-USD currencies represented 22% of total revenue. On a revenue weighted basis, using current exchange rates, net of hedges in place for Q4, the U.S. dollar is approximately 3% stronger than the rates realized in Q3. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows, in the U.S., we placed 175 systems in the third quarter, lower than the 227 in Q3 of 2021, reflecting a decline of 66 systems associated with trade-in transactions and a challenging macroeconomic environment. Outside the U.S., we placed 130 systems in the third quarter, compared with 109 last year. Current quarter system placements included 54 into Europe, 32 into Japan and 14 into China, compared with 47 into Europe, 20 into Japan and 17 into China in the third quarter of 2021. As of the end of Q3 2022, there were 40 systems remaining under the current quota in China, which is also available to the three domestic competitors that have completed local registration with NMPA. Markets that are served through distributors have represented approximately 10% of system placements so far this year. Our distribution partners purchased product from us in U.S. dollars and sell in their local currencies. While we have not experienced a significant impact so far, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar reduces distributor margins and may cause delays in capital purchases. Leasing represented 37% of Q3 placements, compared with 42% last quarter and 41% in the third quarter of 2021. The lower lease mix is a function of customer and regional mix, and while leasing will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time. Third quarter system average selling prices were $1.5 million consistent with last quarter. System ASPs were negatively impacted by a higher trade-in mix and the impact of FX, offset by a higher mix of Xi dual console placements. We recognized $17 million of lease buyout revenue in the third quarter, compared with $22 million last quarter and $25 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,800, compared with approximately $1,900 for both last quarter and last year. On a year-over-year basis, FX negatively impacted I&A per procedure by approximately $50. The remainder of the year-over-year reduction was primarily a result of customer ordering patterns. During the quarter, our distributors and customers in certain OUS markets reduced their inventory as supply chain predictability moderately improved. We placed 50 Ion systems in the quarter, as compared to 28 in the third quarter of last year. The installed base of Ion systems is now 254 systems, of which 112 are under operating lease arrangements. Third quarter Ion procedures of approximately 6,400 increased 211% on a year-over-year basis. Ion is in the new MDR regulatory review process in Europe, and during the quarter, we submitted Ion into the regulatory process in China. As a reminder, regulatory review timelines in China are lengthy. Moving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2022 was 69.8%, compared with 71.3% for the third quarter of 2021 and 69.2% last quarter. Q3 pro forma gross margin included a one-time benefit of approximately 50 basis points relating to the favorable conclusion of certain indirect tax matters. Pro forma gross margin was lower than last year, primarily due to the stronger U.S. dollar, manufacturing and logistics inefficiencies as a result of the supply chain environment, higher component pricing and increased fixed costs relative to revenue. Indicators of supply and inventory held modestly improved in the quarter but remained well below pre-pandemic levels. Pro forma operating expenses increased 24% compared with third quarter of 2021, driven by increased headcount, higher R&D related project costs and higher travel costs. Growth in operating expenses has been primarily in support of our Ion platform, next-generation robotics capabilities, our digital capabilities and expansion of our infrastructure to allow us to effectively scale. We are also seeing higher regulatory costs as a result of increased regulatory requirements globally and expansion of our new platforms into OUS markets. As Gary mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we slowed our hiring pace, adding approximately 530 employees lower than the 700-plus employees we have added per quarter in the last three quarters. As we look forward to 2023, we expect our operating expense growth will be lower than the growth for this year. The slowing growth rate of operating expenses reflects the completion of some of our infrastructure and business process improvement investments and planned leverage in our enabling functions. As part of our planning process, we are also conducting a review of our capital expenditure priorities and we will provide an update as to the outcome of this review on the next call. Within this framework, we will continue to invest in our new platforms, Ion and SP, next-generation capabilities and our digital ecosystem, given the return profiles we see for those investments. Pro forma other income was $7.2 million for Q3, lower than $10.4 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange losses from re-measurement of the balance sheet resulting from the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 23.4%, in line with our expectations. Third quarter 2022 pro forma net income was $429 million or $1.19 per share, compared with $435 million and also $1.19 per share for the third quarter of last year. Capital expenditures in Q3 were $153 million, primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities footprint and increase manufacturing capacity. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $324 million or $0.90 per share for the third quarter of 2022, compared with GAAP net income of $381 million or $1.04 per share for the third quarter of 2021. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, litigation charges and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.4 billion, compared with $8.2 billion at the end of Q2. The sequential reduction in cash and investments reflected share repurchases and capital expenditures, partially offset by cash from operating activities. During the quarter, we completed a $1 billion ASR in addition to the $607 million of shares repurchased in the first half. Since the end of 2021, our diluted share count has decreased by approximately 7 million shares or 2% and we have a remaining authorization to repurchase our shares of $2.5 billion. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian, who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2022.\nBrian King: Thank you, Jamie. Our overall third quarter 2022 procedure growth was 20%, compared to 20% for the third quarter of 2021 and 14% last quarter. The three-year compound annual growth rate between the third quarter of 2019 and third quarter of 2022 was 16%. In the U.S., third quarter 2022 procedures exceeded our expectations with growth at 18% year-over-year, compared to 16% for the third quarter of 2021 and 11% last quarter. Procedure growth reflects a positive impact relative to Q3 last year, which was impacted by the Delta variant. On a three-year compound annual growth basis, U.S. procedure growth was 13%. Third quarter procedure growth continued to be driven by general surgery with strength in bariatrics, cholecystectomy and hernia repair. Trends in malignant procedures, namely colorectal and lobectomy procedures were also strong. Growth in gynecology, our second largest procedure category in the U.S., also experienced double-digit growth, while more mature urologic procedures grew in the high single digits. Outside of the U.S., third quarter procedure volume grew approximately 24% year-over-year, compared to 30% for the third quarter of 2021 and 22% last quarter. On a three-year compound annual growth basis, procedure growth was 21%. Turning to Europe, procedure growth was led by strong growth in Germany, U.K., Italy and Spain. In all of the regions noted, procedure growth outside of urology was strong in general surgery and gynecology categories. Specifically in Germany, we experienced early-stage growth in benign hysterectomy and colorectal surgery. In the U.K., growth was led by benign hysterectomy, colorectal and cholecystectomy procedures. While still early-stage, year-over-year procedure growth in these non-urology procedures was almost 4 times higher than urology. Turning to Asia, in Japan, growth in general surgery and gynecology continued to be strong. We experienced robust growth in these categories led by gastrectomy, rectal resection and benign hysterectomy. Further contributing to strong procedure performance was continued early-stage growth in newly reimbursed procedures, namely colon resection and nephrectomy procedures. In China, we continue to see a recovery in the first couple of months of the third quarter as COVID cases began to decline and lockdown restrictions were lifted. Procedure growth was driven by urologic procedures, specifically prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy, along with strong growth in colon resection within general surgery. Later in the quarter, we began to see procedures start to moderate as COVID began to reemerge in various regions and rolling lockdowns were implemented. Korea procedure growth was also solid in the third quarter. Growth in procedures continued to be broad-based with strong growth in SP procedures. Now turning to the clinical side of our business, each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. Earlier today at the Annual CHEST conference in Nashville, Tennessee, Dr. Eric Folk from Massachusetts General Hospital presented preliminary performance updates from the PRECIsE study. Results were consistent with data released last year and demonstrated encouraging results for diagnostic yield and sensitivity of malignancy for samples obtained through an Ion procedure with a strong safety profile. We anticipate the final data from PRECIsE to be published in the first part of next year. Continuing with Ion, a group from the Mayo Clinic in both Rochester, Minnesota and Jacksonville, Florida, led by doctors Alejandra Yu Lee-Mateus, Janani Reisenauer and Sebastian Fernandez-Bussy published a retrospective case series in respirology, comparing the performance of the Ion endoluminal system with the CT guided transthoracic approach for pulmonary lesion biopsy. A total of 225 patients were included in this study. 113 who underwent an Ion procedure with a median nodule size of 18 millimeters and 112 who underwent a transthoracic biopsy with a median nodule size of 16 millimeters. Within the Ion group, the overall diagnostic yield and sensitivity for malignancy reported was 87.6% and 82.1%, respectively, which were comparable to the same outcomes from the transthoracic approach. Importantly, the rate of complications was significantly lower for the Ion approach, with a 13% difference relative to the transthoracic approach. Further analysis demonstrated an approximately 80% reduced chance of pneumothorax associated with the Ion procedure. The authors concluded in part that robotic assisted approach with Ion can be as accurate as the transthoracic approach for sampling pulmonary nodules with similar or reduced complications and should be considered as a means for nodule biopsy. Turning to the surgical side, Dr. Leonardo Sandrolini from the University of Bologna and colleagues published a systematic review and meta analysis comparing the robotic-assisted and laparoscopic approaches for left colectomy procedures in the International Journal of Colorectal Disease. Data from 11 different articles, including over 52,000 patients were included in this analysis, with over 13,500 in the robotic arm and over 39,000 in the laparoscopic arm and with no difference in preoperative characteristics reported. With regard to perioperative outcomes, a 4% lower conversion to open rate was reported for the robotic-assisted approach compared to the laparoscopic approach. Further analysis demonstrated the risk of conversion to open for the robotic-assisted approach was approximately half the rest of the laparoscopic approach. In addition, the analysis showed a higher risk of postoperative complications after a laparoscopic left colectomy, as well as a lower rate of superficial wound infections for the robotic-assisted approach. The analysis also showed anastomotic leak was 30% less likely with the robotic-assisted approach compared to the lap group. The authors concluded in part that robotic left colectomy requires less conversion to open surgery than the standard laparoscopic approach and more studies are warranted to highlight possible advantages in using the robotic platform for left colectomy. I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2022. Starting with procedures, on our last call, we forecast full year 2022 procedure growth within a range of 14% to 16.5%. We are now increasing our forecast and expect full year 2022 procedure growth of 17% to 18%. This range continues to reflect the uncertainty associated with the course of the pandemic. The low end of the range still assumes increasing COVID hospitalizations, regional lockdowns and staffing pressure at hospitals for the remainder of the year. At the high end of the range, we assume COVID-19-related hospitalizations around the world continue to decline throughout the remainder of 2022, and there are no additional significant impacts from further resurgences. The range does not reflect significant material supply chain disruptions or hospital capacity constraints similar to what we have experienced at the start of the pandemic. Turning to gross profit, on our last call, we forecast our 2022 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 69% and 70.5%, expected to be towards the lower end of that range. We are now refining our estimate of pro forma gross profit margin to be within 69% and 69.5% of net revenue, given the ongoing impact of higher input costs related to supply chain and the impact from a stronger U.S. dollar. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on products, regional and trade-in mix, fluctuations in foreign currency rates and the impact of new product introductions. With respect to operating expenses, on our last call, we forecast pro forma operating expense growth to be between 23% and 25%. We are adjusting our estimate and now expect our full year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 21% and 23%. We are narrowing our estimate for non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $520 million to $530 million in 2022. We are also updating our estimate for other income which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $40 million and $50 million in 2022, a decrease from our previous estimate of $60 million and $70 million. The decrease primarily reflects lower interest income on cash that was used to repurchase shares and also the net impact of certain foreign exchange gains and losses. On last quarter\u2019s call, we forecast 2022 capital expenditures within a range of $700 million to $800 million. We are now lowering our estimate for capital expenditures for 2022 to be in the range of $600 million to $700 million. With regard to income tax, we continue to estimate our 2022 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pre-tax income. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions. Maggie, I think we would like to go ahead and lead the Q&A ahead.\nOperator: All right. Yes. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And first we have a question from the line of Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nTravis Steed: Hey, thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the good quarter. Maybe, Gary, on the capital selling funnel, just maybe you could comment how the funnel has changed since at the end of the year when you initially highlighted a slower funnel. And just trying to square away the 13% installed base growth with the slower funnel and if that\u2019s being offset by the 7% higher utilization and how to think about capital in the double placements moving forward?\nGary Guthart: What we are seeing on that side, on the capital side is that, where we see healthy procedure growth, the installed base growth is keeping pace and you are absolutely right in your question to kind of link utilization growth with installed base growth. On the utilization side, the 7% is higher than the norm. It\u2019s got a little artifact in it we think, which is a year ago third quarter was a little bit suppressed because of the Delta variant. So I think it\u2019s hard to keep doing 7% quarterly. If the customers could do that, we would be delighted. It\u2019s -- utilization is good for them, it\u2019s good for us and it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s just hard to move in a durable way because of all the workflow issues in the hospital at large, not just robotics, but just across the system. So we are seeing both. I think the capital side what we have seen here is that capital is available to be competed for if you can become a high priority within the hospital to get it. So it\u2019s not so much that the capital environment is easy as it is competitive and if you can rise on the party list, then we will find that the loop and we are seeing that in installed base growth in greenfields and in Ion.\nOperator: Thank you. And next we have a question from the line of Amit Hazan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAmit Hazan: Thank you. And a couple of questions if that\u2019s okay. First, I think, maybe just to ask about how you are thinking about the pipeline for more mature procedures. If I heard you right, you were urology and gynecology up high-single digits, double digits in the U.S., pretty good numbers, just want to make sure those are clean. And then just kind of the typical question about your own sources, external internal customer discussions, just how you are thinking about the diagnostic pipeline for those slower growing cancer procedures and kind of where we are or where we are heading relative to the trough levels that were observed last year?\nGary Guthart: Okay. On the issue of kind of the quality of growth on urology and gynecology, Brian, I am going to kick that to you.\nBrian King: Sure. And I think Gary touched on it on the previous answer, an element of that being just a comparison period from last year, but still seeing really healthy growth in those particular categories. As I called out, growth in gynecology, which is our second largest procedure category, did have, I\u2019d say, double-digit growth, probably in the lower end there and then those more mature urologic procedures being those high-single digits, but it\u2019s really favoring from the comparison from last year, but still doing really well.\nJamie Samath: On the diagnostic pipelines, what we continue to see for the most part is relatively steady in terms of the tests that are occurring, mostly a little below the volumes that we saw pre-pandemic. The one exception that we have seen in the U.S. in kind of recent trends is a tick up in colonoscopies. I wouldn\u2019t say that this evidence that that\u2019s impacted da Vinci procedures yet as that\u2019s a recent trend, obviously, we are encouraged by the fact that more patients are able to get back to having those diagnostic tests and we will see how that plays out in terms of surgery.\nGary Guthart: On just a follow-up point to Brian, your answer, I think, the other thing is that while we are mature in urology and gynecology in the United States, there\u2019s still a little growth there too. But outside the United States and Europe and Asia, we are still relatively early and we think that in those two categories we will continue to see growth. Jamie, just a follow-up point on your answer on the diagnostics side, you were saying it started to come back and we are seeing a little bit of an uptick. It is absolutely clear that there\u2019s been a trough or a bolus of people who stayed out of diagnostic pipelines and that hasn\u2019t fully recovered. And their disease is progressing. That is also absolutely clear in the literature. So how big that is and what that looks like as they come back into the health system in terms of surgery and da Vinci surgery, you are just going to have to wait and see. It\u2019s a hard thing to measure, but I think there\u2019s a bolus out there and it\u2019s unfortunate given disease progression.\nOperator: Thank you. And next we have a question from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nLarry Biegelsen: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations. Just two for me, I wanted to start, Gary, with the color commentary you gave on OpEx spending next year. If we look at the last five years, you grew EPS faster than sales or pre-COVID, I am sorry, four years to the five years, this year, it looks like earnings will probably be down. How much of a priority is EPS growth and what would need to happen for you to get back to the algorithm where you grew EPS faster than sales and I have one follow-up.\nGary Guthart: The -- we watch it. We want to make sure that we are efficient stewards of our expenses and our capital and where we see an efficiency we will pursue it. That\u2019s what I have been messaging and that\u2019s what I was talking about here in the script. We think there are opportunities for us to increase our productivity and to do a better job onboarding from the staff we have brought in, helping them become more productive more quickly. We think there are really good opportunities in our new platforms, the things we have been talking to you about. Ion is growing nicely. SP, as we pursue additional indications. I think will be quite strong and we are pleased with multiport currently what\u2019s in the market, the things we are working on, as well as our digital tools. So we think those things are important. We don\u2019t want to starve them. But we will sequence them. So it\u2019s a balanced approach. Some of it is making sure that our growth engines remain intact and we continue to innovate. Other parts are just making sure that we are being efficient with our use of capital and that we are building a lean organization as we grow. Jamie, you can speak a little bit to the expense characterization as you see it.\nJamie Samath: There\u2019s just a couple of framing comments I\u2019d make, Larry. If you look at the midpoint of the procedure guidance we provided, on a three-year CAGR basis, that\u2019s procedure growth of about 15%, just under -- just over 15%. You do the same for our OpEx guidance, that\u2019s just under 15%. So, kind of back to 2019 on a three-year CAGR basis, procedure growth and spending growth relatively in line. Just one other thing I\u2019d highlight to make a point, if you look at the reported revenue growth for Q3 and 11% year-over-year. If you look at our recurring revenue growth, that\u2019s about 80% of our total revenue, 16%. If you adjust that on a constant currency basis, it\u2019s 20% revenue growth and so comparable with the 20% procedure growth. When you look back at 2018, 2019, generally, procedure growth and revenue growth are relatively similar. You are seeing a disconnect right now for the reasons we have described, the lower trade-in volumes, trade-in volumes so far this year are down 40% from the prior year and you are seeing the impact of FX as we have described. And so there are some macro and secular level impacts on what\u2019s happening in the P&L this year. Specifically on spending, we kind of described it in the script. There are some infrastructure investments that we have been making that start to complete and that creates the opportunity for us to spend at a lower growth rate, and given the work that we have done and the investments that we have made, we are going to look for some leverage in our enabling functions, particularly as we get into next year. Final thing that Gary mentioned was as you look at kind of our pipeline, there\u2019s some natural sequencing that you will do with respect to some of our programmatic spending next year and those factors play into the slowing operating expense growth rate that we have described.\nLarry Biegelsen: That\u2019s super helpful. If I could sneak one in -- one more in. Gary, you have talked about a huge amount of variation in surgery around the world. You have talked about developing tools to identify best practices to reduce the variation and improve outcomes. Where are you in that process and what are the capabilities you still need to develop to make that a reality? Thanks.\nGary Guthart: Yeah. I love that question. The -- there\u2019s a couple of things. On the kind of the baseline, you need to gather enough of the right data to characterize variability of care teams and variability of patients. So there\u2019s a patient population, it\u2019s got variability and you have got care team or physician variability as well. And getting the right data streams, getting them stored and figuring out how to do the right kind of assessment or analysis on them, curating that data, making sure it\u2019s annotated properly, some basic stuff that you have to do to be able to look for meaningful sources of variation. We are well down that pathway in terms of getting the right data streams, having the right conversations with our customers and starting to do the analysis. So I am excited by it. As we look at how to deliver that, we are still in a I think surgical science discovery phase. We are partnered with many of the top hospitals -- academic hospitals around the world looking at surgical data science, starting to figure out sources of variation and drawing it back to causality, not just correlation. So I think the baseline is there, the ability to collect and gather that data, I think our relationships with top tier researchers are in place and we are starting to see early signals that look really good. Final point I\u2019d make is there are some basic things we can do that are logical and not extraordinarily complicated that can help personalized learning pathways and training pathways, and we are starting to work through that now. That\u2019s kinds of technologies that will come out into the field first. So I think it was a long-term journey. Some of the things we talked to you about Intuitive Hub or some of the baseline capabilities there in terms of the right data collected, annotated the right way and shared with the right hospital customers to get us good outcomes.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we have Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I will add my congratulations on a nice quarter. Maybe just to dial-in a little bit more on the capital equipment environment, you touched on this and it\u2019s great to see procedures driving placement volumes. But are you seeing any changes, whether it\u2019s in the U.S. or Europe as we are in an uncertain economic environment around the world, it\u2019s clearly not showing up in the numbers yet. But just seeing if there\u2019s any rate of change or if the outlook is any different than the current environment? Thanks a lot.\nJamie Samath: Just a couple of things I\u2019d highlight. As we have spoken to customers and this is mostly anecdotal, you do see some input that staffing pressures are easing a little bit, particularly with respect to vacation rates and labor costs. Those two factors are still way above pre-pandemic levels, but you see a little bit of improvement in the quarter, at least based on both those anecdotes and the survey work that we have seen. In Q2 and Q3, you saw customers going through the process of reexamining their capital budgets and that causes some delays in capital investments, and obviously, they reprioritize what they invest in. I think robotic surgery is still an area of potential value for customers. That does cause some delays. On the OUS side, we haven\u2019t seen a significant impact yet so far in terms of capital spending by those customers. Generally, we are at earlier stages of adoption. The payer structures are different and so far at least what we have seen is kind of nice capital numbers in the OUS markets, as you can see from the kind of comparisons. If you look at European placements in Q3, they were up 15%, placements in Asia were up 36% year-over-year. So we haven\u2019t seen anything so far. I would say there are obviously economic risks, particularly in Europe with the energy situation there, the situation with Ukraine and Russia, we haven\u2019t seen those manifest yet.\nOperator: Thank you. And next we have a line -- question from the line of Richard Newitter with Truist. Please go ahead.\nRichard Newitter: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the quarter. Just with respect to the spending sequencing comments that you made, what should we be thinking about that with respect to locations or kind of a next-gen console system and some of the other types of iterative technology advancements you have talked about in the pipeline. Is there any implication for a new system if you will or da Vinci next-gen console in the cadence of the spending you are talking about in 2023? Thanks.\nGary Guthart: Across the platforms, we work on improvements to the robot system side or full innovation there. We work on instruments and accessories and software updates and sometimes partnered product. In general, we maintain our priority and our cadence on those things that we think are going to have the biggest impact to our customers that allow them to get better outcomes or to address new opportunities that they are not addressing today. We continue to invest and have a high priority on quality improvements and things that will make our customers more satisfied. Some other things that tend to be great ideas, but perhaps are not highly urgent, then those things will sequence out and that\u2019s a conversation we routinely have. What do we have to do at high priority and do it at high quality quickly? What are the things that can sequence after that? So hard to answer your question in detail from a process point of view, if it matters a lot to our customers, if it\u2019s a high dissatisfy or high opportunity, those things get put in line first.\nOperator: Thank you. And next we have the line of Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nJayson Bedford: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. One topic that I thought was interesting, you mentioned ablation technology with respect to Ion and starting a trial in Germany. Can you talk a bit more about the technology and the size and scope of the trial, and maybe any type of timeline you can offer in the U.S. in terms of starting a trial?\nGary Guthart: Well, I will talk a little bit about the motivation. In terms of the details of the trial, I don\u2019t have them at our fingertips, but our team can respond to that in a future call. Here we know that Ion can navigate in deep into the lung, we know that surgeons and interventional pulmonologists want to treat tissue there. They want to be able to engage with it one way or another. So ablative technology can be used for a couple of different disease states and we have high interest in that, whether it\u2019s inoperable cancer or whether it\u2019s something for emphysema or chronic bronchitis. So being able to navigate there with an energy source will ultimately be important. The first one that we are talking about here, I believe is a microwave energy source. There are some other energy sources that people are interested in. In some cases, we are developing it ourselves and in several other cases we are partnering with others. And we think that will open the door to additional indications for Ion in the lung and elsewhere. We are pretty excited about it. Apologies for not having the details of the trial at our fingertips, but I imagine our team will get that to you in the future.\nOperator: Thank you. And next we have the line of Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nMatt Taylor: Hi. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. I wanted to get some updated thoughts, you have been asked a little bit about this in the recent past and on this call. But maybe you could give us some feedback on how you are thinking about capital spending from hospital customers going into recession and thinking about how this one could compare to what you have seen in the past with some of the different cycles that the company has gone through over a longer period of time, maybe do some compare and contrast and talk about the demand environment that you see out there and how you are going to compete for other priorities for capital?\nJamie Samath: Just with respect to prior cycles and this one actually, Matt, is a little interesting in so far as we indicated in Q1, we saw some softness in the capital pipeline in Q1 and Q2, and to some extent, that continued in Q3. If I look back at prior cycles in 2008, you saw three quarters of a year-over-year decline in capital placements, 2013 I think we saw five quarters in a row of declining capital placements and then when COVID hit in 2020, again, three quarters in a row. I only give those as reference points. I don\u2019t think we can say that those are indicative as to what may happen if and when there\u2019s a recession in the U.S. or beyond. So, I think, honestly, if you look at the progression of the economic projections, it\u2019s pretty complex and hard to call at this point. So we just give those historical reference points.\nGary Guthart: Two comments for me, of course, the occurrence, the depth and the shape of a recession, impossible for us sitting at this table to predict. What I can talk about is how the conversations with hospital executives have gone. I think, in general, their perspective is to serve their patient population as best they can with technologies that will get the outcomes they want at the price points they want. I think we have been doing well with that. I think both on the product side and our ability to demonstrate economic viability and contribution margin gains for hospitals has been powerful and I think that gives us some strength going into the future. That said, depending on how hard and deep it is, then it becomes a question of what they want to offer their patient population and what kind of decisions they are going to have to make. I also think that relative to past cycles, Intuitive has a couple of more tools in the toolbox in terms of leasing portfolios and some other things. Hard to predict where it will go. I think our ability to both demonstrate value and adjust to capital placement models it\u2019s a little stronger than it was in past years.\nOperator: Thank you. And next we have Adam Maeder with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nAdam Maeder: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question and congratulations on a nice quarter. I wanted to ask about Ion, which if I am looking at it correctly, had a record placement for installs with also some very nice volume trends. So Gary or Jamie, can you just talk about kind of what\u2019s driving that inflection in system placements? And then you referenced the PRECIsE data that was presented at CHEST I think earlier today, as well as the journal publication coming next year. Just talk about any potential impact to adoption looking forward.\nGary Guthart: I will jump in and Jamie you can help. I think we are still in the early market. We are pleased with the growth and the customer feedback that we have been getting the -- that -- and when we talk to them and survey our customers their satisfaction levels are very high with the Ion product. I think it\u2019s driven by a couple of things. The preliminary data that\u2019s come out of the PRECIsE trial that\u2019s already been talked out and now the later data I think was attractive to the customer base. I think the other thing going on is that as we have installed additional sites and helped them bring their programs up, I think they are able to replicate that data. I think that it\u2019s being commonly adopted. And I think that is having a compounding effect, the idea that the early publications are being repeated in the hands of new teams that are coming on board gives them confidence and this is a little bit of word of mouth amongst the pulmonology community, gives them confidence that they can get what\u2019s being published and I think that\u2019s been strong for us. Jamie, any comments?\nJamie Samath: I would just say there\u2019s some endorsement of the architectural choices that we made with respect in particular to the diameter of the catheter, which makes a real difference to diagnosis of smaller lesions and you see that in the clinical data. I think that the engineering and the commercial teams have really executed really well through the period since we launched the product. And I do think that there\u2019s a halo effect of kind of word of mouth across IPs and users of the product and I think in combination with clinical data, that\u2019s had a positive effect on our progress so far. I wouldn\u2019t characterize how we have progressed so far as an inflection specifically, I think we have made continued progression.\nOperator: Thank you. And next we have the line of Matt Miksic with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMatt Miksic: Great. Thank you so much for taking the question and right, it\u2019s a impressive quarter, so congrats on that as well. The -- I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things you talked about, one, in terms of the macro factors kind of affecting the market and your customers and your business a little bit. One being kind of the staffing challenges that some of these centers are facing. Curious how that is at all is affecting the way either procedures are coming back or demand for system is evolving here? And then into 2023, just curious some of the costs that you have talked about, everyone\u2019s talked about. What -- I know it\u2019s early to ask this kind of question, but your thoughts at this point as to how we should think about those costs evolving in 2023, it\u2019s either sort of rising and staying or rising and then being able to be managed down or just in terms of your cost structure and how it\u2019s increased, any thoughts you have would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.\nJamie Samath: Maybe the second part of the question I will take, Matt. So we are not going to give anything specific with respect to 2023 numbers. We will wait until January to do that when we conventionally provide guidance. I think what we have said with respect to operating expenses in 2023 for the reasons Gary described, the growth rate for that spending will be lower than the growth rate that we experienced in 2022 and a significant component of that is the number of people that we will hire next year. And again, what Gary described was, given the employees that we have hired, there\u2019s a period here where we are going to ensure that we effectively onboard those new hires and get them to a state of productivity and this will be a period for us to go through that kind of absorption phase. I will let Gary respond to the first part.\nGary Guthart: Yeah. Matt, could you -- I am sorry, I just missed a little bit of that first part of the question. Can you just restate that one?\nMatt Miksic: Sure. Just in the context of factors affecting the ebbs and flows recovery, what have you of procedures and system -- new system trends, how staffing -- hospital staffing or challenges there are affecting those trends in your business if at all?\nGary Guthart: Yeah. Fair question. It\u2019s interesting. I think there\u2019s a put and a take there. On the tough side, of course, if hospital staffing is really challenged, particularly as it relates to OR staff, that can limit procedures that they will perform. In general, I think, that folks are paying more to get OR staffed, recognizing they want to both treat those patients and it\u2019s important to the revenue line of the hospital. So it\u2019s primarily inflationary pressure as it relates to what\u2019s happening in the OR in our space. The interesting part is that high quality MIS, minimally invasive surgery, of which we enable helps to offset some of the staffing requirements post-surgery. It\u2019s quite clear, actually. So if they can do the procedure then the types of surgeries we do, it will save them some back end costs in staffing. So there\u2019s a little bit of a seesaw there. So far I don\u2019t think it\u2019s improving in terms of staffing constraints very quickly. It does sound like it\u2019s stabilized and maybe on the slight upside of improvement. Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: All right. We have the line of Drew Ranieri with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDrew Ranieri: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Gary, just maybe on Ion, can you -- I know it\u2019s early days as you are kind of building the cells commercially, but a couple of questions. One is, are you supply constrained at all from meeting demand and then can you just give us a sense of maybe where you are in account penetration for Ion, whether it\u2019s to interventional pulmonologist or at a hospital level? Thank you.\nGary Guthart: On the supply side, we are working extremely hard to meet demand on the capital side. I think we are about there. We are pretty close, pretty close to balanced. I don\u2019t think we are way ahead or way behind. And likewise, on the consumable or per procedure side, we are working extremely hard to meet demand and I think we are slightly behind, not way ahead and not way behind. We are probably running close but pushing hard to keep growing. So on the penetration side, I think, we are a little bit early to go into share mix and things like that, I think we are not quite ready to describe where we are either on the account side or on the pulmonology side. So we will save that for a future call. Anyway, thank you. That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim, better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams, and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better, where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T event conferencing. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gary Guthart",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today. Our business fundamentals strengthened in Q3 with 20% procedure growth in da Vinci procedures compared with Q3 of last year and solid performance in each of our global regions. Our capital placements reflected 13% growth in our installed base to meet procedure demand accompanied by continued increases in utilization per system per year, healthy indicators for our customers and for us. Ion also experienced increases in installs, procedures performed and annualized system utilization. Supply chain challenges while still present are abating from their pandemic peaks. Looking more closely at procedures, 20% growth is up from 14% last quarter and above our three-year compound annual growth rate of 16% during the pandemic. General surgery, our largest procedure category, is growing at the fastest rate of any category fueled by bariatric surgery, cholecystectomy, hernia repair and other foregut procedures in the United States. In Europe, several countries are growing nicely with diversified use beyond urology. Germany, the UK and Ireland, Italy and Spain stood out in the quarter. In Asia, Japanese procedure growth accelerated relative to Q2 and Korean growth remained solid. Procedures in both countries are also diversifying beyond urology. In China, procedure growth was just above our global average, hampered in part by regional rolling lockdowns that continue to impact procedures and utilization. Turning to capital, we placed 305 systems in the quarter compared with 336 in Q3 a year ago and 279 last quarter. Strong procedure demand is supporting da Vinci installed base growth of 13% in the quarter. Per system utilization grew 7% in the quarter, up from our three-year compound annual growth of 5% over the pandemic. Utilization was aided by recovery from a softer U.S. procedure quarter last year, as well as customer performance of more types of procedures and higher volume categories and increases in customer efficiency. SI trade-ins continued to slow given the decline in remaining trade-in opportunity. Ion placements grew to 50 this quarter, up from 28 last year and 41 last quarter, reflecting continued growth in an early market. Overall, our customers are acquiring systems where there is opportunity for procedure growth. On the investment front, we continue to focus on our platforms in multiport endoluminal, single port and digital through indication and regional regulatory expansions, innovation in products and services that meet customer needs and product quality and cost refinements. We expect our new platforms to approach our historical levels of contribution margin over time, progress year-to-date has met our expectations. With regard to our expenses this quarter, we moderated headcount growth to focus on deeply integrating those employees who joined us in the past several quarters. Going into 2023, we expect the rate of growth in fixed expenses to slow as we pursue leverage in our enabling functions and sequence some of our forward investments. We have had a solid quarter achieving product and services milestones. We continue to expand access to our multiport products, training and services globally. Standouts in the quarter include record global quarterly new surgeon training completions to first case and accreditation of our technology training pathway by the Royal College of Surgeons in the UK. For Ion, we submitted our registration application in China, and we obtained German regulatory clinical study approval for ion ablation technology, which start -- which starts our clinical journey towards enabling interventions beyond biopsy. Ion procedures grew 211% in the quarter. Turning to our single-port platform, da Vinci SP, procedures grew 46% year-over-year, with particular strength in Korea, where our SP team launched next-generation SP instruments and our Firefly-enabled endoscope. We also received PMDA clearance in the quarter, market SP in Japan across a broad set of clinical indications similar to the indications SP has in Korea. In our digital portfolio, our My Intuitive app and PORTaL are being adopted broadly in regions in which they are released as the go-to digital portal for da Vinci customers. Installs of our in-room computing platform, Intuitive Hub grew 21% over the third quarter last year and software updates to our Hub installed base improved usability and enabled telepresence. In summary, our core business strengthened in the quarter as acute pandemic impact softened. We are managing spend growth, while investing in core growth opportunities for the future. I will now pass the time over to Jamie to take us through our finances and some persistent macroeconomic issues in greater detail. What we are seeing on that side, on the capital side is that, where we see healthy procedure growth, the installed base growth is keeping pace and you are absolutely right in your question to kind of link utilization growth with installed base growth. On the utilization side, the 7% is higher than the norm. It's got a little artifact in it we think, which is a year ago third quarter was a little bit suppressed because of the Delta variant. So I think it's hard to keep doing 7% quarterly. If the customers could do that, we would be delighted. It's -- utilization is good for them, it's good for us and it's fine, it's just hard to move in a durable way because of all the workflow issues in the hospital at large, not just robotics, but just across the system. So we are seeing both. I think the capital side what we have seen here is that capital is available to be competed for if you can become a high priority within the hospital to get it. So it's not so much that the capital environment is easy as it is competitive and if you can rise on the party list, then we will find that the loop and we are seeing that in installed base growth in greenfields and in Ion. Okay. On the issue of kind of the quality of growth on urology and gynecology, Brian, I am going to kick that to you. On just a follow-up point to Brian, your answer, I think, the other thing is that while we are mature in urology and gynecology in the United States, there's still a little growth there too. But outside the United States and Europe and Asia, we are still relatively early and we think that in those two categories we will continue to see growth. Jamie, just a follow-up point on your answer on the diagnostics side, you were saying it started to come back and we are seeing a little bit of an uptick. It is absolutely clear that there's been a trough or a bolus of people who stayed out of diagnostic pipelines and that hasn't fully recovered. And their disease is progressing. That is also absolutely clear in the literature. So how big that is and what that looks like as they come back into the health system in terms of surgery and da Vinci surgery, you are just going to have to wait and see. It's a hard thing to measure, but I think there's a bolus out there and it's unfortunate given disease progression. The -- we watch it. We want to make sure that we are efficient stewards of our expenses and our capital and where we see an efficiency we will pursue it. That's what I have been messaging and that's what I was talking about here in the script. We think there are opportunities for us to increase our productivity and to do a better job onboarding from the staff we have brought in, helping them become more productive more quickly. We think there are really good opportunities in our new platforms, the things we have been talking to you about. Ion is growing nicely. SP, as we pursue additional indications. I think will be quite strong and we are pleased with multiport currently what's in the market, the things we are working on, as well as our digital tools. So we think those things are important. We don't want to starve them. But we will sequence them. So it's a balanced approach. Some of it is making sure that our growth engines remain intact and we continue to innovate. Other parts are just making sure that we are being efficient with our use of capital and that we are building a lean organization as we grow. Jamie, you can speak a little bit to the expense characterization as you see it. Yeah. I love that question. The -- there's a couple of things. On the kind of the baseline, you need to gather enough of the right data to characterize variability of care teams and variability of patients. So there's a patient population, it's got variability and you have got care team or physician variability as well. And getting the right data streams, getting them stored and figuring out how to do the right kind of assessment or analysis on them, curating that data, making sure it's annotated properly, some basic stuff that you have to do to be able to look for meaningful sources of variation. We are well down that pathway in terms of getting the right data streams, having the right conversations with our customers and starting to do the analysis. So I am excited by it. As we look at how to deliver that, we are still in a I think surgical science discovery phase. We are partnered with many of the top hospitals -- academic hospitals around the world looking at surgical data science, starting to figure out sources of variation and drawing it back to causality, not just correlation. So I think the baseline is there, the ability to collect and gather that data, I think our relationships with top tier researchers are in place and we are starting to see early signals that look really good. Final point I'd make is there are some basic things we can do that are logical and not extraordinarily complicated that can help personalized learning pathways and training pathways, and we are starting to work through that now. That's kinds of technologies that will come out into the field first. So I think it was a long-term journey. Some of the things we talked to you about Intuitive Hub or some of the baseline capabilities there in terms of the right data collected, annotated the right way and shared with the right hospital customers to get us good outcomes.

Jamie, any comments? Yeah. Matt, could you -- I am sorry, I just missed a little bit of that first part of the question. Can you just restate that one? Yeah. Fair question. It's interesting. I think there's a put and a take there. On the tough side, of course, if hospital staffing is really challenged, particularly as it relates to OR staff, that can limit procedures that they will perform. In general, I think, that folks are paying more to get OR staffed, recognizing they want to both treat those patients and it's important to the revenue line of the hospital. So it's primarily inflationary pressure as it relates to what's happening in the OR in our space. The interesting part is that high quality MIS, minimally invasive surgery, of which we enable helps to offset some of the staffing requirements post-surgery. It's quite clear, actually. So if they can do the procedure then the types of surgeries we do, it will save them some back end costs in staffing. So there's a little bit of a seesaw there. So far I don't think it's improving in terms of staffing constraints very quickly. It does sound like it's stabilized and maybe on the slight upside of improvement. Operator, we have time for one more question. On the supply side, we are working extremely hard to meet demand on the capital side. I think we are about there. We are pretty close, pretty close to balanced. I don't think we are way ahead or way behind. And likewise, on the consumable or per procedure side, we are working extremely hard to meet demand and I think we are slightly behind, not way ahead and not way behind. We are probably running close but pushing hard to keep growing. So on the penetration side, I think, we are a little bit early to go into share mix and things like that, I think we are not quite ready to describe where we are either on the account side or on the pulmonology side. So we will save that for a future call. Anyway, thank you. That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim, better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams, and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better, where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months."

            "name": "Jamie Samath",
            "content": "Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. In Q3, growth in procedures, the installed base of da Vinci systems and average system utilization was healthy. The strength of these key business drivers resulted in a pro forma operating margin of 36% and pro forma EPS of $1.19. Simultaneously, we saw headwinds from the strong U.S. dollar, lingering supply chain issues and inflation, which together negatively impacted pro forma operating margin by approximately 2 percentage points compared to the third quarter of last year. I will take you through these details. Q3 procedure growth of 20% reflected an increase in U.S. procedures of 18% and OUS procedure growth of 24%. U.S. procedure growth reflected a favorable comparison to the year ago quarter given the impact of the Delta variant last year. On a three-year compound annual growth rate basis, U.S. procedures grew approximately 13%. In China, our second largest market during the quarter procedures continued to recover from the impact of COVID-related lockdowns that we described on last quarter's earnings call. However, we continue to see regional lockdowns occur as COVID cases rise. Turning to capital, we placed 305 systems in the third quarter, 9% lower than the 336 systems we placed last year. Third quarter system placements included approximately 15 systems that were delayed at the end of last quarter due to component supply delays. There were 71 trading transactions in the quarter, as compared to 136 in Q3 of 2021, reflecting the decline in the number of SIs remaining in the installed base. As of the end of Q3, there were approximately 739 SIs remaining in the installed base, of which 191 are in the U.S. Excluding trade-in transactions global system placements grew 17% from last year. The installed base of da Vinci systems grew approximately 13% year-over-year, consistent with recent trends. The utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, increased almost 7% compared to last year. Using a three-year compound annual growth rate, third quarter utilization was consistent with historical averages, increasing almost 5%. Average system utilization in the U.S. grew 6% year-over-year, an improvement from the 1% decline in utilization in Q2. As a result of our procedure and capital performance, Q3 revenue was $1.56 billion, an increase of 11% from the third quarter of 2021. On a constant currency basis, third quarter revenue grew approximately 15%. In the third quarter, revenue denominated in non-USD currencies represented 22% of total revenue. On a revenue weighted basis, using current exchange rates, net of hedges in place for Q4, the U.S. dollar is approximately 3% stronger than the rates realized in Q3. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows, in the U.S., we placed 175 systems in the third quarter, lower than the 227 in Q3 of 2021, reflecting a decline of 66 systems associated with trade-in transactions and a challenging macroeconomic environment. Outside the U.S., we placed 130 systems in the third quarter, compared with 109 last year. Current quarter system placements included 54 into Europe, 32 into Japan and 14 into China, compared with 47 into Europe, 20 into Japan and 17 into China in the third quarter of 2021. As of the end of Q3 2022, there were 40 systems remaining under the current quota in China, which is also available to the three domestic competitors that have completed local registration with NMPA. Markets that are served through distributors have represented approximately 10% of system placements so far this year. Our distribution partners purchased product from us in U.S. dollars and sell in their local currencies. While we have not experienced a significant impact so far, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar reduces distributor margins and may cause delays in capital purchases. Leasing represented 37% of Q3 placements, compared with 42% last quarter and 41% in the third quarter of 2021. The lower lease mix is a function of customer and regional mix, and while leasing will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time. Third quarter system average selling prices were $1.5 million consistent with last quarter. System ASPs were negatively impacted by a higher trade-in mix and the impact of FX, offset by a higher mix of Xi dual console placements. We recognized $17 million of lease buyout revenue in the third quarter, compared with $22 million last quarter and $25 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,800, compared with approximately $1,900 for both last quarter and last year. On a year-over-year basis, FX negatively impacted I&A per procedure by approximately $50. The remainder of the year-over-year reduction was primarily a result of customer ordering patterns. During the quarter, our distributors and customers in certain OUS markets reduced their inventory as supply chain predictability moderately improved. We placed 50 Ion systems in the quarter, as compared to 28 in the third quarter of last year. The installed base of Ion systems is now 254 systems, of which 112 are under operating lease arrangements. Third quarter Ion procedures of approximately 6,400 increased 211% on a year-over-year basis. Ion is in the new MDR regulatory review process in Europe, and during the quarter, we submitted Ion into the regulatory process in China. As a reminder, regulatory review timelines in China are lengthy. Moving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2022 was 69.8%, compared with 71.3% for the third quarter of 2021 and 69.2% last quarter. Q3 pro forma gross margin included a one-time benefit of approximately 50 basis points relating to the favorable conclusion of certain indirect tax matters. Pro forma gross margin was lower than last year, primarily due to the stronger U.S. dollar, manufacturing and logistics inefficiencies as a result of the supply chain environment, higher component pricing and increased fixed costs relative to revenue. Indicators of supply and inventory held modestly improved in the quarter but remained well below pre-pandemic levels. Pro forma operating expenses increased 24% compared with third quarter of 2021, driven by increased headcount, higher R&D related project costs and higher travel costs. Growth in operating expenses has been primarily in support of our Ion platform, next-generation robotics capabilities, our digital capabilities and expansion of our infrastructure to allow us to effectively scale. We are also seeing higher regulatory costs as a result of increased regulatory requirements globally and expansion of our new platforms into OUS markets. As Gary mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we slowed our hiring pace, adding approximately 530 employees lower than the 700-plus employees we have added per quarter in the last three quarters. As we look forward to 2023, we expect our operating expense growth will be lower than the growth for this year. The slowing growth rate of operating expenses reflects the completion of some of our infrastructure and business process improvement investments and planned leverage in our enabling functions. As part of our planning process, we are also conducting a review of our capital expenditure priorities and we will provide an update as to the outcome of this review on the next call. Within this framework, we will continue to invest in our new platforms, Ion and SP, next-generation capabilities and our digital ecosystem, given the return profiles we see for those investments. Pro forma other income was $7.2 million for Q3, lower than $10.4 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange losses from re-measurement of the balance sheet resulting from the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 23.4%, in line with our expectations. Third quarter 2022 pro forma net income was $429 million or $1.19 per share, compared with $435 million and also $1.19 per share for the third quarter of last year. Capital expenditures in Q3 were $153 million, primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities footprint and increase manufacturing capacity. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $324 million or $0.90 per share for the third quarter of 2022, compared with GAAP net income of $381 million or $1.04 per share for the third quarter of 2021. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, litigation charges and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.4 billion, compared with $8.2 billion at the end of Q2. The sequential reduction in cash and investments reflected share repurchases and capital expenditures, partially offset by cash from operating activities. During the quarter, we completed a $1 billion ASR in addition to the $607 million of shares repurchased in the first half. Since the end of 2021, our diluted share count has decreased by approximately 7 million shares or 2% and we have a remaining authorization to repurchase our shares of $2.5 billion. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian, who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2022. On the diagnostic pipelines, what we continue to see for the most part is relatively steady in terms of the tests that are occurring, mostly a little below the volumes that we saw pre-pandemic. The one exception that we have seen in the U.S. in kind of recent trends is a tick up in colonoscopies. I wouldn't say that this evidence that that's impacted da Vinci procedures yet as that's a recent trend, obviously, we are encouraged by the fact that more patients are able to get back to having those diagnostic tests and we will see how that plays out in terms of surgery. There's just a couple of framing comments I'd make, Larry. If you look at the midpoint of the procedure guidance we provided, on a three-year CAGR basis, that's procedure growth of about 15%, just under -- just over 15%. You do the same for our OpEx guidance, that's just under 15%. So, kind of back to 2019 on a three-year CAGR basis, procedure growth and spending growth relatively in line. Just one other thing I'd highlight to make a point, if you look at the reported revenue growth for Q3 and 11% year-over-year. If you look at our recurring revenue growth, that's about 80% of our total revenue, 16%. If you adjust that on a constant currency basis, it's 20% revenue growth and so comparable with the 20% procedure growth. When you look back at 2018, 2019, generally, procedure growth and revenue growth are relatively similar. You are seeing a disconnect right now for the reasons we have described, the lower trade-in volumes, trade-in volumes so far this year are down 40% from the prior year and you are seeing the impact of FX as we have described. And so there are some macro and secular level impacts on what's happening in the P&L this year. Specifically on spending, we kind of described it in the script. There are some infrastructure investments that we have been making that start to complete and that creates the opportunity for us to spend at a lower growth rate, and given the work that we have done and the investments that we have made, we are going to look for some leverage in our enabling functions, particularly as we get into next year. Final thing that Gary mentioned was as you look at kind of our pipeline, there's some natural sequencing that you will do with respect to some of our programmatic spending next year and those factors play into the slowing operating expense growth rate that we have described. Just a couple of things I'd highlight. As we have spoken to customers and this is mostly anecdotal, you do see some input that staffing pressures are easing a little bit, particularly with respect to vacation rates and labor costs. Those two factors are still way above pre-pandemic levels, but you see a little bit of improvement in the quarter, at least based on both those anecdotes and the survey work that we have seen. In Q2 and Q3, you saw customers going through the process of reexamining their capital budgets and that causes some delays in capital investments, and obviously, they reprioritize what they invest in. I think robotic surgery is still an area of potential value for customers. That does cause some delays. On the OUS side, we haven't seen a significant impact yet so far in terms of capital spending by those customers. Generally, we are at earlier stages of adoption. The payer structures are different and so far at least what we have seen is kind of nice capital numbers in the OUS markets, as you can see from the kind of comparisons. If you look at European placements in Q3, they were up 15%, placements in Asia were up 36% year-over-year. So we haven't seen anything so far. I would say there are obviously economic risks, particularly in Europe with the energy situation there, the situation with Ukraine and Russia, we haven't seen those manifest yet. Just with respect to prior cycles and this one actually, Matt, is a little interesting in so far as we indicated in Q1, we saw some softness in the capital pipeline in Q1 and Q2, and to some extent, that continued in Q3. If I look back at prior cycles in 2008, you saw three quarters of a year-over-year decline in capital placements, 2013 I think we saw five quarters in a row of declining capital placements and then when COVID hit in 2020, again, three quarters in a row. I only give those as reference points. I don't think we can say that those are indicative as to what may happen if and when there's a recession in the U.S. or beyond. So, I think, honestly, if you look at the progression of the economic projections, it's pretty complex and hard to call at this point. So we just give those historical reference points. I would just say there's some endorsement of the architectural choices that we made with respect in particular to the diameter of the catheter, which makes a real difference to diagnosis of smaller lesions and you see that in the clinical data. I think that the engineering and the commercial teams have really executed really well through the period since we launched the product. And I do think that there's a halo effect of kind of word of mouth across IPs and users of the product and I think in combination with clinical data, that's had a positive effect on our progress so far. I wouldn't characterize how we have progressed so far as an inflection specifically, I think we have made continued progression. Maybe the second part of the question I will take, Matt. So we are not going to give anything specific with respect to 2023 numbers. We will wait until January to do that when we conventionally provide guidance. I think what we have said with respect to operating expenses in 2023 for the reasons Gary described, the growth rate for that spending will be lower than the growth rate that we experienced in 2022 and a significant component of that is the number of people that we will hire next year. And again, what Gary described was, given the employees that we have hired, there's a period here where we are going to ensure that we effectively onboard those new hires and get them to a state of productivity and this will be a period for us to go through that kind of absorption phase. I will let Gary respond to the first part."

At this time all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, it's my pleasure to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations with Intuitive Surgical, Mr. Brian King. Please go ahead.\nBrian King: Thank you. So good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive's second quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; and Jamie Samath, our CFO. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 3, 2022, and Form 10-Q filed on April 22, 2022. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our second quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Jamie will provide a review of our financial results, and I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2022. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. And with that, I will turn it over to Gary.\nGary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. Our Q2 results reflect both environmental and Intuitive's specific headwinds accompanied by underlying business strength. Procedures in the quarter grew 14% over last year despite pressure from COVID-driven lockdowns in China, our second largest market. Capital placements slowed from a year ago due to a combination of factors we described last quarter and which I will review shortly. Overall pressure from COVID lockdowns impacted procedures in the quarter modestly while reduced trade-ins and supply chain timing impacted our capital placements more significantly. The leading indicator of the health of our business, procedure demand, remains healthy. Starting first with procedures. I am encouraged by 14% growth in the quarter, reflecting strength in U.S. general surgery and solid growth extending beyond urology outside the United States. U.S. procedure growth was led by bariatric surgery, cholecystectomy and colorectal procedures with continued growth in hernia repair. In OUS markets, procedures grew 22% in the quarter in spite of the COVID lockdown in China. Outside the U.S., we are seeing strength in urology now accompanied by diversified growth in other procedures. For example, in Japan, growth was strong in general surgery, including rectal resection. In the UK and Ireland, growth was strong in gynecology and general surgery. And in France, gynecology and general surgery experienced solid growth. System utilization in several OUS countries has been increasing in recent quarters as procedure adoption diversifies increasing value for our customers and for Intuitive. This is a result of the investments we made in key country markets starting several years ago. Turning to da Vinci capital placements. We placed 279 systems in the quarter, down from 328 in Q2 2021. In the da Vinci business, we see three causes for the decline in placements relative to a year ago. As our customers have standardized on generation four da Vinci systems, the installed base of third generation systems has declined, lowering the trade-in population, particularly in the United States. Next, supply chain disruption continued in the quarter with semiconductor component delays impacting the timing of system builds, leaving us challenged to match some customer orders at quarter end. Lastly, we've seen hospital capital spending pressure grow in our part of the capital equipment space over the past two quarters, incenting customers to seek efficiency gains on existing capital before acquiring new capacity. Component supply constraints remain a risk, and our operating teams are working hard to shelter our customers for most of these pressures. Capital placements in more mature markets are a mix of core demand for procedures and trade-in opportunities. The need for high-quality robotic-assisted surgery remains healthy. Incremental capital demand at the customer is a function of system utilization and procedure growth. On the system utilization side, our compound annual growth rate remains at historic levels of 5% over the past three-year period. System utilization in the U.S. over the past year was slightly down as procedure growth rate over the past year roughly matched the system installed base growth. In contrast, system utilization in many OUS markets has been rising as procedures diversify. Overall, we prioritize system utilization growth for customers as it increases the value to them of their investments and is aligned with long-term health for Intuitive. Turning to our innovation engines and new products and services, we placed 41 Ion systems, up from 20 in Q2 of last year. Given its stage of maturity, Ion capital demand procedure growth as hospitals seek to build initial capability. With the Ion clinical installed base now at 204 systems, Ion utilization has been growing nicely along with encouraging early capital replacements. We received 510(k) clearance for our integration of Ion with Siemens Cios Spin cone-beam CT. This combination improves registration and targeting precision for Ion in the lung and is being well received by our customers. We remain focused on strengthening clinical outcomes in lung care, a fantastic customer experience and operational excellence in the Ion program. In our multiport ecosystem, we initiated our first phase U.S. launch of our eight millimeter stapler designed to work in small anatomical spaces, for example, in thoracic surgery. Early customer feedback has been encouraging. In China, we're preparing to launch our SureForm 45 and 60 millimeter staplers and our latest endoscope, Endoscope Plus. All three will continue to support growth in general surgery and thoracic procedures. For da Vinci SP, we have expanded the number of colorectal IDE sites to help accelerate accrual, and we submitted another regulatory package for SP imaging and accessories in Japan, as we work on the necessary clearances to support an SP launch in the country. For our digital tools, Intuitive Hub installs grew nicely again in the quarter, and we're focused on ensuring outstanding customer experiences with data capture and media management, along with increasing utilization over time. On spending, we are committed to our innovation programs because we believe the forward opportunity for our products and services are important to our customers and to the company. We have some natural shock absorbers that decrease some of our variable spending as a result of the slowdown in da Vinci capital placements. We are also planning for decelerating spend growth after we complete some infrastructure projects, we need to support the company's expansion. Given our confidence in the future of our business, we have also returned cash to shareholders in the form of buybacks in the quarter. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie who will take you through our finances in greater detail.\nJamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Q2 procedure growth of 14% reflected an increase in U.S. procedures of 11% and OUS procedure growth of 22%. As a reminder procedures in the U.S. in the second quarter of last year included a recovery of procedures that were delayed as a result of the significant impact of Omicron variant. Brian will provide additional procedure commentary later in the call. We placed 279 systems in the second quarter as compared to 328 systems in the second quarter of 2021 and 311 systems last quarter. Q2 system placements were 15% lower than the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to a significant decline in trade-in transactions. There were 56 trade-in transactions in the quarter as compared to 125 in Q2 of 2021, reflecting the decline in the number of SIs remaining in the installed base. The supply chain environment continues to be challenging and during the quarter we experienced delays in the supply of certain semiconductor components that caused manufacturing output of da Vinci systems to be later in the quarter than historical norms. As a result, a number of systems that we would have expected to place in the latter part of June experienced minor delays and were shipped and installed in July. We indicated on last quarter\u2019s call that we had experienced softening in the U.S. capital pipeline. That softness persisted in Q2. Financial pressures have increased on hospitals, given higher inflation, increasing interest rates, supply chain challenges, and continued staffing shortages. Some of the larger IDNs have indicated that as a consequence of the financial pressures they face, they are lowering their capital investment plans and tightening operational budgets. We expected demand for capital, particularly in the U.S., will be impacted while macro conditions remain challenging. Where a particular hospital requires additional da Vinci capacity, given growth in their programs, we will leverage our flexible acquisition models to meet the financial objectives of our customers. Given the system placements in Q2, the installed base of da Vinci systems grew approximately 13% year-over-year. Utilization of clinical systems in the field measured by procedures per system increased approximately 1% compared to last year. Using a three-year compound annual growth rate second quarter utilization grew almost 5%, which is in line with historical averages. In more mature markets like the U.S. capital demand is sensitive to procedure growth. And therefore we monitor changes in system utilization closely. As a result of our procedure and capital performance, Q2 revenue was $1.52 billion, an increase of 4% from the second quarter of 2021. On a constant currency basis second quarter revenue grew approximately 6% over last year. It is worth highlighting that recurring revenue grew 14% year-over-year to $1.24 billion representing 81% of total revenue. Additional revenue, statistics and trends are as follows: in the U.S., we've placed 150 systems in the second quarter lower than the 213 in Q2 of 2021, reflecting a decline of 59 systems associated with trade-in transactions, a softer demand environment, and the delay of some system placements into July. The remaining installed base of SI systems in the U.S. is approximately 230 systems. Outside the U.S., we placed 129 systems in the second quarter compared with 115 in the second quarter of 2021. Current core assistant placements included 78 into Europe, 18 into Japan, and 15 into China, compared with 63 into Europe, 16 into Japan, and 19 into China in the second quarter of 2021. As of the end of Q2 2022, there were 48 systems remaining under the current quarter in China, which is also available to competitors that have received local regulatory clearance. Globally, trade-in transactions represented 20% of placements in the quarter, compared to 38% for full year 2021 and 48% for full year 2020. As we have previously indicated, given the lower number of older generation systems in the field, we expect the volume of trade-ins to be significantly lower in 2022, as compared to last year. Leasing represented 42% of Q2 placements compared with 35% last quarter and 33% in the second quarter of 2021, the higher lease mix primarily reflected an increase in the proportion of O-U.S. customers that lease a system in the quarter versus purchased, driven in particular by customers in Europe. While leasing will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time. Second quarter system average selling prices were $1.50 million slightly lower than the $1.54 million last quarter, although system ASPs were roughly flat, lower trade-in volumes benefitted Q2 ASP, offset by an unfavorable impact from the stronger U.S. dollar and a higher mix of lower price Xi systems, primarily driven by customers in Europe. We recognized $22 million of lease buyout revenue in the second quarter compared with $16 million last quarter and $26 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,900 per procedure, compared with $1,870 last quarter and $1,940 in the second quarter of 2021. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the benefit of stocking orders in Q2 of 2021 associated with the launch of our extended use instruments program and an unfavorable FX impact from the stronger U.S. dollar. The sequential increase reflects a higher proportion of stapling and advanced energy revenue. Revenue for these categories combined grew 22% as compared to the second quarter of last year. We placed 41 Ion systems in the quarter as compared to 20 Ion placements in the second quarter of last year. The installed base of Ion systems is now 204 systems of which 90 are under operating lease arrangements. Second core Ion procedures of approximately 5,200 increased 251% compared to the second core of 2021. Ion is in the new MDR regulatory review process in Europe and our efforts to pursue a submission in China continue to make progress. Five of the systems placed in the second quarter were SP systems, resulting in an installed base of 111. Second core SP procedures grew approximately 28% year-over-year. One of the areas of potential clinical differentiation for SP is in narrow access surgery. For example, in transoral robotic surgical or TORS procedures, for malignant TORS procedures based on the last four quarters, we estimate SP market share in the U.S. to be just under 20%. Growth of the SP platform will continue to be gated by additional clinical indications and clearances in markets beyond the U.S. and Korea. Moving on to the rest of the P&L, pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of 2022 was 69.2% compared with 71.7% for the second quarter of 2021 and 69.8% last quarter. Pro forma gross margin was lower primarily as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar, higher logistics costs, increased component pricing and increased fixed cost relative to revenue. As we invest in our infrastructure and manufacturing capacity to serve our long-term needs. Pro forma operating expenses increased 23% compared with the second quarter of 2021. The increase in second quarter operating expenses from a year ago, reflected an increase in headcount, higher R&D-related project costs and higher travel costs, including the impact of inflation. Given the early stages of our newer platforms, Ion and SP and our digital ecosystem, we expect to continue to invest in R&D, given the return profile of these investments. Spending in SG&A will be more closely linked to our procedure and revenue performance, and we will continue to pursue plans to invest in infrastructure and business process automation to ensure we can efficiently and effectively scale. Pro forma operating margin for Q2 was 35% as compared to 40% for the full year 2021. As compared to the second quarter of last year, the net impact of FX, inflation and manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the supply chain environment is a reduction in operating margin of approximately 2%. Our pro forma tax rate \u2013 effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22.3%, in line with our expectations. Second quarter 2022 pro forma net income was $415 million or $1.14 per share compared with $475 million or $1.30 per share for the second quarter of 2021. Capital expenditures in Q2 were $131 million, primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities footprint, increased manufacturing capacity and automation of certain production lines. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $308 million or $0.85 per share for the second quarter of 2022, compared with GAAP net income of $517 million or $1.42 per share for the second quarter of 2021. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $8.2 billion, compared with $8.4 billion at the end of Q1. The sequential reduction in cash and investments primarily reflected share repurchases and capital expenditures, partially offset by cash from operating activities. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent and are as follows: first, to organically invest in the business, given the significant opportunities we see to develop differentiated technology and drive adoption of our products. Second, to acquire external technology that creates value for our customers and/or accelerate development timelines or acquisitions that accelerate our growth. Third, we return excess cash to shareholders and look to do so efficiently. In Q2, we repurchased 2.2 million of our shares at an average price of $224 per share for a total expenditure of $500 million. Concurrent with today\u2019s earnings release, our Board of Directors have improved an increase to the share repurchase authorization to $3.5 billion. With that, I would like to turn it over to Brian, who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2022.\nBrian King: Thank you, Jamie. Our overall second quarter 2022 procedure growth was 14%, compared to 68% for the second quarter of 2021, which we believe benefited from a number of procedures which had previously been deferred due to COVID-19. The three-year compound annual growth rate was 16% between the second quarter of 2019 and second quarter of 2022. In the U.S., second quarter 2022 procedure growth was 11% year-over-year, compared to 77% for the second quarter of 2021 and 16% last quarter. On a three-year compound annual growth basis, U.S. procedure growth was 14%. Q2 procedure growth continued to be driven by general surgery, with particular strength in bariatrics, cholecystectomy and colorectal, while hernia and foregut were also strong contributors. Growth in mature urology and gynecology procedures also continue but at a moderate pace in the low-single digits. Outside of the U.S., second quarter procedure volume grew approximately 22%, compared with 51% for the second quarter of 2021 and 25% last quarter. Despite COVID-related restrictions in China, on a three-year compound annual growth basis, procedure growth was 20%. Turning to Europe. Procedure growth was led by strong growth in Italy, UK and Germany. In all three regions noted, procedure growth was strong in general surgery and gynecology. In Italy, growth in these procedures outside of urology was led by general surgery, specifically in colorectal and HPV procedures. In Germany, growth in these categories was led by early stage growth in colorectal surgery and benign hysterectomy. Year-over-year procedure growth in these non-urology procedures was almost 3 times higher than urology. While in the UK, benign hysterectomy and colorectal resection experienced strong early-stage growth. In Asia, we experienced strong growth in Japan, while in China, procedures remain below expectations as government restrictions continued due to COVID infections that persisted throughout most of the quarter. In Japan, growth in general surgery and gynecology continued to be strong with robust growth, specifically in benign hysterectomy, rectal resection and gastrectomy. In addition, prostatectomy continued with solid double-digit growth, reflecting a recovery when compared to the prior year, which was constrained by COVID. Further contributing to procedure strength was early growth in the adoption of newly reimbursed procedures namely colon resection and nephrectomy procedures. In China, second quarter procedure growth continued to be negatively impacted by regional lockdowns due to ongoing COVID infections that affected many large cities throughout most of the quarter. Despite the restrictions, China experienced modest year-over-year growth and began to show signs of a return to normal run rates in June. Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. Earlier this year, Dr. Sarah Diez and Robert Cleary from St. Joseph Mercy Hospital Ann Arbor, along with Doctors Young Jin Lee and Amira Basara from the Swedish Cancer Institute in Seattle, Washington and in collaboration with Intuitive, published a real-world body of evidence comparing health care utilization outcomes and payer/patient expenditures associated with open and minimally invasive colectomy for benign disease. Notably, this analysis also included a comparison of laparoscopic and da Vinci approaches. Utilizing the IBM MarketScan commercial claims and encounter database, this study included over 10,000 adult patients who between January 2013 and December 2018 underwent an elective inpatient colectomy for a benign condition with over 2,500 patients in the open group and over 6,000 subjects in the laparoscopic group and over 1,000 patients in the da Vinci Group. Through an inverse propensity treatment weighted analysis, the minimally invasive approach demonstrated a lower total health care expenditure across all time frames analyzed from the surgical procedure through 365 days post procedure, with lower average total expenditures ranging from $2,300 to $8,100. With regards to resource utilization, the minimally invasive approach demonstrated an approximately two-day lower length of stay with these patients less likely to be readmitted, visit the emergency department or visit the outpatient department within 365 days from the procedure. The reduction in health care use among minimally invasive patients translated to an additional savings over $5,700 and over two fewer days missed from work for health care visits. Within the MIS category when comparing laparoscopic and da Vinci approaches, da Vinci had a 70% lower risk of conversion to open with over a half day shorter length of stay and patients were less likely to have an outpatient hospital visit within one year of the procedure. Of note, patients who had a conversion to open had a longer length of stay, higher hospital payments and were more likely to have a readmission for hospital visit within one year of the procedure. The reduction in conversion is translated to an additional savings of approximately $4,800 and 1.5 fewer days of missed work due to health care visits. The authors concluded in part that minimally invasive colectomy is associated with lower mean health care expenditures and less mean health care resource utilization compared to the open approach for benign disease, with a shorter mean length of stay and conversion to open rate observed with the da Vinci approach. I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2022. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecast full year 2022 procedure growth within a range of 12% to 16%. We are now increasing our forecast and expect full year 2022 procedure growth of 14% to 16.5%. This range continues to reflect the uncertainty associated with the course of the pandemic. The low end of the range assumes increasing COVID hospitalization and staffing pressure at hospitals for the remainder of the year. At the high end of the range, we assume COVID-19-related hospitalizations around the world continue to decline throughout the remainder of 2022, and there are no additional significant impacts from further resurgences. The range does not reflect significant material supply chain disruptions or hospital capacity constraints similar to what we experienced at the start of the pandemic. While procedure growth so far in the first half of 2022 has been healthy, the capital pipeline in the U.S. has been softer than in prior periods, mainly due to a lower number of SI systems in the installed base available for trade-in and macro-related headwinds creating pressure on the hospital capital spending. Capital placements in more mature markets are a function of procedure demand that is moderated by system utilization growth and trade-in opportunities. While trade-in opportunities have declined, the core demand for procedures continues to be healthy and system utilization has been increasing. With a three-year compound annual growth rate in procedures of 16% from Q2 of 2019 to Q2 of 2022 and installed base growth of 11% over the same period, utilization of installed systems has continued to increase through the pandemic and first half of 2022. This is increasing the value derived from the existing installed base for our customers and for us. As we look ahead, we expect these capital dynamics to continue for the foreseeable future. Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast our 2022 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 69% and 70.5%. We are now refining our estimate of pro forma gross profit margin to be within 69% and 70% of net revenue. Given the ongoing impact of higher input costs related to supply chain and the impact from a stronger U.S. dollar, we would expect to be towards the lower end of that range. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trading mix, fluctuations in foreign currency rates and the impact of new product introductions. With respect to operating expenses, on our last call, we forecast pro forma operating expense growth to be between 23% and 27%. We are refining our estimate and now expect our full year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 23% and 25%. We are refining our estimate for noncash stock compensation expense to range between $520 million to $540 million in 2022. We are also refining our estimate for other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $60 million and $70 million in 2022, an increase from our previous estimate of $50 million and $60 million. The increase primarily reflects the continued rise in interest rates. On last quarter\u2019s call, we forecast 2022 capital expenditures within a range of $700 million to $900 million. We are now refining estimated capital expenditures for 2022 to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million. With regard to income tax, we continue to estimate our 2022 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pretax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019re going to begin today with Larry Biegelsen representing Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, sir.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Gary, maybe if I could start with the supply constraints that you talked about, could you quantify how much you think that negatively impacted Q2? It sounds like they\u2019ve been resolved. And Gary, obviously, people are worried about the impact of a recession. How are you better positioned this time compared to the last recession we saw in 2008, 2009? And I have one follow-up.\nGary Guthart: Okay. On the supply constraint side, I\u2019ll give you a qualitative perspective and Jamie you can fill in a little bit of a quantitative perspective. What\u2019s happening is semiconductor suppliers and some other raw material suppliers giving us choppy delivery time lines. So estimates that are sometimes moving around and that can bring product in late in the quarter. When we assemble that product, it can sometimes make it hard at very quarter end to match system configurations to customers and that\u2019s largely what happened in Q2. Jamie, you want to add to that?\nJamie Samath: Think about the impact to Q2 placements roughly in the 5%-ish range in terms of without those supply constraints, those delayed semiconductor components the incremental systems that would have been delivered in Q2.\nGary Guthart: That continues to be choppy, and we expect, certainly for Q3 and perhaps forward that we\u2019ll continue to fight those fights in terms of timing of supply. On the second question \u2013 the second part of your question on recession, clearly, our hospital customers are under financial pressure. We have seen that at the end of Q1 and had communicated with you at that time. I think relative to where we were as Intuitive a decade ago, the size and strength of the installed base, the relative position that we have in terms of centrality to surgery and multiple disciplines and the expression of that in recurring revenue, the percentage of our business that\u2019s in recurring revenue, I think gives us a little bit better shock absorption and predictability in terms of a large part of the revenue of the business. And gives us a few more degrees of freedom in terms of how we make our investments and time those investments relative to 2008, 2009. We are close with our customers. I am personally in contact with many. The trends that we\u2019ve been describing to you, I think we understood pretty well the size and duration of those trends in terms of pressure, very hard for any of us to predict. And you had a follow-on.\nLarry Biegelsen: Yes, that\u2019s all fair. Again, I\u2019m going to push my luck a little bit here. FDA seems to be requiring clinical data for new systems. We know you have a new system in development. So my question is, do you know yet if FDA is going to require clinical data for your new system before approval? And if so, what can you share? Thank you.\nGary Guthart: Looking at two things, I think let me broaden the question. Looking at the regulatory environment globally and in particular, in the United States and Europe, we have seen a trend in medical device and in robotic-assisted surgery for increasing data requirements. Sometimes those are trials, sometimes there are other kind of data. That trend has continued, and it\u2019s impacting all of us in the market, including Intuitive. You can expect that we will improve the Gen 4 product that\u2019s out there. We can get good ideas and technologies into our existing customer base hands and improve their utility, we will do that. We are, of course, working on next generations. And as I\u2019ve said before, generations after that, without answering your question specifically, the deeper the technologic opportunities and the clinical impact, the more likely you have a deeper validation work to do. And we\u2019re not afraid of that work. I\u2019d rather do things that are really clinically meaningful for the customer. And if we have to do the work, then we\u2019ll do the work. I will say for everybody on the call, it\u2019s clear that relative to a decade ago, the investment trough and the time lines for new systems have both increased. The time lines have increased because of the changing regulatory environments in several countries. And as a result, the amount of investment that has to go into that has also changed. It\u2019s also increased. I think, and this is a prediction that it will also extend the useful life of products that we design. So it\u2019s taking a little longer to get to market than it used to, maybe more than a little, it\u2019s costing us more to get there. But that change in environment also means that really well-designed systems probably have longer use for life in the field. And I think we\u2019re starting to see that early evidence of that as well. So thank you for the question, Larry.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thank you.\nOperator: And next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Amit Hazan representing Goldman Sachs. You\u2019re open.\nAmit Hazan: Thanks and good afternoon. Maybe to come back to the supply chain question. I want to maybe ask it lends as kind of a bigger picture here, just given all the challenges you\u2019ve gone through in the past year and a half or so. Do you have plans that change strategically in terms of evolving towards maybe regionalization or domestication of the supply chain? And how do we think about that and incremental costs that might come with that, if that\u2019s the plan? Or do you just plan to kind of ride this out and expect a more normal environment next year?\nGary Guthart: I\u2019ll start, and Jamie, you can lean in. First, I want to acknowledge our operating teams and the supply chain teams. They have done a spectacular job in the number of components that we manage in a robotic surgery system, both on the capital side and on the instruments and accessories side and the management of those supply chains is remarkable, perhaps bigger than most people expect relative to the size of our company. They have been really good at being proactive and thoughtful about supply chain, robustness about strategic reserves and about the ability to pivot into alternative components when we need to. And that has really been a spectacular performance. That\u2019s a long way of saying that they have been proactive. They will continue to be forward-looking and design for supply chain robustness. What that looks like depends a lot on the underlying product, whether it\u2019s creating second sources or using alternatives or thinking about regional deployment. We have been working through regional deployment prior to the pandemic, and we\u2019ve done that work as we\u2019ve gone on. That does incur some costs. We\u2019re thoughtful about it. And Jamie, why don\u2019t you provide your perspective?\nJamie Samath: From a strategic perspective or a long-term perspective, setting aside the current supply chain challenges, some of the things that we consider in our own long-term planning is the size of our business as it grows over time in the various regions that we serve, where you might locate, redundant capacity or incremental capacity. And in terms of the economic equation, you\u2019re trading the potential cost of redundancy with savings on freight and logistics to the extent that you can supply them in region. That economic analysis is relatively straightforward. And really, you\u2019re just looking for the degree of redundancy you want and when does the regional businesses get big enough to warrant the economics. But certainly, what you described is something that we\u2019re looking at carefully and have been.\nAmit Hazan: Thanks for that. And maybe just to hit on just earnings and going into the future with the components that you give us, it seems pretty clear this year, we\u2019re probably not going to get earnings growth. You had some interesting comments. It sounds like R&D, you\u2019re going to keep spending and you believe what you\u2019re doing organically that makes sense. And sir, if you have more comments on SG&A, but just thinking through, okay, no earnings this year, in terms of your commitment to shareholders, is it okay for you not to grow earnings next year, too? Would that become a bigger focus for you just given how this year has gone? How do you think about earnings growth after kind of what this year is going to end up looking like? Thanks.\nJamie Samath: Yes. So, we\u2019re not going to get specific about 2023 at this point. You\u2019ll obviously see us provide our outlook on the January call. What we\u2019re doing with respect to R&D currently is investing in multiyear projects and investments. You see that in our newer platforms, Ion and SP. We have obviously investments in digital, many of which are at an early stage. And we do continue to invest in the fourth generation ecosystem. And we look at the returns on those investments carefully and have confidence in them. But in part because of the regulatory time lines that Gary described, they are multiyear investments and we think that the returns there are quite attractive. And so that\u2019s why you see, for example, if you look at the first half, our R&D grew 30% relative to the overall growth of about 25% for OpEx. But if you take a multiyear view, given the growth opportunities that we see, you\u2019d expect us to grow earnings over time. I\u2019m not going to say whether that\u2019s 2023 yet or not. And with respect to operating margins, specifically, what we\u2019ve said is we look to be at the high end of our medtech peer set. And by medtech, that means high-growth companies that have growth opportunities as we see that we do. I'll speak to \u2013 for a second on SG&A. We do have some infrastructure that is either needs to be built out to support the growth particularly in manufacturing or we have some processes in IT and in other parts of the business where we're long lived on our pavement and there's some repaving or potholes to fix that we will finish. We do expect to see highly targeted spending in that area going forward. And as we retire, some of that project spend will be thoughtful about where we go next. So we'll start to see some of that expense start to titrate into next year.\nAmit Hazan: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Next in the line of Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nTravis Steed: All right. Thanks for taking the questions. Gary, I'd love a little more color just on the overall hospital capital environment. Are you seeing hospitals just being more cautious on the near term or do you think we're in for a longer duration CapEx, slowdown? I'm curious how you think the slowdown could range in terms of outcomes, if it's like, 2008, 2009 or 2013, 2014 or 2020 and also like leases ticked up to 42% this quarter, I'm curious where you think that could peak in the slower CapEx environment?\nGary Guthart: Yeah. Hard to predict the depth in duration of hospital pressure. So I won't, I will talk about what the \u2013 I think what the inputs are, what they're faced with. Clearly, they're constrained on labor and the labor costs because of that constraint have gone up. That's not something that will resolve quickly. They're also facing inflationary pressure in some of their materials that they purchase, and they don't have enormous flexibility to change pricing on their side. So I would expect profitability constraint on the hospital side to be present. In light of that, one of their first tools in their toolkit is to try to get greater productivity out of existing assets and capital, and Intuitive will help them. If there's more productivity to get out of the products they already owned, we will help them do that. I still think there are hospitals out there that are going to be strategic that are in better financial condition. And if they want to build a new capacity and a new product line says SP or Ion or to branch out into a new region, then they'll do that. And we'll help them do that as well. I don't think this is a one or two quarter resolution. It's certainly going to be something longer than that. With regard to change in lease and how do we think about leases going forward? Jamie, I'll ask you to take that.\nJamie Samath: Yeah. If I split between U.S. and O-U.S., what you've seen in the U.S. is relative maturity in understanding and acceptance use of our leasing program. It's been ticking up slowly over time while it will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on customer preference. I do think that will slowly continue to tick up just based on what we hear from customers. In O-U.S. where we offer leasing, which is not in every market, we\u2019re at an earlier stage. And so you're seeing growing understand and acceptance as leasing as an option as they acquire capital. And so I'd expect that to continue to climb over time.\nTravis Steed: Great. Thank you. And I had one other question, Gary, listened to your talk a few weeks ago, and you mentioned the time it takes to get new parts to market is a couple of years longer. I think you said six to eight years before now, eight to 10 years. I'd love to kind of get in a little more detail on that assumption that you went through there. And kind of think is, I guess I assume it's mostly regulatory, but kind of dig into the comment a bit more and see how that's changed your strategic thinking in general of how you think about innovation and your product cycles at the moment?\nGary Guthart: Yeah, it was a kind of a directional comment more about averages than about a particular product line. So I discourage anybody looking at a particular product line and try to infer from it. We have a basket of things we do and on average, it's gotten longer. Strategically I think there are a couple of things that strengths in the business versus a decade ago that help us and give us more flexibility, more freedom. And that is both the deep penetration we have in the market, the large size of the customer base in terms of active users. If we can get them a technology and increments, we\u2019re not as dependent on capital revenue. And as years pass, I think, the recurring revenue side is a strength for us. If that increases productivity for the hospital, that\u2019s great. It turns out that gives them better financial returns on the investments they made. But also our economic profile is stronger in repeat use utilization than it is in capital change. So what that means to us is bring capital change when it really is differentiated, when it really brings incremental clinical value or new market access to our customers. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. With regard to the regulatory side, our goal is to be really good at it to get the right data we need at the right time to underwrite the first time and take care of it. And those types of requirements ebb and flow over time. And we\u2019re in a particular state where the requirements are quite high and we\u2019ll deal with it.\nTravis Steed: Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go to the line of Robbie Marcus representing JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe to start, a lot of your comments say, it feels like it\u2019s a U.S. comment in terms of the capital equipment. I want to get a sense, is there any difference in geography just given the hospitals, most of them outside the U.S., are dictated by a single payer country networks. And then I\u2019ll just ask the follow-up as well, pretty good OUS procedure number. How do we think about how much of an impact the shutdowns in China had and how should we be thinking about the ramp in second half on China, just given that the country is still not on a strong pathway to a reopening? Thanks.\nGary Guthart: Yes. Robbie, on that first question, it\u2019s a good one. And I appreciate it. Clearly, the utilization of systems and the posture of hospital acquisition relative to systems differs by country based on the maturity of our markets and the depth of penetration of da Vinci. We tried to call that out a little bit in the script. Jamie, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s additional color you\u2019d like to apply.\nJamie Samath: Yes, I just say the softness in the U.S. capital pipeline is clear, and it\u2019s been clear for two quarters. What you saw in placements in Q2 was actually OUS placements grew as compared to a year ago. We haven\u2019t seen any clear and specific indications on capital weakness that I call out. Obviously, China had a challenging quarter with respect to procedures. But you look at the macro, you look at what\u2019s happening in Europe. You could imagine that might be a challenge as you look forward, but nothing that I call out at this point.\nGary Guthart: On \u2013 you had asked kind of how do we expect China to proceed in procedures in the back half. Of course that\u2019s impossible for us to predict what I might ask Brian is you might just reiterate some of your comments as what\u2019s assumed in the model in terms of [indiscernible].\nBrian King: Yes. So we have seen, I\u2019d say at the end of Q2, we did see some improvement or recovery of procedures, I\u2019d say probably closer to more normal levels. Over time, it\u2019s really hard to predict what\u2019s going to happen in China. I think they are our second largest market by procedure volume. It does have an impact when things do slow down, but you can see the procedure growth that we had despite the challenges in China. So I think it\u2019s probably a bit too soon to really give any color and what\u2019s going to happen there because there's just still so much variability and frankly, we were still really early in the quarter.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: And we have a question from Rick Wise representing Stifel. Please go ahead.\nRick Wise: Good afternoon, guys. Again, reflecting on history a little bit. When I think back to the end of the financial crisis to early last decade, obviously, there were periods of marked capital slowdown and yes, those \u2013 the recovery following that was in part of macro recovery. But it was also in 2014, the launch of the Xi, it was procedure volume uptake, expanded instruments. I mean, there were many drivers of the recovery under the umbrella of the macro recovery. As we look ahead and think about the next few years assuming the macro recovery occurs, I was just reflecting that the mix might be different this time, but what\u2019s the \u2013 on the procedure side and the system or instrument side, I mean, what are the drivers that get us back to that accelerated growth again? Is it international instruments and yes, inevitably a new system at some point, or how would you talk about the next few years in thinking about a recovery from this period?\nGary Guthart: Appreciate the question. In terms of drivers of growth, first kind of zoom out, we are in the thick part of the adoption curve in the United States in general surgery across multiple sub-procedures and there's real room there. I don't think we're saturated and response has been really good and our training numbers and adoption and the underlying capability of our Gen 4 products has been great; so that's one. Two, we're seeing investments that we've made many years ago in rounded teams, rounded intuitive teams in key countries payback now, and that has been fantastic. So it starts with growth in oncology, oncologic surgical procedures outside of urology \u2013 in addition to urology, so we're seeing that but we're also seeing the early indications of adoption in benign surgery in our U.S. markets, which is frankly an exciting green shoot in the sense that that could follow a pathway that mirrors what we saw in the U.S. So I think there's lots of opportunity there and, and that has to do with bringing our instruments, our accessories, our ecosystem, our training capabilities, our data capabilities into our priority country markets over time. So we've got that. We have outstanding innovations that are coming to market. Ion is doing really well in the U.S. Ion will go deeper into other applications. We're trying to bring it to Europe or in that process will bring it to Asia over time. SP, SP is having great success in Korea. We're bringing it to Japan. We're working on additional indications for the United States. SP has differentiated capability, and as those indications get added and it's hard work I think it will bring incremental procedures to our customers and then to us over time. And those are procedures that are either rarely done with daVinci or not done with daVinci at all. And I think that's another leg of opportunity and how many years does that take? Well, they will layer out \u2013 those things will layer out over time. In terms of regional performance we have those opportunities in front of us right now. In terms of things like SP and Ion; SP is one of the more mature technologies in new platform. I think its economics are looking increasingly good for intuitive, and as they continue to knock down additional clinical indications I think that'll add strength. Ion has been growing like a weed. It's less mature in terms of its financial profile, but we're working hard on it and so I think those things will contribute as well. So I think we have irons in the fire that we have confidence in.\nRick Wise: Okay. And just one last quick one for me, it's a little bit of a fishing expedition kind of question of just reflecting on your comments about partnering with hospitals. One aspect is financially and with leases, et cetera, but I know you have many initiatives underway in terms of data collection and management, any update in terms of your initiatives there? And is there anything on that side of the house we should be paying attention to? Thank you, Gary.\nGary Guthart: Thanks Rick. On the basics in our more mature daVinci markets, our data facility and in terms of the ability to collect, analyze and share insight with our hospitals has been really good. And they are the things that allow them to compare the efficacy and efficiency of their daVinci program. Relative to others in their own hospital group relative to national and international norms, it allows them to make decisions about where capacity are going, where there are opportunities for improvement within their system? We use that routinely. It is not a new idea; it's starting to become really baked into all the workflows and processes. We're automating a lot of that capability, so that's been fabulous. At the other end of the spectrum we are engaged with hardcore healthcare researchers looking at what AI and our data sets can bring in terms of improved outcomes, personalized training, faster time to competency and the excitement level there is quite high, and we're continuing to invest down that pathway. So in one set, it's used every day and another set, I think, it's in the innovation engines and its informing discovery. And I believe those discoveries, in a few years, will change the nature of surgery and some of the training that we do. So I think there's an opportunity on both sides.\nRick Wise: Thank you.\nGary Guthart: Just one last question, please.\nOperator: All right. Our final question today will come from the line of Richard Newitter representing Truist. You\u2019re open.\nRichard Newitter: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Gary, just on that last answer. Can you give us any sense as to how if and maybe even when you might look to begin monetizing those types of \u2013 I don't want to say new alternative service models, things that might help hospitals become more efficient. Can we expect to see that filter into new sources of revenue streams and when? And are you already exploring that? And then I have one follow-up.\nGary Guthart: I \u2013 we've said this before, in our digital efforts in terms of digital tools, some of them are \u2013 the way we do our financial analysis, some of them are value creating through efficiency and labor savings on our side or on the hospital side and the investments are really a reduction in our cost to serve. So that's one category. There's another category that is around accelerated time to competency that lowers our cost to serve through having people get through their implementation and programmatic processes more quickly. The third category is direct revenue opportunity. We have things in the field working in all three of those categories. So none of them is empty. In terms of pricing and customer acceptance of our value proposition, we are out in our training opportunities in some of our augmented reality spaces and in our Intuitive Hub starting to explore those. Some of them are very, very early. Some of them are reasonably mature in terms of what our pricing and other models look like. What I would tell you is that relative to other sources of revenue, these should be accretive to our bottom line because of some of the cost savings, but they won't be huge revenue lines in the near term. I would not set the expectation that all of that turns into big time revenue. Our biggest thing and our focus is to help our customers, hospitals get to great, high-functioning, minimally invasive surgery programs using our products. If we do that, then they will find a way to pay us. And so far, that economic engine has worked well for them and it's worked well for us.\nRichard Newitter: Great. And just \u2013 you guys mentioned TORS, I believe, where SP is gaining traction. You've got 20% penetration. I think you estimated \u2013 of U.S. estimated procedures. Just remind us, how big of a category is TORS? Can you quantify that for us? And where do you think something like that could go? Or where are some of your more aggressive users in terms of their penetration already? Thank you.\nJamie Samath: Yes. On the micro question, so that was malignant TORS. It's a small but high-value segment. Roughly TAM number of surgeries performed is in the 10,000 per year range. So a relatively small market. But like I said, for surgeons and patients, really high value. In terms of where it might go, I'll let Gary expand on that.\nGary Guthart: Yes. I think that SP and invasive surgery has opportunities to extend the kinds of procedures that are done robotically and we'll look to Korea as a guide in that they have broad clearances. And they're using it all over the body from gynecology to breast oncology and other things where they see value. And I think that as that clinical evidence comes through and as the clearances expand, you'll see incremental opportunity that is reasonable for us and, I think, exciting for our customer base. We'll detail those things further in future calls as that data starts to publish. That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple lane: Better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It follows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a care, a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly, so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation and using the AT&T Event Services. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Gary Guthart",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today. Our Q2 results reflect both environmental and Intuitive's specific headwinds accompanied by underlying business strength. Procedures in the quarter grew 14% over last year despite pressure from COVID-driven lockdowns in China, our second largest market. Capital placements slowed from a year ago due to a combination of factors we described last quarter and which I will review shortly. Overall pressure from COVID lockdowns impacted procedures in the quarter modestly while reduced trade-ins and supply chain timing impacted our capital placements more significantly. The leading indicator of the health of our business, procedure demand, remains healthy. Starting first with procedures. I am encouraged by 14% growth in the quarter, reflecting strength in U.S. general surgery and solid growth extending beyond urology outside the United States. U.S. procedure growth was led by bariatric surgery, cholecystectomy and colorectal procedures with continued growth in hernia repair. In OUS markets, procedures grew 22% in the quarter in spite of the COVID lockdown in China. Outside the U.S., we are seeing strength in urology now accompanied by diversified growth in other procedures. For example, in Japan, growth was strong in general surgery, including rectal resection. In the UK and Ireland, growth was strong in gynecology and general surgery. And in France, gynecology and general surgery experienced solid growth. System utilization in several OUS countries has been increasing in recent quarters as procedure adoption diversifies increasing value for our customers and for Intuitive. This is a result of the investments we made in key country markets starting several years ago. Turning to da Vinci capital placements. We placed 279 systems in the quarter, down from 328 in Q2 2021. In the da Vinci business, we see three causes for the decline in placements relative to a year ago. As our customers have standardized on generation four da Vinci systems, the installed base of third generation systems has declined, lowering the trade-in population, particularly in the United States. Next, supply chain disruption continued in the quarter with semiconductor component delays impacting the timing of system builds, leaving us challenged to match some customer orders at quarter end. Lastly, we've seen hospital capital spending pressure grow in our part of the capital equipment space over the past two quarters, incenting customers to seek efficiency gains on existing capital before acquiring new capacity. Component supply constraints remain a risk, and our operating teams are working hard to shelter our customers for most of these pressures. Capital placements in more mature markets are a mix of core demand for procedures and trade-in opportunities. The need for high-quality robotic-assisted surgery remains healthy. Incremental capital demand at the customer is a function of system utilization and procedure growth. On the system utilization side, our compound annual growth rate remains at historic levels of 5% over the past three-year period. System utilization in the U.S. over the past year was slightly down as procedure growth rate over the past year roughly matched the system installed base growth. In contrast, system utilization in many OUS markets has been rising as procedures diversify. Overall, we prioritize system utilization growth for customers as it increases the value to them of their investments and is aligned with long-term health for Intuitive. Turning to our innovation engines and new products and services, we placed 41 Ion systems, up from 20 in Q2 of last year. Given its stage of maturity, Ion capital demand procedure growth as hospitals seek to build initial capability. With the Ion clinical installed base now at 204 systems, Ion utilization has been growing nicely along with encouraging early capital replacements. We received 510(k) clearance for our integration of Ion with Siemens Cios Spin cone-beam CT. This combination improves registration and targeting precision for Ion in the lung and is being well received by our customers. We remain focused on strengthening clinical outcomes in lung care, a fantastic customer experience and operational excellence in the Ion program. In our multiport ecosystem, we initiated our first phase U.S. launch of our eight millimeter stapler designed to work in small anatomical spaces, for example, in thoracic surgery. Early customer feedback has been encouraging. In China, we're preparing to launch our SureForm 45 and 60 millimeter staplers and our latest endoscope, Endoscope Plus. All three will continue to support growth in general surgery and thoracic procedures. For da Vinci SP, we have expanded the number of colorectal IDE sites to help accelerate accrual, and we submitted another regulatory package for SP imaging and accessories in Japan, as we work on the necessary clearances to support an SP launch in the country. For our digital tools, Intuitive Hub installs grew nicely again in the quarter, and we're focused on ensuring outstanding customer experiences with data capture and media management, along with increasing utilization over time. On spending, we are committed to our innovation programs because we believe the forward opportunity for our products and services are important to our customers and to the company. We have some natural shock absorbers that decrease some of our variable spending as a result of the slowdown in da Vinci capital placements. We are also planning for decelerating spend growth after we complete some infrastructure projects, we need to support the company's expansion. Given our confidence in the future of our business, we have also returned cash to shareholders in the form of buybacks in the quarter. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie who will take you through our finances in greater detail. Okay. On the supply constraint side, I'll give you a qualitative perspective and Jamie you can fill in a little bit of a quantitative perspective. What's happening is semiconductor suppliers and some other raw material suppliers giving us choppy delivery time lines. So estimates that are sometimes moving around and that can bring product in late in the quarter. When we assemble that product, it can sometimes make it hard at very quarter end to match system configurations to customers and that's largely what happened in Q2. Jamie, you want to add to that? That continues to be choppy, and we expect, certainly for Q3 and perhaps forward that we'll continue to fight those fights in terms of timing of supply. On the second question \u2013 the second part of your question on recession, clearly, our hospital customers are under financial pressure. We have seen that at the end of Q1 and had communicated with you at that time. I think relative to where we were as Intuitive a decade ago, the size and strength of the installed base, the relative position that we have in terms of centrality to surgery and multiple disciplines and the expression of that in recurring revenue, the percentage of our business that's in recurring revenue, I think gives us a little bit better shock absorption and predictability in terms of a large part of the revenue of the business. And gives us a few more degrees of freedom in terms of how we make our investments and time those investments relative to 2008, 2009. We are close with our customers. I am personally in contact with many. The trends that we've been describing to you, I think we understood pretty well the size and duration of those trends in terms of pressure, very hard for any of us to predict. And you had a follow-on. Looking at two things, I think let me broaden the question. Looking at the regulatory environment globally and in particular, in the United States and Europe, we have seen a trend in medical device and in robotic-assisted surgery for increasing data requirements. Sometimes those are trials, sometimes there are other kind of data. That trend has continued, and it's impacting all of us in the market, including Intuitive. You can expect that we will improve the Gen 4 product that's out there. We can get good ideas and technologies into our existing customer base hands and improve their utility, we will do that. We are, of course, working on next generations. And as I've said before, generations after that, without answering your question specifically, the deeper the technologic opportunities and the clinical impact, the more likely you have a deeper validation work to do. And we're not afraid of that work. I'd rather do things that are really clinically meaningful for the customer. And if we have to do the work, then we'll do the work. I will say for everybody on the call, it's clear that relative to a decade ago, the investment trough and the time lines for new systems have both increased. The time lines have increased because of the changing regulatory environments in several countries. And as a result, the amount of investment that has to go into that has also changed. It's also increased. I think, and this is a prediction that it will also extend the useful life of products that we design. So it's taking a little longer to get to market than it used to, maybe more than a little, it's costing us more to get there. But that change in environment also means that really well-designed systems probably have longer use for life in the field. And I think we're starting to see that early evidence of that as well. So thank you for the question, Larry. I'll start, and Jamie, you can lean in. First, I want to acknowledge our operating teams and the supply chain teams. They have done a spectacular job in the number of components that we manage in a robotic surgery system, both on the capital side and on the instruments and accessories side and the management of those supply chains is remarkable, perhaps bigger than most people expect relative to the size of our company. They have been really good at being proactive and thoughtful about supply chain, robustness about strategic reserves and about the ability to pivot into alternative components when we need to. And that has really been a spectacular performance. That's a long way of saying that they have been proactive. They will continue to be forward-looking and design for supply chain robustness. What that looks like depends a lot on the underlying product, whether it's creating second sources or using alternatives or thinking about regional deployment. We have been working through regional deployment prior to the pandemic, and we've done that work as we've gone on. That does incur some costs. We're thoughtful about it. And Jamie, why don't you provide your perspective? Yeah. Hard to predict the depth in duration of hospital pressure. So I won't, I will talk about what the \u2013 I think what the inputs are, what they're faced with. Clearly, they're constrained on labor and the labor costs because of that constraint have gone up. That's not something that will resolve quickly. They're also facing inflationary pressure in some of their materials that they purchase, and they don't have enormous flexibility to change pricing on their side. So I would expect profitability constraint on the hospital side to be present. In light of that, one of their first tools in their toolkit is to try to get greater productivity out of existing assets and capital, and Intuitive will help them. If there's more productivity to get out of the products they already owned, we will help them do that. I still think there are hospitals out there that are going to be strategic that are in better financial condition. And if they want to build a new capacity and a new product line says SP or Ion or to branch out into a new region, then they'll do that. And we'll help them do that as well. I don't think this is a one or two quarter resolution. It's certainly going to be something longer than that. With regard to change in lease and how do we think about leases going forward? Jamie, I'll ask you to take that. Yeah, it was a kind of a directional comment more about averages than about a particular product line. So I discourage anybody looking at a particular product line and try to infer from it. We have a basket of things we do and on average, it's gotten longer. Strategically I think there are a couple of things that strengths in the business versus a decade ago that help us and give us more flexibility, more freedom. And that is both the deep penetration we have in the market, the large size of the customer base in terms of active users. If we can get them a technology and increments, we're not as dependent on capital revenue. And as years pass, I think, the recurring revenue side is a strength for us. If that increases productivity for the hospital, that's great. It turns out that gives them better financial returns on the investments they made. But also our economic profile is stronger in repeat use utilization than it is in capital change. So what that means to us is bring capital change when it really is differentiated, when it really brings incremental clinical value or new market access to our customers. And that's what we're focused on. With regard to the regulatory side, our goal is to be really good at it to get the right data we need at the right time to underwrite the first time and take care of it. And those types of requirements ebb and flow over time. And we're in a particular state where the requirements are quite high and we'll deal with it. Yes. Robbie, on that first question, it's a good one. And I appreciate it. Clearly, the utilization of systems and the posture of hospital acquisition relative to systems differs by country based on the maturity of our markets and the depth of penetration of da Vinci. We tried to call that out a little bit in the script. Jamie, I don't know if there's additional color you'd like to apply. On \u2013 you had asked kind of how do we expect China to proceed in procedures in the back half. Of course that's impossible for us to predict what I might ask Brian is you might just reiterate some of your comments as what's assumed in the model in terms of [indiscernible]. Appreciate the question. In terms of drivers of growth, first kind of zoom out, we are in the thick part of the adoption curve in the United States in general surgery across multiple sub-procedures and there's real room there. I don't think we're saturated and response has been really good and our training numbers and adoption and the underlying capability of our Gen 4 products has been great; so that's one. Two, we're seeing investments that we've made many years ago in rounded teams, rounded intuitive teams in key countries payback now, and that has been fantastic. So it starts with growth in oncology, oncologic surgical procedures outside of urology \u2013 in addition to urology, so we're seeing that but we're also seeing the early indications of adoption in benign surgery in our U.S. markets, which is frankly an exciting green shoot in the sense that that could follow a pathway that mirrors what we saw in the U.S. So I think there's lots of opportunity there and, and that has to do with bringing our instruments, our accessories, our ecosystem, our training capabilities, our data capabilities into our priority country markets over time. So we've got that. We have outstanding innovations that are coming to market. Ion is doing really well in the U.S. Ion will go deeper into other applications. We're trying to bring it to Europe or in that process will bring it to Asia over time. SP, SP is having great success in Korea. We're bringing it to Japan. We're working on additional indications for the United States. SP has differentiated capability, and as those indications get added and it's hard work I think it will bring incremental procedures to our customers and then to us over time. And those are procedures that are either rarely done with daVinci or not done with daVinci at all. And I think that's another leg of opportunity and how many years does that take? Well, they will layer out \u2013 those things will layer out over time. In terms of regional performance we have those opportunities in front of us right now. In terms of things like SP and Ion; SP is one of the more mature technologies in new platform. I think its economics are looking increasingly good for intuitive, and as they continue to knock down additional clinical indications I think that'll add strength. Ion has been growing like a weed. It's less mature in terms of its financial profile, but we're working hard on it and so I think those things will contribute as well. So I think we have irons in the fire that we have confidence in. Thanks Rick. On the basics in our more mature daVinci markets, our data facility and in terms of the ability to collect, analyze and share insight with our hospitals has been really good. And they are the things that allow them to compare the efficacy and efficiency of their daVinci program. Relative to others in their own hospital group relative to national and international norms, it allows them to make decisions about where capacity are going, where there are opportunities for improvement within their system?

            "name": "Jamie Samath",
            "content": "Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Q2 procedure growth of 14% reflected an increase in U.S. procedures of 11% and OUS procedure growth of 22%. As a reminder procedures in the U.S. in the second quarter of last year included a recovery of procedures that were delayed as a result of the significant impact of Omicron variant. Brian will provide additional procedure commentary later in the call. We placed 279 systems in the second quarter as compared to 328 systems in the second quarter of 2021 and 311 systems last quarter. Q2 system placements were 15% lower than the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to a significant decline in trade-in transactions. There were 56 trade-in transactions in the quarter as compared to 125 in Q2 of 2021, reflecting the decline in the number of SIs remaining in the installed base. The supply chain environment continues to be challenging and during the quarter we experienced delays in the supply of certain semiconductor components that caused manufacturing output of da Vinci systems to be later in the quarter than historical norms. As a result, a number of systems that we would have expected to place in the latter part of June experienced minor delays and were shipped and installed in July. We indicated on last quarter's call that we had experienced softening in the U.S. capital pipeline. That softness persisted in Q2. Financial pressures have increased on hospitals, given higher inflation, increasing interest rates, supply chain challenges, and continued staffing shortages. Some of the larger IDNs have indicated that as a consequence of the financial pressures they face, they are lowering their capital investment plans and tightening operational budgets. We expected demand for capital, particularly in the U.S., will be impacted while macro conditions remain challenging. Where a particular hospital requires additional da Vinci capacity, given growth in their programs, we will leverage our flexible acquisition models to meet the financial objectives of our customers. Given the system placements in Q2, the installed base of da Vinci systems grew approximately 13% year-over-year. Utilization of clinical systems in the field measured by procedures per system increased approximately 1% compared to last year. Using a three-year compound annual growth rate second quarter utilization grew almost 5%, which is in line with historical averages. In more mature markets like the U.S. capital demand is sensitive to procedure growth. And therefore we monitor changes in system utilization closely. As a result of our procedure and capital performance, Q2 revenue was $1.52 billion, an increase of 4% from the second quarter of 2021. On a constant currency basis second quarter revenue grew approximately 6% over last year. It is worth highlighting that recurring revenue grew 14% year-over-year to $1.24 billion representing 81% of total revenue. Additional revenue, statistics and trends are as follows: in the U.S., we've placed 150 systems in the second quarter lower than the 213 in Q2 of 2021, reflecting a decline of 59 systems associated with trade-in transactions, a softer demand environment, and the delay of some system placements into July. The remaining installed base of SI systems in the U.S. is approximately 230 systems. Outside the U.S., we placed 129 systems in the second quarter compared with 115 in the second quarter of 2021. Current core assistant placements included 78 into Europe, 18 into Japan, and 15 into China, compared with 63 into Europe, 16 into Japan, and 19 into China in the second quarter of 2021. As of the end of Q2 2022, there were 48 systems remaining under the current quarter in China, which is also available to competitors that have received local regulatory clearance. Globally, trade-in transactions represented 20% of placements in the quarter, compared to 38% for full year 2021 and 48% for full year 2020. As we have previously indicated, given the lower number of older generation systems in the field, we expect the volume of trade-ins to be significantly lower in 2022, as compared to last year. Leasing represented 42% of Q2 placements compared with 35% last quarter and 33% in the second quarter of 2021, the higher lease mix primarily reflected an increase in the proportion of O-U.S. customers that lease a system in the quarter versus purchased, driven in particular by customers in Europe. While leasing will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time. Second quarter system average selling prices were $1.50 million slightly lower than the $1.54 million last quarter, although system ASPs were roughly flat, lower trade-in volumes benefitted Q2 ASP, offset by an unfavorable impact from the stronger U.S. dollar and a higher mix of lower price Xi systems, primarily driven by customers in Europe. We recognized $22 million of lease buyout revenue in the second quarter compared with $16 million last quarter and $26 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,900 per procedure, compared with $1,870 last quarter and $1,940 in the second quarter of 2021. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the benefit of stocking orders in Q2 of 2021 associated with the launch of our extended use instruments program and an unfavorable FX impact from the stronger U.S. dollar. The sequential increase reflects a higher proportion of stapling and advanced energy revenue. Revenue for these categories combined grew 22% as compared to the second quarter of last year. We placed 41 Ion systems in the quarter as compared to 20 Ion placements in the second quarter of last year. The installed base of Ion systems is now 204 systems of which 90 are under operating lease arrangements. Second core Ion procedures of approximately 5,200 increased 251% compared to the second core of 2021. Ion is in the new MDR regulatory review process in Europe and our efforts to pursue a submission in China continue to make progress. Five of the systems placed in the second quarter were SP systems, resulting in an installed base of 111. Second core SP procedures grew approximately 28% year-over-year. One of the areas of potential clinical differentiation for SP is in narrow access surgery. For example, in transoral robotic surgical or TORS procedures, for malignant TORS procedures based on the last four quarters, we estimate SP market share in the U.S. to be just under 20%. Growth of the SP platform will continue to be gated by additional clinical indications and clearances in markets beyond the U.S. and Korea. Moving on to the rest of the P&L, pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of 2022 was 69.2% compared with 71.7% for the second quarter of 2021 and 69.8% last quarter. Pro forma gross margin was lower primarily as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar, higher logistics costs, increased component pricing and increased fixed cost relative to revenue. As we invest in our infrastructure and manufacturing capacity to serve our long-term needs. Pro forma operating expenses increased 23% compared with the second quarter of 2021. The increase in second quarter operating expenses from a year ago, reflected an increase in headcount, higher R&D-related project costs and higher travel costs, including the impact of inflation. Given the early stages of our newer platforms, Ion and SP and our digital ecosystem, we expect to continue to invest in R&D, given the return profile of these investments. Spending in SG&A will be more closely linked to our procedure and revenue performance, and we will continue to pursue plans to invest in infrastructure and business process automation to ensure we can efficiently and effectively scale. Pro forma operating margin for Q2 was 35% as compared to 40% for the full year 2021. As compared to the second quarter of last year, the net impact of FX, inflation and manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the supply chain environment is a reduction in operating margin of approximately 2%. Our pro forma tax rate \u2013 effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22.3%, in line with our expectations. Second quarter 2022 pro forma net income was $415 million or $1.14 per share compared with $475 million or $1.30 per share for the second quarter of 2021. Capital expenditures in Q2 were $131 million, primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities footprint, increased manufacturing capacity and automation of certain production lines. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $308 million or $0.85 per share for the second quarter of 2022, compared with GAAP net income of $517 million or $1.42 per share for the second quarter of 2021. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $8.2 billion, compared with $8.4 billion at the end of Q1. The sequential reduction in cash and investments primarily reflected share repurchases and capital expenditures, partially offset by cash from operating activities. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent and are as follows: first, to organically invest in the business, given the significant opportunities we see to develop differentiated technology and drive adoption of our products. Second, to acquire external technology that creates value for our customers and/or accelerate development timelines or acquisitions that accelerate our growth. Third, we return excess cash to shareholders and look to do so efficiently. In Q2, we repurchased 2.2 million of our shares at an average price of $224 per share for a total expenditure of $500 million. Concurrent with today's earnings release, our Board of Directors have improved an increase to the share repurchase authorization to $3.5 billion. With that, I would like to turn it over to Brian, who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2022. Think about the impact to Q2 placements roughly in the 5%-ish range in terms of without those supply constraints, those delayed semiconductor components the incremental systems that would have been delivered in Q2. From a strategic perspective or a long-term perspective, setting aside the current supply chain challenges, some of the things that we consider in our own long-term planning is the size of our business as it grows over time in the various regions that we serve, where you might locate, redundant capacity or incremental capacity. And in terms of the economic equation, you're trading the potential cost of redundancy with savings on freight and logistics to the extent that you can supply them in region. That economic analysis is relatively straightforward. And really, you're just looking for the degree of redundancy you want and when does the regional businesses get big enough to warrant the economics. But certainly, what you described is something that we're looking at carefully and have been. Yes. So, we're not going to get specific about 2023 at this point. You'll obviously see us provide our outlook on the January call. What we're doing with respect to R&D currently is investing in multiyear projects and investments. You see that in our newer platforms, Ion and SP. We have obviously investments in digital, many of which are at an early stage. And we do continue to invest in the fourth generation ecosystem. And we look at the returns on those investments carefully and have confidence in them. But in part because of the regulatory time lines that Gary described, they are multiyear investments and we think that the returns there are quite attractive. And so that's why you see, for example, if you look at the first half, our R&D grew 30% relative to the overall growth of about 25% for OpEx. But if you take a multiyear view, given the growth opportunities that we see, you'd expect us to grow earnings over time. I'm not going to say whether that's 2023 yet or not. And with respect to operating margins, specifically, what we've said is we look to be at the high end of our medtech peer set. And by medtech, that means high-growth companies that have growth opportunities as we see that we do. I'll speak to \u2013 for a second on SG&A. We do have some infrastructure that is either needs to be built out to support the growth particularly in manufacturing or we have some processes in IT and in other parts of the business where we're long lived on our pavement and there's some repaving or potholes to fix that we will finish. We do expect to see highly targeted spending in that area going forward. And as we retire, some of that project spend will be thoughtful about where we go next. So we'll start to see some of that expense start to titrate into next year. Yeah. If I split between U.S. and O-U.S., what you've seen in the U.S. is relative maturity in understanding and acceptance use of our leasing program. It's been ticking up slowly over time while it will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on customer preference. I do think that will slowly continue to tick up just based on what we hear from customers. In O-U.S. where we offer leasing, which is not in every market, we're at an earlier stage. And so you're seeing growing understand and acceptance as leasing as an option as they acquire capital. And so I'd expect that to continue to climb over time. Yes, I just say the softness in the U.S. capital pipeline is clear, and it's been clear for two quarters. What you saw in placements in Q2 was actually OUS placements grew as compared to a year ago. We haven't seen any clear and specific indications on capital weakness that I call out. Obviously, China had a challenging quarter with respect to procedures. But you look at the macro, you look at what's happening in Europe. You could imagine that might be a challenge as you look forward, but nothing that I call out at this point. Yes. On the micro question, so that was malignant TORS. It's a small but high-value segment. Roughly TAM number of surgeries performed is in the 10,000 per year range. So a relatively small market. But like I said, for surgeons and patients, really high value. In terms of where it might go, I'll let Gary expand on that."

And finally we will host a question-and-answer session. With that I will turn it over to Gary.\nGary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. In the first quarter procedure demand for our products was healthy recovering where COVID receded. Drivers of procedure performance included general surgery in the US and non-urology procedures outside of the US, which are our areas of focus. Regardless of the health of procedure demand we were challenged by environmental stresses including regional waves of COVID, staffing pressure at hospitals, component and raw material availability and logistic delays. While it's difficult to forecast how long these headwinds will persist, our teams are working hard to meet the challenge. In the quarter da Vinci procedures grew 19%, compared to the first quarter 2021. The use of da Vinci in general surgery in the United States grew nicely led by bariatric procedures, cholecystectomy, hernia repair and rectal surgery. Lobectomy growth was also healthy. Outside the United States, the UK, China, Japan Germany and Italy grew above our quarterly average growth rate, but I will note that some countries saw the beginnings of COVID slowdowns later in the quarter in particular china and Korea. International use of da Vinci is diversifying beyond urology in several countries with growth in oncologic procedures in thoracic surgery, gynecology and general surgery. In Japan, MHLW increased reimbursement for robotically assisted gastrectomy and added another eight procedures to reimbursement coverage in April, bringing the total number of covered da Vinci procedure types to over 25 in Japan. In our flexible robotics program, Ion procedures grew approximately 350% in Q1, compared with Q1 2021, reflecting continued strength in adoption and utilization of the platform. Turning to capital. Our team installed 311 da Vinci systems in the quarter compared with 298 systems in Q1 2021, bringing our total clinical installed base to 6,920 da Vinci systems. Placements varied by region with the UK standing out with a strong placement quarter. Capital placements have been historically lumpy and after several quarters of capital strength we're seeing some near-term softening of our capital placement pipeline in the US. Contributing factors may include a pull-forward of Q1 2022 demand into Q4 2021 due to customer budget utilization at year end, a reduction in the number of third-generation da Vinci systems available for trade-ins and an overall tightening of hospital finances. With the three-year CAGR and procedures of 15% from Q1 of 2019 to Q1 of 2022 and installed base growth of 11% over the same period utilization of installed systems continue to climb through the pandemic and in the first quarter. This is increasing the value derived from the existing installed base for our customers and for us. Over the mid-term capital demand in mature robotic-assisted surgery segments is a function of procedure demand moderated by utilization growth. Jamie will give regional capital trends and Brian will give a more detailed procedure review later in the call. As we exit the first quarter, we continued to invest in global expansion, innovation initiatives and our business infrastructure. Our spending in the quarter was roughly in line with our target. In instruments and accessories, we received Chinese NMPA clearance for our 45-millimeter and 60-millimeter SureForm staplers, our Vessel Sealer Extend and our Endoscope Plus. These products support the utility of our Xi systems for several procedures, particularly, general and thoracic surgeries. Turning to Ion. We submitted our EU medical device regulation application for the platform to allow the entry of Ion into Europe. Our teams are also building production capability and -- capacity pardon me and making improvements to customer workflow planning software and reprocessing efficiency. In digital products, the My Intuitive app community tripled year-over-year and is now available in the US, Japan, Germany, France, United Kingdom and Ireland and Switzerland with launches set for Italy, Spain and India in Q2. Building on our Orpheus technology our teams in Israel and the US have created Intuitive Hub, a unified hardware and software solution for the operating room. Intuitive Hub enables OR teams to capture, edit and share video clips from clinical procedures and collaborate virtually using existing workflows and Intuitive systems. In the quarter, we launched an upgraded interface to da Vinci systems that allows for automated video capture with integrated procedure annotation for key events creating convenient video storage and review for each cases. Customer feedback for this integration has been encouraging. Across the installed base the number of procedures in which Intuitive Hub was used grew approximately 60% year-over-year. To our goal of adding Iris anatomical models, we're in conversations with FDA on how best to characterize some of its core AI technology, which will require a resubmission of our 510(k) for the next set of segmented organ models. Finally, the installed base of our virtual reality training simulator SimNow grew 33% in the quarter compared with a year ago. For our single port program da Vinci SP, we began the launch of our next-generation SP endoscope which includes our Firefly Fluorescence Imaging technology and has 65% longer life. We also launched our next-generation core SP instruments that can apply higher forces during surgery and are more durable. Feedback on both has been encouraging. In Japan we submitted our da Vinci SP for clearance to PMDA seeking broad indications. We continue to pursue additional indications for SP in the US, which is important for broader adoption, with an ongoing IDE trial in colorectal surgery, and an approved IDE for thoracic surgery. COVID and some site-specific delays have slowed our progress in our colorectal trial. We're working hard to expand the number of participating sites to accelerate its completion. Stepping back, for 2022, our top priority is to support, supply and train our customers as they navigate a challenging environment. We are also focused on helping general surgeons in the United States adopt our technologies and diversifying our business outside the United States beyond urology and executing on our new platforms and digital tools. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie Samath, who will take you through financial matters in greater detail.\nJamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Overall, Q1 results reflected approximately 19% procedure growth as compared to the first quarter of 2021 and system placements of 311 systems, resulting in an expansion of the installed base of da Vinci systems of approximately 13%. As a result of our procedure and capital performance, Q1 revenue increased by 15% year-over-year. Key business metrics for the first quarter of 2022 were as follows. Within the 19% procedure growth, procedures in the US increased 16% and OUS procedures grew by 25%. Procedures in the US were impacted in January by the significant number of hospitalizations related to the Omicron variant. As rates of COVID-related hospitalizations declined in February and March, da Vinci procedures recovered quickly. On a three-year compound annual growth rate basis, first quarter procedures grew approximately 15%. First quarter system placements of 311 increased 4% from the 298 systems placed last year. The number of systems placed in conjunction with the trade-in of an older generation system declined by 18% from the first quarter of 2021. That decline was entirely driven by the US. Utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, increased approximately 6% compared to last year. Using a three-year CAGR, first quarter utilization grew 4%. During the quarter, the supply chain environment continued to be challenging and remains dynamic. In Q1, we continued to experience constraints in our ability to meet customer demand, and as a result, on-time delivery performance to our customers was lower than we have experienced so far during the pandemic. In Europe, recently, we have experienced some geographically limited delays in fulfilling orders for some da Vinci instruments and accessories. These delays were due to a combination of the global supply chain and logistics issues, including our freight forwarder's unanticipated shutdown of its computer system. While these constraints did not have a material impact to our Q1 financial results, risks associated with potential disruption to our manufacturing operations and our ability to supply certain products to our customers remain significant. During the quarter, we also experienced higher logistics costs and manufacturing inefficiencies that impacted our gross margin. US procedure growth of 16% over Q1 of 2021 reflected continued relative strength in bariatrics, cholecystectomy and hernia repair. In Europe, we experienced strong growth in the UK, reflecting in part the significant adverse impact of COVID in Q1 of 2021. Procedure growth in the UK also reflected strong early-stage growth in hysterectomy, colorectal and thoracic procedures. Procedure growth in Germany and Italy was also strong while procedure growth in France was adversely impacted by COVID-mitigation measures in the first part of the quarter. Overall procedure growth in Asia was solid with growth across a broad set of procedure categories. Q1 procedures in China and Korea were slightly lower than our expectations given the impact of the Omicron variant later in the quarter. Procedure growth in Japan was strong reflecting some recovery in urologic procedures and strong growth in rectal hysterectomy and thoracic, key procedures that were granted da Vinci reimbursement in April of 2020. The impact of the Delta variant in Q3 of last year and the impact of the Omicron variant in this past quarter highlight the continued risk of future COVID waves and the associate significant risks to the number of da Vinci procedures that maybe performed. Brian will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call. As Gary indicated, during the quarter we experienced a softening in our US capital pipeline, which we expect to impact system placements in the near term. In the US, we placed 186 systems in the first quarter lower than 190 in Q1 of 2021, reflecting a decline of 28 systems associated with trade-in transactions, partially offset by increased placements to greenfield customers. The remaining installed base of SI systems in the US is approximately 268 systems. Outside the US, we placed 125 systems in the first quarter compared with 108 in the first quarter of 2021. Current core assistant placements included 78 into Europe, 19 into Japan and nine into China compared with 59 into Europe, eight into Japan and 23 into China in the first quarter of 2021. We placed 30 systems in the UK in Q1, driven in part by the timing of government budget cycles. We do not expect to place similar levels of systems in the remainder of 2022 in the UK. Capital performance in Japan was driven primarily by greenfield accounts and some existing customers adding capacity in anticipation of the eight additional procedure reimbursements taking effect on April 1. System placements in China were moderately impacted by longer logistics cycle times as a result of lockdowns in response to increased COVID cases. As of the end of Q1 2022, there were 55 systems remaining under the current quota in China, which may also be available to competitors that have received local regulatory clearance. Globally trade-in transactions represented 35% of placements in the quarter compared to 38% for the full year of 2021 and 48% for the full year 2020. Given the lower number of older-generation systems in the field, we expect the volume of trade-ins to be significantly lower in 2022 as compared to 2021. Hospitals continue to experience financial and operational pressures as a result of staffing shortages, the supply chain environment and resulting inflation. Since the start of the pandemic in 2020, the impact of COVID has placed a significant burden on hospitals. The financial pressures our customers have faced have been partially mitigated by government funding, such as the approximately $178 billion of CARES Act and other relief made available to hospitals in the U.S. The rising interest rate environment increases debt servicing costs and may make access to new debt more challenging. To the extent that hospitals continue to face financial pressures, reductions in government funding and higher interest rates, hospital capital spending may be adversely impacted. In addition, as competition progresses in various markets, we will likely experience longer selling cycles and price pressure. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. Total first quarter revenue was $1.49 billion, an increase of 15% from last year. Leasing represented 35% of Q1 placements, compared with 37% last year -- last quarter rather. The slightly lower first quarter lease mix primarily reflected the mix of customers who prefer to purchase systems. While leasing will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time. First quarter system average selling prices were $1.54 million higher than the $1.45 million last quarter. The sequential increase was primarily driven by a lower mix of bulk by transactions with large customers and a favorable product mix in particular a higher proportion of Xi dual system placements in the quarter. We recognized $16 million of lease buyout revenue in Q1, compared with $26 million last quarter, and $19 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,870 per procedure, compared with $1,940 per procedure in the fourth quarter of 2021, and down 4% from the $1,950 realized in the first quarter of last year. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the benefit of stocking orders in Q1 of 2021 associated with the launch of our extended use instruments program in the U.S. and Europe, and an unfavorable FX impact from the stronger U.S. dollar. The sequential decline primarily reflects lower stocking orders associated with lower system placements, hospital ordering patterns and a small unfavorable impact from FX. We placed 34 Ion systems in the quarter, as compared to 14 Ion placements in the first quarter of last year. The installed base of Ion systems is now 163 systems of which 70 are under operating lease arrangements. First quarter Ion procedures of just over 3,900 are up over 4x compared to the first quarter of 2021. Seven of the systems placed in the first quarter were SP systems, including three systems placed at customers in Korea. Our installed base of SP systems is now 106. First quarter SP procedures grew approximately 36% year-over-year with approximately 50% growth in transoral procedures small but high-value segment. Growth of the SP platform will continue to be gated by additional clinical indications and clearances in market beyond the U.S. and Korea. Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the first quarter of 2022 was 69.8%, compared with 71.8% for the first quarter 2021 and 70.1% last quarter. Pro forma gross margin was lower than last quarter, primarily as a result of higher logistics costs and increased fixed costs relative to revenue, as we invest in our infrastructure and manufacturing capacity to serve our long-term needs. While net inventory grew approximately $66 million quarter-over-quarter, there are still a number of components and products that are below our targeted levels. Pro forma operating expenses increased 26% compared with the first quarter 2021. The increase in first quarter operating expenses from a year ago reflected an, increase in head count increased variable compensation and higher customer-facing costs customer training, travel costs and marketing programs. As of the end of Q1, we had just over 10,500 employees, an increase of 26% from the first quarter of 2021 or an increase of 20% on a three-year CAGR basis. Of the approximately 2,100 employees we have added over the last year approximately 900 are manufacturing employees. Capital expenditures in Q1 were $95 million, primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities' footprint, increase manufacturing capacity and automation of certain production lines. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 23.3%, slightly above our expectations primarily due to certain discrete tax items. Our pro forma tax rate was above the 22.2% for 2021, primarily due to a previous change in U.S. tax law that became effective on January 1st 2022. Our first quarter 2022 pro forma net income was $413 million or $1.13 per share, compared with $427 million or $1.17 per share for the first quarter of 2021. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $366 million or $1 per share for the first quarter of 2022, compared with GAAP net income of $426 million or $1.17 per share for the first quarter of 2021. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $8.4 billion, compared with $8.6 billion as of December 31st 2021. The sequential reduction in cash and investments in the first quarter primarily reflected share repurchases, capital expenditures and unrealized losses on interest-bearing investments classified as available for sale, partially offset by cash from operating activities and proceeds from employee stock plans. During the quarter we repurchased 398,000 shares, at an average price of $268 per share for a total expenditure of $107 million. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian, who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2022.\nBrian King: Thank you, Jamie. Our overall first quarter 2022 procedure growth was 19% compared to 16% for the first quarter of 2021. The three-year compound annual growth rate was 15%, between the first quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2022. First quarter 2022 procedure growth benefited, by 140 basis points from one additional workday in the quarter. In the U.S., first quarter 2022 procedure growth was 16% year-over-year, compared to 14% for the first quarter of 2021 and 16% last quarter. On a three-year compound annual growth basis US procedure growth was 13%. In the US first quarter growth was again driven by growth in procedures within general surgery. Bariatrics cholecystectomy and hernia repair were the largest contributors to procedure growth while growth in forge and rectal recession were also strong contributors. Outside of the US first quarter procedure volume grew approximately 25% compared with 23% for the first quarter of 2021 and 28% last quarter. On a 3-year compound annual growth basis procedure growth was 20%. In Europe we experienced strong growth in the UK, Italy, and Germany, partially reflecting the disruption caused by COVID in the first quarter of 2021. In the UK, procedure growth was strong in general, surgery, and gynecology categories supported by early-stage growth in hysterectomy colorectal and thoracic procedures. Procedure growth in Germany and Italy was also driven by procedures outside of urology with growth driven by colorectal hysterectomy, and thoracic procedures. Capital placements were also strong in the UK with the placement of 30 systems, the highest number of systems placed in the UK in a single quarter, driven in part by government funding and the trade-ins of older-generation systems. In Japan, growth in general surgery gynecology and thoracic continued to be strong with robust growth specifically in benign hysterectomy, gastrectomy, and lobectomy. In addition urologic procedures specifically prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy both experienced solid double-digit growth reflecting a recovery when compared to the prior year which was constrained by COVID. In China and Korea, first quarter procedure growth was solid but slightly below expectations as we saw a resurgence in March of COVID infections regional lockdowns and hospitalizations which negatively impacted procedure volumes. In China, growth in urology was solid in particular with growth in prostatectomy nephrectomy and partial nephrectomy. We continue to see broad-based growth in general surgery thoracic and gynecology as well. As we enter the second quarter this year, we are seeing the negative impact on procedure volume as a result of continued regional lockdowns. Now, turning to Ion, our robotic-assisted and alumina platform focused today on minimally invasive lung biopsy procedures. First quarter 2022 Ion procedures totaled just over 3,900 in Q1 2022, an approximately 350% increase over the prior year and 34% over the prior quarter. Ion system placements were also strong ending Q1 2022 with 163 installed systems growing approximately 225% over the prior year. Now, turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. During the quarter, Dr. Peres Shaw along with colleagues from the Robert I. Grossman School of Medicine at New York University and in collaboration with Intuitive published a real-world body of evidence assessing open conversion rates during minimally invasive surgery using laparoscopic, thoracoscopic, or da Vinci robotic surgery across 10 common procedures for benign or malignant conditions. Utilizing the premier health care database, this study included over 275,000 adult patients who between January 2013 and September 2015 underwent a minimally invasive procedure including hysterectomy, sigmoidectomy, right colectomy, ventral or inguinal hernia repair, partial nephrectomy, lobectomy or low anterior resection. Overall, a 5% conversion to open rate for the MIS approach was observed across all procedures with a range of 1% to 24%. Converted-to-open patients were associated with a 1.8-day longer length of stay, 1.7 times greater risk of readmission within 30 days of the procedure and a significantly higher in-hospital or perioperative 30-day total cost, adding approximately $2,900 to the in-hospital cost and $3,400 to the total 30-day cost. The researchers also compared differences in conversions between the laparoscopic, thoracoscopic and da Vinci cohorts. After performing propensity score matching, conversion rates for da Vinci procedures were significantly lower than LAP or VATS across all procedures. The volume-weighted conversion rate for da Vinci was approximately 2.8%, corresponding to a total relative conversion reduction for all study procedures of 58.5%, compared to the laparoscopic or the thoracoscopic procedures. The researchers concluded in part \"From the standpoint of population health or a hospital system, these high-level data indicated that a cumulative effect of conversions can be a significant burden. And that reduction of conversion has major benefits and leads to increased value for the patient, the hospital and society at large. The use of robotic-assisted surgery is associated with a significant decrease in the conversion rate for all 10 operations studied and a multidisciplinary robotic program, encompassing several specialties, could result in significantly decrease conversion rates, with an improved ability to deliver successful minimally invasive surgery to its patients.\" I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2022. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecast full year 2022 procedure growth within a range of 11% to 15%. We are now increasing our forecast and expect full year 2022 procedure growth of 12% to 16%. This range continues to reflect the uncertainty associated with the course of the pandemic. The low end of the range assumes ongoing COVID and staffing pressure at hospitals and assume some continued choppiness with COVID throughout the year. At the high end of the range, we assume COVID-19-related hospitalizations around the world decline throughout the remainder of 2022 and there are no additional significant impacts from further resurgences. As noted last quarter, the range does not reflect significant supply chain disruptions. The steep increase in infections and subsequent recovery in the quarter from the Omicron variant in the US and the trend in procedure volumes, we have seen exiting the quarter in China, highlight the risk to the number of procedures that may be performed. In the second quarter of 2022, our year-over-year procedure growth rate will likely be lower than recent quarters, as Q2 2021 results reflected a strong recovery in procedures as COVID began to subside. Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast our 2022 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 69.5% and 70.5%. We are now slightly expanding the range of our pro forma, gross profit margin to be within 69% and 70.5% of net revenue. The lower end of the range was updated to reflect the impact on input costs related to supply chain inflation and some impact from a stronger US dollar. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter, depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions. With respect to operating expenses, on our last call, we forecast pro forma operating expense growth to be between 21% and 27%. We are refining our estimate and now expect our full year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 23% and 27%. We continue to expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $510 million and $550 million in 2022. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $50 million and $60 million in 2022. On last quarter's call, we forecast 2022 capital expenditures within a range of $700 million to $1 billion. We are now refining estimated capital expenditures for 2022 to be in the range of $700 million to $900 million, based primarily on the current timing of planned facility construction activities. With regard to income tax, we continue to estimate our 2022 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pre-tax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you.  And our first question is, sorry, from the line of Amit Hazan. Please, go ahead.\nAmit Hazan: Thank you. Hey, good afternoon. Maybe, I'll ask my first question on your comments on the US systems side and the capital spending environment, would just love to have more color on that. And, obviously, we were focused on the same numbers that you mentioned, which is just the greenfield unit placements. And if we kind of look back, just as context of what we have is, just over the past four or five years, those tend to increase by about 10% a year and it is pretty choppy year-to-year. Just using that as a proxy, how much help can you give us on whether that's a good kind of target for this year for the non-trade-ins in the US? And then just color on what you're seeing here in the near, kind of, just immediate term that you mentioned. It sounded like a lot of risk factors. And I'm wondering if it's risk factors that you're citing or its something that you're actually seeing in your customers delaying planned purchases.\nGary Guthart: Yes. Let me take the second question first and then I'll ask Jamie to step in on a little bit more on the trade-in side. So what we're seeing now, where we're at is, a little bit less delay of planned purchases, a little bit less what we're signaling more around -- Q4 demand looks strong. Q1 in terms of the early parts of the pipeline process and some of the contracting, some of the later parts, we're seeing in the US just a little bit lower volume. It may clear itself. It may entirely be that, this was just a pull-forward of a little bit of demand and some budget flushing, as hospitals got ready for the retirement of some of the government support for COVID. But it's not clear. We don't know yet. We know for sure that we're getting toward the end of the SI trade-in cycle in the United States. So that will soften some of the US capital. The final point I'll -- and then there's forecasted additional pressures on hospitals and finances. The short answer to that is, we're going to have to see. We'll see if those come to fruition or not. So that's a little bit of where that lays out. With regard to kind of what does the trade-in ratio look like, let me turn it to you Jamie. \nJamie Samath: Yes. If I just look back at last year 2021 there's about 500-ish trade-ins done globally. Of that about 80% were transactions in the US, so you can just kind of get a sense of the degree to which the US has driven the trade-in cycle. As I said in my prepared remarks as of the end of Q1 there's about 268 SIs left in the US in the installed base. And so you can kind of use those two data points to some estimate of how that will play out overtime.  As you start to get towards kind of the end of the tail of remaining SIs, that they probably last for a little longer than kind of the average when you're in the middle of the distribution. But that's what I'd say with respect to trade-ins. I think Amit you had a question on greenfields. The way I would think about it in the US is, you kind of have your procedure estimates that you can take from our range. You can apply the usual model with respect to utilization. That gives you some sense of how the installed base might expand. And so, you can kind of do that calculation. That obviously is a mix of greenfields and incrementals. And I would just reflect in that model then what is the potential risk from what we highlighted with respect to the softening US capital pipeline that we saw in Q1. \nGary Guthart: Just a capping remark on that. Final thought is, the core driver in a mature multiport market segment in a country like the United States, the core driver is procedure demand. And we feel like procedure demand is healthy. It's healthy in our target areas. Our major focus is making sure that we can supply the customer with what they need in a way that's high quality and timely. So, it's really managing the supply chain. If that goes well and we are successful in closing those gaps, I think capital demand will work itself out. It will play through because it ultimately in those markets is driven by core procedure demand. \nAmit Hazan: Thanks for that color. And the second question I always hate to ask this question but I feel like investors want me to, at this point in time just get you to reflect on it. So we always believe as you stated that you're working on at least one, if not two new platforms. We know you have that in the background. We see your R&D spend. That's obvious to everyone. I think the big question is always about timing.  And for us what we wanted to ask is, is this a situation at this point in time where technology just need more time to incubate whether maybe what we're seeing is more something that's related to FDA in the process that you go through and how that's evolved? How much color can you give us on just the process for getting new technology to market and where you are?\nGary Guthart: Yes. It's a good question. The -- what I'd say here is a couple. One is, as the technologies have matured and the installed base has gotten bigger, we've made an intentional decision to invest a lot in upgrading the capabilities of Gen 4 platforms that are out there. So the first thing has been that the SI that somebody purchases today is more capable than the SI that they had in -- when it was first launched and we keep doing that.  In part that's easier those kind of incremental adds to platform architecture that's pretty mature are easier for the customer base to absorb. And they also compound utilization. They allow them to get more utility out of the capital they have. They get higher throughput through it and they do more procedures with it. And in Gen 4, we're not done with that. We have continued to do it and whether it's instruments and accessories or endoscopy or software.  And we have some things up our sleeves for that too. So that was intentional. We were doing more kind of structural changes early on in that product and we have intentionally moved some things into more incremental changes on Gen 4. We do think that there are bigger structural changes that will make sense. We are working on them. They are interesting. I think they have long-term implications for the surgical market segments we participated and I'm excited about them. Some of those things are around technology development. Some of them are around manufacturing and supply chain development and some of them are around clinical pathways and regulatory pathways. So all of those things play out. I will reinforce what you said. We work on incremental changes. We work on structural changes and we work kind of multiple generations ahead and that remains true. We continue to do that. Timing-wise, sometimes a little bit hard to predict perfectly based on both supply chain readiness, and how FDA thinks about those things. For us, I want to make sure that every time we make a step that the customers value it, that it's done with them in mind rather than with us in mind. And we continue to have that philosophy and we'll pursue it.\nAmit Hazan: Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Rick Wise from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nRick Wise: Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Hi, Gary. Maybe, we could talk about -- you could expand on your comments on Ion. Just a couple of things you said that I'd be curious to hear more about. Submitted for EU approval, maybe you could give us a little more color on the timing of the opportunity and I'm wondering whether it impacts 2022. But maybe you could also talk a little bit about what you've been kind enough to describe in the recent past as sort of an inflection point for Ion. Maybe broadly speaking, what's your early -- what's the feedback you're getting from how the device is using? And maybe talk a little bit about what's next. I mean, it seems more like an execution kind of story at this point.\nGary Guthart: Thanks, Rick. On submission for Europe, the -- we just submitted our dossier. Europe has changed over their -- the framing of their medical device regulation. They call it, EU MDR. It's relatively new for the world. As a result, projecting exact timing to get those clearances is a little different relative to historical norms. We don't anticipate it completing in 2022. That's just -- it's a little bit of what's the odds game, but we think it's several quarters to finish, mostly because it's new for the regulators and it's new for us. On the point of how is Ion ongoing, it's being driven right now on the single indication of biopsy and bronchoscopy. I think it's driving well because it meets a need. I think alternate technologies manual and robotic are less capable. And we see a lot of peer-to-peer word of mouth that is driving interest and that's backed by data like the PRECIsE trial. So that's been helpful for us. A lot of our focus here has been developing our manufacturing capacity, continuously improving the product in terms of usability, quality, robustness and efficacy. And the teams are doing a great job and working extremely hard to do all of those things make sure that we can maintain supply and improve. I'm just delighted with what they're up to. They are both increasing capacity and improving robustness and quality simultaneously. So that's been wonderful, and I think we have room. We're seeing the combination of Ion bronchoscopic evaluation combined with robotic surgery thereafter sometimes people do it on the same day. And that has seen some real value for patients. It's not every part of the patient population, but there are some patients for whom that's a good solution. And we see a lot of excitement. So the tie-through of Ion diagnostics with follow-through treatment is creating patient value. It's shortening the time to definitive answers and then a surgery if a surgery is indicated. So that's been great. We think Ion as a platform has multiple future indications that it can provide clinical value that it can bring and we are pursuing them assertively in various places. We are not yet publicly describing what those things are in part because we have some technology to develop in part there's some regulatory pathways in and it's a competitive space. And so we're working down those elements. As we get a little closer have a little bit better visibility into which ones when then we'll be sure to share.\nRick Wise: Got you. Procedure demand, as you clearly stated it was healthy this quarter. It seems like it's \u2013 it feels like, it's likely to continue. So hopefully, as hopefully COVID headwinds settle back a little bit around the world. You \u2013 Intuitive always used to talk about the \u2013 let's see, if I can say this correctly Gary, the percentage of utilization for average utilization for da Vinci systems. And I'm sort of making this up from memory, but it used to be like when you got to 60% or 65% of procedure of da Vinci capacity, it would start to drive new discussions about new systems. Is it \u2013 forgetting the specifics of question where do you feel like you are with the current installed base utilization? And is that a consideration that we should reflect on as we think about system placements going forward?\nGary Guthart: There's absolutely a relationship between procedure growth and demand, and increased utilization on capital, right? And it's inversely related. If you have lower utilization, you sell more capital to do the same number of procedures. We have believed and have pursued assertively that while higher utilization decreases the number of systems that we sell, it increases the utility the economic value derived by our customers to get higher throughput. And so we put programs in both in terms of design and workflow, as well as consulting services to help them get higher utilization. We've been doing that for years. It's a number that, you can move in a sustained way but it's hard to move quickly. And I'll turn it over to Jamie shortly, who'll talk a little bit about what the trend line and utilization growth has been. But from an intent point of view, we are happy to see increased utilization, even if that pressures near-term capital because it creates better ROI conditions for our customers. And from a pure marginal economics point of view at Intuitive, the marginal economics work out well for us too. So it's a win-win even though at the top line in placements, it may look like pressure. So then you had asked the question kind of what is peak utilization, and how do you think about that. I'll also turn it over to Jamie. It has a lot to do with mix and operating conditions in the hospital. It's a little bit less a technology question, a little bit more how they use it. So Jamie, perhaps a little bit on utilization.\nJamie Samath: If I just go back to pre-COVID for a second Rick, if you look at 2019 average system utilization grew by 5% over 2018. If I look at recent times and use the CAGR approach to kind of normalize for COVID last year on a two-year CAGR basis in 2021 utilization grew by 4% this past quarter on a three-year CAGR basis. Again back to 2019 grew by 4%. So you can see some relative consistency there. With respect to looking forward, I think that there is some dependency on the institution the procedure mix within the institution. General surgery in combination with Xi gives you the opportunity to drive utilization differently than a different procedure mix particularly given the lower procedure times in some of the benign low-acuity procedures. But it also reflects the number of surgeons that are trained and the commitment of the possible to drive asset utilization. If you look at the distribution of utilization today it's relatively wide. I think there are a number of CFOs and hospitals that on a medium-term basis see opportunities to continue to drive utilization up and we are supportive of that. \nRick Wise: Thank you so much.\nGary Guthart: Thanks, Rick.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just one on China for me and one on inflation and supply constraint. So on China what have you guys seen so far from the lockdowns? And what are your expectations for the second quarter? Do you think you can still grow year-over-year in China? And related to that Gary what's the process and time line for the next quota? You're about to finish this quota. Is it possible the next quota could be larger or eliminated entirely? And I have one follow-up. \nGary Guthart: I'll turn those both to Jamie. \nJamie Samath: Yes. With respect to what we saw with -- in procedures in Q1 as you saw the COVID cases rises in places like Shanghai. And as the authorities locked down and they locked down pretty strictly, we saw procedures impacted in March. That's continued so far into April although it's obviously early. I think that there's risk in procedures in Q2 relative to what you would expect without COVID and those lockdowns. China is our second-biggest marketplace, but it's still a relatively small proportion of overall procedures. US is still about 70% of global procedures. But certainly the way things look right now you have some impact in Q2. What that ends up being really depends on how long the lockdowns last and how long COVID persists in China. I think a separate risk is kind of the impact of logistics and supply chains as we deliver product to China and from a more macro perspective just the port closures and the broader impact that we could see in China given the degree of exports they have just generally across the economy. With respect to the China quota difficult to predict. The last couple of times the quota has been issued in the third year of the quota period, which would be next year. We don't have great visibility into when that might be. And we don't have honestly great visibility into what the number would be. I don't think we are expecting or planning on a situation where we are exempt from a quota. But again we don't have great insights to how that will play out. \nGary Guthart: In general, if the quota\u2026\nLarry Biegelsen: Yes.\nGary Guthart: If the quota, is responsive to demand we think demand is high and the question is how responsive to that demand is the central government quota when they do it. Sorry, Larry go ahead. \nLarry Biegelsen: No. I'm sorry to interrupt you. Thank you. Jamie on inflation and supply constraints, are you able to quantify the impact on the gross margin that you're expecting from inflation? And on supply constraints, how are you addressing this? A lot of companies are buying forward inventory. And what are your expectations for when it gets better? I know you've talked about hand-to-hand combat. You've used that phrase almost on the last few calls. So thanks for taking the questions.\nJamie Samath: Yes. I would just maybe ground the impact of inflation a couple of ways. If you look back at history, our gross margin has been in, let's say, the 71%-ish range versus what we just guided 69% to 70.5%. And there's really two drivers in the gap between our history and that range. One are the investments we're making in fixed costs in infrastructure and manufacturing capacity, that's being invested effectively for long-term need. So some of that is ahead of when we will need it. But the lead times require that we put that in place ahead of time. The second impact is this impact from the supply chain and inflation in the form of logistics costs, higher component prices, et cetera. I can't give you perfect kind of delineation between the two. I would say roughly slightly more of that the impact of that gap is on the fixed cost side. The remainder is in inflation supply chain impacts. With respect to how we're managing through the supply chain, there are significant efforts by our operations team just to respond to the whack-a-mole that you described. It's a constant battle of issue resolution. And our number one goal as Gary described is to ensure continuity of supply to customers. So that's where our efforts and focus is. As the supply chain environment rebalances in whatever point that is in the future, certainly, we will kind of refocus our operations teams to focus on cost reductions, getting our manufacturing efficiencies back to our targets. But that's going to really be a question of when will that be. On the inventory side, you saw us actually increase inventories. I referenced in my prepared remarks almost $70 million sequentially. The mix of that though is clearly not perfect. We're replenishing inventory where we can if and as supply lasts. But we have an imbalance currently. Certainly, if you look at the medium to long-term, we're going to look carefully at what levels of inventory we want to hold, as one risk mitigation. I think the other thing we'll look at is, how do we make ourselves less dependent on sole suppliers.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thanks, Jamie.\nGary Guthart : Just a tiny bit of color on that capping sentence, the current situation -- it's a little bit hard to predict the future, because there's enough moving parts that determining what or forecasting exactly how it will move is probably difficult at this moment. Currently, the number of parts that are under stress has decreased, but the intensity of the stress around a few parts has increased. So, the issue of -- the number of things that are a challenge is narrowing, but the ones that remain are more stubborn. And Jamie, your point of we use various tools whether it's buying ahead, buying safety stock, or redundancy and supply chain. We'll use any and all of those if we can to help mitigate the risk.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thank you, Gary.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Drew Ranieri from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDrew Ranieri : Hi, Gary and Jamie. Thanks for taking the question. Gary, just for you. I mean, I think Intuitive has like 2,200 US hospital customers. That's more my guess than I think what you've ever laid out. But can you maybe talk about what it takes to get the remaining 4,000 hospitals really off the sidelines and using robotics? Just maybe how are you thinking about that in the US? I mean, do you necessarily have to go everywhere, or are there really, kind of, still opportunities to get into the high-volume surgery centers hospitals given some of the commentary about the trade-in cycle dynamics and your push for some higher utilization of the systems?\nGary Guthart: The -- I won't speak to the quantitative approach. And perhaps Jamie you have a perspective. But just to give you a little bit of a qualitative view, many of the hospitals out there that are greenfields, while they may not have one of our programs today are part of an integrated delivery network that somewhere in the system they have our products and knowledge. The way we work with that is collaboratively with IDN leadership. As they start to understand what the value of the programs are, they will start to move within their own system our products into locations they care about. And so we've seen a really nice move and collaborative expansion with our customer base into those spaces. Increasingly, we have conversations about moving into different sites of care, especially as benign -- general surgery procedures and some other procedures that are benign and often done in smaller ambulatory environments become more prevalent in our workspace we see that improving over time. So we think we can follow our customers where they want to go. There is the concentrating effect of robotics and capital investment. It is capital investment. When that happens it does concentrate regionally those patients and procedures into Centers of Excellence. We think that's good for our customer to get higher utilization. We think it's good for surgical outcomes because they get more practice. So I think it's a combination of the two. I don't think we just look at it and think we have to go to where every patient is today. We do think consolidation helps and works but it will expand from where it is in this moment. Jamie, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.\nJamie Samath: The only thing I would say is the remaining greenfields tend to be -- this is not always the case, but tend to be more in the rural setting, smaller number of beds. So what I think we've seen over the last three, four quarters as Gary described is actually increases in the number of placements of greenfield accounts. These are hospitals as Gary said that are within existing IDNs. And that's largely a function of the success and experience those IDNs have had with benign procedures particularly in general surgery, which tend to be a higher mix in these rural hospitals. And so they see the opportunity for effective robotics programs in that setting, whereas, before maybe there was more skepticism or the financial picture was more challenging. We'll do that carefully and in conjunction with our IDN partners and it has to be one that makes economic sense for us and for the customer. On the ASC side, we have a relatively small but growing installed base. Our procedure growth at ASCs in the US is accretive, but that's probably because the number of systems that we have at hospitals or ASCs is relatively low. Those ASCs generally are ASCs affiliated in some way with our IDNs. That gives us greater confidence in those accounts.\nGary Guthart: Drew, I'll give you a fast follow-up here at the end.\nDrew Ranieri: All right. Thanks. Just on Japan, you talked about adding eight more procedures -- you're getting reimbursement for eight more procedures. Can you maybe just put that in context of how you expect that ramp to maybe look like versus the prior wave of reimbursed procedures in Japan? Thanks.\nBrian King: Drew hi, this is Brian. I guess I would say, really the opportunity for adoption on those eight newly reimbursed procedures, it's a bit difficult I'd say, to estimate at this time, right? I mean, if you were to take procedures like colon resection, as an example, it's highly penetrated by lap today. So I think adoption of da Vinci will actually be dependent on, say, demonstrating clinical and economic benefits, which I think it's going to take some time. And I think it's going to take some time to develop our training and proctoring capabilities and really to establish key opinion leaders. So, I think it's just going to take some time. It's really hard to estimate how quickly da Vinci will adopt locally.\nGary Guthart: A little color on that. I think over the mid-term, we're really excited about it. Over the near term, it takes more. Thank you, Drew. That was our last question.\nGary Guthart: In closing, we continue to believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the Quadruple Aim: better more predictable patient outcomes; better experiences for patients; better experiences for their care teams; and ultimately a lower total cost to treat. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly, so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months. This concludes the call.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gary Guthart",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today. In the first quarter procedure demand for our products was healthy recovering where COVID receded. Drivers of procedure performance included general surgery in the US and non-urology procedures outside of the US, which are our areas of focus. Regardless of the health of procedure demand we were challenged by environmental stresses including regional waves of COVID, staffing pressure at hospitals, component and raw material availability and logistic delays. While it's difficult to forecast how long these headwinds will persist, our teams are working hard to meet the challenge. In the quarter da Vinci procedures grew 19%, compared to the first quarter 2021. The use of da Vinci in general surgery in the United States grew nicely led by bariatric procedures, cholecystectomy, hernia repair and rectal surgery. Lobectomy growth was also healthy. Outside the United States, the UK, China, Japan Germany and Italy grew above our quarterly average growth rate, but I will note that some countries saw the beginnings of COVID slowdowns later in the quarter in particular china and Korea. International use of da Vinci is diversifying beyond urology in several countries with growth in oncologic procedures in thoracic surgery, gynecology and general surgery. In Japan, MHLW increased reimbursement for robotically assisted gastrectomy and added another eight procedures to reimbursement coverage in April, bringing the total number of covered da Vinci procedure types to over 25 in Japan. In our flexible robotics program, Ion procedures grew approximately 350% in Q1, compared with Q1 2021, reflecting continued strength in adoption and utilization of the platform. Turning to capital. Our team installed 311 da Vinci systems in the quarter compared with 298 systems in Q1 2021, bringing our total clinical installed base to 6,920 da Vinci systems. Placements varied by region with the UK standing out with a strong placement quarter. Capital placements have been historically lumpy and after several quarters of capital strength we're seeing some near-term softening of our capital placement pipeline in the US. Contributing factors may include a pull-forward of Q1 2022 demand into Q4 2021 due to customer budget utilization at year end, a reduction in the number of third-generation da Vinci systems available for trade-ins and an overall tightening of hospital finances. With the three-year CAGR and procedures of 15% from Q1 of 2019 to Q1 of 2022 and installed base growth of 11% over the same period utilization of installed systems continue to climb through the pandemic and in the first quarter. This is increasing the value derived from the existing installed base for our customers and for us. Over the mid-term capital demand in mature robotic-assisted surgery segments is a function of procedure demand moderated by utilization growth. Jamie will give regional capital trends and Brian will give a more detailed procedure review later in the call. As we exit the first quarter, we continued to invest in global expansion, innovation initiatives and our business infrastructure. Our spending in the quarter was roughly in line with our target. In instruments and accessories, we received Chinese NMPA clearance for our 45-millimeter and 60-millimeter SureForm staplers, our Vessel Sealer Extend and our Endoscope Plus. These products support the utility of our Xi systems for several procedures, particularly, general and thoracic surgeries. Turning to Ion. We submitted our EU medical device regulation application for the platform to allow the entry of Ion into Europe. Our teams are also building production capability and -- capacity pardon me and making improvements to customer workflow planning software and reprocessing efficiency. In digital products, the My Intuitive app community tripled year-over-year and is now available in the US, Japan, Germany, France, United Kingdom and Ireland and Switzerland with launches set for Italy, Spain and India in Q2. Building on our Orpheus technology our teams in Israel and the US have created Intuitive Hub, a unified hardware and software solution for the operating room. Intuitive Hub enables OR teams to capture, edit and share video clips from clinical procedures and collaborate virtually using existing workflows and Intuitive systems. In the quarter, we launched an upgraded interface to da Vinci systems that allows for automated video capture with integrated procedure annotation for key events creating convenient video storage and review for each cases. Customer feedback for this integration has been encouraging. Across the installed base the number of procedures in which Intuitive Hub was used grew approximately 60% year-over-year. To our goal of adding Iris anatomical models, we're in conversations with FDA on how best to characterize some of its core AI technology, which will require a resubmission of our 510(k) for the next set of segmented organ models. Finally, the installed base of our virtual reality training simulator SimNow grew 33% in the quarter compared with a year ago. For our single port program da Vinci SP, we began the launch of our next-generation SP endoscope which includes our Firefly Fluorescence Imaging technology and has 65% longer life. We also launched our next-generation core SP instruments that can apply higher forces during surgery and are more durable. Feedback on both has been encouraging. In Japan we submitted our da Vinci SP for clearance to PMDA seeking broad indications. We continue to pursue additional indications for SP in the US, which is important for broader adoption, with an ongoing IDE trial in colorectal surgery, and an approved IDE for thoracic surgery. COVID and some site-specific delays have slowed our progress in our colorectal trial. We're working hard to expand the number of participating sites to accelerate its completion. Stepping back, for 2022, our top priority is to support, supply and train our customers as they navigate a challenging environment. We are also focused on helping general surgeons in the United States adopt our technologies and diversifying our business outside the United States beyond urology and executing on our new platforms and digital tools. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie Samath, who will take you through financial matters in greater detail. Yes. Let me take the second question first and then I'll ask Jamie to step in on a little bit more on the trade-in side. So what we're seeing now, where we're at is, a little bit less delay of planned purchases, a little bit less what we're signaling more around -- Q4 demand looks strong. Q1 in terms of the early parts of the pipeline process and some of the contracting, some of the later parts, we're seeing in the US just a little bit lower volume. It may clear itself. It may entirely be that, this was just a pull-forward of a little bit of demand and some budget flushing, as hospitals got ready for the retirement of some of the government support for COVID. But it's not clear. We don't know yet. We know for sure that we're getting toward the end of the SI trade-in cycle in the United States. So that will soften some of the US capital. The final point I'll -- and then there's forecasted additional pressures on hospitals and finances. The short answer to that is, we're going to have to see. We'll see if those come to fruition or not. So that's a little bit of where that lays out. With regard to kind of what does the trade-in ratio look like, let me turn it to you Jamie. Just a capping remark on that. Final thought is, the core driver in a mature multiport market segment in a country like the United States, the core driver is procedure demand. And we feel like procedure demand is healthy. It's healthy in our target areas. Our major focus is making sure that we can supply the customer with what they need in a way that's high quality and timely. So, it's really managing the supply chain. If that goes well and we are successful in closing those gaps, I think capital demand will work itself out. It will play through because it ultimately in those markets is driven by core procedure demand. Yes. It's a good question. The -- what I'd say here is a couple. One is, as the technologies have matured and the installed base has gotten bigger, we've made an intentional decision to invest a lot in upgrading the capabilities of Gen 4 platforms that are out there. So the first thing has been that the SI that somebody purchases today is more capable than the SI that they had in -- when it was first launched and we keep doing that.  In part that's easier those kind of incremental adds to platform architecture that's pretty mature are easier for the customer base to absorb. And they also compound utilization. They allow them to get more utility out of the capital they have. They get higher throughput through it and they do more procedures with it. And in Gen 4, we're not done with that. We have continued to do it and whether it's instruments and accessories or endoscopy or software.  And we have some things up our sleeves for that too. So that was intentional. We were doing more kind of structural changes early on in that product and we have intentionally moved some things into more incremental changes on Gen 4. We do think that there are bigger structural changes that will make sense. We are working on them. They are interesting. I think they have long-term implications for the surgical market segments we participated and I'm excited about them. Some of those things are around technology development. Some of them are around manufacturing and supply chain development and some of them are around clinical pathways and regulatory pathways. So all of those things play out. I will reinforce what you said. We work on incremental changes. We work on structural changes and we work kind of multiple generations ahead and that remains true. We continue to do that. Timing-wise, sometimes a little bit hard to predict perfectly based on both supply chain readiness, and how FDA thinks about those things. For us, I want to make sure that every time we make a step that the customers value it, that it's done with them in mind rather than with us in mind. And we continue to have that philosophy and we'll pursue it. Thanks, Rick. On submission for Europe, the -- we just submitted our dossier. Europe has changed over their -- the framing of their medical device regulation. They call it, EU MDR. It's relatively new for the world. As a result, projecting exact timing to get those clearances is a little different relative to historical norms. We don't anticipate it completing in 2022. That's just -- it's a little bit of what's the odds game, but we think it's several quarters to finish, mostly because it's new for the regulators and it's new for us. On the point of how is Ion ongoing, it's being driven right now on the single indication of biopsy and bronchoscopy. I think it's driving well because it meets a need. I think alternate technologies manual and robotic are less capable. And we see a lot of peer-to-peer word of mouth that is driving interest and that's backed by data like the PRECIsE trial. So that's been helpful for us. A lot of our focus here has been developing our manufacturing capacity, continuously improving the product in terms of usability, quality, robustness and efficacy. And the teams are doing a great job and working extremely hard to do all of those things make sure that we can maintain supply and improve. I'm just delighted with what they're up to. They are both increasing capacity and improving robustness and quality simultaneously. So that's been wonderful, and I think we have room. We're seeing the combination of Ion bronchoscopic evaluation combined with robotic surgery thereafter sometimes people do it on the same day. And that has seen some real value for patients. It's not every part of the patient population, but there are some patients for whom that's a good solution. And we see a lot of excitement. So the tie-through of Ion diagnostics with follow-through treatment is creating patient value. It's shortening the time to definitive answers and then a surgery if a surgery is indicated. So that's been great. We think Ion as a platform has multiple future indications that it can provide clinical value that it can bring and we are pursuing them assertively in various places. We are not yet publicly describing what those things are in part because we have some technology to develop in part there's some regulatory pathways in and it's a competitive space. And so we're working down those elements. As we get a little closer have a little bit better visibility into which ones when then we'll be sure to share. There's absolutely a relationship between procedure growth and demand, and increased utilization on capital, right? And it's inversely related. If you have lower utilization, you sell more capital to do the same number of procedures. We have believed and have pursued assertively that while higher utilization decreases the number of systems that we sell, it increases the utility the economic value derived by our customers to get higher throughput. And so we put programs in both in terms of design and workflow, as well as consulting services to help them get higher utilization. We've been doing that for years. It's a number that, you can move in a sustained way but it's hard to move quickly. And I'll turn it over to Jamie shortly, who'll talk a little bit about what the trend line and utilization growth has been. But from an intent point of view, we are happy to see increased utilization, even if that pressures near-term capital because it creates better ROI conditions for our customers. And from a pure marginal economics point of view at Intuitive, the marginal economics work out well for us too. So it's a win-win even though at the top line in placements, it may look like pressure. So then you had asked the question kind of what is peak utilization, and how do you think about that. I'll also turn it over to Jamie. It has a lot to do with mix and operating conditions in the hospital. It's a little bit less a technology question, a little bit more how they use it. So Jamie, perhaps a little bit on utilization. Thanks, Rick. I'll turn those both to Jamie. In general, if the quota... If the quota, is responsive to demand we think demand is high and the question is how responsive to that demand is the central government quota when they do it. Sorry, Larry go ahead. Just a tiny bit of color on that capping sentence, the current situation -- it's a little bit hard to predict the future, because there's enough moving parts that determining what or forecasting exactly how it will move is probably difficult at this moment. Currently, the number of parts that are under stress has decreased, but the intensity of the stress around a few parts has increased. So, the issue of -- the number of things that are a challenge is narrowing, but the ones that remain are more stubborn. And Jamie, your point of we use various tools whether it's buying ahead, buying safety stock, or redundancy and supply chain. We'll use any and all of those if we can to help mitigate the risk. The -- I won't speak to the quantitative approach. And perhaps Jamie you have a perspective. But just to give you a little bit of a qualitative view, many of the hospitals out there that are greenfields, while they may not have one of our programs today are part of an integrated delivery network that somewhere in the system they have our products and knowledge. The way we work with that is collaboratively with IDN leadership. As they start to understand what the value of the programs are, they will start to move within their own system our products into locations they care about. And so we've seen a really nice move and collaborative expansion with our customer base into those spaces. Increasingly, we have conversations about moving into different sites of care, especially as benign -- general surgery procedures and some other procedures that are benign and often done in smaller ambulatory environments become more prevalent in our workspace we see that improving over time. So we think we can follow our customers where they want to go. There is the concentrating effect of robotics and capital investment. It is capital investment. When that happens it does concentrate regionally those patients and procedures into Centers of Excellence. We think that's good for our customer to get higher utilization. We think it's good for surgical outcomes because they get more practice. So I think it's a combination of the two. I don't think we just look at it and think we have to go to where every patient is today. We do think consolidation helps and works but it will expand from where it is in this moment. Jamie, I don't know if you want to add anything to that. Drew, I'll give you a fast follow-up here at the end. A little color on that. I think over the mid-term, we're really excited about it. Over the near term, it takes more. Thank you, Drew. That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the Quadruple Aim: better more predictable patient outcomes; better experiences for patients; better experiences for their care teams; and ultimately a lower total cost to treat. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly, so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months. This concludes the call."

            "name": "Jamie Samath",
            "content": "Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Overall, Q1 results reflected approximately 19% procedure growth as compared to the first quarter of 2021 and system placements of 311 systems, resulting in an expansion of the installed base of da Vinci systems of approximately 13%. As a result of our procedure and capital performance, Q1 revenue increased by 15% year-over-year. Key business metrics for the first quarter of 2022 were as follows. Within the 19% procedure growth, procedures in the US increased 16% and OUS procedures grew by 25%. Procedures in the US were impacted in January by the significant number of hospitalizations related to the Omicron variant. As rates of COVID-related hospitalizations declined in February and March, da Vinci procedures recovered quickly. On a three-year compound annual growth rate basis, first quarter procedures grew approximately 15%. First quarter system placements of 311 increased 4% from the 298 systems placed last year. The number of systems placed in conjunction with the trade-in of an older generation system declined by 18% from the first quarter of 2021. That decline was entirely driven by the US. Utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, increased approximately 6% compared to last year. Using a three-year CAGR, first quarter utilization grew 4%. During the quarter, the supply chain environment continued to be challenging and remains dynamic. In Q1, we continued to experience constraints in our ability to meet customer demand, and as a result, on-time delivery performance to our customers was lower than we have experienced so far during the pandemic. In Europe, recently, we have experienced some geographically limited delays in fulfilling orders for some da Vinci instruments and accessories. These delays were due to a combination of the global supply chain and logistics issues, including our freight forwarder's unanticipated shutdown of its computer system. While these constraints did not have a material impact to our Q1 financial results, risks associated with potential disruption to our manufacturing operations and our ability to supply certain products to our customers remain significant. During the quarter, we also experienced higher logistics costs and manufacturing inefficiencies that impacted our gross margin. US procedure growth of 16% over Q1 of 2021 reflected continued relative strength in bariatrics, cholecystectomy and hernia repair. In Europe, we experienced strong growth in the UK, reflecting in part the significant adverse impact of COVID in Q1 of 2021. Procedure growth in the UK also reflected strong early-stage growth in hysterectomy, colorectal and thoracic procedures. Procedure growth in Germany and Italy was also strong while procedure growth in France was adversely impacted by COVID-mitigation measures in the first part of the quarter. Overall procedure growth in Asia was solid with growth across a broad set of procedure categories. Q1 procedures in China and Korea were slightly lower than our expectations given the impact of the Omicron variant later in the quarter. Procedure growth in Japan was strong reflecting some recovery in urologic procedures and strong growth in rectal hysterectomy and thoracic, key procedures that were granted da Vinci reimbursement in April of 2020. The impact of the Delta variant in Q3 of last year and the impact of the Omicron variant in this past quarter highlight the continued risk of future COVID waves and the associate significant risks to the number of da Vinci procedures that maybe performed. Brian will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call. As Gary indicated, during the quarter we experienced a softening in our US capital pipeline, which we expect to impact system placements in the near term. In the US, we placed 186 systems in the first quarter lower than 190 in Q1 of 2021, reflecting a decline of 28 systems associated with trade-in transactions, partially offset by increased placements to greenfield customers. The remaining installed base of SI systems in the US is approximately 268 systems. Outside the US, we placed 125 systems in the first quarter compared with 108 in the first quarter of 2021. Current core assistant placements included 78 into Europe, 19 into Japan and nine into China compared with 59 into Europe, eight into Japan and 23 into China in the first quarter of 2021. We placed 30 systems in the UK in Q1, driven in part by the timing of government budget cycles. We do not expect to place similar levels of systems in the remainder of 2022 in the UK. Capital performance in Japan was driven primarily by greenfield accounts and some existing customers adding capacity in anticipation of the eight additional procedure reimbursements taking effect on April 1. System placements in China were moderately impacted by longer logistics cycle times as a result of lockdowns in response to increased COVID cases. As of the end of Q1 2022, there were 55 systems remaining under the current quota in China, which may also be available to competitors that have received local regulatory clearance. Globally trade-in transactions represented 35% of placements in the quarter compared to 38% for the full year of 2021 and 48% for the full year 2020. Given the lower number of older-generation systems in the field, we expect the volume of trade-ins to be significantly lower in 2022 as compared to 2021. Hospitals continue to experience financial and operational pressures as a result of staffing shortages, the supply chain environment and resulting inflation. Since the start of the pandemic in 2020, the impact of COVID has placed a significant burden on hospitals. The financial pressures our customers have faced have been partially mitigated by government funding, such as the approximately $178 billion of CARES Act and other relief made available to hospitals in the U.S. The rising interest rate environment increases debt servicing costs and may make access to new debt more challenging. To the extent that hospitals continue to face financial pressures, reductions in government funding and higher interest rates, hospital capital spending may be adversely impacted. In addition, as competition progresses in various markets, we will likely experience longer selling cycles and price pressure. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. Total first quarter revenue was $1.49 billion, an increase of 15% from last year. Leasing represented 35% of Q1 placements, compared with 37% last year -- last quarter rather. The slightly lower first quarter lease mix primarily reflected the mix of customers who prefer to purchase systems. While leasing will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time. First quarter system average selling prices were $1.54 million higher than the $1.45 million last quarter. The sequential increase was primarily driven by a lower mix of bulk by transactions with large customers and a favorable product mix in particular a higher proportion of Xi dual system placements in the quarter. We recognized $16 million of lease buyout revenue in Q1, compared with $26 million last quarter, and $19 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,870 per procedure, compared with $1,940 per procedure in the fourth quarter of 2021, and down 4% from the $1,950 realized in the first quarter of last year. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the benefit of stocking orders in Q1 of 2021 associated with the launch of our extended use instruments program in the U.S. and Europe, and an unfavorable FX impact from the stronger U.S. dollar. The sequential decline primarily reflects lower stocking orders associated with lower system placements, hospital ordering patterns and a small unfavorable impact from FX. We placed 34 Ion systems in the quarter, as compared to 14 Ion placements in the first quarter of last year. The installed base of Ion systems is now 163 systems of which 70 are under operating lease arrangements. First quarter Ion procedures of just over 3,900 are up over 4x compared to the first quarter of 2021. Seven of the systems placed in the first quarter were SP systems, including three systems placed at customers in Korea. Our installed base of SP systems is now 106. First quarter SP procedures grew approximately 36% year-over-year with approximately 50% growth in transoral procedures small but high-value segment. Growth of the SP platform will continue to be gated by additional clinical indications and clearances in market beyond the U.S. and Korea. Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the first quarter of 2022 was 69.8%, compared with 71.8% for the first quarter 2021 and 70.1% last quarter. Pro forma gross margin was lower than last quarter, primarily as a result of higher logistics costs and increased fixed costs relative to revenue, as we invest in our infrastructure and manufacturing capacity to serve our long-term needs. While net inventory grew approximately $66 million quarter-over-quarter, there are still a number of components and products that are below our targeted levels. Pro forma operating expenses increased 26% compared with the first quarter 2021. The increase in first quarter operating expenses from a year ago reflected an, increase in head count increased variable compensation and higher customer-facing costs customer training, travel costs and marketing programs. As of the end of Q1, we had just over 10,500 employees, an increase of 26% from the first quarter of 2021 or an increase of 20% on a three-year CAGR basis. Of the approximately 2,100 employees we have added over the last year approximately 900 are manufacturing employees. Capital expenditures in Q1 were $95 million, primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities' footprint, increase manufacturing capacity and automation of certain production lines. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 23.3%, slightly above our expectations primarily due to certain discrete tax items. Our pro forma tax rate was above the 22.2% for 2021, primarily due to a previous change in U.S. tax law that became effective on January 1st 2022. Our first quarter 2022 pro forma net income was $413 million or $1.13 per share, compared with $427 million or $1.17 per share for the first quarter of 2021. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $366 million or $1 per share for the first quarter of 2022, compared with GAAP net income of $426 million or $1.17 per share for the first quarter of 2021. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $8.4 billion, compared with $8.6 billion as of December 31st 2021. The sequential reduction in cash and investments in the first quarter primarily reflected share repurchases, capital expenditures and unrealized losses on interest-bearing investments classified as available for sale, partially offset by cash from operating activities and proceeds from employee stock plans. During the quarter we repurchased 398,000 shares, at an average price of $268 per share for a total expenditure of $107 million. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian, who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2022. Yes. If I just look back at last year 2021 there's about 500-ish trade-ins done globally. Of that about 80% were transactions in the US, so you can just kind of get a sense of the degree to which the US has driven the trade-in cycle. As I said in my prepared remarks as of the end of Q1 there's about 268 SIs left in the US in the installed base. And so you can kind of use those two data points to some estimate of how that will play out overtime.  As you start to get towards kind of the end of the tail of remaining SIs, that they probably last for a little longer than kind of the average when you're in the middle of the distribution. But that's what I'd say with respect to trade-ins. I think Amit you had a question on greenfields. The way I would think about it in the US is, you kind of have your procedure estimates that you can take from our range. You can apply the usual model with respect to utilization. That gives you some sense of how the installed base might expand. And so, you can kind of do that calculation. That obviously is a mix of greenfields and incrementals. And I would just reflect in that model then what is the potential risk from what we highlighted with respect to the softening US capital pipeline that we saw in Q1. If I just go back to pre-COVID for a second Rick, if you look at 2019 average system utilization grew by 5% over 2018. If I look at recent times and use the CAGR approach to kind of normalize for COVID last year on a two-year CAGR basis in 2021 utilization grew by 4% this past quarter on a three-year CAGR basis. Again back to 2019 grew by 4%. So you can see some relative consistency there. With respect to looking forward, I think that there is some dependency on the institution the procedure mix within the institution. General surgery in combination with Xi gives you the opportunity to drive utilization differently than a different procedure mix particularly given the lower procedure times in some of the benign low-acuity procedures. But it also reflects the number of surgeons that are trained and the commitment of the possible to drive asset utilization. If you look at the distribution of utilization today it's relatively wide. I think there are a number of CFOs and hospitals that on a medium-term basis see opportunities to continue to drive utilization up and we are supportive of that. Yes. With respect to what we saw with -- in procedures in Q1 as you saw the COVID cases rises in places like Shanghai. And as the authorities locked down and they locked down pretty strictly, we saw procedures impacted in March. That's continued so far into April although it's obviously early. I think that there's risk in procedures in Q2 relative to what you would expect without COVID and those lockdowns. China is our second-biggest marketplace, but it's still a relatively small proportion of overall procedures. US is still about 70% of global procedures. But certainly the way things look right now you have some impact in Q2. What that ends up being really depends on how long the lockdowns last and how long COVID persists in China. I think a separate risk is kind of the impact of logistics and supply chains as we deliver product to China and from a more macro perspective just the port closures and the broader impact that we could see in China given the degree of exports they have just generally across the economy. With respect to the China quota difficult to predict. The last couple of times the quota has been issued in the third year of the quota period, which would be next year. We don't have great visibility into when that might be. And we don't have honestly great visibility into what the number would be. I don't think we are expecting or planning on a situation where we are exempt from a quota. But again we don't have great insights to how that will play out. Yes. I would just maybe ground the impact of inflation a couple of ways. If you look back at history, our gross margin has been in, let's say, the 71%-ish range versus what we just guided 69% to 70.5%. And there's really two drivers in the gap between our history and that range. One are the investments we're making in fixed costs in infrastructure and manufacturing capacity, that's being invested effectively for long-term need. So some of that is ahead of when we will need it. But the lead times require that we put that in place ahead of time. The second impact is this impact from the supply chain and inflation in the form of logistics costs, higher component prices, et cetera. I can't give you perfect kind of delineation between the two. I would say roughly slightly more of that the impact of that gap is on the fixed cost side. The remainder is in inflation supply chain impacts. With respect to how we're managing through the supply chain, there are significant efforts by our operations team just to respond to the whack-a-mole that you described. It's a constant battle of issue resolution. And our number one goal as Gary described is to ensure continuity of supply to customers. So that's where our efforts and focus is. As the supply chain environment rebalances in whatever point that is in the future, certainly, we will kind of refocus our operations teams to focus on cost reductions, getting our manufacturing efficiencies back to our targets. But that's going to really be a question of when will that be. On the inventory side, you saw us actually increase inventories. I referenced in my prepared remarks almost $70 million sequentially. The mix of that though is clearly not perfect. We're replenishing inventory where we can if and as supply lasts. But we have an imbalance currently. Certainly, if you look at the medium to long-term, we're going to look carefully at what levels of inventory we want to hold, as one risk mitigation. I think the other thing we'll look at is, how do we make ourselves less dependent on sole suppliers. The only thing I would say is the remaining greenfields tend to be -- this is not always the case, but tend to be more in the rural setting, smaller number of beds. So what I think we've seen over the last three, four quarters as Gary described is actually increases in the number of placements of greenfield accounts. These are hospitals as Gary said that are within existing IDNs. And that's largely a function of the success and experience those IDNs have had with benign procedures particularly in general surgery, which tend to be a higher mix in these rural hospitals. And so they see the opportunity for effective robotics programs in that setting, whereas, before maybe there was more skepticism or the financial picture was more challenging. We'll do that carefully and in conjunction with our IDN partners and it has to be one that makes economic sense for us and for the customer. On the ASC side, we have a relatively small but growing installed base. Our procedure growth at ASCs in the US is accretive, but that's probably because the number of systems that we have at hospitals or ASCs is relatively low. Those ASCs generally are ASCs affiliated in some way with our IDNs. That gives us greater confidence in those accounts."

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to your host, Head of Investor Relations, Brian King. Please go ahead.\nBrian King: Good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive\u2019s fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today we have Gary Guthart, our CEO, and Jamie Samath, our CFO. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 10, 2023, and Form 10-Q filed on October 20, 2023. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the events section under our investor relations page. Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our full year and fourth quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present business and operational highlights. Jamie will provide a review of our financial results. Then I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our financial outlook for 2024. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. And with that, I will turn it over to Gary.\nGary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. I'll touch on our performance last quarter and for the full year 2023 and share our perspective on 2024. The past year was a good one for Intuitive with use of our platforms growing nicely, hospitals building additional system capacity to support that growth and increased average utilization per system per year for each of our platforms. Our teams have been delivering to meet customer demand, driving quality and availability improvements, running clinical trials and readying new products and services for the market. We'll touch on a few of those efforts on this call. Starting first with procedures, growth for the full year was 22%. Areas of strength included general surgery in the United States and regional performance in countries including Germany, France, the UK, and Ireland to name a few. In the US, general surgery procedure growth was led by cholecystectomy with foregut procedures rising as well. Colon and hernia procedure growth was also healthy for the year. Bariatric procedures grew year-over-year. However, we saw continued deceleration of growth throughout 2023, likely the result of the uptake of GLP-1 drugs for obesity. Procedure growth outside the United States diversified beyond urology with nice growth in categories including gynecology and general surgery. In flexible robotics, ion procedures showed continued strength with 129% growth for the full year. SP procedure growth was accretive in the year with 48% growth over full year driven by acceleration in the United States. On the capital front, we placed 1,313 multi-port systems in the full year of \u201823, compared with 1,241 multi-port systems in 2022. Ion placements for the year were 213 versus 192 prior year, and SP placements were 57 for the full year versus 23 systems in the prior year. Globally, placements were strong in the United States and Japan in the year. The use of flexible financing arrangements was substantial in the quarter, particularly in the United States, as customers seek to build capacity, balance their DaVinci system portfolios to improve access, and lastly, to allow flexibility to upgrade to future systems. Jamie will take you through placement dynamics in more detail later in the call. System utilization, defined as procedures per installed clinical system per quarter, grew 9% globally year-over-year for our multi-port platform, reaching a new high as customers adopt a broad mix of procedures on our systems. Utilization grew 15% for SP in the year, while it grew 6% for Ion over 2022. Utilization is an important indicator of customer health because it is correlated to patient demand, care team satisfaction, and hospital financial health. The above performance reported revenue of $7.1 billion for the year, 14% growth over \u201822. Our capital and operating expenses were on the upper end of our spend guidance, reflecting continued investments in R&D to support growth of our platforms and digital tools, expansion of our manufacturing and commercial footprints, and capital amortization. Product margins were challenged in the full year as a result of higher than expected costs, primarily for our newer platforms. Jamie will take you through our financial performance in greater detail later in the call. Strength in procedures, growth in the clinical install base, and increased utilization signaled continued belief by our customers that our platforms make a difference in their efforts to pursue the quadruple lane, better outcomes, better patient experiences, better care team experiences, and lower total cost to treat per patient episode. As we look to 2024, I'd like to share with you that we have submitted to FDA our 510(k) application for our next generation multiport platform, da Vinci 5. Our design priorities for our new platforms are as follows. First, we look for opportunities to bring better minimally invasive care to more patients. Second, we work to improve the performance of our platforms and existing procedures. Third, we seek to improve care team satisfaction through product utility, dependability, and usability improvements. And finally, we strive to help lower the total cost to treat per patient episode. Once cleared, we believe da Vinci 5 will make a positive impact on each of these objectives through hundreds of design changes that respond to surgeon and care team inputs and fulfill our design priorities. As just one example, da Vinci 5 possesses four orders of magnitude greater processing power than our Generation 4 products. That means 10,000 times the processing power to gather data, improve sensing, and deliver better digital and analytic performance. Given the sophistication of the technologies involved, we plan a phased launch in the first several quarters after clearance, giving us time to mature our supply and manufacturing processes for the new system. da Vinci 5 will join our existing robotic surgical system portfolio alongside multiport systems X and Xi and single port system SP, offering surgeons and hospitals their choice of highly capable proven solutions from Intuitive. We have been in communication with FDA on da Vinci 5 for the past several quarters and have completed a comprehensive multi-center IDE trial. This trial finished accruing patients in May of 2023 and we submitted for our 510(k) to FDA for da Vinci 5 in August last year. We are currently responding to FDA's questions. The timing of the US Launch will depend on the time required to resolve these questions. So far, we believe the questions asked fall within normal expectations for a submission of this type. In addition to FDA, we have initiated conversations on da Vinci 5 with regulators in Japan and in Korea and will report our progress toward commercialization in countries outside the United States as we know more. Once FDA cleared, we will communicate features and benefits in greater depth. We started 2023 focused on increased adoption of our priority procedures in countries through outstanding training, commercial and market access execution. We pursued expanded indications and launches for Ion and SP. We focused on excellence in continuity of supply, product quality, and services provision as we emerge from pandemic stresses. And finally, we pursued increased productivity in our functions that benefit from scale. Taken together, our team made good progress against these objectives. As we enter 2024, our company priorities are as follows. First, we'll focus on innovation through expanded indication and launches of our new platforms by region, including our first phase of da Vinci 5 launch once cleared. Second, we'll pursue increased adoption for focus procedures by country through training commercial activities and market access efforts. Third, we will drive quality and gross margin improvements. And finally, we continue to focus on increasing our productivity, particularly in functions that benefit from industrial scale. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie.\nJamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. And we'll also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Q4 and 2023 revenue, procedures, and system placements are in line with our preliminary press release of January 9th. I will briefly review full year 2023 performance before describing our Q4 results in greater detail. 2023 procedures grew by 22% as compared to last year, or 17% on a four-year compound annual growth rate basis. As we've discussed on previous calls, 2023 procedure growth was above our longer-term trend primarily because of the need to address patient backlogs. During the year, we placed 1,370 systems with customers, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Excluding trading transactions, net new system placements for 2023 grew by 23% over the prior year, with the US up 26%, driven primarily by customer need for additional capacity. Trading volumes declined by 105 systems to a total of 240 trading transactions for the year. Recurring revenue, which is correlated to ongoing use of our products, represented 83% of total revenue and grew 21% over the prior year. Total revenue of $7.1 billion increased 14% and for the first time our advanced instrument portfolio of stapler and energy devices exceeded $1 billion in revenue, growing 21% in 2023. During the year, we repurchased $416 million of our stock or approximately 1.7 million shares at an average price of $241 per share. We have a remaining authorization to repurchase our shares of $1.1 billion. Given these results, pro forma earnings per share for 2023 grew 22% as compared to last year. Turning to Q4, our core metrics were strong. da Vinci procedures grew 21%. The installed base of systems grew 14% to 8,606 systems, and average system utilization continued to be above long-term trends, increasing by 9% for the full year of 2023. Higher system utilization reflects both a higher mix of shorter duration benign procedures and the need to address patient backlogs. In Q4, US procedures grew 17% driven by growth in general surgery. OUS procedures grew 29%, driven by strong performance in China, the UK, Germany and Japan with notable strength across multiple OUS markets in general surgery which grew 44% in Q4. As a reminder, procedures in China in the fourth quarter of last year were adversely impacted by increasing COVID cases, resulting in negative growth in Q4 of 2022. Turning to capital, we placed 415 systems in the fourth quarter, 12% higher than the 369 systems we placed in the fourth quarter of last year. In the US, we placed 209 systems in Q4, 28 more than last year, driven by capacity expansion for procedure growth and higher greenfield placements at existing IDN customers. We placed 70 systems in Japan with strengths driven by greenfield placements and customer use of remaining capital budgets. Consistent with last quarter, we have seen delayed tenders and lower system placements in China due to ongoing anti-corruption efforts by the government. We expect system placements in China to be at lower levels at least through the first half of 2024. Globally, there were 51 trading transactions in the quarter as compared to 110 last year. As of the end of Q4, there were approximately 375 SIs remaining in the installed base, 60 of which are in the US. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.93 billion, an increase of 17% from last year. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth was also 17%. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. Leasing represented 48% of Q4 placements, compared with 42% last year. The increasing lease mix we have seen over time is primarily driven by customers in the US, particularly those who have acquired systems under usage-based arrangements. These arrangements provide customers greater financial flexibility to expand their robotics programs independent of capital budgets. These arrangements also incorporate technology obsolescence protection for next generation technology. Q4 system average selling prices were $1.42 million as compared to $1.43 million last year. System ASPs were negatively impacted by regional mix, partially offset by lower trade-ins. We recognized $21 million of lease buyout revenue in the fourth quarter compared with $17 million last quarter and last year. da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,800 compared with approximately $1,820 last year. The year-over-year decline in I&A per procedure is primarily a result of procedure mix in the US, given strong growth in cholecystectomy and lower growth in bariatrics and customer ordering patterns, partially offset by the I&A price increase implemented mid-2023. Turning to Ion, there were approximately 16,500 ion procedures in the fourth quarter, an increase of 108% as compared to last year. In Q4, we placed 44 Ion systems compared to 67 in Q4 of 2022 and 55 last quarter. We experienced supply challenges for our Ion catheter and vision probe and limited Ion system placements during the quarter to ensure customers could effectively launch their programs. There is strong customer demand for Ion, which contributed to backlog growth in the quarter. We are working hard and making progress to resolve these supply challenges. The installed base of Ion systems is now 534 systems, of which 214 are under operating lease arrangements. Our SP platform continued to make progress in 2023. Fourth quarter SP procedure growth accelerated to 58%. We placed 19 systems in Q4 and 57 for the year, up from 23 placements in 2022. Fourth quarter placements included five in Korea and two in Japan. Average system utilization for our SP platform grew 15% in 2023, reflecting increased usage by US customers. We continue to make progress in expanding the opportunity for SP, including continued work on regulatory submissions in the US for colorectal and thoracic indications and a system submission in China. In January, we received clearance for SP in Europe across a broad procedure set and are planning for a measured rollout as we build local KOLs and establish local proctoring and training capabilities. Moving on to the rest of the P&L, pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 68% compared with 68.2% for the fourth quarter of 2022. The year-over-year decline in pro-forma gross margin reflects increased inventory reserves and a higher mix of new platform revenue that currently carry dilutive gross margins, partially offset by the I&A price increase implemented mid last year. With respect to our manufacturing capabilities and capital investment plans, during the quarter we initiated local excise system production in China, allowing us to participate in tenders that require a domestically produced system. We also completed the transfer of X system production to our East Coast hub near Atlanta, Georgia. And during 2024, we are planning to transfer Xi system production from California to our East Coast hub. Over the next 18 months, we expect to open new manufacturing facilities for da Vinci 5 and Ion system manufacturing in California and to complete line transfers for Ion and SP I&A to our Mexicali facility. We believe these activities will position Intuitive to serve our customers with best-in-class supply availability, product quality and product cost. Fourth quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 15% compared with last year, driven by increased headcount and higher variable compensation. In addition, fourth quarter 2023 operating expenses included a $40 million contribution to the Intuitive Foundation. We did not make a contribution in 2022. Pro forma other income was $67.1 million for Q4, higher than $57.9 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher interest income. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 15.9%, lower than prior quarters, primarily because of the release of certain tax reserves associated with the expiration of related statutes and a favorable earnings mix. Fourth quarter 2023 pro forma net income was $574 million or $1.60 per share compared with $439 million or $1.23 per share for the fourth quarter of last year. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $606 million or $1.69 per share for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with gap net income of $325 million or $0.91 per share for the fourth quarter of 2022. Fourth quarter GAAP tax expense reflected one-time benefits of $159 million associated with an increase in deferred tax assets associated with a statutory rate increase in Switzerland and receipt of certain tax benefits associated with our Swiss operations. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website. We ended the year with cash investments of $7.3 billion compared with $7.5 billion at the end of Q3. The sequential reduction in cash and investments reflected capital expenditures of $435 million, partially offset by cash generated from operating activities. Let me take a moment to address the new multiple system that Gary highlighted and certain assumptions that may impact 2024 modeling. First, since we have not received FDA clearance for da Vinci 5, we cannot provide specificity on launch timing and pricing. Second, once cleared, we are planning a phased launch period over several quarters. Noting that we are at the end of the Si trading cycle and that da Vinci 5 will be in a phased rollout, we expect total trading volumes to be lower in 2024 than the prior year. Given that, and our procedure guidance of 13% to 16% growth, we also expect total system placements for 2024 to be lower than 2023. As a result of the phased rollout of da Vinci 5, we expect a higher proportion of Gen 4 systems will be leased as customers seek flexibility to upgrade to da Vinci 5 when supply allows. For those customers that prefer to purchase a Gen 4 system, we will offer a future trading right that can be exercised when there is sufficient da Vinci 5 supply. Purchase contracts containing a trading right result in a deferral of a portion of the purchase price negatively impacting systems revenue. Finally, consistent with our experience bringing four generations of platforms to market, new systems typically start at lower gross margins and rise over a multiyear period as we build volume and optimize design, manufacturing and supply chains. Brian will describe our gross margin guidance in more detail later in the call. Before I turn it over to Brian to discuss clinical highlights and our outlook for 2024, let me address operating margins. 2023 pro forma operating margin was 34% of revenue compared to 35% in the prior year. We expect operating margins to be under pressure in 2024, given the anticipated launch of da Vinci 5, increased depreciation expense and an adverse mix impact to gross margin from the growth in new platforms. However, as we look to the medium term, we see opportunity for operating margin expansion based on the following dynamics. One, moving to broad launching da Vinci 5, allowing customers the opportunity to upgrade their existing fleet to the latest technology. Two, improving gross margin. We aspire to be above the 70% level over time. And three, leveraging those functions that can take advantage of scale as we grow. Improvements to gross margin will be driven by the following actions: First, improving the product cost of new platforms, including da Vinci 5. Second, growing into and eventually leveraging the incremental fixed costs from new manufacturing facilities. And third, the return of resources that have been deployed to supply continuity given the impact of the pandemic to returning to routine manufacturing and product cost reduction activities. We have the teams and capability to deliver on these efforts over the next several years. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian.\nBrian King: Thank you, Jamie. Overall procedure growth for full year 2023 was 22% year-over-year compared to 18% for the full year of 2022. Overall procedure growth was comprised of 19% growth in the US and 27% growth outside of the US. In the US, fourth quarter 2023 procedure growth was 17% year-over-year compared to 18% for the fourth quarter of 2022 and 17% last quarter. Fourth quarter growth was led by procedures within general surgery, with strength in cholecystectomy, colon resection and foregut procedures. As Gary noted, bariatric procedures continued to grow year-over-year, but growth moderated into the mid-single digits. Looking outside of the US, over the years, we have made investments in countries and international markets to support customers and their adoption of da Vinci procedures. Looking back over the past decade, OUS procedures have grown 20% on a compound annual growth basis and have consistently been accretive to total procedure growth. OUS procedures have grown from about 20% of total global procedures to now about a third. While market maturity and levels of adoption differ by region and country, broadly, we now see more than half of OUS growth being led by procedures beyond urology, reflecting customers' growing adoption of general surgery, gynecology and thoracic procedures, the results of which I will highlight below. Focusing on the fourth quarter, OUS procedure volume grew 29% compared with 18% for the fourth quarter of 2022 and 24% last quarter. Growth was led by strength in colon resection followed by growth in hysterectomy and lung resection procedures. Growth in urology continued to be healthy, led by kidney procedures along with continued double-digit growth in prostatectomy. In Europe, fourth quarter growth was led by general surgery and gynecology procedure categories. Germany, the UK and France procedure performance led the region. In Germany, we saw strong growth in colon resection and kidney procedures, in the UK from growth in hysterectomy and rectal resection and in France from growth in colorectal and lung resection procedures. In Asia, growth in the fourth quarter was led by China, reflecting a benefit from lower procedure volumes in the fourth quarter of 2022 due to COVID. In Japan, our third largest market by procedure volume, procedure growth was healthy and led by prostatectomy and colorectal procedures. We placed 70 systems in Japan, reflecting the continued adoption of robotic surgery for a growing number of procedures and the availability of remaining capital budgets. India, while still in the early stage of adoption, saw continued strength in general surgery and gynecology procedures. Now, turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. In the fourth quarter, Dr. Nicola de'Angelis from Beaujon University Hospital, along with multiple colleagues from the French Society of Parietal Surgery, Club Hernie, and French Society of Digestive and Visceral Surgery, published a systematic review and meta-analysis describing robotic surgery for inguinal and ventral hernias in surgical endoscopy. In this analysis, authors reviewed publications between September 2014 and July 2022 and published pooled outcomes comparing the robotic-assisted approach for both inguinal and ventral hernia repairs to both laparoscopy and the open approach. With regards to inguinal hernia, when compared to laparoscopy, the robotic-assisted approach was associated with a 46% lower risk of hernia recurrence. Furthermore, subjects undergoing a robotic-assisted approach were associated with a 54% lower rate of opioid use relative to the open approach. For ventral hernia repairs, the robotic-assisted approach had a 49% lower risk of conversion to open and 41% lower risk of intraoperative bowel injuries relative to laparoscopy. When comparing to an open repair for ventral hernias, the robotic-assisted approach was associated with a 3.4-day shorter length of stay, 34% lower risk of 30-day readmissions, 39% lower risk of overall complications, and more specifically, a 53% lower risk of surgical site infections. The authors concluded, \u201cthe present systematic review and meta-analysis supports the use of robotic surgery for abdominal wall hernia repair. Pooled data analysis show improved outcomes over laparoscopy and open surgery, particularly for ventral hernia repair. Overall, these results based on 64 studies support robotic surgery as a safe, effective and viable alternative to traditional open and laparoscopic surgery for inguinal and ventral hernia repair. And may contribute to dismiss the residual skepticism and increase the interest towards this minimally invasive surgical technique\". I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2024. Starting with procedures. As described in our announcement earlier this month, total 2023 da Vinci procedures grew approximately 22% year-over-year to over 2,280,000 procedures performed worldwide. For 2024, we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 13% and 16%. Our overall procedure guidance range assumes that growth moderates from last year, given the elevated backlog benefit we experienced in 2023. The low end of the range assumes a modest decline in bariatric procedures along with challenges in China from increasing competition and anticorruption activities impacting capital placements, and therefore, procedure growth. We also assume there is no impact from patient backlog in the year. At the high end of the range, we assume bariatrics continues at current growth rates, and factors in China do not have a significant impact on our business. In addition, we assume any backlog of patients would decline throughout the year. Finally, we would expect that procedure seasonality will follow normalized historical patterns, resulting in a tough comparison for the first half of 2024, given the strong procedure growth in the first half of last year. Turning to gross profit. Our full year 2023 pro forma gross profit margin was 68%. In 2024, we expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within 67% and 68% of net revenue. The lower estimate of pro forma gross profit margin in 2024 reflects the impact of growth in our newer products, and the impact of capital investments that will come on to support the growth of our business. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trading mix, impact of new product introductions and pricing. Turning to operating expenses. In 2023, our pro forma operating expenses grew 14%. In 2024, we expect pro forma operating expense growth to be between 11% and 15%. The operating expense growth reflects increased depreciation expense as we bring on new facilities and investments to drive our growth objectives. We expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $680 million to $710 million in 2024. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $290 million and $320 million in 2024. With regard to capital expenditures, we expect the range to total between $1 billion to $1.2 billion, primarily for planned facility construction activities. With regard to income tax, in 2023, our pro forma income tax rate was 20.6%. As we look forward, we estimate our 2024 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pretax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Sir, your line is open now.\nLarry Biegelsen: Can you hear me?\nGary Guthart: Yeah, Larry.\nLarry Biegelsen: You can hear me. Great. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on a nice end to the year here. Thanks for all the color on da Vinci 5. So obviously, a few questions on that. I'd love to start with just, Jamie, maybe a framework for how to think about the financial implications of a new system beyond 2024. Is the Xi launch a good analog from a pacing standpoint? And what are the ramifications of leasing? If a customer on the lease upgrade, will the lease get the ASP lift? We assume you'll have. And what will you do with returned Xi? And I had just one follow-up.\nJamie Samath: Yeah. I would say the dynamics are quite different between when we launched Xi in 2014 versus where we are today. And I think the feature sets of da Vinci 5, which we haven't described I think an important context for you all, which we'll do once we have clearance. You look at relative penetration of da Vinci over that period, the extent to which leasing has changed significantly our OUS penetration. I think there are a number of factors, Larry, where I would not use the kind of Xi ramp and progression as a reference point for how da Vinci 5 might progress. But I think that I would make any further comments on that once we get through clearance and are able to talk to you about the feature set.\nLarry Biegelsen: Any color\u2026\nJamie Samath: With respect to the lease. So I think there are a number of dynamics that in the end will motivate a customer to look at a trade even if they have an existing system under lease. If I hold everything else equal and just look at the fact that the asset is leased, I do think there is some benefit to the customer insofar as they can avoid a capital budget barrier to executing an upgrade. But I think you have to look at all of the other dynamics that we're yet to describe.\nLarry Biegelsen: Okay. And then I guess on the new system, I'll try my luck here. Just lastly, do you expect the same indications on as Xi upon launch? And, Gary, is this more about improving outcomes in existing procedures or expanding addressable procedures? Thank you.\nGary Guthart: Yeah, we submitted for broad indications and in the IDE trial it was a broad indication trial. What that looks like in the end, we'll come down to how we answer some of the questions that come back and forth. So I'm not telling you what the end point is, but I can tell you what our starting point is. In terms of kind of breadth and depth, we think that it will allow for additional penetration into some of the categories we're in already. And maybe an analogy is you could do some general surgery with Si, the earlier system, we had clearances there, but Xi had some product improvements and some really nice forward progress that allowed us for greater penetration depth. So there's opportunity for depth. We think over time there's opportunity for additional indications. Those are unlikely to occur right out of the gate. And we think that there's some really nice indications to talk about or features to talk about in future calls.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay, we'll go to the next line. We go to Travis Steed, Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nTravis Steed: Hey, everybody. Can you hear me okay?\nGary Guthart: Yeah. Hi, Travis.\nTravis Steed: All right, great. Maybe just high level, just like -- you were talking about da Vinci 5 having hundreds of design changes. When you just think about da Vinci 5 and kind of driving the quad aim, maybe just kind of talk about high level, more what you're trying to solve for with some of those design changes. What's different about da Vinci 5 versus da Vinci 4? And is it possible we could see a system in 2024? Is it more likely in 2025?\nGary Guthart: I laid out in the script kind of what our design methodology was. I am dying to tell you more about da Vinci 5, but I'll wait for clearance and for the final back and forth with FDA so we can do that with a little more care. So that's kind of where we are on that set. We're excited about it. I think it is substantive and I think some of the improvements that we can bring are going to be interesting and exciting. We are submitted and we're in the back and forth with FDA. It is our hope that it is a \u201824 launch. They ultimately are the arbiters of when we get clearance. But what I'd say based on past experience with them is that we're in a constructive conversation that we understand. And if that goes the way we want, then certainly it's something we'd be excited about in \u201824. But I can't guarantee it because I don't have the clearance yet.\nTravis Steed: That's helpful. Would you expect some sort of ASP uplift versus da Vinci 4 and maybe also talk about the manufacturing capacity? How long will it take to get to scale on the manufacturing and how would that look kind of versus the Xi launch? Can you do hundreds a year or thousands a year? I'm just kind of curious where, if that's a limiting factor in kind of the availability of these systems going forward. Thanks a lot.\nGary Guthart: Yeah, I'll start with just a little bit of color on ASP and then I'll turn it over to Jamie. We won't call any ASP right now. We want to both get through the final clearances. What I will say is there are some differences relative to X, Xi that make that discussion a little detailed. And it's important for it to be detailed and clear for the customer to understand what they're going to be buying. So we're going to pause that for now. With regard to manufacturing ramp, clearly we're going to be in a phased launch. I think we'll be supply constrained in the early side of that, kind of intentionally as we work through manufacturing process, but in terms of pacing and what that might feel like, Jamie, let me turn it over to you.\nJamie Samath: To some extent, it will obviously depend how that progresses both within our four walls and with our suppliers. Certainly, it\u2019s several quarters. I would take several quarters to be something that's beyond a year, but I think you have to watch us make progress here, and we'll keep you updated.\nTravis Steed: All right, great. Thanks a lot and congrats.\nGary Guthart: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll go next to the line of Robbie Marcus, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on a really good quarter. I'm going to push my luck again. Gary, one of the things we talked about two weeks ago on stage was big data and the potential to integrate it into your systems. Maybe if we think about just philosophically da Vinci 5, is this something we'll see a lot more software improvements rather than hardware improvements? I realize you're not giving specific details, but is software and the ability to add future software updates something we can be looking forward to?\nGary Guthart: Yeah, one of the things we talked about in the script is the increase in computational capability of the system, the re-baselining of that system. And one of the reasons for that is future programmability. Some of the things that we'll be able to bring out of the gate are pretty exciting, but it also gives us the opportunity to build on that base and sequential software releases. So it's a good pull-through, Robbie. The point you make is a good one, and we do want to pull through software capability. It will not just be software that we bring to market, but it's a starting point. Just to remind everybody back in the Xi launch period, Xi didn't have everything that we could possibly do with it at first year of launch either. It's something that as we build capability and build skill we can add to over time, and we've done that for years, we will do the same in dV 5, it is a platform upon which we can build for many years to come.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. And maybe one for Jamie. OpEx stepping up with the new product launch, you talked about in the midterm, seeing operating margin expansion, we're also seeing elevated CapEx this year as you talked about all the manufacturing plants. Maybe addressing them both, how should we think about where all of these expenses are going, particularly in OpEx this year, R&D versus SG&A? And what types of activities in each? And then is three years a good time frame to think about for the midterm when we might see these spending trends moderate? Thanks a lot.\nJamie Samath: Yeah. Let me take CapEx first. In '23 and '24, the majority of those capital investments are for manufacturing facilities and to add manufacturing capacity in particular to our Mexicali factory. So a significant portion of the depreciation that comes with that will show up in cost of sales, and that's reflected in part in the '24 gross margin guidance. Some of it will show up in OpEx, and that will therefore be reflected in SG&A. If I look at the relative growth in R&D and SG&A in '24, I think it's relatively similar. Obviously, innovation in R&D is important to us. But you will have a little bit of an impact in '24 at least for incremental depreciation. We still see opportunity to leverage some of our enabling functions. There are some other functions that also can leverage as we scale and grow, and so we'll look to do that over the next couple of years. With respect to the kind of operating margin expansion opportunity that I described in my prepared remarks. And we said over the medium term, I'd kind of broadly say that's a three- to five-year horizon. We have a specific set of actions and plans that we need to execute. Those teams have those as goals. There's some variability, obviously, in terms of how they get executed and there's some interrelationship between set of actions that need to be completed. So there are dynamics there that can impact the speed at which that gets executed. And of course, we have to run our business in the meantime.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for the thoughts.\nOperator: And we'll go over to the line of Rick Wise, Stifel. Please go ahead.\nRick Wise: Good evening everybody, and great to see the Gen 5 announcement. Maybe I'm going to go into a slightly different direction. Maybe we can get some updates and more details, more color on Ion and SP. SP, Gary, the strongest quarter ever. I'm just curious your thoughts about '24 and the next couple of years. What's next? How are you -- what are the team priorities for '24? And on the Ion side, maybe more for Jamie, you gave us some good color about demand strong and supply constraints continue. How are you thinking and what are you dialing into your thinking for '24 about resolution of the catheter and the vision probe limitations? When are you hoping that, that gets largely better result?\nGary Guthart: Thanks, Rick. On the SP front, we're pleased with the step forward they took in '23. It was good. We're seeing more focused efforts in our commercial team in the US, which has been good. We're excited about its entry into Japan, and we're starting to see a build of activity in Japan, too. So that's been good. We expect to see it in Europe in '24, and that's another nice step. And I think that's a broader set of clinical indications as it was in Korea and Japan. So it gives us a little more freedom to operate, which is great. In the US, we have trials that had finished accrual and have been submitted or will be submitted soon in thoracic and colorectal that will give our US customers more opportunity to use SP in a multiplatform -- multispecialty environment. So I think SP continues to be a nice build. So that looks good. And team has their marching orders and is working down that set of processes. We have a breast oncology trial that's ongoing that we're excited about also that will not make a big impact in '24, but starts to open additional opportunity for narrow access surgery thereafter. So that's kind of where we are in SP, so far, so good. I'll turn it over to Jamie and talk about Ion.\nJamie Samath: Not ready to be particularly specific yet on when the supply chain challenges are behind us. For catheter, you have three dynamics. So we had a specific supply constraint that impacted us. We are, at the same time, transferring a number of catheter lines to Mexicali. And we're doing that as the business is effectively doubling, so you're bringing on new staff, you're having to train them. So that's a real effort that takes some time. And I think there's a little bit of variability in terms of when we get to point where that's behind us. So I'm going to let us have another quarter before we talk about when that's resolved. The teams are making clear progress, but there's work still will be done. On the vision probe, I think it's a relatively simpler problem for us to address. There isn't a supplier dependency within that particular area. It's really just us being able to execute, again, a line transfer as the business is doubling and the team are making great progress. But stay tuned.\nRick Wise: Got you. And just one follow-up on Gen 5 and what's next. You said, Jamie, and it makes sense that probably in the next couple of quarters or until you launch, customers probably will lean more toward the leases with an upgrade clause. If I understood you. But I was just reflecting on it, should we imagine that, that could accelerate this sort of leasing approach in the near term for Xi, and as people, I guess, preferentially, potentially possibly maybe line up to get Gen 5 and that puts them in a more favorable position. How does that all -- how are all those dynamics work? Is this good? Better for sales that this transition occurs? Or is it going to be more complicated?\nJamie Samath: Well, I think the first effect is we'll see the operating lease proportion of placements increased from where it's been. And again, that's because customers are motivated to have the protection that's in those clauses so that they can upgrade da Vinci 5 when it becomes more broadly available. So that was the first kind of message we wanted to provide in terms of 2024 modeling. In terms of then how that gets upgraded, it's really a function of when does da Vinci 5 launch, which obviously we can't be specific about right now, and there's some things to work through with FDA. And then what's the period of time over which we then go from a constrained or phased launch to a full launch. And so I don't see that particularly as somehow a revenue benefit in '24. I think what we're saying is you'll have more of the placements that are leased, and therefore, that revenue is spread over time.\nGary Guthart: More likely to be a slight negative than a slight positive. And I think the things we've put in place for customer transparency, the ability to see it, work to mitigate the feeling of having to wait and they'll get a chance to put their hands on it and see it. But I don't see it as an accelerant.\nRick Wise: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll go to the line of Adam Maeder, Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nAdam Maeder: Hi, good afternoon, and thank you for taking the questions and congrats on a great year. I wanted to start on China and ask about the quota that went effective last summer as well as the anticorruption campaign. If I heard the commentary correct -- correctly, it sounds like you expect systems to be impacted -- system placements to be impacted through the first half of 2024. Does that mean there's some optimism that placements could get better in the back half of the year? And just any additional color on what you're seeing in that geography regarding anticorruption campaign would be very appreciated. Thank you.\nJamie Samath: Indications so far have been that, that anticorruption effort is a year-long effort which would take us to the middle of '24. And so that's why we indicated that we would expect delayed tenders through the period in which that effort is ongoing. We don't have great visibility, frankly, beyond the first half of '24. And that's why in the prepared remarks, we said at least through the first half of '24. So yes, if that effort was to be resolved, and if things start to normalize in terms of the pace at which tenders occurred, then you could see some opportunity for that to recover. But we're not in a position where we can predict that at this point.\nAdam Maeder: That's helpful color, Jamie. Thanks for that. And for the follow-up, I wanted to ask about the procedure growth guidance, the 13% to 16% for this year. Maybe you could flesh that out for a little bit, a little bit by geography, US versus international. How you're thinking about that as well as, I guess, Europe versus Asia specifically. And just any color on quarterly cadence would be appreciated as well. Thanks again.\nJamie Samath: Let me start with seasonality. And I'm not going to be specific on quarterly cadence, but I do think I tried to emphasize in our prepared remarks that we believe that the first half will be a tougher comp versus last year. And so using that, the comparison from last year and then also thinking about our historical sort of cadence throughout the year, I think you can look at that history and just make an assumption on what that growth rate -- what those growth rates could be by quarter. Let's talk about factors in the procedure guidance. So those -- there's really three primary factors, right? You have -- we've called out bariatric growth rates, and that's primarily a US factor. We talked a bit about from an OUS perspective, China, and then also backlog in the system. And so the backlog also being primarily a US factor. But could still be broader. But -- so I'm not going to go into specifics as far as US versus OUS. But I think I'd go back and just really center you on our comments around bariatric growth rates, right? Low end of the range assumes that there's some continued moderation in bariatric procedures and at the high end of the range that it assumes current growth rates. There's some impact in China at the low end of the range just from the discussion that we had right now an anticorruption and how long that actually persists and then the benefit of backlog and how that will persist throughout the year.\nGary Guthart: In soft tissue surgery, I would just say, if you look at '23, the two primary growth drivers that we've called out is general surgery in the US, that grew 25% in 2023. And for OUS, beyond urology that grew 35% in '23. And at the core, we think those continue to be growth drivers for the business.\nAdam Maeder: Thanks very much.\nOperator: And we'll go to the next line. Go to the line of Drew Ranieri of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDrew Ranieri: Gary, just, maybe just broadly on da Vinci 5 and just the TAM that you kind of updated at the conference earlier this month. How are you -- could you maybe just update us maybe on how you're thinking about penetration today in general surgery, where you are with chole, hernia, colorectal bariatrics, just to help us level set because it sounds like this could be another progression in general surgery for the company? And then I had a follow-up.\nGary Guthart: Sure. Jamie, I'll let you take the kind of characterization of where we are in the adoption curves of general surgery, hernia, benign, chole and so on.\nJamie Samath: If you take a look at the US, and I'm going to put this in quartiles for a second in terms of where we are in the adoption curve, colorectal we're in the second quartile. Bariatrics, also the second quartile. Actually cholecystectomy and hernia all in the second quartile in terms of where they are along the adoption curve. And so that obviously gives us some continuing runway to grow, and that's a driver behind the US general surgery growth rates that we've seen. In the international markets, by the way, just in terms of general surgery, for the most part -- in most of the larger markets, we're in the first quarter of adoption. It's early. What we're seeing is growth start to stick and those don't start to be on early growth rates. Particularly in the cancer procedures, colorectal and beyond general surgery in hysterectomy and thoracic.\nGary Guthart: With regard to dV 5, I won't call out what specific targeting has been. We'll talk about more about dV 5 when we get a chance to talk about clearance. We do think that it's something that can help improve outcomes in multiple places. And we look forward to talking to you about that when we have the opportunity. If you have one follow-up, Drew, I'll take the follow-up. Otherwise, we'll close the call. So Drew, you have one more?\nDrew Ranieri: Sure. Yeah. Just on da Vinci 5. Can you maybe just talk about how it might be able to improve access to hospitals? I know that you have many IDNs that have added more systems, but do you see that more as an opportunity? Or do you see just maybe better access for even smaller hospitals with having multiport systems in the portfolio? Thanks.\nGary Guthart: Yeah. Thank you for the question. We think that having a portfolio of choices makes a ton of sense for hospitals. And this will be a part of that portfolio. We talked about it in the prepared script. Got to give people choice. Some of that choice will have to do with how they view their practice. Some of it may have to do with what their site of care looks like and feels like. So that gives us some optionality and gives our customers optionality. I think that's really healthy. So thank you, Drew. Appreciate the question.\nGary Guthart: That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and caregivers in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim. Better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams and ultimately, a lower total cost to treat. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and in their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey and we look forward to talking with you again in three months.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone, for joining today's conference call. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gary Guthart",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today. I'll touch on our performance last quarter and for the full year 2023 and share our perspective on 2024. The past year was a good one for Intuitive with use of our platforms growing nicely, hospitals building additional system capacity to support that growth and increased average utilization per system per year for each of our platforms. Our teams have been delivering to meet customer demand, driving quality and availability improvements, running clinical trials and readying new products and services for the market. We'll touch on a few of those efforts on this call. Starting first with procedures, growth for the full year was 22%. Areas of strength included general surgery in the United States and regional performance in countries including Germany, France, the UK, and Ireland to name a few. In the US, general surgery procedure growth was led by cholecystectomy with foregut procedures rising as well. Colon and hernia procedure growth was also healthy for the year. Bariatric procedures grew year-over-year. However, we saw continued deceleration of growth throughout 2023, likely the result of the uptake of GLP-1 drugs for obesity. Procedure growth outside the United States diversified beyond urology with nice growth in categories including gynecology and general surgery. In flexible robotics, ion procedures showed continued strength with 129% growth for the full year. SP procedure growth was accretive in the year with 48% growth over full year driven by acceleration in the United States. On the capital front, we placed 1,313 multi-port systems in the full year of \u201823, compared with 1,241 multi-port systems in 2022. Ion placements for the year were 213 versus 192 prior year, and SP placements were 57 for the full year versus 23 systems in the prior year. Globally, placements were strong in the United States and Japan in the year. The use of flexible financing arrangements was substantial in the quarter, particularly in the United States, as customers seek to build capacity, balance their DaVinci system portfolios to improve access, and lastly, to allow flexibility to upgrade to future systems. Jamie will take you through placement dynamics in more detail later in the call. System utilization, defined as procedures per installed clinical system per quarter, grew 9% globally year-over-year for our multi-port platform, reaching a new high as customers adopt a broad mix of procedures on our systems. Utilization grew 15% for SP in the year, while it grew 6% for Ion over 2022. Utilization is an important indicator of customer health because it is correlated to patient demand, care team satisfaction, and hospital financial health. The above performance reported revenue of $7.1 billion for the year, 14% growth over \u201822. Our capital and operating expenses were on the upper end of our spend guidance, reflecting continued investments in R&D to support growth of our platforms and digital tools, expansion of our manufacturing and commercial footprints, and capital amortization. Product margins were challenged in the full year as a result of higher than expected costs, primarily for our newer platforms. Jamie will take you through our financial performance in greater detail later in the call. Strength in procedures, growth in the clinical install base, and increased utilization signaled continued belief by our customers that our platforms make a difference in their efforts to pursue the quadruple lane, better outcomes, better patient experiences, better care team experiences, and lower total cost to treat per patient episode. As we look to 2024, I'd like to share with you that we have submitted to FDA our 510(k) application for our next generation multiport platform, da Vinci 5. Our design priorities for our new platforms are as follows. First, we look for opportunities to bring better minimally invasive care to more patients. Second, we work to improve the performance of our platforms and existing procedures. Third, we seek to improve care team satisfaction through product utility, dependability, and usability improvements. And finally, we strive to help lower the total cost to treat per patient episode. Once cleared, we believe da Vinci 5 will make a positive impact on each of these objectives through hundreds of design changes that respond to surgeon and care team inputs and fulfill our design priorities. As just one example, da Vinci 5 possesses four orders of magnitude greater processing power than our Generation 4 products. That means 10,000 times the processing power to gather data, improve sensing, and deliver better digital and analytic performance. Given the sophistication of the technologies involved, we plan a phased launch in the first several quarters after clearance, giving us time to mature our supply and manufacturing processes for the new system. da Vinci 5 will join our existing robotic surgical system portfolio alongside multiport systems X and Xi and single port system SP, offering surgeons and hospitals their choice of highly capable proven solutions from Intuitive. We have been in communication with FDA on da Vinci 5 for the past several quarters and have completed a comprehensive multi-center IDE trial. This trial finished accruing patients in May of 2023 and we submitted for our 510(k) to FDA for da Vinci 5 in August last year. We are currently responding to FDA's questions. The timing of the US Launch will depend on the time required to resolve these questions. So far, we believe the questions asked fall within normal expectations for a submission of this type. In addition to FDA, we have initiated conversations on da Vinci 5 with regulators in Japan and in Korea and will report our progress toward commercialization in countries outside the United States as we know more. Once FDA cleared, we will communicate features and benefits in greater depth. We started 2023 focused on increased adoption of our priority procedures in countries through outstanding training, commercial and market access execution. We pursued expanded indications and launches for Ion and SP. We focused on excellence in continuity of supply, product quality, and services provision as we emerge from pandemic stresses. And finally, we pursued increased productivity in our functions that benefit from scale. Taken together, our team made good progress against these objectives. As we enter 2024, our company priorities are as follows. First, we'll focus on innovation through expanded indication and launches of our new platforms by region, including our first phase of da Vinci 5 launch once cleared. Second, we'll pursue increased adoption for focus procedures by country through training commercial activities and market access efforts. Third, we will drive quality and gross margin improvements. And finally, we continue to focus on increasing our productivity, particularly in functions that benefit from industrial scale. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie. Yeah, Larry. Yeah, we submitted for broad indications and in the IDE trial it was a broad indication trial. What that looks like in the end, we'll come down to how we answer some of the questions that come back and forth. So I'm not telling you what the end point is, but I can tell you what our starting point is. In terms of kind of breadth and depth, we think that it will allow for additional penetration into some of the categories we're in already. And maybe an analogy is you could do some general surgery with Si, the earlier system, we had clearances there, but Xi had some product improvements and some really nice forward progress that allowed us for greater penetration depth. So there's opportunity for depth. We think over time there's opportunity for additional indications. Those are unlikely to occur right out of the gate. And we think that there's some really nice indications to talk about or features to talk about in future calls. Yeah. Hi, Travis. I laid out in the script kind of what our design methodology was. I am dying to tell you more about da Vinci 5, but I'll wait for clearance and for the final back and forth with FDA so we can do that with a little more care. So that's kind of where we are on that set. We're excited about it. I think it is substantive and I think some of the improvements that we can bring are going to be interesting and exciting. We are submitted and we're in the back and forth with FDA. It is our hope that it is a \u201824 launch. They ultimately are the arbiters of when we get clearance. But what I'd say based on past experience with them is that we're in a constructive conversation that we understand. And if that goes the way we want, then certainly it's something we'd be excited about in \u201824. But I can't guarantee it because I don't have the clearance yet. Yeah, I'll start with just a little bit of color on ASP and then I'll turn it over to Jamie. We won't call any ASP right now. We want to both get through the final clearances. What I will say is there are some differences relative to X, Xi that make that discussion a little detailed. And it's important for it to be detailed and clear for the customer to understand what they're going to be buying. So we're going to pause that for now. With regard to manufacturing ramp, clearly we're going to be in a phased launch. I think we'll be supply constrained in the early side of that, kind of intentionally as we work through manufacturing process, but in terms of pacing and what that might feel like, Jamie, let me turn it over to you. Thank you. Yeah, one of the things we talked about in the script is the increase in computational capability of the system, the re-baselining of that system. And one of the reasons for that is future programmability. Some of the things that we'll be able to bring out of the gate are pretty exciting, but it also gives us the opportunity to build on that base and sequential software releases. So it's a good pull-through, Robbie. The point you make is a good one, and we do want to pull through software capability. It will not just be software that we bring to market, but it's a starting point. Just to remind everybody back in the Xi launch period, Xi didn't have everything that we could possibly do with it at first year of launch either. It's something that as we build capability and build skill we can add to over time, and we've done that for years, we will do the same in dV 5, it is a platform upon which we can build for many years to come. Thanks, Rick. On the SP front, we're pleased with the step forward they took in '23. It was good. We're seeing more focused efforts in our commercial team in the US, which has been good. We're excited about its entry into Japan, and we're starting to see a build of activity in Japan, too. So that's been good. We expect to see it in Europe in '24, and that's another nice step. And I think that's a broader set of clinical indications as it was in Korea and Japan. So it gives us a little more freedom to operate, which is great. In the US, we have trials that had finished accrual and have been submitted or will be submitted soon in thoracic and colorectal that will give our US customers more opportunity to use SP in a multiplatform -- multispecialty environment. So I think SP continues to be a nice build. So that looks good. And team has their marching orders and is working down that set of processes. We have a breast oncology trial that's ongoing that we're excited about also that will not make a big impact in '24, but starts to open additional opportunity for narrow access surgery thereafter. So that's kind of where we are in SP, so far, so good. I'll turn it over to Jamie and talk about Ion. More likely to be a slight negative than a slight positive. And I think the things we've put in place for customer transparency, the ability to see it, work to mitigate the feeling of having to wait and they'll get a chance to put their hands on it and see it. But I don't see it as an accelerant. In soft tissue surgery, I would just say, if you look at '23, the two primary growth drivers that we've called out is general surgery in the US, that grew 25% in 2023. And for OUS, beyond urology that grew 35% in '23. And at the core, we think those continue to be growth drivers for the business. Sure. Jamie, I'll let you take the kind of characterization of where we are in the adoption curves of general surgery, hernia, benign, chole and so on. With regard to dV 5, I won't call out what specific targeting has been. We'll talk about more about dV 5 when we get a chance to talk about clearance. We do think that it's something that can help improve outcomes in multiple places. And we look forward to talking to you about that when we have the opportunity. If you have one follow-up, Drew, I'll take the follow-up. Otherwise, we'll close the call. So Drew, you have one more? Yeah. Thank you for the question. We think that having a portfolio of choices makes a ton of sense for hospitals. And this will be a part of that portfolio. We talked about it in the prepared script. Got to give people choice. Some of that choice will have to do with how they view their practice. Some of it may have to do with what their site of care looks like and feels like. So that gives us some optionality and gives our customers optionality. I think that's really healthy. So thank you, Drew. Appreciate the question. That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and caregivers in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim.

Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey and we look forward to talking with you again in three months."

            "name": "Jamie Samath",
            "content": "Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. And we'll also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Q4 and 2023 revenue, procedures, and system placements are in line with our preliminary press release of January 9th. I will briefly review full year 2023 performance before describing our Q4 results in greater detail. 2023 procedures grew by 22% as compared to last year, or 17% on a four-year compound annual growth rate basis. As we've discussed on previous calls, 2023 procedure growth was above our longer-term trend primarily because of the need to address patient backlogs. During the year, we placed 1,370 systems with customers, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Excluding trading transactions, net new system placements for 2023 grew by 23% over the prior year, with the US up 26%, driven primarily by customer need for additional capacity. Trading volumes declined by 105 systems to a total of 240 trading transactions for the year. Recurring revenue, which is correlated to ongoing use of our products, represented 83% of total revenue and grew 21% over the prior year. Total revenue of $7.1 billion increased 14% and for the first time our advanced instrument portfolio of stapler and energy devices exceeded $1 billion in revenue, growing 21% in 2023. During the year, we repurchased $416 million of our stock or approximately 1.7 million shares at an average price of $241 per share. We have a remaining authorization to repurchase our shares of $1.1 billion. Given these results, pro forma earnings per share for 2023 grew 22% as compared to last year. Turning to Q4, our core metrics were strong. da Vinci procedures grew 21%. The installed base of systems grew 14% to 8,606 systems, and average system utilization continued to be above long-term trends, increasing by 9% for the full year of 2023. Higher system utilization reflects both a higher mix of shorter duration benign procedures and the need to address patient backlogs. In Q4, US procedures grew 17% driven by growth in general surgery. OUS procedures grew 29%, driven by strong performance in China, the UK, Germany and Japan with notable strength across multiple OUS markets in general surgery which grew 44% in Q4. As a reminder, procedures in China in the fourth quarter of last year were adversely impacted by increasing COVID cases, resulting in negative growth in Q4 of 2022. Turning to capital, we placed 415 systems in the fourth quarter, 12% higher than the 369 systems we placed in the fourth quarter of last year. In the US, we placed 209 systems in Q4, 28 more than last year, driven by capacity expansion for procedure growth and higher greenfield placements at existing IDN customers. We placed 70 systems in Japan with strengths driven by greenfield placements and customer use of remaining capital budgets. Consistent with last quarter, we have seen delayed tenders and lower system placements in China due to ongoing anti-corruption efforts by the government. We expect system placements in China to be at lower levels at least through the first half of 2024. Globally, there were 51 trading transactions in the quarter as compared to 110 last year. As of the end of Q4, there were approximately 375 SIs remaining in the installed base, 60 of which are in the US. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.93 billion, an increase of 17% from last year. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth was also 17%. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. Leasing represented 48% of Q4 placements, compared with 42% last year. The increasing lease mix we have seen over time is primarily driven by customers in the US, particularly those who have acquired systems under usage-based arrangements. These arrangements provide customers greater financial flexibility to expand their robotics programs independent of capital budgets. These arrangements also incorporate technology obsolescence protection for next generation technology. Q4 system average selling prices were $1.42 million as compared to $1.43 million last year. System ASPs were negatively impacted by regional mix, partially offset by lower trade-ins. We recognized $21 million of lease buyout revenue in the fourth quarter compared with $17 million last quarter and last year. da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,800 compared with approximately $1,820 last year. The year-over-year decline in I&A per procedure is primarily a result of procedure mix in the US, given strong growth in cholecystectomy and lower growth in bariatrics and customer ordering patterns, partially offset by the I&A price increase implemented mid-2023. Turning to Ion, there were approximately 16,500 ion procedures in the fourth quarter, an increase of 108% as compared to last year. In Q4, we placed 44 Ion systems compared to 67 in Q4 of 2022 and 55 last quarter. We experienced supply challenges for our Ion catheter and vision probe and limited Ion system placements during the quarter to ensure customers could effectively launch their programs. There is strong customer demand for Ion, which contributed to backlog growth in the quarter. We are working hard and making progress to resolve these supply challenges. The installed base of Ion systems is now 534 systems, of which 214 are under operating lease arrangements. Our SP platform continued to make progress in 2023. Fourth quarter SP procedure growth accelerated to 58%. We placed 19 systems in Q4 and 57 for the year, up from 23 placements in 2022. Fourth quarter placements included five in Korea and two in Japan. Average system utilization for our SP platform grew 15% in 2023, reflecting increased usage by US customers. We continue to make progress in expanding the opportunity for SP, including continued work on regulatory submissions in the US for colorectal and thoracic indications and a system submission in China. In January, we received clearance for SP in Europe across a broad procedure set and are planning for a measured rollout as we build local KOLs and establish local proctoring and training capabilities. Moving on to the rest of the P&L, pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 68% compared with 68.2% for the fourth quarter of 2022. The year-over-year decline in pro-forma gross margin reflects increased inventory reserves and a higher mix of new platform revenue that currently carry dilutive gross margins, partially offset by the I&A price increase implemented mid last year. With respect to our manufacturing capabilities and capital investment plans, during the quarter we initiated local excise system production in China, allowing us to participate in tenders that require a domestically produced system. We also completed the transfer of X system production to our East Coast hub near Atlanta, Georgia. And during 2024, we are planning to transfer Xi system production from California to our East Coast hub. Over the next 18 months, we expect to open new manufacturing facilities for da Vinci 5 and Ion system manufacturing in California and to complete line transfers for Ion and SP I&A to our Mexicali facility. We believe these activities will position Intuitive to serve our customers with best-in-class supply availability, product quality and product cost. Fourth quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 15% compared with last year, driven by increased headcount and higher variable compensation. In addition, fourth quarter 2023 operating expenses included a $40 million contribution to the Intuitive Foundation. We did not make a contribution in 2022. Pro forma other income was $67.1 million for Q4, higher than $57.9 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher interest income. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 15.9%, lower than prior quarters, primarily because of the release of certain tax reserves associated with the expiration of related statutes and a favorable earnings mix. Fourth quarter 2023 pro forma net income was $574 million or $1.60 per share compared with $439 million or $1.23 per share for the fourth quarter of last year. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $606 million or $1.69 per share for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with gap net income of $325 million or $0.91 per share for the fourth quarter of 2022. Fourth quarter GAAP tax expense reflected one-time benefits of $159 million associated with an increase in deferred tax assets associated with a statutory rate increase in Switzerland and receipt of certain tax benefits associated with our Swiss operations. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website. We ended the year with cash investments of $7.3 billion compared with $7.5 billion at the end of Q3. The sequential reduction in cash and investments reflected capital expenditures of $435 million, partially offset by cash generated from operating activities. Let me take a moment to address the new multiple system that Gary highlighted and certain assumptions that may impact 2024 modeling. First, since we have not received FDA clearance for da Vinci 5, we cannot provide specificity on launch timing and pricing. Second, once cleared, we are planning a phased launch period over several quarters. Noting that we are at the end of the Si trading cycle and that da Vinci 5 will be in a phased rollout, we expect total trading volumes to be lower in 2024 than the prior year. Given that, and our procedure guidance of 13% to 16% growth, we also expect total system placements for 2024 to be lower than 2023. As a result of the phased rollout of da Vinci 5, we expect a higher proportion of Gen 4 systems will be leased as customers seek flexibility to upgrade to da Vinci 5 when supply allows. For those customers that prefer to purchase a Gen 4 system, we will offer a future trading right that can be exercised when there is sufficient da Vinci 5 supply. Purchase contracts containing a trading right result in a deferral of a portion of the purchase price negatively impacting systems revenue. Finally, consistent with our experience bringing four generations of platforms to market, new systems typically start at lower gross margins and rise over a multiyear period as we build volume and optimize design, manufacturing and supply chains. Brian will describe our gross margin guidance in more detail later in the call. Before I turn it over to Brian to discuss clinical highlights and our outlook for 2024, let me address operating margins. 2023 pro forma operating margin was 34% of revenue compared to 35% in the prior year. We expect operating margins to be under pressure in 2024, given the anticipated launch of da Vinci 5, increased depreciation expense and an adverse mix impact to gross margin from the growth in new platforms. However, as we look to the medium term, we see opportunity for operating margin expansion based on the following dynamics. One, moving to broad launching da Vinci 5, allowing customers the opportunity to upgrade their existing fleet to the latest technology. Two, improving gross margin. We aspire to be above the 70% level over time. And three, leveraging those functions that can take advantage of scale as we grow. Improvements to gross margin will be driven by the following actions: First, improving the product cost of new platforms, including da Vinci 5. Second, growing into and eventually leveraging the incremental fixed costs from new manufacturing facilities. And third, the return of resources that have been deployed to supply continuity given the impact of the pandemic to returning to routine manufacturing and product cost reduction activities. We have the teams and capability to deliver on these efforts over the next several years. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian. Yeah. I would say the dynamics are quite different between when we launched Xi in 2014 versus where we are today. And I think the feature sets of da Vinci 5, which we haven't described I think an important context for you all, which we'll do once we have clearance. You look at relative penetration of da Vinci over that period, the extent to which leasing has changed significantly our OUS penetration. I think there are a number of factors, Larry, where I would not use the kind of Xi ramp and progression as a reference point for how da Vinci 5 might progress. But I think that I would make any further comments on that once we get through clearance and are able to talk to you about the feature set. With respect to the lease. So I think there are a number of dynamics that in the end will motivate a customer to look at a trade even if they have an existing system under lease. If I hold everything else equal and just look at the fact that the asset is leased, I do think there is some benefit to the customer insofar as they can avoid a capital budget barrier to executing an upgrade. But I think you have to look at all of the other dynamics that we're yet to describe. To some extent, it will obviously depend how that progresses both within our four walls and with our suppliers. Certainly, it's several quarters. I would take several quarters to be something that's beyond a year, but I think you have to watch us make progress here, and we'll keep you updated. Yeah. Let me take CapEx first. In '23 and '24, the majority of those capital investments are for manufacturing facilities and to add manufacturing capacity in particular to our Mexicali factory. So a significant portion of the depreciation that comes with that will show up in cost of sales, and that's reflected in part in the '24 gross margin guidance. Some of it will show up in OpEx, and that will therefore be reflected in SG&A. If I look at the relative growth in R&D and SG&A in '24, I think it's relatively similar. Obviously, innovation in R&D is important to us. But you will have a little bit of an impact in '24 at least for incremental depreciation. We still see opportunity to leverage some of our enabling functions. There are some other functions that also can leverage as we scale and grow, and so we'll look to do that over the next couple of years. With respect to the kind of operating margin expansion opportunity that I described in my prepared remarks. And we said over the medium term, I'd kind of broadly say that's a three- to five-year horizon. We have a specific set of actions and plans that we need to execute. Those teams have those as goals. There's some variability, obviously, in terms of how they get executed and there's some interrelationship between set of actions that need to be completed. So there are dynamics there that can impact the speed at which that gets executed. And of course, we have to run our business in the meantime. Not ready to be particularly specific yet on when the supply chain challenges are behind us. For catheter, you have three dynamics. So we had a specific supply constraint that impacted us. We are, at the same time, transferring a number of catheter lines to Mexicali. And we're doing that as the business is effectively doubling, so you're bringing on new staff, you're having to train them. So that's a real effort that takes some time. And I think there's a little bit of variability in terms of when we get to point where that's behind us. So I'm going to let us have another quarter before we talk about when that's resolved. The teams are making clear progress, but there's work still will be done. On the vision probe, I think it's a relatively simpler problem for us to address. There isn't a supplier dependency within that particular area. It's really just us being able to execute, again, a line transfer as the business is doubling and the team are making great progress. But stay tuned. Well, I think the first effect is we'll see the operating lease proportion of placements increased from where it's been. And again, that's because customers are motivated to have the protection that's in those clauses so that they can upgrade da Vinci 5 when it becomes more broadly available. So that was the first kind of message we wanted to provide in terms of 2024 modeling. In terms of then how that gets upgraded, it's really a function of when does da Vinci 5 launch, which obviously we can't be specific about right now, and there's some things to work through with FDA. And then what's the period of time over which we then go from a constrained or phased launch to a full launch. And so I don't see that particularly as somehow a revenue benefit in '24. I think what we're saying is you'll have more of the placements that are leased, and therefore, that revenue is spread over time. Indications so far have been that, that anticorruption effort is a year-long effort which would take us to the middle of '24. And so that's why we indicated that we would expect delayed tenders through the period in which that effort is ongoing. We don't have great visibility, frankly, beyond the first half of '24. And that's why in the prepared remarks, we said at least through the first half of '24. So yes, if that effort was to be resolved, and if things start to normalize in terms of the pace at which tenders occurred, then you could see some opportunity for that to recover. But we're not in a position where we can predict that at this point. Let me start with seasonality. And I'm not going to be specific on quarterly cadence, but I do think I tried to emphasize in our prepared remarks that we believe that the first half will be a tougher comp versus last year. And so using that, the comparison from last year and then also thinking about our historical sort of cadence throughout the year, I think you can look at that history and just make an assumption on what that growth rate -- what those growth rates could be by quarter. Let's talk about factors in the procedure guidance. So those -- there's really three primary factors, right? You have -- we've called out bariatric growth rates, and that's primarily a US factor. We talked a bit about from an OUS perspective, China, and then also backlog in the system. And so the backlog also being primarily a US factor. But could still be broader. But -- so I'm not going to go into specifics as far as US versus OUS. But I think I'd go back and just really center you on our comments around bariatric growth rates, right? Low end of the range assumes that there's some continued moderation in bariatric procedures and at the high end of the range that it assumes current growth rates. There's some impact in China at the low end of the range just from the discussion that we had right now an anticorruption and how long that actually persists and then the benefit of backlog and how that will persist throughout the year. If you take a look at the US, and I'm going to put this in quartiles for a second in terms of where we are in the adoption curve, colorectal we're in the second quartile. Bariatrics, also the second quartile. Actually cholecystectomy and hernia all in the second quartile in terms of where they are along the adoption curve. And so that obviously gives us some continuing runway to grow, and that's a driver behind the US general surgery growth rates that we've seen. In the international markets, by the way, just in terms of general surgery, for the most part -- in most of the larger markets, we're in the first quarter of adoption. It's early. What we're seeing is growth start to stick and those don't start to be on early growth rates. Particularly in the cancer procedures, colorectal and beyond general surgery in hysterectomy and thoracic."

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to your host, Head of Investor Relations, Intuitive Surgical, Brian King. Please go ahead.\nBrian King: Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive's third quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; Jamie Samath, our CFO; and Dr. Myriam Curet, our Chief Medical Officer. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 10, 2023, and Form 10-Q filed on July 24, 2023. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our third quarter results, as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Jamie will provide a review of our financial results, Myriam will present clinical highlights, and I will discuss procedure details and provide our updated financial outlook for 2023. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.\nGary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. In this third quarter, we saw a strong growth in procedures performed by our customers, solid new system placements and healthy growth in utilization amid market conditions that remain largely consistent with Q2. Our new platforms continue to gain ground with Ion installs and procedure growth continuing, SP installs and procedure growth modestly accelerating and healthy growth in customer use of our digital tools. Turning first to procedures. da Vinci procedure growth in the quarter was 19%. Areas of strength included general surgery for benign conditions, particularly in the United States and broad regional growth with Germany, Japan, the U.K. and India standouts. China procedure growth was in line with our global average in the quarter. U.S. dermal surgery procedure growth was led by cholecystectomy and colon resection. Ion procedures showed continued strength with 125% growth in the quarter. SP procedure growth accelerated with 54% global growth in the quarter driven by strength in the United States. On the capital front, we placed 312 systems in Q3 compared with 305 systems in Q3 of last year. Our clinical installed base now stands 8,127 multiport da Vinci systems, 490 Ion systems and 158 single-port da Vinci systems. Overall, our capital placement trends reflect demand for additional capacity in multiport, continued greenfield interest in our Ion system and a modest acceleration for placements of SP. The proportion of leases for new capital placements accelerated in the quarter with the U.S. using the highest leasing rates. We think the acceleration in leasing reflects the convenience of our leasing program and the maturity of our Generation 4 multiport systems. While leasing reduces in-quarter revenue relative to capital purchase, total economics are healthy for our customer and for us. Leasing allows our customers to build clinical capacity when and where they need it and provides predefined pathways for our new technology as it enters the market. The growth rate in system utilization, defined as procedures per installed system per quarter was 6%, down from 9% last quarter while still above historical growth rates. Strong procedure growth and increased proportion of use in benign indications shortens average procedure times and needs of scheduling. Higher utilization increases our customers' return on invested capital and is economically healthy for us. Turning to our finances. Our revenue grew 12% in the quarter and our operating expenses were within our spend guidance. Our spending reflects continued investments in research and development to support the growth of our platforms and digital tools, expansion of our manufacturing and commercial footprints and capital amortization. Looking at the broader picture, our fourth-generation da Vinci platform is operating at global scale and embedded in a robust ecosystem of instruments, accessories, training and services. Customer acceptance of our Ion platform is strong. Acceptance of our da Vinci SP is accelerating with new indications in the pipeline, and our digital tools are building momentum through their early stages. We welcome Dr. Myriam Curet, Intuitive's Chief Medical Officer to this call, and she will take us through our clinical perspective and some of the work we're doing to expand indications. Our operations teams did a fantastic job supporting our customers through the supply chain shocks of the past several years. This unavoidable effort diverted resources away from product cost reduction and as supply chain stresses ease, we're now pivoting our attention to once again lowering our product costs. Areas of opportunity include our Ion program, our SP accessories portfolio and our multiport accessories in advanced instrument lines. Given the timing of facilities completion, manufacturing efficiency improvements for new products and other complex projects, we expect variability in gross margin over the coming quarters as we work through these programs. Turning to our digital offerings, customer use of our digital tools and channels is growing nicely. Our SimNow surgical simulators are installed at the majority of our customer sites and subscription renewal rates are outstanding. Routine use of My Intuitive app by over 10,000 da Vinci surgeons grew by 140% year-over-year and is receiving strong Net Promoter Scores that continue improving over time. Our Intuitive Hub media management and telepresence system installations grew 58% in the quarter, and Hub captured surgical cases grew 61%. In closing, core demand is healthy. We're focused on in our ecosystem internationally and driving our product cost down, particularly for our newer platforms. We are dogged in pursuit of significant long-term opportunity to improve the quadruple aim using our integrated ecosystem powered by analytics, and we are pacing our investments to catalyze that opportunity. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie, who will take you through our finances in greater detail.\nJamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Core metrics continue to be healthy in Q3, with global procedure growth of 19% and an increase in the installed base of da Vinci systems of 13% and an increase in average system utilization of 6%. Our key financial indicators were also healthy. Third quarter recurring revenue grew 21%. Pro forma operating margin was 36%, and pro forma earnings per share increased 23% over last year. Procedures in the U.S. grew 17%, reflecting a lower benefit from patient backlogs as compared to the first half of 2023. Last quarter, we highlighted that our growth rate in bariatric's procedures in the U.S. had slowed given patient interest in weight loss drugs. In Q3, we continued to see double-digit growth albeit at a modestly lower growth rate as compared to Q2. Bariatric's procedures represent between 4% and 5% of total global procedures. Based on third-party data, we believe we continue to gain market share in the bariatric surgical segment. OUS procedures grew 24% with relative strength in India, Germany, the U.K. and Japan. Procedure growth in China was consistent with our expectations, lower than last quarter due to a strong base period given the recovery from COVID-related lockdowns in the year ago quarter. Consistent with recent trends, growth in non-neurology procedures outside of the United States was accretive, growing at approximately 31%. Within the larger cancer categories, our fastest-growing OUS procedure is colon resection, a high-value procedure led by adoption in Japan, Germany and the U.K. With respect to capital performance, we placed 312 systems in the third quarter as compared to 305 systems last year. As a reminder, system placements in Q3 of last year benefit from a delay in the shipment of approximately 15 systems from June into July as a result of supply chain challenges we encountered in June of last year. Late in Q3, we started to see delays in tender processes in China, primarily as a result of anticorruption efforts by the central government, resulting in lower system placements in China in Q3. We expect tender delays to continue to impact system placements in China in Q4. Q3 revenue was $1.7 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. Q3 revenue growth was driven by procedure growth, partially offset by an 11% decline in systems revenue due to the significant increase in the mix of operating lease arrangements. On a constant currency basis, third quarter revenue growth was also 12%. Given recent movements in exchange rates, at current rates, the U.S. dollar is approximately 3% stronger on a revenue-weighted basis as compared to the average rates realized in Q3. Revenue denominated in non-USD currencies represent approximately 24% of total revenue. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: in the U.S., we placed 159 systems in the third quarter compared to 175 systems placed last year. Outside the U.S., we placed 153 systems in Q3 compared with 130 systems last year. Current quarter system placements included 60 into Europe, 32 into Japan and 10 into China compared with 54 into Europe, 32 into Japan and 15 into China in Q3 of last year. 62 of the 312 systems placed in Q3 were trading transactions compared to 71 trading transactions in the third quarter of last year. As of the end of Q3, there are approximately 440 SIs remaining in the installed base, of which 85 are in the U.S. Operating leases represented 52% of third quarter placements compared with 37% last year. In the U.S., 70% of system placements in Q3 were under operating lease arrangements compared to 48% last year. Of the 163 operating lease placements in the quarter, 93 were usage-based arrangements, an increase compared to 54% last year, reflecting customer preferences, particularly in the U.S. While leasing may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time. Q3 system average selling prices were $1.4 million as compared to $1.39 million last quarter from $1.5 million last year. The year-over-year decrease in system ASPs was primarily driven by lower pricing and geographical mix. We recognized $17 million of lease buyout revenue in the third quarter compared with $12 million last quarter and $17 million in Q3 of 2022. da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure of approximately $1,830, compared with approximately $1,840 last quarter and $1,800 last year. On a sequential basis, lower I&A per procedure reflected the impact of customer ordering patterns, partially offset by a full quarter impact from the I&A price increase that went into effect halfway through last quarter. Turning to our Ion platform. In Q3, we placed 55 Ion systems as compared to 50 in Q3 of 2022. Third quarter Ion procedures of approximately 14,500 increased 125% as compared to last year. 16 of the systems placed in the third quarter were SP systems, 12 into the U.S. and four into Korea. SP procedures grew by 54%, and average system utilization growth continued to accelerate growing 21% compared to Q3 of last year. Moving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the third quarter was 68.8% compared with 68.5% last quarter and 69.8% last year. As a reminder, pro forma gross margin in Q3 of last year included a onetime benefit of approximately 50 basis points related to the favorable conclusion of certain indirect tax matters. The remaining year-over-year difference in pro forma gross margin is primarily due to a higher mix of the Ion revenue, which currently carries significantly lower margins as compared to the da Vinci business and lower system ASP, partially offset by the I&A price increase. Inventory increased to approximately 180 days in Q3, higher than historical averages, driven by two factors: first, we have modestly increased our inventory targets given supply chain stresses over the last couple of years; and secondly, given significant capital investments we are making in manufacturing facilities and capacity, we are building bridge inventory to facilitate an elevated number of line transfers to new locations. As a result, we expect higher levels of inventory relative to historical norms into 2025. Third quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher headcount-related costs. During the quarter, our head count increased by 489 employees, of which approximately 275 were for our manufacturing operations in support of revenue growth. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were lower by 100 basis points as compared to Q3 of last year and largely reflected planned leverage in our enabling functions. Pro forma other income in Q3 was $58 million compared to $42 million last quarter and $7 million last year. Other income primarily consists of interest income and the increase as compared to last quarter was driven by higher interest rates and higher average cash and investment balances. Pro forma other income in Q3 of last year also reflected higher than typical foreign exchange losses resulting from remeasurement of the balance sheet as a result of the strengthening U.S. dollar. Capital expenditures in Q3 were $256 million, primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities footprint and increase manufacturing capacity. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 22.5%, consistent with our expectations. Third quarter pro forma net income was $524 million or $1.46 per share compared with $429 million or $1.19 per share for Q3 of last year. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $416 million or $1.16 per share for the third quarter of 2023 compared with GAAP net income of $324 million or $0.90 per share for the third quarter of 2022. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.5 billion compared with $7.1 billion last quarter. The sequential increase in cash and investments reflected cash from operating activities and proceeds from employee stock exercises partially offset by capital expenditures. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Myriam, who will discuss clinical highlights.\nMyriam Curet: Thank you. Now turning to the clinical side for our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. In addition to relaying the results of one of these studies, I'd like to start by describing the status of some important Intuitive research projects underway that support our company's belief in the potential value of da Vinci systems specifically our single-port system for procedures requiring refined access to tight or difficult to reach anatomical areas. In June 2021, Intuitive launched an FDA-approved clinical study focused on complex colorectal procedures, such as low anterior resection or right colectomy, performed using the SP platform. Currently, enrollment is complete with 60 patients across nine sites in the U.S. and Korea. Another FDA-approved trials for rapid procedures in pulmonary lobectomy and thymectomy performed using SP completed enrollment in June of this year with 32 subjects enrolled across six centers in the U.S. We believe that Intuitive single-port technology will enable thoracic surgeons to perform uniportal lobectomy, something that may be difficult using a VATS approach. Intuitive intent to submit data from these two studies to the FDA after the patient follow-up outlined in the study plan and the data analysis has been completed. Now I'll turn to a notable study published in the Annals of Surgery this past August. This study was not sponsored by Intuitive. Dr. Yogita Patel of McMaster University in Canada published early results from the RAVAL trial in a manuscript titled Robotic Lobectomy is cost effective and provides comparable health utility scores to video-assisted lobectomy. This study describes results from a multicenter, multinational, blinded, randomized controlled study comparing the da Vinci and VATS approach to pulmonary lobectomy. It analyzed 164 subjects, 81 in new robotic-assisted group and 82 in the VATS group. And all robotic-assisted lobectomies were performed with a da Vinci multiport platform. Notably, the health utility score was significantly higher in the da Vinci arm at seven weeks and 12 weeks post procedure, which suggests the quality of life for patients who underwent a da Vinci lobectomy was better than for patients undergoing the VATS procedure. Interestingly, and related to quality of life outcomes, the authors analyzed the incremental cost-effective ratio or ICER for the robotic group relative to VATS and reported the robotic group was associated with a gain of approximately $11,000 per quality adjusted life year. In addition, the median number of lymph nodes examined and sampled were significantly higher in the da Vinci Group. To summarize, the authors conclude that, early results from the RAVAL trials suggest that robotic pulmonary lobectomy is a cost-effective intervention, which is associated with comparable patient-reported health utility scores when compared to VATS lobectomy. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian who will discuss additional procedure highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2024.\nBrian King: Thank you, Myriam. Our overall third quarter procedure growth was 19% year-over-year compared to 20% for the third quarter of 2022 and 22% last quarter. In the U.S., third quarter 2023 procedure growth was 17% year-over-year compared to 18% for the third quarter of 2022 and 19% last quarter. Q3 growth was led by procedure strength within general surgery, with particular strength in cholecystectomy and colon resection. Outside of the U.S., third quarter procedure volume grew 24% compared with 24% for the third quarter of 2022 and 28% last quarter. OUS growth was led by procedures beyond urology, which now make up approximately 50% of total OUS procedures. General surgery growth was strong, primarily in colorectal procedures followed by growth in gynecology procedures. Growth in urology continued to be healthy, led by kidney procedures, along with continued double-digit growth in prostatectomy. In Europe, we experienced strong growth in Germany, the U.K. and Spain. In each of the regions noted, procedure growth was led by general surgery, primarily from colorectal procedures and specifically in Germany and the U.K., hysterectomy procedures also contributed to strong growth. In Asia, growth was led by Japan. More than half of the incremental procedure growth in the country was led by strong growth in general surgery procedures, consisting largely of colorectal and gastrectomy procedures. In China, procedure growth was consistent with our expectations for the quarter. Growth was driven primarily in neurology, notably by prostatectomy and kidney procedures. In India, while in the early stage of adoption, saw strong growth in general surgery procedures, namely cholecystectomy and hernia repair and growth in gynecology procedures. I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2023. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecasted full year 2023 procedure growth within a range of 20% to 22%. We are now raising the low end from 20% to 21% and expect full year 2023 procedure growth of 21% to 22%. The low end of the range reflects uncertainty around the duration of elevated procedure volumes with patients returning to health care, a continued slowing of bariatric growth rates in the U.S. and macroeconomic challenges that could impact hospitals and patient spending. At the high end of the range, we assume macroeconomic challenges do not have a significant impact on hospital procedure volumes, and bariatric growth rates in the U.S. continue at the rate we experienced in Q3. The range does not reflect significant material supply chain disruptions or hospital capacity constraints. Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast our 2023 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 68% and 69%. We are now refining our estimate of pro forma gross profit margin to be within 68% and 68.5%. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions. With respect to operating expenses, on our last call, we forecast pro forma operating expense growth to be between 12% and 15%. We are adjusting our estimate and now expect our full year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 12% and 14%. We are also refining our estimate for noncash stock compensation expense to range between $600 million to $610 million in 2023, lowering the range from our previous estimates of $600 million to $620 million. We are increasing our estimate for other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $190 million and $200 million in 2023, an increase from our previous estimate of $160 million and $180 million. The increase primarily reflects the rise in interest rates. With regard to capital expenditures, we are narrowing our estimate to range between $900 million to $1 billion, primarily for planned facility construction activities. With regard to income tax, we are also refining our estimate for the 2023 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 23% of pretax income, reducing the previous estimate of the upper end of the range from 24% to 23%. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We go to the first question from the line of Robbie Marcus, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRobert Marcus: Great. Congrats on good quarter. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe to start, it's hard to escape it. GLP-1 is becoming a very big topic in med tech. And your -- it's impacting bariatric surgery here. It doesn't seem to be impacting anything else, particularly in the pipeline. But just wondering your thoughts overall, could GLP-1s ultimately be a positive as more people try weight loss surgery and come in the funnel? And any other impacts good or bad that you foresee on business?\nGary Guthart: Thanks, Robbie. I'm going to ask Dr. Curet as a bariatric surgeon to go ahead and weigh in on that first part of your question, and we'll talk about the broader implications after that.\nMyriam Curet: I think you are correct. I think in the short term, we will see patients who are considering or are in the pipeline for bariatric surgery going to try the drug. However, given compliance issues, costs, side effects, we expect that many of them will not stay on the drug for longer than a year or 2. And at that time, we'll consider bariatric surgery. So I think overall, we'll see an increased interest in bariatric surgery, but that will get delayed in the short term.\nGary Guthart: Robbie, any follow-up you wanted on GLP-1s?\nRobert Marcus: No, I had a financial question for Jamie, if that's okay, after.\nGary Guthart: Please.\nRobert Marcus: Jamie, it looks like the fourth quarter gross margin is ticking down a bit, and you're talking about the increased depreciation cost and some of these new investments here. I was wondering if you could seize the amount, and I'm really looking for how to think about into next year with depreciation, so we could get our gross margin set based on whatever expansion or contraction we're all forecasting. Thanks a lot.\nJamie Samath: Yes. For Q4, you're not really seeing significant depreciation and expense reflected in the range that we provided. That's really more next year as some of the manufacturing capacity in facilities come online. What you're seeing in Q4 really is a little bit of FX given how the rates have moved, a little bit of slower progress in some of the line transfers and product cost reduction plans that we have, that's not a large delay. It's just slightly slower than we had planned. And then there's some mix dynamics reflected in Q4. They now to be relatively small, but those are the dynamics as to why gross margin range for the year is at the midpoint, slightly lower than what we had previously. With respect to how '24 is shaping up, what I would just say is, as Gary said in his prepared remarks, we'll see some variability in gross margin over the next several quarters is the depreciation expense and the ongoing efforts to improve our product costs, particularly on the Ion side. And frankly, there are some accumulated inefficiencies just in our global manufacturing operations. They built up over COVID and because of the supply chain issues that we encountered that we're addressing. And a number of those will take time for us to resolve. So I'd say let us give you '24 guidance for gross margin when we get to January because I think we still have to work through those plans.\nRobert Marcus: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: We'll go to the next line, Travis Steed, Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nTravis Steed: Thanks for taking the question. I guess to follow up on that. I know on the prepared remarks, it sounds like Gary said, manufacturing improvements for new products and other complex projects. So just curious if you could elaborate on some of those new products and complex projects and what those are that's impacting the gross margin.\nGary Guthart: Yes. On the product side, we have real work to do on Ion. Ion is well accepted by the customer base, growing quickly. We need to iterate and drive manufacturability and manufacturing costs on Ion. So that was mainly what I was referring to. Some of the accessories in the SP line are real opportunities. We want to be assertive there. So on the product side, that's most of what the reference is.\nJamie Samath: Just one other element. We are in-sourcing a high-volume accessory on the multiport side as part of in-sourcing that there's some differential automation in the line there. And so ramping that, there's some work to get that to be at our targets.\nTravis Steed: Great. Helpful. And coming into this year, on the procedures, some of the swing factors were China, staffing pressures and COVID. And I imagine like going into '24, there's bariatrics in China, some of the swing factors. Maybe you could just talk about some of the swing factors on 2024 procedures, pluses and minuses and do you think China and bariatrics are still going to be growing and adding to the growth in procedures in '24?\nBrian King: Travis, this is Brian. I guess thinking of 2024, nothing really to share at this point. Clearly, I think when we get into January, we'll be able to give you a bit more insight. But I guess I'll just leave it at that for now.\nGary Guthart: Let me just pick up two topics you hit. On the China side, I think the procedure demand side remains robust. I think there's some government policy activity that's putting a little bit of a chill in the market. Some of that is economics, so price caps and value-based pricing and some of it is in any corruption probe that is giving hospitals some pause moving forward with other new programs. We'll see. I think the China side is likely to -- some pressure on the China side is likely to persist for several quarters. On the bariatric side, I think we'll find a new normal in the next few quarters. It's hard to predict exactly when that will happen. We'll see that play out in the marketplace.\nTravis Steed: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: We go to next line, Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Gary, your usage-based leasing program has gotten some scale. Can you talk about the utilization rates on those systems relative to the average? And any other themes you could share?\nGary Guthart: Sure. I will turn to Jamie here on kind of utilization rates. So why don't you kick that off?\nJamie Samath: Yes. There's two ways to look at it, Larry, what is the absolute utilization rate compared to a regular leasing compared to a purchase arrangement. They are very similar. Actually, the tightness on the mean between those three structures is very tight. Within those arrangements, you generally have a target procedure level that reflects success of the program for the customer and the economic objectives that we have. And if you accumulate again, the portfolio they run at slightly above the targeted procedure levels that we have embedded in the contracts. So they have run very well so far, and it's one of the reasons why we and the customer have expanded those so quickly in recent times.\nLarry Biegelsen: That's helpful. And leasing in the U.S., where do you see that going? I mean, it was almost -- it was over 70 this quarter and last quarter. Have we plateaued? Or does that continue to go higher?\nJamie Samath: On a global basis, we expect the proportion of placements that are leased to continue to find. U.S. is pretty high, as you pointed out, Larry, 70% this quarter, 78% last quarter. There will be some larger IDNs that just routinely prefer to purchase just because of how that affects the metrics that are important to them. But even in the U.S., I think there's some room for that to continue to creep up a little bit, obviously, running out of room. We found a number of U.S. customers have really appreciate that as a way to manage through what are totally managed capital budgets.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have Brandon Vazquez, William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Vazquez: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe my first one, I wanted to talk a little bit about general surgery, that's obviously been a nice growth path for you here in the U.S. My understanding is it's a little less penetrated international. What do you think needs to happen in the international markets to kind of get on that steep part of the adoption curve for general surgery as well? Are they kind of seeing time lines and catalysts in the U.S?\nGary Guthart: Sure. Thank you for the question. On -- one way to think about it is that general surgery comprises both procedures that are done where cancer is the underlying cause and others that are benign indication. On the cancer as an underlying cause, we're seeing nice early growth in several OUS markets. So there, I think that's healthy, and we're enthused. I think reimbursements are generally in place in many of the places that we are operating. I think that's what good in clinical data coming out has been supportive. I think that as you think about benign indications, we're seeing some of the beginnings of benign indications in some markets, there may be reimbursement work or education of insurers that has to be done for those to progress further. So in that setting, we'll have additional work to do as it plays out.\nBrandon Vazquez: Great. And then maybe last one from me as a follow-up, I think last quarter, you guys were talking a little bit about launching, I believe it was called Case Insight, kind of the software AI platform. Any kind of updates on that end? How are things going so far? And maybe what's in the future for that program? Thanks.\nGary Guthart: Yes. Thank you for the reference. So Case Insights is our machine learning AI program that looks at surgical science. We have our first installs and first case is going that we had talked about it with you last quarter. So far, early feedback, and it's super early. We're really in the early innings here is very good. Case Insights builds on some prior research that we had done with academic centers on something that we have described as a computational observer. So we have some pretty good scientific underpinnings for it. We expect over time that, that program will feed insights into different parts of the hospital's analytic system from giving specific guidance to learning surgeons and care teams about where they might improve their technique and skills to giving suggestions to programmatics, about efficiency and total cost management, to giving other insights for the company about how to improve procedures in the OR. So, we think it's a long-term set of investments around really the science of surgery. We remain extremely excited about it. While we do have some revenue for it, we don't expect it to be a serious revenue driver. We think it is an ecosystem complementary. And we look forward to describing it more to you as time goes on.\nBrandon Vazquez: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: We'll go next to Matt Miksic, Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Miksic: Hi, thanks so much for taking the questions. So, I had one question on - follow-up on kind of the bariatric trends and one on sort of the system leasing effect on pricing. So bariatric, if you could maybe talk about - you mentioned the global percentage of procedures that bariatric represent maybe - just the growth trajectory of that business in the second quarter and the third quarter. And whether that's something you expect to grow at a similar trajectory or bottom out in your comments on folks getting on the drug for getting off saying a year or two to kind of suggest maybe a longer path to stabilization in that business line within. And then I'll just follow-up briefly with the question on ASPs, if I could? Thank you.\nGary Guthart: Yes. Jamie, you might speak to kind of what the size or percentage of that business is for us. A little bit of the acceleration or deceleration trend.\nJamie Samath: Yes. And I want to make sure I got it right, Matt. So come back to me if I have the wrong questions. But our total bariatric business represents about 4% to 5% of global procedures. What you saw in Q2 was in the U.S., which is where the majority of our bariatric procedure volumes are, in the U.S., the growth rate declined to about the U.S. average. And then what we saw in Q3 was it modestly decline a little further in Q3. Were those your questions?\nMatthew Miksic: Yes. No, that's very helpful. And then I guess, just your expectation - you framed out in terms of your guidance, but I mean, is this - I mentioned it just because one of the other competitors actually saw a decline, I guess, in laparoscopic bariatric or some combination a lot been open in the third quarter, single-digit decline. But it doesn't seem like you're in that zone, right? You're still at or slightly below your average growth rate in the U.S. Is that - am I hearing your answer correctly?\nJamie Samath: Well, if you take our procedure growth in bariatrics relative to market, we're taking share and have been for some time. So the fact that we had double-digit growth in Q3 relative to another company that had a decline, that's just a reflection in part of the fact that we are taking share in bariatrics and continue to do so, even though there's an impact to overall bariatric surgery, because of GLP-1s.\nMatthew Miksic: Got it. That's very helpful. And then the other - just ASP, I understand system ASP you give is not - does not - as your U.S. leasing goes up, as I understand it, those leased systems in the U.S. are not included in that ASP calculation. So if you could maybe just speak to - I don't know, the way in which the increased leases have affected ASP or whether this is straight up year-over-year decline that suggested in sort of the overall numbers that you provide, if that's a clear question?\nJamie Samath: So everything you described is correct. Generally, although there can be exceptions for mix effect, generally U.S. system ASPs when purchased are accretive to the global average. So in effect, as leasing has grown significantly in the U.S., that in and of itself has an adverse effect for calculated system ASP. The other thing that you see then with now a greater proportion of systems used to calculate that system ASP being international FX can have an effect. If you look on a two-year horizon. So for example, the exchange rate in Japan based on how the U.S. dollar has strengthened, there's a 30% to 40% impact over a two-year basis on system ASP in Japan as translated. So, there is a geographical effect. And if you look at a long enough horizon, there's an FX effect in what we described in Q3 was in terms of the year-over-year decline in ASP, also a dynamic relative to pricing. And that's really just as we expand our existing customers who are looking for a third, fourth, fifth system, those tend to be slightly lower ASPs than you've seen previously when they were greenfield accounts, I would say that in China, we do see some competitive dynamics with respect to pricing just given the number of lower local players. And so, there's been some competitive effect on system ASPs in China specifically. We don't really see that in other markets to this point.\nMatthew Miksic: Thanks so much for the color.\nOperator: And we'll go to the next one, Jayson Bedford, Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nJayson Bedford: Hi, good afternoon. Gary, I think you've expressed your views on the role of bariatric surgery in a GLP world. I'm just wondering if these views have changed in any way over the last quarter or two? I know it's not a lot of time, but the adoption of this class of drugs is obviously ramping quickly. And then just as kind of a related follow-up, getting back to Robbie's question on the potential impact of GLPs beyond bariatrics. Do you expect an impact from some of your other procedure categories as GLPs get adopted?\nGary Guthart: Okay. On the first one, I think Myriam described it well. Our position on GLP-1s as it relates to bariatric surgery, I think she hit it well at the start of the call, no reason to reiterate it here. On the issue of potential impact beyond bariatrics, there may be some, although I think as you think through the analysis, I think it will be modest. And here's how we think about it. If you look at obesity and diabetes as risk factors in other domains and other diseases for which surgery is performed, they are sometimes positive correlated risk factors for that disease. In some weird cases, they are negative in cases that it's actually protective against disease. So it's not entirely obvious. In most of the diseases that we treat as we look at it, it is not the dominant risk factor. So as we look out and think about what could it be like in our TAM, we can kind of do a back of the envelope analysis. It is really early. I don't think anybody knows the exact number. What I can say is that it's not the dominant risk factor in most things that we look at. And we have a very large unpenetrated TAM. I think we're still in the early innings of what we're trying to work on. So, if these drugs are highly effective at avoiding other types of diseases, we will cheer. I still think we have a lot of upside opportunity to pursue.\nJayson Bedford: Fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: And we go to next line, Ryan Zimmerman, BTIG. Please go ahead.\nRyan Zimmerman: Thanks for taking the questions. I think you spoke about some of the new indications in SP. If I'm not mistaken, I think there's a 30-day follow-up on the thoracic trial. But I'm curious if you could expand maybe when complex colorectal and thoracic cases potentially could become growth drivers for SP adoption and when you expect those - not just those trials to wrap up, but potentially clearances in the U.S. with that?\nGary Guthart: Sure. Myriam, I think you're best to answer that.\nMyriam Curet: Yes. So, we are hoping to submit everything in the foreseeable future. After that, as you know, there's at least a 90-day turnaround for the IDEs and then - excuse me, for the clearances. And then after that, we will have to put training together - and they'll see launches together. So I can't really give you a time line for when that would be, but we know what the work is that needs to be done, and we are starting and moving forward on that.\nRyan Zimmerman: Okay.\nGary Guthart: Our biggest steps are get the data arranged to get it into the FDA and work with them to get clearances. And then as Myriam says, we'll go through a staged commercialization. So you can expect submissions in the first half of '24 and then response thereafter.\nRyan Zimmerman: Thank you, Gary. One of the other things, and I don't know if it's direct to you, Gary or Jamie, but you did talk about an opportunity to lower product costs as supply chain stresses ease and I know there were some comments earlier about '24 gross margins. But stepping aside from that, can you quantify the opportunity potentially for what that looks like? Have you gotten your arms around - I know Marshall has been kind of shepherd in these processes. But at what point can you give the Street more color on what that opportunity looks like to drive gross margin gains?\nJamie Samath: We have very well detailed plans for each of the areas that we're focused on. The teams have the capability and skill. It's going to take some time. I think the best way I would answer the question is we see a path of overtime probably in the midterm to get back above 70% gross margin.\nRyan Zimmerman: Thank you, Jamie.\nOperator: We go to next line, Anthony Petrone, Mizuho Group. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Petrone: Maybe one on China and one on pricing on instruments. When we think about the quota size that National Health Commission in China put out, its new quota is 559 systems. Just wondering on anticorruption, could that shift that number over time whether it be that just fewer capital dollars going to projects or just from a timing element, because things are getting elongated. And then the pricing question would be on instruments and accessories. The company put a 5% price increase in their first one in 14 years. Chairman Powell came out and said, look, inflation is going to be persistent and elevated for quite some time. If inflation stays high, could another 5% price increase beyond the table for 2024? Thanks.\nGary Guthart: With regard to the capital side in China, I'll jump into that. I think demand for our systems and for the procedures they support in China, raw demand is really high. So it's really being limited or titrated by policy. I don't see - I haven't heard anything that says people want to go back and revisit or lower the quota, I think that would be resisted by customers who are looking for purchases. So, I think it's more around delay and a kind of a timing thing and how long it is hard to predict, but months, not weeks. On the pricing side, I'll speak to a general principle rather than projecting '24. What we try to do is a couple of things. One is be an outstanding manufacturer, really get high quality at low cost, and make sure that we can invest in manufacturing prowess to do that. I think that's really powerful for us, gives us enormous flexibility to meet the customers' needs, kind of where they are. With regard to pricing, we look at a couple of things, certainly price to us, cost to us, but also price elasticity, what the customer can do and achieve and that varies by market. And I think, we've become increasingly sensitive to and sophisticated at understanding pricing. So raw material pricing and core inflation to us is an input to our pricing. That's why we took price up this last year, but it's not the only thing, and you shouldn't expect us to be purely algorithmic tracking inflation on its own.\nAnthony Petrone: Thanks.\nOperator: And we'll go to the line of Michael Polark of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Polark: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. I have big picture one modeling long-term. There's an investor presentation out earlier this year and it - Intuitive identified 6 million procedures globally for multi and single port for which you currently have line of sight. And on that same slide, identified that there's 20 million soft tissue surgery procedures overall. And if I look at where you're today, you're approaching 40% of that 6 million. And so my question is the delta between the 20 and the six to 14 kind of - how do you expand the six towards the 20? And what are the major unlocks that you expect over the next three to five years that will move the six towards the 20 and kind of your feel for the pace of addressing more of the global procedure pie?\nGary Guthart: Yes, it's a good question. I think the general tools that we use to get from six to 20 are kind of three buckets. Some of them are clearances in new markets. So making sure that a market we can address has access to the technologies that we already have. So when you think about something like Ion, for example, Ion is not yet available in all the markets in which we operate as it operates that it starts to open what we can do. That's kind of one bucket. New indications are another one that some of the work that Myriam described earlier. That starts to open a new opportunity for us as we broaden the applicability of our platforms to new types of surgery and intervention. The third bucket or another bucket is reimbursement. There are places where we think additional data, is required to get insurers to engage a little bit differently and open the market. And then lastly, there are new products and technologies that we're working on that we are not yet described, that we think - allow us to provide new solutions that are competitive in the marketplace. Each of those operates on a little bit different time line. So it's not - I can't give you a simple synopsis of how fast each one runs. Some of them take a lot of years, some reimbursement things or long lead. A product development can be long lead. Other types of access can happen more quickly. But that's a set of plans that we lay out. We're pretty disciplined about laying out, what we want to do over time over a multiyear time horizon. And that's how, we start to open that market. That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the Quadruple Aim. There are more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision the future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better, where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly, so patients can get back to what matters most.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone. And that does conclude your conference. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

            "name": "Myriam Curet",
            "content": "Thank you. Now turning to the clinical side for our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. In addition to relaying the results of one of these studies, I'd like to start by describing the status of some important Intuitive research projects underway that support our company's belief in the potential value of da Vinci systems specifically our single-port system for procedures requiring refined access to tight or difficult to reach anatomical areas. In June 2021, Intuitive launched an FDA-approved clinical study focused on complex colorectal procedures, such as low anterior resection or right colectomy, performed using the SP platform. Currently, enrollment is complete with 60 patients across nine sites in the U.S. and Korea. Another FDA-approved trials for rapid procedures in pulmonary lobectomy and thymectomy performed using SP completed enrollment in June of this year with 32 subjects enrolled across six centers in the U.S. We believe that Intuitive single-port technology will enable thoracic surgeons to perform uniportal lobectomy, something that may be difficult using a VATS approach. Intuitive intent to submit data from these two studies to the FDA after the patient follow-up outlined in the study plan and the data analysis has been completed. Now I'll turn to a notable study published in the Annals of Surgery this past August. This study was not sponsored by Intuitive. Dr. Yogita Patel of McMaster University in Canada published early results from the RAVAL trial in a manuscript titled Robotic Lobectomy is cost effective and provides comparable health utility scores to video-assisted lobectomy. This study describes results from a multicenter, multinational, blinded, randomized controlled study comparing the da Vinci and VATS approach to pulmonary lobectomy. It analyzed 164 subjects, 81 in new robotic-assisted group and 82 in the VATS group. And all robotic-assisted lobectomies were performed with a da Vinci multiport platform. Notably, the health utility score was significantly higher in the da Vinci arm at seven weeks and 12 weeks post procedure, which suggests the quality of life for patients who underwent a da Vinci lobectomy was better than for patients undergoing the VATS procedure. Interestingly, and related to quality of life outcomes, the authors analyzed the incremental cost-effective ratio or ICER for the robotic group relative to VATS and reported the robotic group was associated with a gain of approximately $11,000 per quality adjusted life year. In addition, the median number of lymph nodes examined and sampled were significantly higher in the da Vinci Group. To summarize, the authors conclude that, early results from the RAVAL trials suggest that robotic pulmonary lobectomy is a cost-effective intervention, which is associated with comparable patient-reported health utility scores when compared to VATS lobectomy. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian who will discuss additional procedure highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2024. I think you are correct. I think in the short term, we will see patients who are considering or are in the pipeline for bariatric surgery going to try the drug. However, given compliance issues, costs, side effects, we expect that many of them will not stay on the drug for longer than a year or 2. And at that time, we'll consider bariatric surgery. So I think overall, we'll see an increased interest in bariatric surgery, but that will get delayed in the short term. Yes. So, we are hoping to submit everything in the foreseeable future. After that, as you know, there's at least a 90-day turnaround for the IDEs and then - excuse me, for the clearances. And then after that, we will have to put training together - and they'll see launches together. So I can't really give you a time line for when that would be, but we know what the work is that needs to be done, and we are starting and moving forward on that."

            "name": "Gary Guthart",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today. In this third quarter, we saw a strong growth in procedures performed by our customers, solid new system placements and healthy growth in utilization amid market conditions that remain largely consistent with Q2. Our new platforms continue to gain ground with Ion installs and procedure growth continuing, SP installs and procedure growth modestly accelerating and healthy growth in customer use of our digital tools. Turning first to procedures. da Vinci procedure growth in the quarter was 19%. Areas of strength included general surgery for benign conditions, particularly in the United States and broad regional growth with Germany, Japan, the U.K. and India standouts. China procedure growth was in line with our global average in the quarter. U.S. dermal surgery procedure growth was led by cholecystectomy and colon resection. Ion procedures showed continued strength with 125% growth in the quarter. SP procedure growth accelerated with 54% global growth in the quarter driven by strength in the United States. On the capital front, we placed 312 systems in Q3 compared with 305 systems in Q3 of last year. Our clinical installed base now stands 8,127 multiport da Vinci systems, 490 Ion systems and 158 single-port da Vinci systems. Overall, our capital placement trends reflect demand for additional capacity in multiport, continued greenfield interest in our Ion system and a modest acceleration for placements of SP. The proportion of leases for new capital placements accelerated in the quarter with the U.S. using the highest leasing rates. We think the acceleration in leasing reflects the convenience of our leasing program and the maturity of our Generation 4 multiport systems. While leasing reduces in-quarter revenue relative to capital purchase, total economics are healthy for our customer and for us. Leasing allows our customers to build clinical capacity when and where they need it and provides predefined pathways for our new technology as it enters the market. The growth rate in system utilization, defined as procedures per installed system per quarter was 6%, down from 9% last quarter while still above historical growth rates. Strong procedure growth and increased proportion of use in benign indications shortens average procedure times and needs of scheduling. Higher utilization increases our customers' return on invested capital and is economically healthy for us. Turning to our finances. Our revenue grew 12% in the quarter and our operating expenses were within our spend guidance. Our spending reflects continued investments in research and development to support the growth of our platforms and digital tools, expansion of our manufacturing and commercial footprints and capital amortization. Looking at the broader picture, our fourth-generation da Vinci platform is operating at global scale and embedded in a robust ecosystem of instruments, accessories, training and services. Customer acceptance of our Ion platform is strong. Acceptance of our da Vinci SP is accelerating with new indications in the pipeline, and our digital tools are building momentum through their early stages. We welcome Dr. Myriam Curet, Intuitive's Chief Medical Officer to this call, and she will take us through our clinical perspective and some of the work we're doing to expand indications. Our operations teams did a fantastic job supporting our customers through the supply chain shocks of the past several years. This unavoidable effort diverted resources away from product cost reduction and as supply chain stresses ease, we're now pivoting our attention to once again lowering our product costs. Areas of opportunity include our Ion program, our SP accessories portfolio and our multiport accessories in advanced instrument lines. Given the timing of facilities completion, manufacturing efficiency improvements for new products and other complex projects, we expect variability in gross margin over the coming quarters as we work through these programs. Turning to our digital offerings, customer use of our digital tools and channels is growing nicely. Our SimNow surgical simulators are installed at the majority of our customer sites and subscription renewal rates are outstanding. Routine use of My Intuitive app by over 10,000 da Vinci surgeons grew by 140% year-over-year and is receiving strong Net Promoter Scores that continue improving over time. Our Intuitive Hub media management and telepresence system installations grew 58% in the quarter, and Hub captured surgical cases grew 61%. In closing, core demand is healthy. We're focused on in our ecosystem internationally and driving our product cost down, particularly for our newer platforms. We are dogged in pursuit of significant long-term opportunity to improve the quadruple aim using our integrated ecosystem powered by analytics, and we are pacing our investments to catalyze that opportunity. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie, who will take you through our finances in greater detail. Thanks, Robbie. I'm going to ask Dr. Curet as a bariatric surgeon to go ahead and weigh in on that first part of your question, and we'll talk about the broader implications after that. Robbie, any follow-up you wanted on GLP-1s? Please. Yes. On the product side, we have real work to do on Ion. Ion is well accepted by the customer base, growing quickly. We need to iterate and drive manufacturability and manufacturing costs on Ion. So that was mainly what I was referring to. Some of the accessories in the SP line are real opportunities. We want to be assertive there. So on the product side, that's most of what the reference is. Let me just pick up two topics you hit. On the China side, I think the procedure demand side remains robust. I think there's some government policy activity that's putting a little bit of a chill in the market. Some of that is economics, so price caps and value-based pricing and some of it is in any corruption probe that is giving hospitals some pause moving forward with other new programs. We'll see. I think the China side is likely to -- some pressure on the China side is likely to persist for several quarters. On the bariatric side, I think we'll find a new normal in the next few quarters. It's hard to predict exactly when that will happen. We'll see that play out in the marketplace. Sure. I will turn to Jamie here on kind of utilization rates. So why don't you kick that off? Sure. Thank you for the question. On -- one way to think about it is that general surgery comprises both procedures that are done where cancer is the underlying cause and others that are benign indication. On the cancer as an underlying cause, we're seeing nice early growth in several OUS markets. So there, I think that's healthy, and we're enthused.

Yes. Jamie, you might speak to kind of what the size or percentage of that business is for us. A little bit of the acceleration or deceleration trend. Okay. On the first one, I think Myriam described it well. Our position on GLP-1s as it relates to bariatric surgery, I think she hit it well at the start of the call, no reason to reiterate it here. On the issue of potential impact beyond bariatrics, there may be some, although I think as you think through the analysis, I think it will be modest. And here's how we think about it. If you look at obesity and diabetes as risk factors in other domains and other diseases for which surgery is performed, they are sometimes positive correlated risk factors for that disease.

In most of the diseases that we treat as we look at it, it is not the dominant risk factor. So as we look out and think about what could it be like in our TAM, we can kind of do a back of the envelope analysis. It is really early. I don't think anybody knows the exact number. What I can say is that it's not the dominant risk factor in most things that we look at. And we have a very large unpenetrated TAM. I think we're still in the early innings of what we're trying to work on. So, if these drugs are highly effective at avoiding other types of diseases, we will cheer. I still think we have a lot of upside opportunity to pursue. Sure. Myriam, I think you're best to answer that. Our biggest steps are get the data arranged to get it into the FDA and work with them to get clearances. And then as Myriam says, we'll go through a staged commercialization. So you can expect submissions in the first half of '24 and then response thereafter. With regard to the capital side in China, I'll jump into that. I think demand for our systems and for the procedures they support in China, raw demand is really high. So it's really being limited or titrated by policy. I don't see - I haven't heard anything that says people want to go back and revisit or lower the quota, I think that would be resisted by customers who are looking for purchases. So, I think it's more around delay and a kind of a timing thing and how long it is hard to predict, but months, not weeks. On the pricing side, I'll speak to a general principle rather than projecting '24. What we try to do is a couple of things. One is be an outstanding manufacturer, really get high quality at low cost, and make sure that we can invest in manufacturing prowess to do that. I think that's really powerful for us, gives us enormous flexibility to meet the customers' needs, kind of where they are. With regard to pricing, we look at a couple of things, certainly price to us, cost to us, but also price elasticity, what the customer can do and achieve and that varies by market. And I think, we've become increasingly sensitive to and sophisticated at understanding pricing. So raw material pricing and core inflation to us is an input to our pricing. That's why we took price up this last year, but it's not the only thing, and you shouldn't expect us to be purely algorithmic tracking inflation on its own. Yes, it's a good question. I think the general tools that we use to get from six to 20 are kind of three buckets. Some of them are clearances in new markets. So making sure that a market we can address has access to the technologies that we already have. So when you think about something like Ion, for example, Ion is not yet available in all the markets in which we operate as it operates that it starts to open what we can do. That's kind of one bucket. New indications are another one that some of the work that Myriam described earlier. That starts to open a new opportunity for us as we broaden the applicability of our platforms to new types of surgery and intervention. The third bucket or another bucket is reimbursement. There are places where we think additional data, is required to get insurers to engage a little bit differently and open the market. And then lastly, there are new products and technologies that we're working on that we are not yet described, that we think - allow us to provide new solutions that are competitive in the marketplace. Each of those operates on a little bit different time line. So it's not - I can't give you a simple synopsis of how fast each one runs. Some of them take a lot of years, some reimbursement things or long lead. A product development can be long lead. Other types of access can happen more quickly. But that's a set of plans that we lay out. We're pretty disciplined about laying out, what we want to do over time over a multiyear time horizon. And that's how, we start to open that market. That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the Quadruple Aim. There are more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision the future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better, where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly, so patients can get back to what matters most."

            "content": "Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Core metrics continue to be healthy in Q3, with global procedure growth of 19% and an increase in the installed base of da Vinci systems of 13% and an increase in average system utilization of 6%. Our key financial indicators were also healthy. Third quarter recurring revenue grew 21%. Pro forma operating margin was 36%, and pro forma earnings per share increased 23% over last year. Procedures in the U.S. grew 17%, reflecting a lower benefit from patient backlogs as compared to the first half of 2023. Last quarter, we highlighted that our growth rate in bariatric's procedures in the U.S. had slowed given patient interest in weight loss drugs. In Q3, we continued to see double-digit growth albeit at a modestly lower growth rate as compared to Q2. Bariatric's procedures represent between 4% and 5% of total global procedures. Based on third-party data, we believe we continue to gain market share in the bariatric surgical segment. OUS procedures grew 24% with relative strength in India, Germany, the U.K. and Japan. Procedure growth in China was consistent with our expectations, lower than last quarter due to a strong base period given the recovery from COVID-related lockdowns in the year ago quarter. Consistent with recent trends, growth in non-neurology procedures outside of the United States was accretive, growing at approximately 31%. Within the larger cancer categories, our fastest-growing OUS procedure is colon resection, a high-value procedure led by adoption in Japan, Germany and the U.K. With respect to capital performance, we placed 312 systems in the third quarter as compared to 305 systems last year. As a reminder, system placements in Q3 of last year benefit from a delay in the shipment of approximately 15 systems from June into July as a result of supply chain challenges we encountered in June of last year. Late in Q3, we started to see delays in tender processes in China, primarily as a result of anticorruption efforts by the central government, resulting in lower system placements in China in Q3. We expect tender delays to continue to impact system placements in China in Q4. Q3 revenue was $1.7 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. Q3 revenue growth was driven by procedure growth, partially offset by an 11% decline in systems revenue due to the significant increase in the mix of operating lease arrangements. On a constant currency basis, third quarter revenue growth was also 12%. Given recent movements in exchange rates, at current rates, the U.S. dollar is approximately 3% stronger on a revenue-weighted basis as compared to the average rates realized in Q3. Revenue denominated in non-USD currencies represent approximately 24% of total revenue. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: in the U.S., we placed 159 systems in the third quarter compared to 175 systems placed last year. Outside the U.S., we placed 153 systems in Q3 compared with 130 systems last year. Current quarter system placements included 60 into Europe, 32 into Japan and 10 into China compared with 54 into Europe, 32 into Japan and 15 into China in Q3 of last year. 62 of the 312 systems placed in Q3 were trading transactions compared to 71 trading transactions in the third quarter of last year. As of the end of Q3, there are approximately 440 SIs remaining in the installed base, of which 85 are in the U.S. Operating leases represented 52% of third quarter placements compared with 37% last year. In the U.S., 70% of system placements in Q3 were under operating lease arrangements compared to 48% last year. Of the 163 operating lease placements in the quarter, 93 were usage-based arrangements, an increase compared to 54% last year, reflecting customer preferences, particularly in the U.S. While leasing may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time. Q3 system average selling prices were $1.4 million as compared to $1.39 million last quarter from $1.5 million last year. The year-over-year decrease in system ASPs was primarily driven by lower pricing and geographical mix. We recognized $17 million of lease buyout revenue in the third quarter compared with $12 million last quarter and $17 million in Q3 of 2022. da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure of approximately $1,830, compared with approximately $1,840 last quarter and $1,800 last year. On a sequential basis, lower I&A per procedure reflected the impact of customer ordering patterns, partially offset by a full quarter impact from the I&A price increase that went into effect halfway through last quarter. Turning to our Ion platform. In Q3, we placed 55 Ion systems as compared to 50 in Q3 of 2022. Third quarter Ion procedures of approximately 14,500 increased 125% as compared to last year. 16 of the systems placed in the third quarter were SP systems, 12 into the U.S. and four into Korea. SP procedures grew by 54%, and average system utilization growth continued to accelerate growing 21% compared to Q3 of last year. Moving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the third quarter was 68.8% compared with 68.5% last quarter and 69.8% last year. As a reminder, pro forma gross margin in Q3 of last year included a onetime benefit of approximately 50 basis points related to the favorable conclusion of certain indirect tax matters. The remaining year-over-year difference in pro forma gross margin is primarily due to a higher mix of the Ion revenue, which currently carries significantly lower margins as compared to the da Vinci business and lower system ASP, partially offset by the I&A price increase. Inventory increased to approximately 180 days in Q3, higher than historical averages, driven by two factors: first, we have modestly increased our inventory targets given supply chain stresses over the last couple of years; and secondly, given significant capital investments we are making in manufacturing facilities and capacity, we are building bridge inventory to facilitate an elevated number of line transfers to new locations. As a result, we expect higher levels of inventory relative to historical norms into 2025. Third quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher headcount-related costs. During the quarter, our head count increased by 489 employees, of which approximately 275 were for our manufacturing operations in support of revenue growth. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were lower by 100 basis points as compared to Q3 of last year and largely reflected planned leverage in our enabling functions. Pro forma other income in Q3 was $58 million compared to $42 million last quarter and $7 million last year. Other income primarily consists of interest income and the increase as compared to last quarter was driven by higher interest rates and higher average cash and investment balances. Pro forma other income in Q3 of last year also reflected higher than typical foreign exchange losses resulting from remeasurement of the balance sheet as a result of the strengthening U.S. dollar. Capital expenditures in Q3 were $256 million, primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities footprint and increase manufacturing capacity. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 22.5%, consistent with our expectations. Third quarter pro forma net income was $524 million or $1.46 per share compared with $429 million or $1.19 per share for Q3 of last year. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $416 million or $1.16 per share for the third quarter of 2023 compared with GAAP net income of $324 million or $0.90 per share for the third quarter of 2022. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.5 billion compared with $7.1 billion last quarter. The sequential increase in cash and investments reflected cash from operating activities and proceeds from employee stock exercises partially offset by capital expenditures. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Myriam, who will discuss clinical highlights. Yes. For Q4, you're not really seeing significant depreciation and expense reflected in the range that we provided. That's really more next year as some of the manufacturing capacity in facilities come online. What you're seeing in Q4 really is a little bit of FX given how the rates have moved, a little bit of slower progress in some of the line transfers and product cost reduction plans that we have, that's not a large delay. It's just slightly slower than we had planned. And then there's some mix dynamics reflected in Q4. They now to be relatively small, but those are the dynamics as to why gross margin range for the year is at the midpoint, slightly lower than what we had previously. With respect to how '24 is shaping up, what I would just say is, as Gary said in his prepared remarks, we'll see some variability in gross margin over the next several quarters is the depreciation expense and the ongoing efforts to improve our product costs, particularly on the Ion side. And frankly, there are some accumulated inefficiencies just in our global manufacturing operations. They built up over COVID and because of the supply chain issues that we encountered that we're addressing. And a number of those will take time for us to resolve. So I'd say let us give you '24 guidance for gross margin when we get to January because I think we still have to work through those plans. Just one other element. We are in-sourcing a high-volume accessory on the multiport side as part of in-sourcing that there's some differential automation in the line there. And so ramping that, there's some work to get that to be at our targets. Yes. There's two ways to look at it, Larry, what is the absolute utilization rate compared to a regular leasing compared to a purchase arrangement. They are very similar. Actually, the tightness on the mean between those three structures is very tight. Within those arrangements, you generally have a target procedure level that reflects success of the program for the customer and the economic objectives that we have. And if you accumulate again, the portfolio they run at slightly above the targeted procedure levels that we have embedded in the contracts. So they have run very well so far, and it's one of the reasons why we and the customer have expanded those so quickly in recent times. On a global basis, we expect the proportion of placements that are leased to continue to find. U.S. is pretty high, as you pointed out, Larry, 70% this quarter, 78% last quarter. There will be some larger IDNs that just routinely prefer to purchase just because of how that affects the metrics that are important to them. But even in the U.S., I think there's some room for that to continue to creep up a little bit, obviously, running out of room. We found a number of U.S. customers have really appreciate that as a way to manage through what are totally managed capital budgets. Yes. And I want to make sure I got it right, Matt. So come back to me if I have the wrong questions. But our total bariatric business represents about 4% to 5% of global procedures. What you saw in Q2 was in the U.S., which is where the majority of our bariatric procedure volumes are, in the U.S., the growth rate declined to about the U.S. average. And then what we saw in Q3 was it modestly decline a little further in Q3. Were those your questions? Well, if you take our procedure growth in bariatrics relative to market, we're taking share and have been for some time. So the fact that we had double-digit growth in Q3 relative to another company that had a decline, that's just a reflection in part of the fact that we are taking share in bariatrics and continue to do so, even though there's an impact to overall bariatric surgery, because of GLP-1s. So everything you described is correct. Generally, although there can be exceptions for mix effect, generally U.S. system ASPs when purchased are accretive to the global average. So in effect, as leasing has grown significantly in the U.S., that in and of itself has an adverse effect for calculated system ASP. The other thing that you see then with now a greater proportion of systems used to calculate that system ASP being international FX can have an effect. If you look on a two-year horizon. So for example, the exchange rate in Japan based on how the U.S. dollar has strengthened, there's a 30% to 40% impact over a two-year basis on system ASP in Japan as translated. So, there is a geographical effect. And if you look at a long enough horizon, there's an FX effect in what we described in Q3 was in terms of the year-over-year decline in ASP, also a dynamic relative to pricing. And that's really just as we expand our existing customers who are looking for a third, fourth, fifth system, those tend to be slightly lower ASPs than you've seen previously when they were greenfield accounts, I would say that in China, we do see some competitive dynamics with respect to pricing just given the number of lower local players. And so, there's been some competitive effect on system ASPs in China specifically. We don't really see that in other markets to this point. We have very well detailed plans for each of the areas that we're focused on. The teams have the capability and skill. It's going to take some time. I think the best way I would answer the question is we see a path of overtime probably in the midterm to get back above 70% gross margin."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host, Head of Investor Relations, Brian King. Please go ahead, sir. \nBrian King: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; and Jamie Samath, our CFO. \n Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 10, 2023 and Form 10-Q filed on April 20, 2023. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. \n Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. \n Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our second quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Jamie will provide a review of our financial results, then I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2023. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. And with that, I will turn it over to Gary. \nGary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. The fundamentals of our business were healthy in the second quarter with strong procedure and utilization growth and strong capital placements. Our product operations teams continue to build capacity and deliver in a dynamic supply chain environment as customers increasingly rely upon us for routine use. \n Our research and development efforts continued to build momentum in the quarter, including positive development milestones for our Intuitive ecosystem, including systems, instruments, accessories, digital tools and new indications. \n Turning first to procedures, growth in the quarter was 22%. Areas of strength included general surgery and gynecology for benign conditions, particularly in the United States. General surgery procedure growth was led by cholecystectomy and hernia repair. Colon and rectal procedure growth was healthy. Global procedure growth was also strong in the quarter, led by a recovery in China and continued strength in Japan, Germany and the U.K. \n Ion procedures showed continued strength with 145% growth in Q2 of '23. SP procedure growth was accretive with 40% global growth in the quarter, driven by accelerating growth in the United States. \n On the capital front, we placed 331 systems in Q2 compared with 279 systems in Q2 of last year. Our clinical installed base now stands at 7,900 multiport da Vinci systems, 435 Ion systems and 142 single-port da Vinci systems. Overall, our capital placement trends reflected demand for additional capacity in multiport, strong interest in our Ion system and stable demand for SP as we build our SP indications. \n System utilization defined as procedures per installed clinical system per quarter grew 9% globally year-over-year, reaching a new high as customers adopt a broad mix of procedures on our systems. We believe real-world evidence of improvements across the quadruple aim from better patient outcomes to surgeon satisfaction and lower total cost to treat per patient episode underpin this increasing utilization. \n Turning to our finances. Our revenue grew 15% in the quarter. Our capital and operating expenses were within our spend guidance, reflecting continued investments in R&D to support growth of our platforms and digital tools, expansion of our manufacturing and commercial footprints and capital amortization. We will continue investing in R&D, manufacturing and commercial operations to serve our global markets at industrial scale. These investments are likely to be lumpy over the next couple of years as significant operations expansions and other projects complete. \n Taking a step back, we have found that the quadruple aim is the right north star for us, focusing on demonstrable improvements to outcomes across specific procedures and patient populations, increasing patient and care team satisfaction and lowering the total cost to treat per patient episode. \n As electronic medical records have been adopted, we have partnered with our customers to analyze this data, building real-world evidence and big data approaches to measure quadruple aim improvements within countries, regions and health systems. Paired with our ecosystem investments in training services and products and powered by digital tools that can generate actionable intelligence from surgical data, we can help our customers analyze their programs, recommend and support actions to improve performance and lower total costs. This integrated business system is catalyzing our customers' goal of strong MIS programs by servicing actionable and measurable steps. \n Our approach is scalable for us too, working for our da Vinci platforms and for Ion and opening the door to future opportunities. \n Turning to our ecosystem investments. We're making solid progress extending our offerings to new clinical domains and new regions. For da Vinci multiport, we recently obtained NMPA registration for Xi local production in China. This means our da Vinci Xi will be able to compete for the locally sourced tender subset of the recently released updated national quota. \n Our da Vinci SP team achieved several milestones recently. We completed patient enrollment for our colorectal and Thoracic IDE trials, continued our first phase of launch of SP in Japan and submitted our CE mark dossier for SP in Europe. \n Turning to Ion. Our team installed their first Ion system in the U.K. and initiated first cases. For our digital tools, we have initiated our Phase I launch of CASE Insights, our name for our computational observer. CASE Insights is a tool that works with the da Vinci system and hospital data to build AI models that find correlations between surgical technique, patient populations and surgical outcomes. Our first phase of launch builds on work over the past few years with our clinical research partners to refine objective performance indicators and link them to actionable changes to improve outcomes, shortened training times and improve surgical program efficiency. \n We think these computational tools can make a significant impact using real-world and real-time data to improve skills and outcomes and to inform future product and automation opportunities. That said, features can be built quickly but long-term validation is arduous. We're a science-driven organization and will work through validation pathways in pursuit of long-term success. We do not expect material revenue from CASE insights for the next several quarters. \n In closing, our core business has momentum. We see a significant long-term opportunity to improve the quadruple aim using our integrated ecosystem powered by analytics and we are pacing our investments to catalyze that opportunity. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie, who will take you through our finances in greater detail. \nJamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. \n Global procedure growth in Q2 of 22% and reflected U.S. procedure growth of 19% and 28% procedure growth outside of the U.S. Procedures in Q2 benefited from higher patient admissions as hospitals, particularly in the U.S. catch up with patients whose diagnosis and/or treatment was delayed during the pandemic. \n Consistent with our comments last quarter, our contributions to procedure growth from surgeons new to the da Vinci platform was strong, reflecting both the strength of our training capabilities and an increasing number of graduates of residency and fellowship programs who are trained on da Vinci. Within one of our target procedure areas, bariatric surgery, our growth rate in the U.S. slowed during the quarter. Some customers have indicated that they are seeing increased patient interest in weight loss drugs. It is too early to conclude if the slowing growth is a temporary pause as patients evaluate these new drug therapies or if it's a trend that continues. \n We believe that during the quarter, da Vinci continued to gain market share in the bariatric surgical market. Our U.S. procedure growth of 28% reflected strength in China, the U.K., Germany and Japan. Strong procedure growth in China was driven by a continued recovery from more recent COVID-related impacts and a favorable comparison to Q2 last year, which was also impacted by the pandemic. \n Consistent with our comments last quarter, growth in non-neurology procedures outside of the United States was accretive, growing at approximately 35% driven by increases in colorectal, hysterectomy and thoracic procedures. \n Turning to other key metrics. In Q2, the installed base of da Vinci Systems grew 13% to just over 8,000 systems driven primarily by demand for additional capacity given procedure growth. Average system utilization grew almost 9% year-over-year reflecting an increasing mix of short duration benign procedures in the U.S. and customers prioritizing use of their existing assets given the financial pressures they face. \n With respect to capital performance, we placed 331 systems in the second quarter ahead of our expectations. Capital strength in the quarter included a higher number of placements to our distributors and a higher number of multi-system deals in the U.S. relative to recent trends, reflecting in part, certain placements accelerated into Q2 from future quarters. \n Despite Q2 system placements being ahead of our expectations, customers, particularly in the U.S. appear to be cautious in their capital spending given ongoing financial pressures. We placed 279 systems in Q2 of last year, which, as a reminder, reflected a delay in the shipment of approximately 15 systems from June into July as a result of supply chain challenges we encountered during the quarter. \n Q2 revenue was $1.8 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, second quarter revenue grew approximately 17%. Recurring revenue represented 85% of total revenue as compared to 72% for the full year 2019 and grew 20% over last year, driven by procedure growth and an increase in the installed base of systems under operating lease arrangements. \n Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: in the U.S., we placed 157 systems in the second quarter compared to 150 systems placed last year. Outside the U.S., we placed 174 systems in Q2 compared with 129 systems last year. Current quarter system placements included 76 into Europe, 33 into Japan and 16 into China compared with 78 into Europe, 18 into Japan and 15 into China in Q2 of last year. \n During the quarter, the China National Health Commission published the 14th 5-year quota of 559 robotic systems. For those systems awarded to our JV under the new quota, we expect a significant majority to be placed in 2024 through 2027. We are seeing increasing participation of local competitors in tender processes under the national quota. In addition, during 2023, we have experienced pricing pressure in China as a result of provincial government policy changes and competition. These dynamics create greater variability in the outlook for our procedure, system placement and revenue performance in China. \n In Q2, 60 of the 331 systems placed were trading transactions compared to 56 trading transactions in the second quarter of last year. As of the end of Q2, there are approximately 500 SIs remaining in the installed base, of which 97 are in the U.S. \n Leasing represented 50% of Q2 placements compared with 42% for both last quarter and last year. In the U.S., 78% of system placements in Q2 were under operating lease arrangements compared to 59% last quarter. The higher rate of operating leases in the U.S. is primarily driven by an increasing customer preference for our usage-based leasing models in part due to capital budget constraints and continuing financial pressures faced by many of our customers. \n In addition, some customers are choosing leasing structures to preserve flexibility to upgrade to next-generation technology. As a result of these dynamics and the earlier stage of our leasing program with OUS customers, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time. \n Q2 system average selling prices were $1.39 million as compared to $1.47 million last quarter. The sequential decrease in system SPs was primarily driven by a higher mix of X placements for purchase deals and geographical mix. We recognized $12 million of lease buyout revenue in the second quarter compared with $24 million last quarter and $23 million in Q2 of 2022. Da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,840 compared with approximately $1,780 last quarter and $1,900 last year. \n On a sequential basis, higher [ INA ] per procedure was driven primarily by the [ INA ] price increase we described last quarter and customer ordering patterns. \n Turning to our Ion platform. In Q2, we placed 59 Ion systems as compared to 41 in Q2 of 2022. Second quarter Ion procedures of approximately 12,700 increased 145% as compared to last year. During the quarter, we placed our first Ion system in the U.K. market and in this early phase of our European launch, we are focused on the collection of clinical data in support of our reimbursement strategy. 12 of the systems placed in the second quarter were SP systems, compared to 10 systems last quarter. SP procedures grew by 40% and average system utilization growth accelerated from last quarter's 12%, increasing by 14% compared to Q2 of last year. \n Moving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the second quarter was 68.5% compared with 67.2% last quarter and 69.2% last year. Pro forma gross margin was lower than last year, primarily due to a higher mix of Ion revenue which currently carries significantly lower margins as compared to the da Vinci business and lower system SP. \n As we described last quarter, improving product costs and manufacturing efficiency is a priority for our teams over the medium term. Second quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 12% year-over-year, driven primarily by increased headcount added throughout last year, higher variable compensation, increased prototype expenses and increased expenses associated with customer training in support of procedure growth. \n Pro forma operating expenses represented 33% of revenue in Q2 compared to 35% of revenue for the full year 2022, reflecting in part planned leverage in our enabling functions. \n Capital expenditures in Q2 were $178 million, primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities footprint and increase manufacturing capacity. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22.3%, consistent with our expectations. Second quarter pro forma net income was $507 million or $1.42 per share compared with $415 million or $1.14 per share for Q2 of last year. \n I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $421 million or $1.18 per share for the second quarter of 2023 compared with GAAP net income of $308 million or $0.85 per share for the second quarter of 2022. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and gains and losses on strategic investments. \n We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.1 billion compared with $6.6 billion last quarter. The sequential increase in cash and investments reflected cash from operating activities, proceeds from employee stock exercises partially offset by capital expenditures. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian, who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2023. \nBrian King: Thank you, Jamie. Our overall second quarter procedure growth was 22% year-over-year compared to 14% for the second quarter of 2022 and 26% last quarter. In the U.S., second quarter 2023 procedure growth was 19% year-over-year compared to 11% for the second quarter of 2022 and 26% last quarter. \n Q2 growth continued to be driven by strong growth in procedures within general surgery, with particular strength in cholecystectomy and hernia repair. Bariatrics growth was healthy in the quarter but as noted earlier, growth was lower than in prior periods. Outside of the U.S., second quarter procedure volume grew 28% compared with 22% for the second quarter of 2022 and 28% last quarter. Second quarter 2023 OUS procedure growth was driven by continued growth in general surgery, primarily from strong growth in colorectal procedures, followed by growth in thoracic procedures. \n Growth in urology continued to be healthy, led by kidney procedures, along with continued double-digit growth in prostatectomy. In Europe, we experienced strong growth in the U.K., Germany and Spain. In all the regions noted, procedure growth was driven by colorectal and hysterectomy procedures. \n In Asia, growth was led by China, where we saw a continuing recovery in procedures that were impacted by COVID and benefiting from a favorable comparison to procedure volume that was impacted in the same quarter a year ago. \n Procedure growth was led by strong growth in urology, namely prostatectomy and kidney procedures. In Japan, growth was led by general surgery with the largest procedure contributions coming from colorectal and gastrectomy procedures. While still at earlier stages of adoption, India and Taiwan, both demonstrated strong growth in gynecology and general surgery procedures. \n Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. \n This past May, [ Dr. Zhang ] from the second affiliated hospital of [ Chongqing ] University in China, published a systematic review in meta-analysis comparing outcomes of robotic right colectomy procedures with outcomes associated with laparoscopic right colectomy. Published in techniques in Coloproctology, this meta analysis evaluated a total of 15,241 patients across 42 studies with over 2,700 subjects in the robotic right colectomy group and over 12,000 subjects in the laparoscopic group and included outcomes associated with the entire population as well as outcomes for both intracorporeal and extracorporeal anastomosis. \n Looking at the population overall, the authors reported among other outcomes, an approximately half day shorter length of hospital stay, 51% lower risk of conversion to laparotomy and a 12% lower risk of complications with a robotic approach. Notably, in the subgroup specifically comparing outcomes for procedures within Intracorporeal anastomosis. The robotic right colectomy group was associated with a shorter length of hospital stay by approximately 16 hours and a 65% lower risk of conversion to laparotomy. Within the extracorporeal anastomosis subgroup, the robotic-assisted approach was associated with a 40% lower risk of overall complications. \n The authors concluded in part that, \"The safety and efficacy of robotic right colectomy is superior to laparoscopic right colectomy, especially when an Intracorporeal anastomosis has performed\". \n Turning to a clinical study reporting outcomes for robotic-assisted and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, [ Dr. Murai ] from Danbury Hospital in Connecticut, published outcomes comparing lobectomies performed with either approach using the National Cancer database. This study focused on patients with complex etiology, such as non-small cell lung cancer who have received neoadjuvant therapy at [ N1.2 ] disease or had a tumor greater than 5 centimeters and compared 9,500 subjects with over 2,100 in the robotic arm and over 7,000 in the [ bats ] arm. \n Notably, when analyzing rates of conversions to open, the authors reported a 7.7% lower rate of conversion to open in the robotic arm with an approximately 2x higher risk of conversion associated with the [ bats ] group. The authors concluded, \"In summary, our analysis of the National Cancer Database suggests that robotic lobectomy for complex lung resections achieved similar perioperative outcomes and [ R0 ] resections [indiscernible] lobectomy with the exception of a lower rate of conversion to thoracotomy\". \n I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2023. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecasted full year 2023 procedure growth within a range of 18% to 21%. We are now increasing our forecast and expect full year 2023 procedure growth of 20% to 22%. The low end of the range reflects uncertainty around the duration of elevated procedure volumes with patients returning to healthcare, continued slowing of bariatric growth rates in the U.S. and macroeconomic challenges that could impact hospitals and patient spending. At the high end of the range, we assume macroeconomic challenges do not have a significant impact on hospital procedure volumes, and bariatric growth rates in the U.S. continue at the rate we saw in Q2. The range does not reflect significant material supply chain disruptions or hospital capacity constraints. \n Turning to gross profit. We continue to expect our 2023 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 68% and 69%. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions. \n With respect to operating expenses. On our last call, we forecast pro forma operating expense growth to be between 11% and 15%. We are adjusting our estimate and now expect our full year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 12% and 15%. We are also updating our estimate for noncash stock compensation expense to range $600 million to $620 million in 2023, narrowing the range from our previous estimate of $600 million to $630 million. \n We are increasing our estimate for other income which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $160 million and $180 million in 2023, an increase from our previous estimate of $140 million and $160 million. The increase primarily reflects the rise in interest rates. With regard to capital expenditures, we continue to estimate a range of $800 million to $1 billion, primarily for planned facility construction activities. \n With regard to income tax, we continue to estimate our 2023 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pretax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We go through the first question from the line of Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo. \nLarry Biegelsen: Gary, just two for me. One big picture question on AI and second, on procedure growth. So AI is obviously having its moment in the sun here, Gary. I'm curious, where is Intuitive spending time in applying AI? Is it imaging, movement of the robot, training? I'd love to hear your thoughts, and then I have one follow-up. \nGary Guthart: Yes. Well, I'll start on AI. Let's talk about what it is. For us, it's a suite of digital tools that rests on a baseline and then can be built upon using various machine learning techniques including computer vision. We've been at it for some time. We started the Internet-of-Things for surgical robots over a decade ago. We built the baseline of cyber secure privacy-compliant pipes that allow us to get access to the data. So there's some foundational work that was important. That's kind of step 1. \n Step 2 is to collaborate with customers and aggregate data that is meaningful. AI is only as good as the quality of the data that you feed it. And so for us, that has been robot data, some other data in electronic medical record data in partnership with our customer base. We've been doing that for several years now. From that, I think you can start to do analytic inspections. You can do analysis on the data, look for correlations. Sometimes it's pretty simple math. That gets you big data explorations, some simple things that we can do to help our customers become more efficient and to expose variation. \n Over time, you can invest further in things like computer vision, which we have been doing and into predictive analytics, the idea that you can look at surgical data science, understand the variation of patient populations and what's happening in surgery and start to create tools, digital tools that can help improve outcomes or speed learning curves or lower operating costs and we're going to work on all of those things. \n So of the things you mentioned, we have our toe in the water in many, and we've had for some time. As I said in the script, the feature content can be moved pretty quickly. I think the validations take real time to do well, particularly outcome-based or interventional validations. And so we're going to go through and do that with real rigor. So I expect us to continue down that pathway. \nLarry Biegelsen: That's very helpful. And then on procedures, I'm just wondering, you talked about some catch-up in Q2. How are you thinking about how much of the backlog of deferred procedures is still left? You talked about the diagnostic procedures on the last call. And any color on what you're assuming for bariatrics here for the rest of the year? And does that mean international will continue to be stronger than the U.S.? \nGary Guthart: Let me talk a little bit about, I think, the patient population that moved to the sidelines during the pandemic, and then I'll turn the assessment over to Jamie. On the kind of the pandemic response, it's hard to exactly estimate how many folks would have been in diagnostic pipelines that did not get their tests. We do look at the data that's available to do that. I don't think it will clear in just one quarter. I think our past experience on these things is that lower utilization happened over a several year period, and it will probably take many quarters for it to fully recover. How long that is, I think it's very, very hard to estimate. So far, so good. \n You asked a question about bariatrics, I'm going to turn that over to Jamie. He spoke about it a little bit in his prepared remarks. \nJamie Samath: Yes. What we saw in Q2 was that growth rate slowed. We have some input from customers that the level of patient interest is such that patients are now considering drugs versus surgery. It's unclear yet based on that set of inputs from customers the duration of that evaluation by parents and patients and obviously, it's layered. So what we did for our guidance was we just said at the high end for the remainder of the year, the bariatrics growth rate in the U.S. is consistent with what we saw in Q2. And at the low end, we said that the growth rate continues to slow a little bit over the course of the year as patients become increasingly educated about the weight loss drugs. And obviously, there's a number of factors that patients have to consider with respect to those drugs, cost, side effects, what happens if they come off the drugs and regain weight, et cetera. But I think from our perspective, we're early in understanding what the longer-term impact will be. \n Customers have said that they have confidence that there is a role for surgery in weight loss and that will endure over kind of the longer term. What happens in for the rest of the year, I think we'll see. \nOperator: We'll go to the next question. Go to the line of Travis Steed, Bank of America. \nTravis Steed: I did want to ask about China and the China quota and how you think the opportunity is now that there's more local players, but you also have the local version of Xi and on the bariatrics, just a quick follow-up on that, too. Is that around 100,000 procedures. Just trying to think about sizing that their active surgery opportunity or impact? \nJamie Samath: We've set the market size in the U.S. is about 200,000 procedures annually for what we think is a good mesh for robotics. And in terms of where we are in penetration, we're kind of at the -- if I put it in quartiles, we're at the beginning of the second quartile. What was your first question, Travis? \nTravis Steed: It was on China and the China quota and how to think about that opportunity there versus last quarter, given there's more local players, but now you have the local version of Xi. \nJamie Samath: Yes. I mean, obviously, there's increased opportunity in the sense that this quota is 559 systems relative to the prior quota of 225 systems, but you also have now 5 local players. There will be government interest in success of local players. We do believe the surgeons care about capability and feature set and so the extent to which da Vinci continues to be differentiated, I think, is to our advantage. \n In the -- and we are seeing those local players increasingly participate in tenders with respect to how that quota will be allocated. So it gets allocated from the central government to the provinces and then it goes through tender processes. So there is some time before that results in placements and that's why we said in our prepared remarks, we think the bulk of the subset of that quota, our JV wins will be in '24 through '27. \n I also described some dynamics that create greater variability with respect to pricing pressure and increasing competition. So I think for us, that's something that we're going to watch carefully over the next year or so. \nTravis Steed: Great. And a question for Gary. Just I heard the comment on hospitals leasing more to preserve the upgrade option for the next-gen system. So maybe just talk high level, the pipeline comments on the FDA and kind of supply chain bottlenecks that you saw last year? And then and how you're thinking about incremental upgrade to the Gen 4 versus kind of new platforms? \nGary Guthart: Sure. On the supply chain health side, we are seeing fewer pockets of challenge, but some pockets nonetheless. So there's been significant focus and attention to make sure that we're supplying our customers what they need as we go through a pretty nice procedure growth curve. So they're calling out improvement in the breadth of supply chain challenge, but cautioning that there are still some pockets that need attention or require attention. \n We continue to work on multiple things. As you know, we're working on next generations of our platforms, in general, that is a routine activity for us. How we make the decision between upgrading a current generation versus moving it to the next generation really is around customer value of that switch and the convenience and economics of doing an upgrade versus a platform changeover. And we expect to do some of both. We are usually working on the next two generations because of the time it takes to develop a platform, not just the next one, but the next one after that. And current time is really no different. \n We're pleased with the performance of our engineering teams and prosecuting those upgrades and technologies. What I will say is prioritization wise, what we care about is can we improve patient outcomes in a real way or open a new population of patients to the benefits of [indiscernible] surgery. So we look at that. We look to improve the surgeon and care team experience, whether that's in their ergonomics or their workflow and the like with which they perceive our systems. We work to improve efficiencies of overall programs. We'll work on things that make hospital programs more efficient and we work to lower the total cost to treat per patient episode. \n And when we find feature sets and technologies that do that, then we get pretty excited about them and drive them hard. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Robbie Marcus, JPMorgan. \nRobert Marcus: Congrats on a really nice quarter. I heard the comment on prototype expenses are increasing. So I figure I'll try my luck here, and I know you're not going to tell us when a next-gen or if the next-gen system is coming. But I want to ask around just implications if and when one does, you have a lot of leases now. Do they have the option to upgrade? And will that come through at higher revenues? And how do we think about the prototyping expense and really what that's for? \nJamie Samath: Yes, I'm not going to be specific on the prototype expense and it's distributed across a number of programs. Prototype expenses tend to be lumpy within Q2 relative to the comparison point. It just so happened to be a quarter where that was one of the direct drivers of our expenditure. Nothing more than that, I would say. \n As we've grown the proportion of the installed basis under leases, I think it's about 2,000 systems now that are under lease in the installed base. Generally, they have a technology obsolescence clause. That's kind of in part a reflection of customer feedback from when we launched Xi. So that's routinely in our operating lease arrangements and that cause generally gives customers the opportunity to change that existing lease to the lease of any new next-generation technology. And that is not a specified price, by the way, that's to be negotiated. So I wouldn't say anything more about price. \nRobert Marcus: Great. And maybe, Jamie, one more for you on the financial side. Another nice quarter of cash flow generation, north of $7 billion on the balance sheet. Interest rates, high inflation, high as well. How are you thinking about maximizing the cash here? And how should we think about the priorities? \nJamie Samath: With respect to capital allocation, I think our priorities are consistent for how they've been for some time now. Our first priority is to invest in the business, both in capital expenditures, which as you've seen by our guidance are relatively high to our history this year and in organically investing in operating expenses. \n Second is to acquire technology externally that gives us a differentiated capability or accelerate us in the marketplace. That's generally license arrangements, IP acquisition or tuck-in acquisitions. And we continue to look at returning cash to shareholders opportunistically. And I think that's served us well. If you look at kind of the last 18 months, we repurchased 12.6 million shares for $3 billion at an average price of $234 and we did that opportunistically in large part because it reflects kind of the stage of the company. We're relatively early in the robotics space where we look for growth, and I think that's served us well. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Rick Wise, Stifel. \nFrederick Wise: Gary, I recently visited several European hospitals and robotic programs. And frankly, and honestly came way more impressed than ever with Intuitive's European commercial presence reputation. But I was particularly intrigued to hear one particularly high-volume robotic surgeon talk about what's next. And it seemed less focused on systems and very much focused on enabling technologies that make everything better, faster, clearer, et cetera. And they included things like integrated CT image overlays during procedures. That aspect of augmented reality tools that bring CT and surgery together, next generation firefly. He was dreaming of virtual [ rulers ], dual [ SureForm ] 45 and 60 staplers and haptic feedback. I mean that was -- it was fascinating to hear. Are these the kinds of innovations that are priorities for you? And are these the kind of things you want to make docs like that excited about? Is that what you're -- the kind of stuff you're working on? \nGary Guthart: You had a long list. I think several of those are important and things that we have talked about and have shared with the world. I think the idea of higher confidence ability to identify tissue in real time for the surgeon, and we can do that in a few different ways. So the florescence imaging, that you described and other advanced imaging technologies that give surgeons the ability to see beyond the surface of the tissue and beyond what you can see with normal white-light imaging, we absolutely think that's helping clinical outcomes and we're excited about and investing in image fusion or data fusion, and that's the CT overlay, the segmentation of preoperative MR and CT scans and the ability to use that in real time during the case, we think, can change outcomes and change efficiency in the OR. \n Other types of analytic and sensing capabilities, we think are really powerful and important. And to the earlier question about AI, machine learning, machine vision, these things work together. So high-definition images that show you things beyond the surface of the tissue plus computer vision, plus AI models can give you some predictive analytics that I think are really powerful and would help surgeons get to better outcomes, reduce complications. So I am like that surgeon, quite excited. \nFrederick Wise: Great. Just a follow-up, quick follow-up. You -- I think, if I remember correctly, took a 5% across-the-board price hike on instrumentation. I don't know if I'm remembering correctly, that was to kick in like June 1. Did that happen? Did it help the quarter? And should I assume that it's going to be a little bit of an offset or a little bit of an instrument tailwind in the second half and beyond? \nJamie Samath: It was largely implemented in Q2, Rick. It wasn't effective at the beginning of the quarter, I'd say, roughly half of the quarter benefited from the price increase. Our estimate for the impact of the price increase is consistent with what we said last quarter, roughly about $100 million impact to revenue and profit for the year. Again, you get kind of half an impact in Q2 and the full impact in Q3 and Q4. \nGary Guthart: A reminder, our motivations on that, we've been quite conservative on pricing. Our input pricing in the last few years has gone up in terms of raw material and labor content. We have offset most of that through efficiency and scale advantages, but we felt like it was time to share some of that with our customers, and that was what was behind the price increase. \nOperator: We go to the next line. I have Richard of Truist Security. \nRichard Newitter: Richard Newitter here. Jamie, maybe for you on the guidance, 20% to 22%, very healthy. I'm just curious on thinking about the low end of the range there. You specifically mentioned you contemplate bariatric surgery growth trends, eroding a little bit from the 2Q levels. What's the pace of erosion there that you're thinking about that would get you to the low end? Like how much erosion, how did you establish a baseline for yourself? \nJamie Samath: Yes, I don't want to get too specific there, Rick, given just the relative size of bariatrics in the U.S. to our overall procedures. We can obviously see the progression between Q1 and Q2, I'd call it a moderate, steady progression in the model in Q3 and Q4. The overall impact on that is obviously a function of the size of the bariatrics business for us. It's not some dramatic falloff. \nRichard Newitter: Okay. That's helpful. And just maybe sticking on the same topic here on bariatrics. Just thinking about the areas that you could offset that as we think of procedure categories geographically or by category that could be nearing an inflection point like Bariatric got to several years ago, what procedure categories or geographies would you call out that you think could lead to overage there to offset any potential incremental slowdown in bariatrics, if any? \nJamie Samath: I'm not going to answer that in terms of overage, but I'll say where we're seeing healthy growth. If you take our largest 7 markets, which is a focus for us, so China, Japan, South Korea, Germany, France, U.K. and Italy, what you're seeing in those markets is generally a progression beyond urology into the next set of cancer procedures. It's market by market. But generally, that's hysterectomy, thoracic and colorectal procedures. And we're seeing them on the early stages of an adoption curve, and that's why we've talked about our OUS business now is about half outside of urology or beyond urology. This quarter, it grew 35% that subset. That's consistent with what we saw in Q1. That subset also grew 35%. So I think we're excited in those larger markets where we have that focus and continue to drive the adoption curve in that next set of procedures. \n If you look at market by market, you have some unique dynamics in China. You see liver and pancreas procedure doing well in Japan, treatment of stomach cancer in Korea, for example, you see thyroid. But it's really that next step procedures. \nGary Guthart: Just I want to just step back a little bit on bariatrics, we've had a few questions on it and just make a point. As we go out and talk to surgeons, we talk to obesity physicians and pharmacologists, which we do in terms of our diligence. The sense here is that the market is going to adjust to the change in treatment pathway as it relates to drugs. However, it doesn't look like the drugs are a cure and may not be a fast path to cure and a strong consensus among those we speak to, including people who are not surgeons, physicians who are not surgeons is that the surgery and other interventions are going to remain an important part of the interaction. \n As the -- in the near term, I think the market will adjust to understand what role the drugs will play but they're not cures and the discontinued rate remains pretty high, and the populations of patients who don't get any benefit from the drugs also remain significant. So I think there's an adjustment period here and we should be aware of it. But that may become a tailwind in future quarters as folks work through those sets of pathways and look at long-term and durable solutions into the obesity challenges. \nOperator: We'll go to the next line of Ryan Zimmerman, BTIG. \nRyan Zimmerman: Maybe one for Jamie. On the expense management standpoint, I mean, procedures are going up a little bit faster than expense -- OpEx guidance by about 50 basis points or so in and so I'm just wondering, Jamie, kind of what your views are on expense management and letting some of that leverage flow through as we think about not just the back half of the year, but into '24 versus maybe reinvesting that in R&D? \nJamie Samath: Yes. For this year, we have specific objectives with respect to leverage in our enabling functions, which we've described previously. And that's a set of objectives that I think we intend to fulfill. \n Largely, what you see in the adjustments we've made to our operating expense guidance for this year is a function of our top line performance, both in variable compensation and in the number of reps we need in the field to support a higher procedure base. For the rest of kind of operating expense set of investments, we're holding to -- we're largely holding to our plan for this year. \n When you project into '24, I'm not going to kind of describe the direction of where spend will go relative to procedural revenue, we'll do that in January. But you have a couple of dynamics. We have a significant CapEx investments this year, $800 million to $1 billion, that will start to create incremental depreciation expense next year. A chunk of that will be in COGS and a chunk of that will be in operating expenses. So you have kind of an operating expense headwind coming there. And those investments being largely facilities, they are planned for the medium term, meaning they're inefficient for a period until you get to full occupancy or full utilization. \n On the other side, we'll continue to look to leverage our enabling functions into '24, where that shakes out, we'll do in January because we have to complete our planning process in the back half of this year. \nRyan Zimmerman: Okay. That's very helpful. And then I noticed, and this is kind of directed at Gary, you commented on this a little earlier, but you disclosed for the first time, I believe the proportion of lease agreements that are usage-based versus fixed operating lease agreement. And I'm wondering, Gary, what that says and the trends that we see there about the health of our customers and what their preference is over time? \nGary Guthart: Yes, it's a good question. I think we see that one size doesn't fit all. There are some folks for whom they still remain happy about capital purchases. They see it as the cheapest way for them to access systems. They have high confidence and they're going to buy. There are some folks for whom capital is tight, scarce and or they're interested in future technology protection clauses, and they would rather lease. And there are some folks who are looking at expansions, are a little bit unsure about how fast volume might ramp and for them, usage-based arrangements give them some protections about ramp timing and speed. \n Our analytical capabilities are pretty good, and our finance flexibility is pretty good. And as a result, we'll have that conversation pretty direct way, and I think the market starts to settle where it settles. If you ask, do we have a strong preference for one of those models, the answer is not really. \nJamie Samath: The motivation by the way, for the new disclosure was simply the rate at which those adoption of those models have grown, we felt, okay it was important to be transparent as to what portion of operating leases and placements that structure was. If you kind of assess all of our usage-based arrangements in aggregate life today relative to usage patterns and economic objectives in total, on average, they're slightly above our expectations. So they performed well so far. That's obviously a blend across different customers and systems. Some are overperforming, some are underperforming. But I think part of the way that we've operated the program is to look carefully. Is it actually reducing barriers for accelerated growth of our customers? And is it producing the economic results for us and our customers and as we and customers have gained confidence, that's part of the reason why it's expanded the way it has. \nOperator: And we'll go to the next line. Go to the line of Andrew Ranieri, Morgan Stanley. \nAndrew Ranieri: Maybe just one other follow-up question on bariatrics, but maybe a different angle. I mean, we've talked to some general surgeons too, that mean they're kind of suggesting that these new drugs might even open up potential procedure categories where these patients might not have been suited to have surgery. Gary, kind of like what are your views on this? Do you see some near-term disruption from GLP-1s on the bariatric side but maybe this opening doors for other procedure categories? \nGary Guthart: Yes. That's a little bit of the narrative we're hearing too. We go out and canvas our customers pretty widely. There may be a role for kind of new adjuvant use of drugs and then as you say, that may condition some patient populations to be beneficiaries of surgery downstream. There may be folks who start the drugs, get the benefits that they were hoping for, but either the side effects or the cost or the change lifestyle that the drugs are implying, make it hard to sustain. There's a fair amount of that in the literature. So that may -- that population may look for other solutions. \n I think we're just going to have to work through it and see. What we don't see yet is a magic pill, one that cures it and doesn't require behavior change or other lifestyle modification and that -- and it seems unlikely. And as a result, I think we're going to see an adjustment, how long that adjustment period lasts, none of us know. But we know that there will be a role for surgical and mechanical intervention after the fact. And I think we're well positioned. And as Jamie had mentioned, it looks like even in the current environment, the share continues to move our way. So we're going to stay close to it. \nAndrew Ranieri: Is there any procedure categories that are coming up in your conversations that stand the most benefit? \nGary Guthart: It's a good question. We're probing probably too soon for us to give you a definitive answer. \n Right. That was our last question, and thank you. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim. Better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams and, ultimately, a lower total cost to treat. \n We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that's less invasive and profoundly better where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly so patients can get back to what matters most. \n Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in 3 months. \nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

            "name": "Gary Guthart",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today. The fundamentals of our business were healthy in the second quarter with strong procedure and utilization growth and strong capital placements. Our product operations teams continue to build capacity and deliver in a dynamic supply chain environment as customers increasingly rely upon us for routine use. \n Our research and development efforts continued to build momentum in the quarter, including positive development milestones for our Intuitive ecosystem, including systems, instruments, accessories, digital tools and new indications. \n Turning first to procedures, growth in the quarter was 22%. Areas of strength included general surgery and gynecology for benign conditions, particularly in the United States. General surgery procedure growth was led by cholecystectomy and hernia repair. Colon and rectal procedure growth was healthy. Global procedure growth was also strong in the quarter, led by a recovery in China and continued strength in Japan, Germany and the U.K. \n Ion procedures showed continued strength with 145% growth in Q2 of '23. SP procedure growth was accretive with 40% global growth in the quarter, driven by accelerating growth in the United States. \n On the capital front, we placed 331 systems in Q2 compared with 279 systems in Q2 of last year. Our clinical installed base now stands at 7,900 multiport da Vinci systems, 435 Ion systems and 142 single-port da Vinci systems. Overall, our capital placement trends reflected demand for additional capacity in multiport, strong interest in our Ion system and stable demand for SP as we build our SP indications. \n System utilization defined as procedures per installed clinical system per quarter grew 9% globally year-over-year, reaching a new high as customers adopt a broad mix of procedures on our systems. We believe real-world evidence of improvements across the quadruple aim from better patient outcomes to surgeon satisfaction and lower total cost to treat per patient episode underpin this increasing utilization. \n Turning to our finances. Our revenue grew 15% in the quarter. Our capital and operating expenses were within our spend guidance, reflecting continued investments in R&D to support growth of our platforms and digital tools, expansion of our manufacturing and commercial footprints and capital amortization. We will continue investing in R&D, manufacturing and commercial operations to serve our global markets at industrial scale. These investments are likely to be lumpy over the next couple of years as significant operations expansions and other projects complete. \n Taking a step back, we have found that the quadruple aim is the right north star for us, focusing on demonstrable improvements to outcomes across specific procedures and patient populations, increasing patient and care team satisfaction and lowering the total cost to treat per patient episode. \n As electronic medical records have been adopted, we have partnered with our customers to analyze this data, building real-world evidence and big data approaches to measure quadruple aim improvements within countries, regions and health systems. Paired with our ecosystem investments in training services and products and powered by digital tools that can generate actionable intelligence from surgical data, we can help our customers analyze their programs, recommend and support actions to improve performance and lower total costs. This integrated business system is catalyzing our customers' goal of strong MIS programs by servicing actionable and measurable steps. \n Our approach is scalable for us too, working for our da Vinci platforms and for Ion and opening the door to future opportunities. \n Turning to our ecosystem investments. We're making solid progress extending our offerings to new clinical domains and new regions. For da Vinci multiport, we recently obtained NMPA registration for Xi local production in China. This means our da Vinci Xi will be able to compete for the locally sourced tender subset of the recently released updated national quota. \n Our da Vinci SP team achieved several milestones recently. We completed patient enrollment for our colorectal and Thoracic IDE trials, continued our first phase of launch of SP in Japan and submitted our CE mark dossier for SP in Europe. \n Turning to Ion. Our team installed their first Ion system in the U.K. and initiated first cases. For our digital tools, we have initiated our Phase I launch of CASE Insights, our name for our computational observer. CASE Insights is a tool that works with the da Vinci system and hospital data to build AI models that find correlations between surgical technique, patient populations and surgical outcomes. Our first phase of launch builds on work over the past few years with our clinical research partners to refine objective performance indicators and link them to actionable changes to improve outcomes, shortened training times and improve surgical program efficiency. \n We think these computational tools can make a significant impact using real-world and real-time data to improve skills and outcomes and to inform future product and automation opportunities. That said, features can be built quickly but long-term validation is arduous. We're a science-driven organization and will work through validation pathways in pursuit of long-term success. We do not expect material revenue from CASE insights for the next several quarters. \n In closing, our core business has momentum. We see a significant long-term opportunity to improve the quadruple aim using our integrated ecosystem powered by analytics and we are pacing our investments to catalyze that opportunity. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie, who will take you through our finances in greater detail. Yes. Well, I'll start on AI. Let's talk about what it is. For us, it's a suite of digital tools that rests on a baseline and then can be built upon using various machine learning techniques including computer vision. We've been at it for some time. We started the Internet-of-Things for surgical robots over a decade ago. We built the baseline of cyber secure privacy-compliant pipes that allow us to get access to the data. So there's some foundational work that was important. That's kind of step 1. \n Step 2 is to collaborate with customers and aggregate data that is meaningful. AI is only as good as the quality of the data that you feed it. And so for us, that has been robot data, some other data in electronic medical record data in partnership with our customer base. We've been doing that for several years now. From that, I think you can start to do analytic inspections. You can do analysis on the data, look for correlations. Sometimes it's pretty simple math. That gets you big data explorations, some simple things that we can do to help our customers become more efficient and to expose variation. \n Over time, you can invest further in things like computer vision, which we have been doing and into predictive analytics, the idea that you can look at surgical data science, understand the variation of patient populations and what's happening in surgery and start to create tools, digital tools that can help improve outcomes or speed learning curves or lower operating costs and we're going to work on all of those things. \n So of the things you mentioned, we have our toe in the water in many, and we've had for some time. As I said in the script, the feature content can be moved pretty quickly. I think the validations take real time to do well, particularly outcome-based or interventional validations. And so we're going to go through and do that with real rigor. So I expect us to continue down that pathway. Let me talk a little bit about, I think, the patient population that moved to the sidelines during the pandemic, and then I'll turn the assessment over to Jamie. On the kind of the pandemic response, it's hard to exactly estimate how many folks would have been in diagnostic pipelines that did not get their tests. We do look at the data that's available to do that. I don't think it will clear in just one quarter. I think our past experience on these things is that lower utilization happened over a several year period, and it will probably take many quarters for it to fully recover. How long that is, I think it's very, very hard to estimate. So far, so good. \n You asked a question about bariatrics, I'm going to turn that over to Jamie. He spoke about it a little bit in his prepared remarks. Sure. On the supply chain health side, we are seeing fewer pockets of challenge, but some pockets nonetheless. So there's been significant focus and attention to make sure that we're supplying our customers what they need as we go through a pretty nice procedure growth curve. So they're calling out improvement in the breadth of supply chain challenge, but cautioning that there are still some pockets that need attention or require attention. \n We continue to work on multiple things. As you know, we're working on next generations of our platforms, in general, that is a routine activity for us. How we make the decision between upgrading a current generation versus moving it to the next generation really is around customer value of that switch and the convenience and economics of doing an upgrade versus a platform changeover. And we expect to do some of both. We are usually working on the next two generations because of the time it takes to develop a platform, not just the next one, but the next one after that. And current time is really no different. \n We're pleased with the performance of our engineering teams and prosecuting those upgrades and technologies. What I will say is prioritization wise, what we care about is can we improve patient outcomes in a real way or open a new population of patients to the benefits of [indiscernible] surgery. So we look at that. We look to improve the surgeon and care team experience, whether that's in their ergonomics or their workflow and the like with which they perceive our systems. We work to improve efficiencies of overall programs. We'll work on things that make hospital programs more efficient and we work to lower the total cost to treat per patient episode. \n And when we find feature sets and technologies that do that, then we get pretty excited about them and drive them hard. You had a long list. I think several of those are important and things that we have talked about and have shared with the world. I think the idea of higher confidence ability to identify tissue in real time for the surgeon, and we can do that in a few different ways. So the florescence imaging, that you described and other advanced imaging technologies that give surgeons the ability to see beyond the surface of the tissue and beyond what you can see with normal white-light imaging, we absolutely think that's helping clinical outcomes and we're excited about and investing in image fusion or data fusion, and that's the CT overlay, the segmentation of preoperative MR and CT scans and the ability to use that in real time during the case, we think, can change outcomes and change efficiency in the OR. \n Other types of analytic and sensing capabilities, we think are really powerful and important. And to the earlier question about AI, machine learning, machine vision, these things work together. So high-definition images that show you things beyond the surface of the tissue plus computer vision, plus AI models can give you some predictive analytics that I think are really powerful and would help surgeons get to better outcomes, reduce complications. So I am like that surgeon, quite excited. A reminder, our motivations on that, we've been quite conservative on pricing. Our input pricing in the last few years has gone up in terms of raw material and labor content. We have offset most of that through efficiency and scale advantages, but we felt like it was time to share some of that with our customers, and that was what was behind the price increase. Just I want to just step back a little bit on bariatrics, we've had a few questions on it and just make a point. As we go out and talk to surgeons, we talk to obesity physicians and pharmacologists, which we do in terms of our diligence. The sense here is that the market is going to adjust to the change in treatment pathway as it relates to drugs. However, it doesn't look like the drugs are a cure and may not be a fast path to cure and a strong consensus among those we speak to, including people who are not surgeons, physicians who are not surgeons is that the surgery and other interventions are going to remain an important part of the interaction. \n As the -- in the near term, I think the market will adjust to understand what role the drugs will play but they're not cures and the discontinued rate remains pretty high, and the populations of patients who don't get any benefit from the drugs also remain significant. So I think there's an adjustment period here and we should be aware of it. But that may become a tailwind in future quarters as folks work through those sets of pathways and look at long-term and durable solutions into the obesity challenges. Yes, it's a good question. I think we see that one size doesn't fit all. There are some folks for whom they still remain happy about capital purchases. They see it as the cheapest way for them to access systems. They have high confidence and they're going to buy. There are some folks for whom capital is tight, scarce and or they're interested in future technology protection clauses, and they would rather lease. And there are some folks who are looking at expansions, are a little bit unsure about how fast volume might ramp and for them, usage-based arrangements give them some protections about ramp timing and speed. \n Our analytical capabilities are pretty good, and our finance flexibility is pretty good. And as a result, we'll have that conversation pretty direct way, and I think the market starts to settle where it settles. If you ask, do we have a strong preference for one of those models, the answer is not really. Yes. That's a little bit of the narrative we're hearing too. We go out and canvas our customers pretty widely. There may be a role for kind of new adjuvant use of drugs and then as you say, that may condition some patient populations to be beneficiaries of surgery downstream. There may be folks who start the drugs, get the benefits that they were hoping for, but either the side effects or the cost or the change lifestyle that the drugs are implying, make it hard to sustain. There's a fair amount of that in the literature. So that may -- that population may look for other solutions. \n I think we're just going to have to work through it and see. What we don't see yet is a magic pill, one that cures it and doesn't require behavior change or other lifestyle modification and that -- and it seems unlikely. And as a result, I think we're going to see an adjustment, how long that adjustment period lasts, none of us know. But we know that there will be a role for surgical and mechanical intervention after the fact. And I think we're well positioned. And as Jamie had mentioned, it looks like even in the current environment, the share continues to move our way. So we're going to stay close to it. It's a good question. We're probing probably too soon for us to give you a definitive answer. \n Right. That was our last question, and thank you. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim. Better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams and, ultimately, a lower total cost to treat. \n We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that's less invasive and profoundly better where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly so patients can get back to what matters most. \n Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in 3 months."

            "name": "Jamie Samath",
            "content": "Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. \n Global procedure growth in Q2 of 22% and reflected U.S. procedure growth of 19% and 28% procedure growth outside of the U.S. Procedures in Q2 benefited from higher patient admissions as hospitals, particularly in the U.S. catch up with patients whose diagnosis and/or treatment was delayed during the pandemic. \n Consistent with our comments last quarter, our contributions to procedure growth from surgeons new to the da Vinci platform was strong, reflecting both the strength of our training capabilities and an increasing number of graduates of residency and fellowship programs who are trained on da Vinci. Within one of our target procedure areas, bariatric surgery, our growth rate in the U.S. slowed during the quarter. Some customers have indicated that they are seeing increased patient interest in weight loss drugs. It is too early to conclude if the slowing growth is a temporary pause as patients evaluate these new drug therapies or if it's a trend that continues. \n We believe that during the quarter, da Vinci continued to gain market share in the bariatric surgical market. Our U.S. procedure growth of 28% reflected strength in China, the U.K., Germany and Japan. Strong procedure growth in China was driven by a continued recovery from more recent COVID-related impacts and a favorable comparison to Q2 last year, which was also impacted by the pandemic. \n Consistent with our comments last quarter, growth in non-neurology procedures outside of the United States was accretive, growing at approximately 35% driven by increases in colorectal, hysterectomy and thoracic procedures. \n Turning to other key metrics. In Q2, the installed base of da Vinci Systems grew 13% to just over 8,000 systems driven primarily by demand for additional capacity given procedure growth. Average system utilization grew almost 9% year-over-year reflecting an increasing mix of short duration benign procedures in the U.S. and customers prioritizing use of their existing assets given the financial pressures they face. \n With respect to capital performance, we placed 331 systems in the second quarter ahead of our expectations. Capital strength in the quarter included a higher number of placements to our distributors and a higher number of multi-system deals in the U.S. relative to recent trends, reflecting in part, certain placements accelerated into Q2 from future quarters. \n Despite Q2 system placements being ahead of our expectations, customers, particularly in the U.S. appear to be cautious in their capital spending given ongoing financial pressures. We placed 279 systems in Q2 of last year, which, as a reminder, reflected a delay in the shipment of approximately 15 systems from June into July as a result of supply chain challenges we encountered during the quarter. \n Q2 revenue was $1.8 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, second quarter revenue grew approximately 17%. Recurring revenue represented 85% of total revenue as compared to 72% for the full year 2019 and grew 20% over last year, driven by procedure growth and an increase in the installed base of systems under operating lease arrangements. \n Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: in the U.S., we placed 157 systems in the second quarter compared to 150 systems placed last year. Outside the U.S., we placed 174 systems in Q2 compared with 129 systems last year. Current quarter system placements included 76 into Europe, 33 into Japan and 16 into China compared with 78 into Europe, 18 into Japan and 15 into China in Q2 of last year. \n During the quarter, the China National Health Commission published the 14th 5-year quota of 559 robotic systems. For those systems awarded to our JV under the new quota, we expect a significant majority to be placed in 2024 through 2027. We are seeing increasing participation of local competitors in tender processes under the national quota. In addition, during 2023, we have experienced pricing pressure in China as a result of provincial government policy changes and competition. These dynamics create greater variability in the outlook for our procedure, system placement and revenue performance in China. \n In Q2, 60 of the 331 systems placed were trading transactions compared to 56 trading transactions in the second quarter of last year. As of the end of Q2, there are approximately 500 SIs remaining in the installed base, of which 97 are in the U.S. \n Leasing represented 50% of Q2 placements compared with 42% for both last quarter and last year. In the U.S., 78% of system placements in Q2 were under operating lease arrangements compared to 59% last quarter. The higher rate of operating leases in the U.S. is primarily driven by an increasing customer preference for our usage-based leasing models in part due to capital budget constraints and continuing financial pressures faced by many of our customers. \n In addition, some customers are choosing leasing structures to preserve flexibility to upgrade to next-generation technology. As a result of these dynamics and the earlier stage of our leasing program with OUS customers, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time. \n Q2 system average selling prices were $1.39 million as compared to $1.47 million last quarter. The sequential decrease in system SPs was primarily driven by a higher mix of X placements for purchase deals and geographical mix. We recognized $12 million of lease buyout revenue in the second quarter compared with $24 million last quarter and $23 million in Q2 of 2022. Da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,840 compared with approximately $1,780 last quarter and $1,900 last year. \n On a sequential basis, higher [ INA ] per procedure was driven primarily by the [ INA ] price increase we described last quarter and customer ordering patterns. \n Turning to our Ion platform. In Q2, we placed 59 Ion systems as compared to 41 in Q2 of 2022. Second quarter Ion procedures of approximately 12,700 increased 145% as compared to last year. During the quarter, we placed our first Ion system in the U.K. market and in this early phase of our European launch, we are focused on the collection of clinical data in support of our reimbursement strategy. 12 of the systems placed in the second quarter were SP systems, compared to 10 systems last quarter. SP procedures grew by 40% and average system utilization growth accelerated from last quarter's 12%, increasing by 14% compared to Q2 of last year. \n Moving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the second quarter was 68.5% compared with 67.2% last quarter and 69.2% last year. Pro forma gross margin was lower than last year, primarily due to a higher mix of Ion revenue which currently carries significantly lower margins as compared to the da Vinci business and lower system SP. \n As we described last quarter, improving product costs and manufacturing efficiency is a priority for our teams over the medium term. Second quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 12% year-over-year, driven primarily by increased headcount added throughout last year, higher variable compensation, increased prototype expenses and increased expenses associated with customer training in support of procedure growth. \n Pro forma operating expenses represented 33% of revenue in Q2 compared to 35% of revenue for the full year 2022, reflecting in part planned leverage in our enabling functions. \n Capital expenditures in Q2 were $178 million, primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities footprint and increase manufacturing capacity. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22.3%, consistent with our expectations. Second quarter pro forma net income was $507 million or $1.42 per share compared with $415 million or $1.14 per share for Q2 of last year. \n I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $421 million or $1.18 per share for the second quarter of 2023 compared with GAAP net income of $308 million or $0.85 per share for the second quarter of 2022. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and gains and losses on strategic investments. \n We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.1 billion compared with $6.6 billion last quarter. The sequential increase in cash and investments reflected cash from operating activities, proceeds from employee stock exercises partially offset by capital expenditures. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian, who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2023. Yes. What we saw in Q2 was that growth rate slowed. We have some input from customers that the level of patient interest is such that patients are now considering drugs versus surgery. It's unclear yet based on that set of inputs from customers the duration of that evaluation by parents and patients and obviously, it's layered. So what we did for our guidance was we just said at the high end for the remainder of the year, the bariatrics growth rate in the U.S. is consistent with what we saw in Q2. And at the low end, we said that the growth rate continues to slow a little bit over the course of the year as patients become increasingly educated about the weight loss drugs. And obviously, there's a number of factors that patients have to consider with respect to those drugs, cost, side effects, what happens if they come off the drugs and regain weight, et cetera. But I think from our perspective, we're early in understanding what the longer-term impact will be. \n Customers have said that they have confidence that there is a role for surgery in weight loss and that will endure over kind of the longer term. What happens in for the rest of the year, I think we'll see. We've set the market size in the U.S. is about 200,000 procedures annually for what we think is a good mesh for robotics. And in terms of where we are in penetration, we're kind of at the -- if I put it in quartiles, we're at the beginning of the second quartile. What was your first question, Travis? Yes. I mean, obviously, there's increased opportunity in the sense that this quota is 559 systems relative to the prior quota of 225 systems, but you also have now 5 local players. There will be government interest in success of local players. We do believe the surgeons care about capability and feature set and so the extent to which da Vinci continues to be differentiated, I think, is to our advantage. \n In the -- and we are seeing those local players increasingly participate in tenders with respect to how that quota will be allocated. So it gets allocated from the central government to the provinces and then it goes through tender processes. So there is some time before that results in placements and that's why we said in our prepared remarks, we think the bulk of the subset of that quota, our JV wins will be in '24 through '27. \n I also described some dynamics that create greater variability with respect to pricing pressure and increasing competition. So I think for us, that's something that we're going to watch carefully over the next year or so. Yes, I'm not going to be specific on the prototype expense and it's distributed across a number of programs. Prototype expenses tend to be lumpy within Q2 relative to the comparison point. It just so happened to be a quarter where that was one of the direct drivers of our expenditure. Nothing more than that, I would say. \n As we've grown the proportion of the installed basis under leases, I think it's about 2,000 systems now that are under lease in the installed base. Generally, they have a technology obsolescence clause. That's kind of in part a reflection of customer feedback from when we launched Xi. So that's routinely in our operating lease arrangements and that cause generally gives customers the opportunity to change that existing lease to the lease of any new next-generation technology. And that is not a specified price, by the way, that's to be negotiated. So I wouldn't say anything more about price. With respect to capital allocation, I think our priorities are consistent for how they've been for some time now. Our first priority is to invest in the business, both in capital expenditures, which as you've seen by our guidance are relatively high to our history this year and in organically investing in operating expenses. \n Second is to acquire technology externally that gives us a differentiated capability or accelerate us in the marketplace. That's generally license arrangements, IP acquisition or tuck-in acquisitions. And we continue to look at returning cash to shareholders opportunistically. And I think that's served us well. If you look at kind of the last 18 months, we repurchased 12.6 million shares for $3 billion at an average price of $234 and we did that opportunistically in large part because it reflects kind of the stage of the company. We're relatively early in the robotics space where we look for growth, and I think that's served us well. It was largely implemented in Q2, Rick. It wasn't effective at the beginning of the quarter, I'd say, roughly half of the quarter benefited from the price increase. Our estimate for the impact of the price increase is consistent with what we said last quarter, roughly about $100 million impact to revenue and profit for the year. Again, you get kind of half an impact in Q2 and the full impact in Q3 and Q4. Yes, I don't want to get too specific there, Rick, given just the relative size of bariatrics in the U.S. to our overall procedures. We can obviously see the progression between Q1 and Q2, I'd call it a moderate, steady progression in the model in Q3 and Q4. The overall impact on that is obviously a function of the size of the bariatrics business for us. It's not some dramatic falloff. I'm not going to answer that in terms of overage, but I'll say where we're seeing healthy growth. If you take our largest 7 markets, which is a focus for us, so China, Japan, South Korea, Germany, France, U.K. and Italy, what you're seeing in those markets is generally a progression beyond urology into the next set of cancer procedures. It's market by market. But generally, that's hysterectomy, thoracic and colorectal procedures. And we're seeing them on the early stages of an adoption curve, and that's why we've talked about our OUS business now is about half outside of urology or beyond urology. This quarter, it grew 35% that subset. That's consistent with what we saw in Q1. That subset also grew 35%. So I think we're excited in those larger markets where we have that focus and continue to drive the adoption curve in that next set of procedures. \n If you look at market by market, you have some unique dynamics in China. You see liver and pancreas procedure doing well in Japan, treatment of stomach cancer in Korea, for example, you see thyroid. But it's really that next step procedures. Yes. For this year, we have specific objectives with respect to leverage in our enabling functions, which we've described previously. And that's a set of objectives that I think we intend to fulfill. \n Largely, what you see in the adjustments we've made to our operating expense guidance for this year is a function of our top line performance, both in variable compensation and in the number of reps we need in the field to support a higher procedure base. For the rest of kind of operating expense set of investments, we're holding to -- we're largely holding to our plan for this year. \n When you project into '24, I'm not going to kind of describe the direction of where spend will go relative to procedural revenue, we'll do that in January. But you have a couple of dynamics. We have a significant CapEx investments this year, $800 million to $1 billion, that will start to create incremental depreciation expense next year. A chunk of that will be in COGS and a chunk of that will be in operating expenses. So you have kind of an operating expense headwind coming there. And those investments being largely facilities, they are planned for the medium term, meaning they're inefficient for a period until you get to full occupancy or full utilization. \n On the other side, we'll continue to look to leverage our enabling functions into '24, where that shakes out, we'll do in January because we have to complete our planning process in the back half of this year. The motivation by the way, for the new disclosure was simply the rate at which those adoption of those models have grown, we felt, okay it was important to be transparent as to what portion of operating leases and placements that structure was. If you kind of assess all of our usage-based arrangements in aggregate life today relative to usage patterns and economic objectives in total, on average, they're slightly above our expectations. So they performed well so far. That's obviously a blend across different customers and systems. Some are overperforming, some are underperforming. But I think part of the way that we've operated the program is to look carefully. Is it actually reducing barriers for accelerated growth of our customers? And is it producing the economic results for us and our customers and as we and customers have gained confidence, that's part of the reason why it's expanded the way it has."

New capital installs were likewise strong as customers built their da Vinci and Ion system capacity to meet demand. Revenue grew 14% on the back of this continued adoption. \n Some manufacturing and supply challenges this quarter negatively impacted our product margins. This is an opportunity for sharper execution going forward. Our R&D and innovation engines are making good progress with the strength in Ion adoption, progress in our digital efforts and indication expansions for Ion and SP. Overall, our core business remains strong with some near-term procedure and product cost dynamics that we'll discuss today. \n Starting with procedures, we saw a surprising strength in the quarter led by general surgery in the United States and procedure growth beyond urology outside the United States. On a procedure basis, cholecystectomy, bariatric surgery and hernia repair led the way. \n All our major regions performed well. Standouts included India, Spain, U.K., Japan, Germany and Italy. U.S. performance was significantly above trend, and China is recovering from lows in Q4, though not yet meeting our expected 2023 run rate. \n Given that first quarter of the year exceeded our procedure expectations, we're reviewing underlying drivers. The return of patients to health care providers and diagnostic pipelines post-pandemic continues, with evidence of both an increased patient census and some diagnostic pipelines running above pre-pandemic levels after several years of lag. We also see a commitment by our hospital customers to work through staffing constraints to maintain surgical volume. \n Lastly, customers are expressing confidence in our products as a clinically and economically sustainable path forward for minimally invasive surgery. Taken together, we see continued share gain from open surgery and laparoscopy in several procedures and in several countries as evidence accumulates in our favor. \n Strong growth in procedures and a capable product portfolio has supported a healthy capital placement quarter. Worldwide, we placed 312 da Vinci systems and 55 Ion systems in Q1 compared with 311 da Vinci systems and 34 Ion systems in Q1 2022. \n Capital placements were healthy in the United States, our distribution markets, the U.K. and in India in the quarter. Our product portfolio and our teams are competing effectively with the offerings of a growing set of competitors, notably in OUS markets where customers have had more time to evaluate the relative strengths of our offerings. \n Procedures per system per quarter grew 13% during Q1 versus a year ago. Systems are being used more hours per operating day, and customers are increasing the mix of shorter-duration procedures. Both trends are good, long-term indicators for our business. Customers are finding more value in their systems and are moving more of their procedure volume onto our devices compared to other surgical approaches. \n Turning to our finances. Our revenue growth of 14% reflects the strength of our procedures and capital placements, while average selling prices remained stable. Our margins were pressured primarily by charges taken in our stapling line due to a raw material lot non-conformance that necessitated scrapping instruments. We also experienced lower manufacturing yields during the bring-up of new production lines in our high-volume production facilities to support multiport accessory and Ion catheter growth. Customer availability was briefly impacted for stapling but has since recovered, and we're working on bringing customer stocking levels back to their prior levels. For our Ion catheters and our multiport accessories, we're investing in capabilities to increase yield and robustness in the face of rising demand. We have worked through the issues that drove the bulk of these scrap charges in the quarter.\n Finally, in SG&A and R&D, we're spending roughly to plan while continuing to pursue productivity improvements post-pandemic. Jamie and Brian will take you through our finances and forward outlook in more detail shortly. \n On new products and indications, we've had a productive quarter. We received our CE mark for Ion, and we expect to launch in the U.K. as our first entry into the European region. As we focus on scaling Ion, we initiated our first high-volume production lines in our Mexicali facility, increasing production volume 50% over just the prior quarter. \n In digital, our simulation subscription installed base grew 36% year-over-year as virtual reality training becomes more deeply embedded in the training pathway. Our intuitive hub installed base grew 41% year-over-year and utilization during da Vinci cases grew 80% year-over-year as customers use our Intuitive Hub computing system to record and analyze procedures more routinely. \n Turning to SP. We received new indications for SP in the United States through a 510(k) clearance in urology, covering simple prostatectomy, removal of a noncancerous prostate for treatment of advanced benign prostate hyperplasia. We also installed our first da Vinci SP system in Japan, and they completed their first set of cases. \n For 2023, our priorities are as follows. First, we're focused on increased adoption for our priority procedures in countries through outstanding training, commercial and market access execution. Second, we're pursuing expanded indications and launches for our new platforms. Third, we're focused on excellence and continuity of supply, product quality and services provision as we emerge from pandemic stresses. And finally, we're pursuing increased productivity in our functions that benefit from scale. You can see from our first quarter results the relevance of these priorities and our urgency in pursuing them. \n I'll now turn the time over to Jamie who will take you through our finances in greater detail. \nJamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. \n Before I dive into the details of our Q1 results, I will expand on the 2 areas of note in the quarter, and as Gary highlighted, procedure growth and gross margin. \n Global procedure growth in Q1 of 26% came in well above our expectations with notable strength in the U.S. where procedures also grew by 26%. As a reminder, procedures in Q1 of last year reflected an adverse impact from COVID in the early part of the quarter in the U.S. and the latter part of the quarter in Korea and China. We believe that the return of patients to normalized health care routines, including diagnostics, and improved staffing levels have positively impacted this quarter's procedures. However, it is difficult to precisely characterize or estimate the degree or duration of this impact. \n Looking at the monthly trends in the U.S., January and February were particularly strong relative to historical seasonality. However, in March, we saw more normalized growth rates. Outside of the U.S. procedure growth of almost 28% was also ahead of our expectations, with growth outperforming expectations across all our major international markets. \n In the first quarter, non-urology procedures represented roughly half of our total OUS procedures and grew 35% from quarter 1 of last year. Brian will provide additional commentary and our updated procedure outlook later in the call. \n Pro forma gross margin in Q1 was below our expectations at 67.2%, lower than last quarter's 68.2% and last year's 69.8%. Q1 results reflected onetime adverse impacts of approximately 100 basis points relating to manufacturing-related issues and an increase in inventory reserves, as Gary detailed. While we largely resolved these onetime items in the quarter, we see opportunity to strengthen our manufacturing operations and improve product costs. This is a priority for our business unit and operations teams and aligns with our capital investment plans, as we described on last quarter's call. \n Turning to other key metrics. In Q1, the installed base of da Vinci systems grew 12% to almost 7,800 systems driven primarily by demand for additional capacity given procedure growth. Average system utilization grew 13% year-over-year, significantly above long-term trends, driven by notable strength in procedure volumes in January and February and by an increasing mix of shorter-duration benign procedures in the U.S. While we do not expect this level of utilization growth to continue, we actively support our customers as they increase utilization of their da Vinci systems which, in turn, lowers their per procedure costs. \n With respect to capital performance, we placed 312 systems in the first quarter, ahead of our expectations, with notable strength in OUS markets. Current quarter placements were roughly even with the 311 systems we placed in the first quarter of last year. There were 67 trade-in transactions in the quarter as compared to 108 last year. Excluding trade-in transactions, net new system placements increased 21% over the first quarter of last year. As of the end of Q1, there are approximately 560 Sis remaining in the installed base, of which approximately 110 are in the U.S. \n Q1 revenue was $1.7 billion, an increase of 14%. On a constant currency basis, first quarter revenue grew approximately 17%. Recurring revenue represented 81% of total revenue and grew 21% over last year driven by procedure growth and an increase in the installed base of systems under operating lease arrangements. Within I&A revenue for our advanced technology categories, stapler and energy, revenue grew a combined 26% over Q1 of last year. \n Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. In the U.S., we placed 141 systems in the first quarter, lower than the 186 systems we placed last year, reflecting a decline of 51 systems associated with trade-in transactions. Outside the U.S., we placed 171 systems in Q1 compared with 125 systems last year. Current quarter system placements included 101 into Europe, 16 into Japan and 18 into China compared with 78 into Europe, 19 into Japan and 9 into China in Q1 of last year. First quarter system placement performance in Europe included 32 placements in the U.K. driven by timing of the NHS budget period, which closes each year at the end of March. We placed 12 systems in India, a quarterly high for us, which, in part, stems from our recent procedure growth there. In Q1, procedures in India grew 55%, albeit from a relatively small base. \n Reviewing the capital performance in the quarter, we do not expect the strength in U.K. and India to repeat in the remainder of the year. Customers, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, continue to be challenged by staffing, inflation, debt servicing costs and other financial pressures. And as a result, we expect customers to continue to be cautious in their overall capital spending. \n Leasing represented 42% of Q1 placements compared with 42% last quarter and 35% last year. We are increasingly seeing customers address system access and capital budget barriers by choosing our usage-based leasing models. The proportion of placements under this structure continue to increase, particularly in the U.S. As a result of this trend and the earlier stage of our leasing program with OUS customers, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time. \n Q1 system average selling prices were $1.47 million as compared to $1.43 million last quarter. The sequential increase in system ASPs was primarily driven by a lower mix of trade-ins. We recognized $24 million of lease buyout revenue in the first quarter compared with $17 million last quarter and $16 million in Q1 of 2022. \n da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,780 compared with approximately $1,820 last quarter and $1,870 last year. On a year-over-year basis, FX negatively impacted I&A per procedure by approximately $40, and ordering patterns in China had a negative impact of approximately $50 per procedure as our channel partners continue to manage their inventory levels in a dynamic environment. On a sequential basis, the primary driver of the decline in I&A per procedure of $40 was customer ordering patterns in the U.S. \n Turning to our Ion platform. In Q1, we placed 55 Ion systems as compared to 34 in Q1 of 2022. First quarter Ion procedures of approximately 10,200 increased 159% as compared to last year. During the quarter, we received CE mark clearance for our Ion platform in Europe where we will initially focus on the U.K. market and on the collection of clinical data in support of our European reimbursement strategy. Regulatory processes for Ion continue to progress in Korea and China. Ten of the systems placed in the first quarter were SP systems, including our first placement in Japan following clearance last quarter. SP procedures grew by 37% and average system utilization increased by 12% compared to Q1 of last year. \n Moving on to the rest of the P&L. As previously referenced, pro forma gross margin for Q1 was 67.2%. And in addition to the onetime impacts described earlier, pro forma gross margin reflects the impact of higher component and labor costs and, relative to the year-ago period, a stronger U.S. dollar. Gross margin for our Ion platform is currently considerably below our da Vinci business, resulting in an adverse mix impact to gross margin given the higher growth rates of our Ion business. The key area of focus for our Ion and manufacturing teams over the next 18 months is to improve supply stresses, strengthen manufacturing capabilities and lower our product costs. \n I&A prices have remained the same for the life of Xi. However, given the durability of component cost increases throughout the pandemic, we are executing an increase to the list price of da Vinci I&A from approximately 5% over the next couple of months. This increase reflects only a portion of the increased component labor costs reflected in our gross margin. We expect the impact of this decision to be an increase in revenue and operating profit of approximately $100 million in 2023. \n First quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 20% year-over-year driven primarily by increased head count added throughout last year, higher variable compensation, higher travel costs and increased expenses associated with customer training. Operating expenses were moderately above our expectations due to higher variable compensation and training costs related to our procedure performance in the quarter. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up 1%, including the annual reset of certain payroll taxes. Head count increased by approximately 330 in Q1, of which roughly half are in support of revenue growth. \n Capital expenditures in Q1 were $197 million, primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities footprint and increase manufacturing capacity, including automation of certain production lines. \n Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 22.1%, consistent with our expectations. First quarter pro forma net income was $437 million or $1.23 per share compared with $413 million or $1.13 per share for the first quarter of last year. \n I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $355 million or $1 per share for the first quarter of 2023 compared with GAAP net income of $366 million and also $1 per share for the first quarter of 2022. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, gains and losses on strategic investments. \n We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $6.6 billion compared with $6.7 billion at the end of last year. The sequential reduction in cash and investments reflected share repurchases and capital expenditures partially offset by cash from operating activities. \n During the quarter, we spent $350 million to repurchase 1.5 million of our shares at an average price of $230 per share. From the beginning of 2022 through the end of Q1 this year, we have repurchased 12.6 million shares at an average price of $234 per share and have $1.1 billion remaining under current Board authorization to repurchase our shares. \n And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2023. \nBrian King: Thank you, Jamie. Our overall first quarter procedure growth was 26% year-over-year compared to 19% for the first quarter of 2022 and 18% last quarter. In the U.S., first quarter 2023 procedure growth was 26% year-over-year compared to 16% for the first quarter of 2022 and 18% last quarter. Q1 growth continued to be driven by strong growth in procedures within general surgery. Specifically, growth was led by cholecystectomy, bariatrics, hernia repair and other procedures.\n Outside of the U.S., first quarter procedure volume grew 28% compared with 25% for the first quarter of 2022 and 18% last quarter. First quarter 2023 OUS procedure growth was driven by continued growth in general surgery and gynecology categories, primarily from colon resection and hysterectomy. Growth in urology continued to be solid led by kidney procedures, along with continued double-digit growth in prostatectomy. \n In Europe, we experienced strong growth in the U.K., Germany, Italy and France. In all the regions noted, procedure growth was driven by strong growth in colorectal and hysterectomy. Urology was also solid, with particular strength in kidney procedures. Outside of those procedures, in Germany, we also saw strong growth in hernia repair. And in France, growth in lung resection was also strong. \n In Asia, growth beyond urology was also led by general surgery and gynecology procedures. In Japan, growth was led by colon resection, a newly reimbursed procedure in 2022 that provided the most incremental cases this quarter. Growth was also robust in rectal resection and gastrectomy and continued early-stage growth in kidney procedures. In China, procedures started to recover in February from the impact of COVID, exceeding our expectations for the quarter but still below prior averages. Growth in urology was solid, in particular with growth in prostatectomy and kidney procedures. \n Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. \n Starting with the clinical study for benign general surgery, Dr. Courtney Collins from Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center published outcomes comparing robotic versus open retromuscular ventral hernia repairs in older adults using prospectively collected data from the Abdominal Core Health Quality Collaborative, a national hernia-specific registry. \n Published in the Annals of Surgery, over 1,100 patients over the age of 65 were included in a propensity matched analysis, with 350 patients in the robotic arm and approximately 750 patients in the open arm. This study reported the median length of stay associated with the robotic-assisted approach was 1/4 of the length of stay for patients undergoing an open repair, with a 1-day stay in the robotic-assisted arm and a 4-day stay in the open arm. \n While complication rates were similar between both groups, it was notable that median 1-year quality-of-life scores using the HerQLes quality-of-life survey tool trended favorably for patients in the robotic-assisted arm. The authors concluded, in part, that the results suggest that robotic approach may have at least short-term benefits to appropriate older patients undergoing retromuscular ventral hernia repair, including shorter length of stay with relatively low risk of complications, with the important note that surgeon comfort and knowledge of the likely complexity of a repair should always guide operative approach in any patient. \n Now turning to a report published in January of this year. Dr. Sameh Emile from the Cleveland Clinic Florida reported outcomes for robotic-assisted versus laparoscopic resection of T4 rectal cancer in the British Journal of Surgery. This study, leveraging data from the National Cancer Database and after a 1:1 propensity score matching, compared 470 patients undergoing a minimally invasive resection for nonmetastatic T4 rectal cancer, with 235 subjects in each of the laparoscopic and robotic-assisted cohorts. \n Notably, rates of conversions in the robotic-assisted group were approximately half the rate of conversion in the laparoscopic group, with 8.9% in the robotic group versus 17.9% in the laparoscope group. Further analysis demonstrated that risk of conversion to open was 45% lower in the robotic-assisted group when compared to the laparoscopic group. In addition, patients who underwent a robotic-assisted procedure had a 1 day shorter length of stay compared to patients in the laparoscopic arm. The authors concluded, in part, that robotic-assisted resections of T4 rectal cancer were associated with a significantly lower conversion rate and shorter hospital stay than laparoscopic surgery. \n I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2023, starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecasted full year 2023 procedure growth within a range of 12% to 16%. We are now increasing our forecast and expect full year 2023 procedure growth of 18% to 21%. This range continues to reflect the uncertainty associated with the course of the pandemic and macroeconomic risks. \n The low end of the range still assumes continued choppiness with COVID hospitalizations, uncertainty with the timing of the capital quota in China for the remainder of the year, macroeconomic challenges that could impact hospitals and patient spending and a moderation in procedures from elevated levels experienced in January and February this year. \n At the high end of the range, we assume COVID-related hospitalizations around the world continue to decline throughout 2023, a capital quota in China is available and macroeconomic challenges do not impact hospital procedure volumes. The range does not reflect significant material supply chain disruptions or hospital capacity constraints similar to what we experienced at the start of the pandemic. \n Turning to gross profit. We continue to expect our 2023 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 68% and 69%. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions. \n With respect to operating expenses, on our last call, we forecast pro forma operating expense growth to be between 9% and 13%. We are increasing our estimate and now expect our full year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 11% and 15%. The increased operating expense growth reflects higher variable compensation and other costs related to higher procedure growth performance. \n We are also updating our estimate for noncash stock compensation expense to range between $600 million to $630 million in 2023, a decrease from our previous estimate of $610 million to $640 million. We continue to expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $140 million and $160 million in 2023. With regard to capital expenditures, we continue to estimate a range of $800 million to $1 billion for planned facility construction activities. \n With regard to income tax, we continue to estimate our 2023 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pretax income. \n That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll first go to Travis Steed with Bank of America. \nTravis Steed: I'll start out with the 26% procedure growth. Can you just comment a little bit on how much of this is just a better hospital environment, better procedure environment, versus maybe some uptick in share gains from robotics? And a little bit more color on the January, February versus the March, just curious if you think this is some kind of temporary catch-up here or some sustained better procedure environment kind of moving forward. \nJamie Samath: Travis, this is Jamie. I think there are 4 drivers on the 26%. We do think there's a little bit of a soft comp on the base period given some impacts from COVID in Q1 of '22. You have 3 other drivers. We think there is some backlog effect from patients generally returning to more normalized health care routines given the effect of the pandemic over several years. Included within that is diagnostic pipelines, we see the last year or so of diagnostic pipelines being above pre-Covid levels. Second effect, there is some strength in the U.S. in general surgery, particularly behind general surgery. And in our OUS markets, the non-urology side of our procedure categories are growing nicely. .\n We also think that relative to Q4, staffing has improved. It's not where it was pre-COVID, but I think that's allowed for some incremental procedures to be performed. We don't have good estimates as to where the kind of various outperformance is between those categories that we described, market data lags there. Certainly, there's some market share gains, particularly in benign general surgery in the U.S. \n What was the second part of your question, Travis? \nTravis Steed: Just more about the January, February versus the March and if it was more of an early part of the catch-up, I think you answered part of that, versus some sustained better environment here into April. . \nJamie Samath: Yes. January, in particular, was very strong. That also probably reflects in part a little bit of the comp. February continues to be strong, and I characterize March as a normalized growth rate. I'm not going to give you the percentages, though, I think that can be misleading. Early part of April, it's difficult to look at just a couple of weeks. But I'd say generally, it's consistent with what we've seen in March. We've seen some third-party data through end of February, just with respect to total U.S. inpatient admissions, and that shows kind of the same trends in terms of a strong January, February. \nTravis Steed: Great. That's helpful. And then I wanted to ask about the price increase on I&A. Is it like across the board for just the U.S.? I assume, but I wanted to clarify that. And the math I was doing of about 150 basis points on margin but the gross margin guide still staying the same at 68% to 69%, so I just wanted to make sure I understood the moving parts on the margin side and how you're incorporating that into the overall margin guidance. \nJamie Samath: Yes. So the 5% is in the vast majority of our markets, a couple of smaller markets, where local dynamics are such that we have to take a look at that more carefully. That doesn't go into effect for the full year, that's in the next couple of months that we'll implement that. I think if you look at the gross margin impact of the $100 million, depending on where you're modeling revenue, I think you have to do it with and without revenue and gross margin dollars to do the impact to gross margin percentage. I think it's less than the number that you described. And yes, it is reflected in the gross margin guidance that we provided. So what you have there is the puts and takes of the Q1 performance, our updated outlook for the rest of the year and then you add in the effect of the price increase. \nOperator: And next, we'll go to Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. \nRobert Marcus: Great. I just want to say congrats on a great quarter. Maybe if I could ask on placements, the net placements were well above consensus here in the first quarter, really strong showing, flat with last year pretty much, despite lower trade-ins. But that comes with your comments that it's still a fairly tight capital environment. So in a normal environment, how much better do you think you'd be doing on placements? And are you seeing an improvement at all in the capital equipment environment? It's certainly not holding you back here. But I'm just really curious where you think you could go if the environment was a bit healthier. \nJamie Samath: Yes. I would say that the environment is still challenging for hospitals. There's no question that they are encountering relatively significant financial pressures. Generally, we see customers, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, prioritizing their capital investment dollars based on where they see the greatest ROIs and where they have opportunities to gain market share. And so us, where we see that evidence is in where they start to have procedure growth, that means they're out of capacity and they look to invest in da Vinci to expand capacity given the economic evidence that they've accumulated with the experience of their programs. \n Hard to answer your question directly in terms of what would the capital environment be if it were in, let's say, normalized times. For us, I think we're focused on this period on offering customers flexibility in how they acquire capital, meeting them with their financial objectives and serving their objectives in expanding their robotic programs. \nRobert Marcus: Great. And maybe just a quick follow-up. Jamie, as we think about your OpEx progression through the year, it came in a bit higher than the Street had in first quarter. How should we think about that flowing through the rest of the year? And was there anything or any kind of big quarters that we should be thinking about in our progression through the year? \nJamie Samath: Yes. I would say roughly, depending on where you are in the range, Q2 and Q3 operating expenses should be roughly similar to Q1, and you start to see a less of effect just from the payroll tax reset in Q2 and Q3 as those max out, and you should see Q4 seasonally higher. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. \nLarry Biegelsen: Gary, you've talked about competition potentially lengthening the capital placement cycle. But my question is, if there's an effort by a competitor to discount I&A by 30% or so, how would this impact your procedures? And secondly, Gary, why is this the right time to increase price in I&A? And I had one follow-up. \nGary Guthart: Yes. On the first question of what's real pricing out there, there's a few competitors out there, a couple are trumpeting marketing claims about how much they're going to reduce I&A pricing. When we see them in tenders, when we actually see what's written down, we don't see the marketing claim. So I don't know that that's been realized yet or if it's something they want to do in the future, if they're really going to deliver, I don't know. .\n But we do have real-world evidence of engagement in our OUS markets with most of these competitors. And what we find is that the reality is we have a very strong portfolio, we can hit multiple price points because we have different systems that can hit it at different places. The other thing that goes on is that it's more than just whatever a company supplies to get to the total price per procedure. So if a new competitor enters and they have a short procedure set, in other words, they don't have everything you need, the customer will have to go to third-parties to fill it out to finish the case. Often in marketing materials, they don't make that clear, \"Hey, you got to have more to get the case done.\" But in a tender, you do, which is, \"Hey, this is all the stuff that it really takes to get a procedure done.\" \n So we're feeling pretty good about where we are with regard to our ability to deliver economic value that really matters to our customer. I think that we're having real exchanges with them about what that looks like. So that's kind of a baseline. We have been investing in the virtuous cycle, manufacturing capabilities. Some of the capital you hear us investing is both facilities and automation, getting our factories in the right places in the world for logistics and for labor. We're doing those things to be able to lower our product costs, increase our quality as we get volume. That has been lumpy. I wish it was smoother, but it's been a lumpy process for us. \n So the timing for us in terms of price increase is really not about a specific issue. It's not about a specific competitive issue or scrap. It's really around looking at the input costs that we're seeing over the last couple of years and component supply that comes to us from others and labor content, labor costs, and saying, \"Hey, we're going to have to move a little bit here going forward.\" That doesn't diminish the other programs that we've done to make sure we're bringing value to our customers, extended life instruments and other price points that we can help them with. \nLarry Biegelsen: That's very helpful, Gary. Just one on Ion, we estimate Ion sales exceeded $140 million last year. It could drive a couple of hundred basis points of revenue growth this year. Thank you for giving the procedure numbers on this call. My question is when are you going to start to break out Ion revenues and just maybe talk about the ramp in Europe. \nGary Guthart: So the first question of kind of breakouts in your estimates, I'll let Jamie answer that, and I'll talk a little bit about Europe. \nJamie Samath: It's a little early at this point. It's 2% to 3% of procedures and revenue. I think we want to give it a little more time, get a little more experience in the marketplace, execute some of the commercial activities that we have for the year. When it becomes a bigger portion of the total, maybe a year from now, we would look to do some guidance and give greater disclosure. \nGary Guthart: On Europe, this first year, as we go in, we'll be relatively modest in terms of revenue and installs. I think we'll start the process. We're excited about some of the sites and clinical trial work that we need to do. We do have to do some evidence generation in Europe. We do want to look at some of the reimbursement capabilities that are going to be important for broader market access. So year 1 is really about establishing evidence, having the right conversations and building the database so that reimbursement and broader use can be deployed. \nOperator: And next, we'll go to Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. \nJayson Bedford: Just a couple of questions. Just on China, I assume there was a backlog built in December and January and part of February. I don't know if you commented on March trends there, but can you comment on procedure growth in China in the quarter? And to the extent that you do believe there is a backlog, do you expect a bolus of growth in that geography over the next quarter or 2? \nBrian King: Jayson, this is Brian. Good to hear from you. If you recall really at the end of last year, we had highlighted that we saw a significant impact from COVID at the end of the quarter to procedure volumes. And what we saw was that, that actually carried over into the beginning of this year. What we were highlighting in our prepared remarks was we definitely saw an impact in China continue through January, started to see a recovery in February and a bit into March. I guess I would say overall, I think procedures in China exceeded our expectations, but it just still was below our overall, say, long-run averages over time. So it's probably all that I could say. Anything beyond that, I couldn't say if there's anything different in March versus February. \nJamie Samath: I would just add, Jayson, there may be still some unmet backlog in China. If there is, it's probably relatively small, and it's captured within the procedure range that we provided. \nJayson Bedford: Okay. And just another quick clarification question. The supply challenges impacted margins. Was there an impact on revenue in the quarter? I'm just curious how long it will take to replenish the normal inventory levels at the customer level. \nJamie Samath: Yes, there was not an impact to revenue that I'd highlight in Q1. It was really just the gross margin impact of about 100 basis points that we highlighted. With respect to inventory, if I just look at the big picture, we've been trying to replenish inventory targets for each of our critical parts for some time. We've been supply constrained for a good portion of the pandemic. Inventory health improved in Q1 relative to Q4, but we still have a number of parts where we have to get to our target levels. And that will probably take us over the course of the rest of the year. \nGary Guthart: Just a note, supply chain shocks through the last couple of years depleted inventory. Now we're building it back up. And given some of the lack of smoothness, we're probably holding a little more inventory than we would in more smooth times. That little additional inventory increases risk at some point. So we saw that in this quarter, we will work through it this year, but I think that risk still exists a little bit as inventory levels are higher than they were in the last 2, 3 years as we recover. \nOperator: And next, we'll go to Richard Newitter with Truist Securities. \nRichard Newitter: Congrats on the quarter. I have 2 quick ones on SP. I think you had said that FP procedures grew 37% and in the quarter. If you could just remind us kind of how that stacked up for the last 2 quarters. And then the second one on SP, just the new indication there for BPH, how significant is that? And maybe just talk a little bit about how expansive that is for you? And then I have one follow-up. \nGary Guthart: Yes. I'll let Jamie take the trend data, and I can talk about BPH. \nJamie Samath: The '22 procedure growth rate for SP, I think... \nGary Guthart: It looks like Brian is looking it up. I'm going to do the second question first, and then Brian is going to come back and save the day. On BPH, so there are a lot of different treatments for BPH. It's a quite common condition. At smaller prostate sizes, when it's caught earlier, there are pharmacologic approaches. There are some minimally invasive in-office approaches. Those tend to delay further onset. They don't tend to cure. So folks, over time, fail out. And as they fail out of those other procedures, surgery becomes increasingly important. \n SP, early days, looks to be quite interesting. It's a minimally invasive approach. It can deal with advanced stage disease that we think other approaches are not handling well at all. And so as we get involved, I think that's another arrow in the quiver of an SP urologist. I think that helps them. We're already engaged with those customers, and it may give us a lead to participate in a bigger part of that market as time goes on. \n Back to the trend data, I'll go back. \nJamie Samath: Yes. If I just take '22 as a whole, SP procedures grew 38%, so relatively consistent. \nRichard Newitter: Great. And just on the benign procedure commentary, it was such an enormous step-up, particularly in the U.S. I appreciate the easier comps. But were the benign procedures, that potentially saw a little bit of disproportionate lift this quarter, confined just to general surgery benign procedures? Or was it also inclusive of benign GYN? I'm just trying to get a sense for kind of where this procedure strength really derived. \nJamie Samath: Relative to trend lines, we saw benign strength in GYN also. So benign GYN growth rates were higher than we've seen in recent times and higher than long-term trend rates. And we think that speaks to kind of this backlog of patients' return to normal health care routines, et cetera. That's part of what's reflected in those growth rates. \nGary Guthart: At the risk of being redundant, I think there's 2 concepts that are worth stitching together. One of them is that utilization went up 13% in the quarter procedures per system per year. So folks are using capital more frequently. There was an increase in the benign side. So we're seeing a rotation of mix, putting of those procedures onto systems that they own already. That was a big step-up. I think it speaks to how hospitals are thinking about robotic-assisted surgery programs and how they're thinking about capital. \n And the simple answer is they're looking to see greater capital productivity out of what they already own and they see through real-world evidence, the ability to look into their own electronic medical record data, that their outcomes are really good with robotic-assisted surgery and their contribution margins are really healthy. So rotations on to those systems are happening. And I think that's been an acceleration at least in this quarter. So we'll see if it holds through the year, but I think it tells you a little bit about the capital environment and it tells you a little bit about the commitment toward robotic-assisted surgery, particularly in higher-volume, shorter-duration procedures. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to Matt Taylor with Jefferies. \nMatthew Taylor: So I just wanted to ask one. Because you had this outperformance in the procedures and talked about increased procedure guidance for the year, could you unpack that at all geographically or just by area? It sounds like general surgery is very strong. But just any more color on expectations for procedure growth in these different geographies with some of the fluctuations that we're seeing or by category would be great. \nJamie Samath: Yes, I would say our major international markets, so in Europe, Germany, France, U.K., Italy; in Asia, China, Japan, South Korea, they all performed well in the quarter. They all exceeded our expectations. And what we're seeing within those markets is nice growth in non-urology, so hysterectomy, colorectal, thoracic, depending on the market. We're starting to see, albeit at early stages, some of those procedures in those markets starting to get into an adoption curve. So I think that we're relatively optimistic on the outlook for those markets. Our expectations are reflected in the procedure guidance range that Brian provided . \nMatthew Taylor: And just one follow-up on the kind of the China disruption, how are you seeing that come back now? Are there any other geographies where you're still seeing any notable disruption and any recovery expectations you can provide? \nJamie Samath: So I think Brian described what happened in Q1. We saw an impact in January in China. It started to recover in February and March. I think that the dynamics in China are relatively choppy, and I think it's a relatively dynamic market. So rest of the year, I think, there is relatively hard to predict. With respect to COVID impacts in the other markets, nothing that I would highlight. I do think that the financial pressures, staffing dynamics have as much of an impact in many of the European markets as they do the U.S. \nGary Guthart: Yes, I'll speak to my perspective on China a little bit. I think it's a little bit different market for us than other places. The earlier questioner asked do we think there'll be a backlog and it will recover. Certainly, as they reopen, there'll be a backlog of patients that need to come back to surgery. We're such a tiny part of the overall surgery market, and we're so small relative to the total market size given the constraints of the quota, that how much of that comes to us and go somewhere else is going to be hard for us to predict. We're just going to have to live through it. So that's kind of number one. .\n The second one is the demand side is really high. The demand for additional systems and for training and patient demand for high-quality MIS is really good. We're waiting on clarity on additional quota, which is throttling the market right now. So those are the 2 things that I think have to clear up. We'll see patients come back at some rate. Whether they wait to get a robotic surgery in queue or they jump out of queue to get it, any way that they need to get it, that's going to be hard for us to know personally. And we'll see as the government responds to release of new quota.. \nOperator: And next, we go to Drew Ranieri with Morgan Stanley. \nAndrew Ranieri: Gary, just maybe on placements for a moment, you touched on this earlier. But can you give us any more context specifically in the U.S. of like what you're seeing in terms of capacity expansion versus new accounts, just adopting robotics after 20 years? I would just like to hear your perspective there. And I have a follow-up. \nGary Guthart: I'll kick the first part on expansion into greenfields versus accounts that are already owned to Jamie. I ask you, Jamie, to think a little bit about there's corporate ownership IDNs and there's hospital-level ownership within those IDNs as to whether they had a robotics program or not. So perhaps tease those 2 apart a little bit. \nJamie Samath: If you look at maybe a 5-quarter average, Drew, in the U.S., about 20-ish percent of the persistent placements is for greenfield accounts. But those greenfield accounts are really at hospitals that are part of a regional or national IDN that have not had a robotics program. Generally, they have a higher mix of benign procedures, benign general surgery in particular. And as the IDN at large has seen growing economic and clinical evidence for those procedures, particularly on the economic side, they've started to establish robotics programs in those greenfield accounts, again, as part of an existing IDN that we do business with. If you look at kind of the trend line, last couple of quarters, we've seen a little less greenfield mix in the system placements. I don't know that that's a trend. On a 5- or 6-quarter basis, it's relatively stable. \nGary Guthart: Just adding a little bit to your perspective, as we sit with our IDN-level customers and talk about this, one of the things that has been really exciting for us is, in the last few years, the ability to analyze carefully with the kind of data we can bring and the kind of data those IDNs have in terms of their electronic medical record to both understand which hospitals would benefit from robotic programs and what the total profitability is in their hands when they do it, that resolution has gotten a lot better. The quality of those conversations is fantastic. The confidence, I think, they have to reinvest because they can see the data in their own hands, even if they don't have it at a particular hospital, somewhere in their network, they have it and they can do that analysis. That has changed the nature of the conversation in the last few quarters, and I think you're starting to see a reflection of that now. \nAndrew Ranieri: And Gary, just with about 4,700 systems in the U.S. right now, as you're thinking about competition eventually entering the U.S., kind of what are your thoughts on robotic practices being multidisciplinary in robotic systems versus standardization, which has been kind of a key effort of yours over the past several years? \nGary Guthart: Yes. Thank you. I think that not all customers are the same. There are different customers that have a different mission. Some customers view themselves as wanting to be test sites for anything that comes out, and they will do that. Some customers want to be training facilities and, as a result, want to be able to train anybody from any setting in allcomers. So we're going to see some cross-system sites. \n But I think that's different. I think that's not the majority of the market. I think a lot of the market is going to be interested in great outcomes, high applicability of their systems, so that they can be used across multiple procedure categories and serious dependability. These are now being used more frequently. They're a part of everyday surgery for tens of thousands of surgeons now. And I think in that category, the bulk of the market, repeatability, dependability, outstanding outcomes, great access, great regulatory approvals and a lot of confidence in the company that can deliver it, I think those things are going to be assets. We'll see. I don't have a crystal ball. We'll see how it plays out. But so far, so good. \n We'll go ahead and close from here. Thank you. In closing, we continue to believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions more broadly. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim: better, more predictable patient outcomes; better experiences for patients; better experiences for their care teams; and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. \n We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better where disease are identified earlier and treated quickly, so patients can get back to what matters most. \n Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in 3 months. \nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude the call for today. Thanks for your participation of using AT&T Teleconference.

            "name": "Gary Guthart",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today. Use of our products grew strongly in the first quarter versus a year ago, helped by positive surgical trends and strong execution by our team. New capital installs were likewise strong as customers built their da Vinci and Ion system capacity to meet demand. Revenue grew 14% on the back of this continued adoption. \n Some manufacturing and supply challenges this quarter negatively impacted our product margins. This is an opportunity for sharper execution going forward. Our R&D and innovation engines are making good progress with the strength in Ion adoption, progress in our digital efforts and indication expansions for Ion and SP. Overall, our core business remains strong with some near-term procedure and product cost dynamics that we'll discuss today. \n Starting with procedures, we saw a surprising strength in the quarter led by general surgery in the United States and procedure growth beyond urology outside the United States. On a procedure basis, cholecystectomy, bariatric surgery and hernia repair led the way. \n All our major regions performed well. Standouts included India, Spain, U.K., Japan, Germany and Italy. U.S. performance was significantly above trend, and China is recovering from lows in Q4, though not yet meeting our expected 2023 run rate. \n Given that first quarter of the year exceeded our procedure expectations, we're reviewing underlying drivers. The return of patients to health care providers and diagnostic pipelines post-pandemic continues, with evidence of both an increased patient census and some diagnostic pipelines running above pre-pandemic levels after several years of lag. We also see a commitment by our hospital customers to work through staffing constraints to maintain surgical volume. \n Lastly, customers are expressing confidence in our products as a clinically and economically sustainable path forward for minimally invasive surgery. Taken together, we see continued share gain from open surgery and laparoscopy in several procedures and in several countries as evidence accumulates in our favor. \n Strong growth in procedures and a capable product portfolio has supported a healthy capital placement quarter. Worldwide, we placed 312 da Vinci systems and 55 Ion systems in Q1 compared with 311 da Vinci systems and 34 Ion systems in Q1 2022. \n Capital placements were healthy in the United States, our distribution markets, the U.K. and in India in the quarter. Our product portfolio and our teams are competing effectively with the offerings of a growing set of competitors, notably in OUS markets where customers have had more time to evaluate the relative strengths of our offerings. \n Procedures per system per quarter grew 13% during Q1 versus a year ago. Systems are being used more hours per operating day, and customers are increasing the mix of shorter-duration procedures. Both trends are good, long-term indicators for our business. Customers are finding more value in their systems and are moving more of their procedure volume onto our devices compared to other surgical approaches. \n Turning to our finances. Our revenue growth of 14% reflects the strength of our procedures and capital placements, while average selling prices remained stable. Our margins were pressured primarily by charges taken in our stapling line due to a raw material lot non-conformance that necessitated scrapping instruments. We also experienced lower manufacturing yields during the bring-up of new production lines in our high-volume production facilities to support multiport accessory and Ion catheter growth. Customer availability was briefly impacted for stapling but has since recovered, and we're working on bringing customer stocking levels back to their prior levels. For our Ion catheters and our multiport accessories, we're investing in capabilities to increase yield and robustness in the face of rising demand. We have worked through the issues that drove the bulk of these scrap charges in the quarter.\n Finally, in SG&A and R&D, we're spending roughly to plan while continuing to pursue productivity improvements post-pandemic. Jamie and Brian will take you through our finances and forward outlook in more detail shortly. \n On new products and indications, we've had a productive quarter. We received our CE mark for Ion, and we expect to launch in the U.K. as our first entry into the European region. As we focus on scaling Ion, we initiated our first high-volume production lines in our Mexicali facility, increasing production volume 50% over just the prior quarter. \n In digital, our simulation subscription installed base grew 36% year-over-year as virtual reality training becomes more deeply embedded in the training pathway. Our intuitive hub installed base grew 41% year-over-year and utilization during da Vinci cases grew 80% year-over-year as customers use our Intuitive Hub computing system to record and analyze procedures more routinely. \n Turning to SP. We received new indications for SP in the United States through a 510(k) clearance in urology, covering simple prostatectomy, removal of a noncancerous prostate for treatment of advanced benign prostate hyperplasia. We also installed our first da Vinci SP system in Japan, and they completed their first set of cases. \n For 2023, our priorities are as follows. First, we're focused on increased adoption for our priority procedures in countries through outstanding training, commercial and market access execution. Second, we're pursuing expanded indications and launches for our new platforms. Third, we're focused on excellence and continuity of supply, product quality and services provision as we emerge from pandemic stresses. And finally, we're pursuing increased productivity in our functions that benefit from scale. You can see from our first quarter results the relevance of these priorities and our urgency in pursuing them. \n I'll now turn the time over to Jamie who will take you through our finances in greater detail. Yes. On the first question of what's real pricing out there, there's a few competitors out there, a couple are trumpeting marketing claims about how much they're going to reduce I&A pricing. When we see them in tenders, when we actually see what's written down, we don't see the marketing claim. So I don't know that that's been realized yet or if it's something they want to do in the future, if they're really going to deliver, I don't know. .\n But we do have real-world evidence of engagement in our OUS markets with most of these competitors. And what we find is that the reality is we have a very strong portfolio, we can hit multiple price points because we have different systems that can hit it at different places. The other thing that goes on is that it's more than just whatever a company supplies to get to the total price per procedure. So if a new competitor enters and they have a short procedure set, in other words, they don't have everything you need, the customer will have to go to third-parties to fill it out to finish the case. Often in marketing materials, they don't make that clear, \"Hey, you got to have more to get the case done.\" But in a tender, you do, which is, \"Hey, this is all the stuff that it really takes to get a procedure done.\" \n So we're feeling pretty good about where we are with regard to our ability to deliver economic value that really matters to our customer. I think that we're having real exchanges with them about what that looks like. So that's kind of a baseline. We have been investing in the virtuous cycle, manufacturing capabilities. Some of the capital you hear us investing is both facilities and automation, getting our factories in the right places in the world for logistics and for labor. We're doing those things to be able to lower our product costs, increase our quality as we get volume. That has been lumpy. I wish it was smoother, but it's been a lumpy process for us. \n So the timing for us in terms of price increase is really not about a specific issue. It's not about a specific competitive issue or scrap. It's really around looking at the input costs that we're seeing over the last couple of years and component supply that comes to us from others and labor content, labor costs, and saying, \"Hey, we're going to have to move a little bit here going forward.\" That doesn't diminish the other programs that we've done to make sure we're bringing value to our customers, extended life instruments and other price points that we can help them with. So the first question of kind of breakouts in your estimates, I'll let Jamie answer that, and I'll talk a little bit about Europe. On Europe, this first year, as we go in, we'll be relatively modest in terms of revenue and installs. I think we'll start the process. We're excited about some of the sites and clinical trial work that we need to do. We do have to do some evidence generation in Europe. We do want to look at some of the reimbursement capabilities that are going to be important for broader market access. So year 1 is really about establishing evidence, having the right conversations and building the database so that reimbursement and broader use can be deployed. Just a note, supply chain shocks through the last couple of years depleted inventory. Now we're building it back up. And given some of the lack of smoothness, we're probably holding a little more inventory than we would in more smooth times. That little additional inventory increases risk at some point. So we saw that in this quarter, we will work through it this year, but I think that risk still exists a little bit as inventory levels are higher than they were in the last 2, 3 years as we recover. Yes. I'll let Jamie take the trend data, and I can talk about BPH. It looks like Brian is looking it up. I'm going to do the second question first, and then Brian is going to come back and save the day. On BPH, so there are a lot of different treatments for BPH. It's a quite common condition. At smaller prostate sizes, when it's caught earlier, there are pharmacologic approaches. There are some minimally invasive in-office approaches. Those tend to delay further onset.

            "name": "Jamie Samath",
            "content": "Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. \n Before I dive into the details of our Q1 results, I will expand on the 2 areas of note in the quarter, and as Gary highlighted, procedure growth and gross margin. \n Global procedure growth in Q1 of 26% came in well above our expectations with notable strength in the U.S. where procedures also grew by 26%. As a reminder, procedures in Q1 of last year reflected an adverse impact from COVID in the early part of the quarter in the U.S. and the latter part of the quarter in Korea and China. We believe that the return of patients to normalized health care routines, including diagnostics, and improved staffing levels have positively impacted this quarter's procedures. However, it is difficult to precisely characterize or estimate the degree or duration of this impact. \n Looking at the monthly trends in the U.S., January and February were particularly strong relative to historical seasonality. However, in March, we saw more normalized growth rates. Outside of the U.S. procedure growth of almost 28% was also ahead of our expectations, with growth outperforming expectations across all our major international markets. \n In the first quarter, non-urology procedures represented roughly half of our total OUS procedures and grew 35% from quarter 1 of last year. Brian will provide additional commentary and our updated procedure outlook later in the call. \n Pro forma gross margin in Q1 was below our expectations at 67.2%, lower than last quarter's 68.2% and last year's 69.8%. Q1 results reflected onetime adverse impacts of approximately 100 basis points relating to manufacturing-related issues and an increase in inventory reserves, as Gary detailed. While we largely resolved these onetime items in the quarter, we see opportunity to strengthen our manufacturing operations and improve product costs. This is a priority for our business unit and operations teams and aligns with our capital investment plans, as we described on last quarter's call. \n Turning to other key metrics. In Q1, the installed base of da Vinci systems grew 12% to almost 7,800 systems driven primarily by demand for additional capacity given procedure growth. Average system utilization grew 13% year-over-year, significantly above long-term trends, driven by notable strength in procedure volumes in January and February and by an increasing mix of shorter-duration benign procedures in the U.S. While we do not expect this level of utilization growth to continue, we actively support our customers as they increase utilization of their da Vinci systems which, in turn, lowers their per procedure costs. \n With respect to capital performance, we placed 312 systems in the first quarter, ahead of our expectations, with notable strength in OUS markets. Current quarter placements were roughly even with the 311 systems we placed in the first quarter of last year. There were 67 trade-in transactions in the quarter as compared to 108 last year. Excluding trade-in transactions, net new system placements increased 21% over the first quarter of last year. As of the end of Q1, there are approximately 560 Sis remaining in the installed base, of which approximately 110 are in the U.S. \n Q1 revenue was $1.7 billion, an increase of 14%. On a constant currency basis, first quarter revenue grew approximately 17%. Recurring revenue represented 81% of total revenue and grew 21% over last year driven by procedure growth and an increase in the installed base of systems under operating lease arrangements. Within I&A revenue for our advanced technology categories, stapler and energy, revenue grew a combined 26% over Q1 of last year. \n Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. In the U.S., we placed 141 systems in the first quarter, lower than the 186 systems we placed last year, reflecting a decline of 51 systems associated with trade-in transactions. Outside the U.S., we placed 171 systems in Q1 compared with 125 systems last year. Current quarter system placements included 101 into Europe, 16 into Japan and 18 into China compared with 78 into Europe, 19 into Japan and 9 into China in Q1 of last year. First quarter system placement performance in Europe included 32 placements in the U.K. driven by timing of the NHS budget period, which closes each year at the end of March. We placed 12 systems in India, a quarterly high for us, which, in part, stems from our recent procedure growth there. In Q1, procedures in India grew 55%, albeit from a relatively small base. \n Reviewing the capital performance in the quarter, we do not expect the strength in U.K. and India to repeat in the remainder of the year. Customers, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, continue to be challenged by staffing, inflation, debt servicing costs and other financial pressures. And as a result, we expect customers to continue to be cautious in their overall capital spending. \n Leasing represented 42% of Q1 placements compared with 42% last quarter and 35% last year. We are increasingly seeing customers address system access and capital budget barriers by choosing our usage-based leasing models. The proportion of placements under this structure continue to increase, particularly in the U.S. As a result of this trend and the earlier stage of our leasing program with OUS customers, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time. \n Q1 system average selling prices were $1.47 million as compared to $1.43 million last quarter. The sequential increase in system ASPs was primarily driven by a lower mix of trade-ins. We recognized $24 million of lease buyout revenue in the first quarter compared with $17 million last quarter and $16 million in Q1 of 2022. \n da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,780 compared with approximately $1,820 last quarter and $1,870 last year. On a year-over-year basis, FX negatively impacted I&A per procedure by approximately $40, and ordering patterns in China had a negative impact of approximately $50 per procedure as our channel partners continue to manage their inventory levels in a dynamic environment. On a sequential basis, the primary driver of the decline in I&A per procedure of $40 was customer ordering patterns in the U.S. \n Turning to our Ion platform. In Q1, we placed 55 Ion systems as compared to 34 in Q1 of 2022. First quarter Ion procedures of approximately 10,200 increased 159% as compared to last year. During the quarter, we received CE mark clearance for our Ion platform in Europe where we will initially focus on the U.K. market and on the collection of clinical data in support of our European reimbursement strategy. Regulatory processes for Ion continue to progress in Korea and China. Ten of the systems placed in the first quarter were SP systems, including our first placement in Japan following clearance last quarter. SP procedures grew by 37% and average system utilization increased by 12% compared to Q1 of last year. \n Moving on to the rest of the P&L. As previously referenced, pro forma gross margin for Q1 was 67.2%. And in addition to the onetime impacts described earlier, pro forma gross margin reflects the impact of higher component and labor costs and, relative to the year-ago period, a stronger U.S. dollar. Gross margin for our Ion platform is currently considerably below our da Vinci business, resulting in an adverse mix impact to gross margin given the higher growth rates of our Ion business. The key area of focus for our Ion and manufacturing teams over the next 18 months is to improve supply stresses, strengthen manufacturing capabilities and lower our product costs. \n I&A prices have remained the same for the life of Xi. However, given the durability of component cost increases throughout the pandemic, we are executing an increase to the list price of da Vinci I&A from approximately 5% over the next couple of months. This increase reflects only a portion of the increased component labor costs reflected in our gross margin. We expect the impact of this decision to be an increase in revenue and operating profit of approximately $100 million in 2023. \n First quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 20% year-over-year driven primarily by increased head count added throughout last year, higher variable compensation, higher travel costs and increased expenses associated with customer training. Operating expenses were moderately above our expectations due to higher variable compensation and training costs related to our procedure performance in the quarter. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up 1%, including the annual reset of certain payroll taxes. Head count increased by approximately 330 in Q1, of which roughly half are in support of revenue growth. \n Capital expenditures in Q1 were $197 million, primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities footprint and increase manufacturing capacity, including automation of certain production lines. \n Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 22.1%, consistent with our expectations. First quarter pro forma net income was $437 million or $1.23 per share compared with $413 million or $1.13 per share for the first quarter of last year. \n I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $355 million or $1 per share for the first quarter of 2023 compared with GAAP net income of $366 million and also $1 per share for the first quarter of 2022. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, gains and losses on strategic investments. \n We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $6.6 billion compared with $6.7 billion at the end of last year. The sequential reduction in cash and investments reflected share repurchases and capital expenditures partially offset by cash from operating activities. \n During the quarter, we spent $350 million to repurchase 1.5 million of our shares at an average price of $230 per share. From the beginning of 2022 through the end of Q1 this year, we have repurchased 12.6 million shares at an average price of $234 per share and have $1.1 billion remaining under current Board authorization to repurchase our shares. \n And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2023. Travis, this is Jamie. I think there are 4 drivers on the 26%. We do think there's a little bit of a soft comp on the base period given some impacts from COVID in Q1 of '22. You have 3 other drivers. We think there is some backlog effect from patients generally returning to more normalized health care routines given the effect of the pandemic over several years. Included within that is diagnostic pipelines, we see the last year or so of diagnostic pipelines being above pre-Covid levels. Second effect, there is some strength in the U.S. in general surgery, particularly behind general surgery. And in our OUS markets, the non-urology side of our procedure categories are growing nicely. .\n We also think that relative to Q4, staffing has improved. It's not where it was pre-COVID, but I think that's allowed for some incremental procedures to be performed. We don't have good estimates as to where the kind of various outperformance is between those categories that we described, market data lags there. Certainly, there's some market share gains, particularly in benign general surgery in the U.S. \n What was the second part of your question, Travis? Yes. January, in particular, was very strong. That also probably reflects in part a little bit of the comp. February continues to be strong, and I characterize March as a normalized growth rate. I'm not going to give you the percentages, though, I think that can be misleading. Early part of April, it's difficult to look at just a couple of weeks. But I'd say generally, it's consistent with what we've seen in March. We've seen some third-party data through end of February, just with respect to total U.S. inpatient admissions, and that shows kind of the same trends in terms of a strong January, February. Yes. So the 5% is in the vast majority of our markets, a couple of smaller markets, where local dynamics are such that we have to take a look at that more carefully. That doesn't go into effect for the full year, that's in the next couple of months that we'll implement that. I think if you look at the gross margin impact of the $100 million, depending on where you're modeling revenue, I think you have to do it with and without revenue and gross margin dollars to do the impact to gross margin percentage. I think it's less than the number that you described. And yes, it is reflected in the gross margin guidance that we provided. So what you have there is the puts and takes of the Q1 performance, our updated outlook for the rest of the year and then you add in the effect of the price increase. Yes. I would say that the environment is still challenging for hospitals. There's no question that they are encountering relatively significant financial pressures. Generally, we see customers, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, prioritizing their capital investment dollars based on where they see the greatest ROIs and where they have opportunities to gain market share. And so us, where we see that evidence is in where they start to have procedure growth, that means they're out of capacity and they look to invest in da Vinci to expand capacity given the economic evidence that they've accumulated with the experience of their programs. \n Hard to answer your question directly in terms of what would the capital environment be if it were in, let's say, normalized times. For us, I think we're focused on this period on offering customers flexibility in how they acquire capital, meeting them with their financial objectives and serving their objectives in expanding their robotic programs. Yes. I would say roughly, depending on where you are in the range, Q2 and Q3 operating expenses should be roughly similar to Q1, and you start to see a less of effect just from the payroll tax reset in Q2 and Q3 as those max out, and you should see Q4 seasonally higher. It's a little early at this point. It's 2% to 3% of procedures and revenue. I think we want to give it a little more time, get a little more experience in the marketplace, execute some of the commercial activities that we have for the year. When it becomes a bigger portion of the total, maybe a year from now, we would look to do some guidance and give greater disclosure. I would just add, Jayson, there may be still some unmet backlog in China. If there is, it's probably relatively small, and it's captured within the procedure range that we provided. Yes, there was not an impact to revenue that I'd highlight in Q1. It was really just the gross margin impact of about 100 basis points that we highlighted. With respect to inventory, if I just look at the big picture, we've been trying to replenish inventory targets for each of our critical parts for some time. We've been supply constrained for a good portion of the pandemic. Inventory health improved in Q1 relative to Q4, but we still have a number of parts where we have to get to our target levels. And that will probably take us over the course of the rest of the year. The '22 procedure growth rate for SP, I think... Yes. If I just take '22 as a whole, SP procedures grew 38%, so relatively consistent. Relative to trend lines, we saw benign strength in GYN also. So benign GYN growth rates were higher than we've seen in recent times and higher than long-term trend rates. And we think that speaks to kind of this backlog of patients' return to normal health care routines, et cetera. That's part of what's reflected in those growth rates. Yes, I would say our major international markets, so in Europe, Germany, France, U.K., Italy; in Asia, China, Japan, South Korea, they all performed well in the quarter. They all exceeded our expectations. And what we're seeing within those markets is nice growth in non-urology, so hysterectomy, colorectal, thoracic, depending on the market. We're starting to see, albeit at early stages, some of those procedures in those markets starting to get into an adoption curve. So I think that we're relatively optimistic on the outlook for those markets. Our expectations are reflected in the procedure guidance range that Brian provided . So I think Brian described what happened in Q1. We saw an impact in January in China. It started to recover in February and March. I think that the dynamics in China are relatively choppy, and I think it's a relatively dynamic market. So rest of the year, I think, there is relatively hard to predict. With respect to COVID impacts in the other markets, nothing that I would highlight. I do think that the financial pressures, staffing dynamics have as much of an impact in many of the European markets as they do the U.S. If you look at maybe a 5-quarter average, Drew, in the U.S., about 20-ish percent of the persistent placements is for greenfield accounts. But those greenfield accounts are really at hospitals that are part of a regional or national IDN that have not had a robotics program. Generally, they have a higher mix of benign procedures, benign general surgery in particular. And as the IDN at large has seen growing economic and clinical evidence for those procedures, particularly on the economic side, they've started to establish robotics programs in those greenfield accounts, again, as part of an existing IDN that we do business with. If you look at kind of the trend line, last couple of quarters, we've seen a little less greenfield mix in the system placements. I don't know that that's a trend. On a 5- or 6-quarter basis, it's relatively stable."

Q3 of 2024 was a good quarter for us with healthy procedure growth, solid capital placements and strong operational execution in a dynamic global environment. I'll kick off by providing a perspective on our platforms and our regions. Starting with our multiport system, we now have an install base of roughly 9,300 globally. Our five-year procedure compound annual growth rate in multi-port has been 17% with approximately 16 million total patients treated using DaVinci multi-port platforms of which approximately 10 million were in the past five years. Manufacturing logistics and service capability has increased over the past several years, helping assure availability for our customers, while managing margins. System stability taken across our multi-port product lines has been outstanding, setting a standard for dependability. We launched our fifth generation multi-port system in March this year and have installed 188 today with over 12,000 procedures completed using DaVinci 5 in roughly six months. DaVinci 5 is bringing outstanding improvements for surgeons, care teams, and hospitals in addition to first of their kind features that we think will improve patient outcomes. We're moving towards our broad launch and are well into the process of securing additional global regulatory clearances for DaVinci 5, which you'll hear about later in the call. Turning to our endoluminal system, we launched Ion in Q3 of 2019. Today, the Ion install base is 736, of which 722 are in the United States. Physicians have completed more than 150,000 lung biopsies using Ion to-date, each one of which uses a machine learning created anatomically segmented lung model based on the patient specific anatomy, personalized digital intervention for every case. Our five-year compound annual growth rate for Ion procedures has been 205%. There are over 100 peer-reviewed articles assessing Ion. Overall safety and accuracy data has been outstanding. Over the past year, we have focused on excellence in product quality, product availability, and customer experience. We have updated Ion with significant feature and software upgrades 5 times since its launch, and have made dozens of improvements to our catheters and vision probes. Over the next two years, we'll expand our efforts to place systems beyond the United States, to continue system and software innovation, to increase utilization in existing U.S. accounts, and in continued pursuit of additional indication. We launched DaVinci SP in Q3 of 2018 and the installed base now stands at 243. SP procedures have been growing at a five-year category of 55% with 67,000 total procedures completed to-date. We've seen strong SP performance in Korea encouraging early growth in Europe and Japan and have increased our cadence of regulatory activity globally to broaden its applicability. The SP clinical evidence base stands at over 500 peer review journal articles. SP has found stronger uptake outside the United States as clinical indications in Europe, Japan, Korea, and now Taiwan are broader than the U.S. Our SP team is focused on extending our instrument lineup, including stapling and advanced energy, on increasing indications in the U.S., on enabling proctoring networks in global markets, and on next generation SP system innovation. In our digital efforts, nearly 3,000 DaVinci virtual reality simulators are in the installed base, and surgeons complete approximately 15,000 hours of training on simulators per quarter. Our active surgeon users for My Intuitive app now exceed 14,000. Intuitive Hub is enabled in approximately 2,000 operating rooms. We have performed our analytics program custom hospital analytics over 4,000 times and at a run rate of several hundred per quarter. Our digital team is focused on three enabling pillars: digital tools that improve outcomes in the OR and interventional suite, tools that help create better care teams faster, and tools that drive efficiencies and lower total cost of ownership, all while pursuing outstanding capabilities in cybersecurity and data privacy. Dave will touch on our digital progress shortly. Regionally, we have been investing to build a balanced country and regional teams that allow us to serve customers globally with high-quality interactions. These include commercial activity, pair engagement, R&D, logistics, and production capabilities in region. This has been a multi-year effort that has increased customer satisfaction and strengthened our global capability. Our five-year compound annual growth rate for procedures in the Europe region has been 21%. In the Asia region, our five-year procedure CAGR has been 25%. And other markets outside the U.S. it has been 18%. Reimbursement coverage for robot-assistant surgery has been obtained or expanded for dozens of procedures in many of the countries we serve. That said, we're still relatively early in our opportunity to localize our capabilities to serve more patients around the world. Overall, our teams have been strengthening our ability to serve our customers globally at industrial scale, expanding the applicability of robot-assisted surgery and other interventions by pursuing new platforms, products and services, and obtaining new clinical indications. We've also been strengthening our digital ecosystem to support our customers and our company with high quality data and insight. The opportunity to improve outcomes for patients and our customers quintuple aim through advanced technology ecosystems like ours is bigger than ever and we are focused on discipline execution to get there. I now turn the time over to Dave to take you through clinical R&D and operational updates.\nDave Rosa: Thank you, Gary. Starting with procedures, DaVinci procedure growth in the quarter was 18%, aided by an additional business day relative to Q3 2023. Growth again centered on general surgery in the U.S., with accretive contributions to the global growth rate from Japan, Germany, France, and the U.K. In Asia, we have mixed market conditions, largely consistent with the first-half of the year. Jamie will describe these dynamics later in the call. Turning to capital, we placed 379 DaVinci systems in the quarter, including 110 DaVinci 5 systems and 21 SP systems. We also installed 58 Ion systems in the quarter. Capital placements were solved in the U.S., Japan, India, and our distribution markets, and capital pressure in Europe and China continued. System utilization, defined as procedures per installed clinical system per quarter, grew 4% globally year-over-year for our multi-port platforms, 9% for SP, and 11% for Ion. Turning to our finances, revenue grew 17% in the quarter and spending was within our expectations. Our spending reflects investment in research and development to support the growth of our platforms and digital tools, expansion of our manufacturing facilities, and planned leverage from our enabling functions. Jamie will take you through our finances in greater detail later in the call. In Q3, we continued our measured rollout of DaVinci 5 placing 110 systems as the launch progresses in line with our plans. We are encouraged by broad use of the platform across specialties with customers expressing a preference for DaVinci 5. Last month, about 1,200 healthcare professionals gathered at our annual user conference, Intuitive 360, to highlight various aspects of their robotic programs. Customers have completed over 12,000 cases with DaVinci 5, and several presented their early case data around efficiency and force feedback. A number of customers have reported console time savings when comparing DaVinci 5 to Xi, and we look forward to broader analyses as more data becomes available. For force feedback, Dr. Laila Rashidi from MultiCare Health in Tacoma, a leading voice on gentler surgery and its impact on recovery for her colorectal patients, described her results. Even with her focus on managing surgical forces, Dr. Rashidi\u2019s initial cases with DaVinci 5 show a further reduction in force of about 20% when force feedback is used. Force feedback is a complex technology that we have been pursuing for more than two decades, and it stems from a belief that less force on tissue can lead to improved patient experiences. We also believe force feedback may accelerate learning for care teams, and we will continue to study the use of force feedback with our customers. We expect more publications over the coming quarters, and our teams continue working hard to improve product margin and increase supply of force feedback instruments. As we have said before, maturing these insights will take time. Turning to our digital efforts, we believe that digital innovations on our DaVinci and Ion platforms can extract unique clinical and operational insights. Coupled with electronic medical record data, these insights should become a core part of improving outcomes, learning, and efficiencies in the future. To-date, we have data from millions of procedures that enable customers to review operational metrics, such as instruments used, procedure duration, and more. In addition, hundreds of thousands of these cases are connected to corresponding de-identified electronic medical records, enabling certain clinical and operational hypotheses to be tested. Case insights is our new analytical tool in My Intuitive that will add kinematic, force feedback, and video data to physicians' post-operative case reports, further enabling analyses to identify a connection between DaVinci system data and clinical or operational outcomes. We are at the early stages of innovative technology we believe will be powerful, but it will require rapid cycles of innovation and take time to build validated data sets. In Q3, we submitted our CE technical file in Europe. Last week, we received clearance for DaVinci 5 in Korea and are back and forth in the regulatory process in Japan. This quarter, we began shipping our DaVinci 5 broad launch hardware and completed a software update that addresses aspects of early customer feedback. We are driving toward broad launch mid-year of 2025 when we expect to be at scale on our manufacturing operations and will have released a software update enabling the integrated hub and simulator along with various digital and imaging features. Moving to instruments and accessories, in Q3 we obtained 510(k) clearance for our 8 millimeter SureForm 30 stapler expanding our advanced instrument portfolio of SureForm staplers that currently includes 12 millimeter versions of 60, 45, and 30-millimeter lengths. 8-millimeter SureForm 30 is primarily used in cases where the decreased diameter enables surgeons to better visualize and access tissue and tight spaces as often seen in thoracic or kidney procedures. We are starting our commercial journey in China with Ion, where we placed two systems and saw physicians perform their first cases. We will begin working with a number of medical centers to collect data that will inform our broader commercialization strategy in the country. In Europe, our early launch expanded into Germany and Italy. Turning to SP, in the quarter we received clearance with broad indications in Taiwan similar to Korea, Japan, and Europe. We also completed a U.S. 510(k) submission for a colorectal indication. Commercialization in Europe continues according to plan and we're encouraged by early customer interest for SP. Now I'd like to share with you some recently published peer review literature that we found to be notable. In addition to the specific data highlighted on this call, we encourage you to consider the wide body of evidence detailing these topics in published scientific studies over the years. In August, at the 2024 American Association for Oncology and Interventional Pulmonology Annual Conference, Dr. Bryan Husta from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center presented results from the CONFIRM study. CONFIRM is a prospective multi-center study evaluating outcomes from the integrated Ion Endoluminal System and Mobile Cone Beam CT in the biopsy of pulmonary nodules less than 2 centimeters in size. 155 patients from six centers throughout the U.S. were involved. With a median nodule size of 14 millimeters, the integrated platform enabled a tool-in nodule rate of 99.4%, with a diagnostic yield of 90% and zero pneumothorax observed. Subgroup analysis demonstrated consistent results across all centers, with high diagnostic yields observed regardless of nodule size, location, or presence of CT bronchus sign. The presented conclusion noted \u201cintegrated shape sensing robotic assisted bronchoscopy and mobile cone beam CT demonstrated a high diagnostic yield and excelled the safety for small complex nodules with reproducible results across physicians and institutions. These results suggested that integrated platform may be able to compete with a trans-thoracic biopsy approach in small nodules.\u201d Earlier this year, Dr. Maegawa from the Department of surgery at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, published in the journal surgery, a study comparing robotic and laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures for benign indications performed in 2022. Using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Database, over 59,000 patients were included in this study with over 53,000 in the laparoscopic arm and approximately 5,500 in the robotic assisted arm. Through a multivariable logistic regression analysis, which controlled for confounding factors, patients undergoing a robotic-assisted cholecystectomy had an 18% lower chance of experiencing a serious complication, as well as a 56% lower chance of a conversion to open and 24% lower risk of requiring hospitalization for more than 24 hours. The authors also looked at elective cholecystectomies only and reported a 46% lower chance of conversion to open, 59% lower chance of re-operation, and 30% lower odds of a hospitalization over 24 hours associated with robotic-assisted cholecystectomies. The authors concluded \u201cusing a large and recent national surgical database, the study showed that overall robotic cholecystectomies were independently associated with a lower risk of serious complications, lower rate of conversions to open, and lower risk of hospitalization greater than 24 hours when compared to laparoscopy. These findings suggest that the adoption of new technologies might enhance the safety of minimally invasive surgery in selected cases.\u201d In closing, we are committed to our 2024 priorities, supporting our measured launch of DaVinci 5 and our other new platforms by region, supporting surgeons' adoption of focused procedures, continuing to improve product quality and margins, and finally improving productivity in those functions that benefit from global scale. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie, who will take you through our finances and procedure highlights in greater detail.\nJamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis and will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Core metrics continue to be strong in Q3 with DaVinci procedure growth of 18%, installed base growth of DaVinci systems of 15%, and overall DaVinci system utilization up 3%. Procedure growth in Q3 benefited from a higher number of business days compared to the year ago period. On a day adjusted basis, Q3 procedure growth was 17%. U.S. procedures grew 16% driven by growth in benign general surgery. On a day adjusted basis, bariatrics procedures in the U.S. declined in the mid-single-digit range, similar to last quarter. OUS procedures grew 24%, reflecting strong growth in general surgery, gynecology, and thoracic procedures. Within our OUS markets, growth was strong in the U.K. and India and solid in Japan, Germany, France, and Italy. Procedure growth in South Korea improved from the prior quarter but was still below longer term historical trends given the ongoing precision strike. In China, procedure growth was below the corporate average given recent system placement trends reflecting several market dynamics that we have previously described and domestic robotic competition. With respect to capital performance, we placed 379 systems in the third quarter, compared with 312 systems in Q3 of last year. In the U.S., we placed 219 systems in quarter three, compared to 159 systems placed in Q3 of last year. U.S. system placements in the quarter included 110 DaVinci 5 placements. As supply of DaVinci 5 increases and we move into broad launch mid-next year, we expect that placements in the U.S. will progressively shift toward transactions. Outside the U.S., we placed 160 systems in quarter three, compared with 153 systems last year. Excluding trading transactions, net new system placements in OUS markets increased 28% year-over-year. Q3 system placements included 65 into Europe, 39 into Japan, and 14 into China, compared with 60 into Europe, 32 into Japan, and 10 into China in quarter three of last year. Placements in Europe continue to be challenged by ongoing government budget pressures impacting healthcare capital spending. Third quarter revenue was $2 billion, an increase of 17% from last year, driven by DaVinci procedure growth, expansion of the DaVinci installed base, and growth in our Ion business. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth was also 17%. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: leasing represented 58% of Q3 placements, higher than recent periods, reflecting relative capital strength in the U.S., where a much greater proportion of our customers prefer to lease systems. Q3 system average selling prices were $1.51 million, as compared to $1.4 million last year. Higher year-over-year system ASPs reflected a higher mix of DaVinci 5 and a lower mix of trade-ins. We'd recognize $24 million of lease buyout revenue in quarter three, compared with $28 million last quarter and $17 million last year. DaVinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,800, flat to the prior quarter and lower than last year's $1,830. The year-over-year decline in I&A per procedure was primarily driven by a lower mix of bariatrics procedures and a higher mix of procedures in markets served by distributors. Turning to our Ion platform, procedures grew 73% to approximately 25,000 procedures in the third quarter. In Q3, we placed 58 Ion systems, compared to 55 last year and 74 last quarter. As a reminder, first-half Ion placements reflected a catch up of backlog as supply of catheters and vision probes improved. Q3 Ion system placements included three placements in Europe and our first two placements in China. The install base of Ion systems increased 50% year-over-year to 736 systems, of which 296 are under operating lease arrangements. Third quarter SP procedure growth was 70%, with strong multi-specialty growth in Korea, strong growth in the U.S., and early-stage growth in Japan and Europe. 21 of the systems placed in the quarter were SP systems, of which 15 placements were in OUS markets. The SP installed base grew 54% from the year ago quarter to 243 systems. Moving on to the rest of the P&L, pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 69.1%, compared with 68.8% for the third quarter of 2023 and 70% last quarter. The year-over-year improvement in pro forma gross margin primarily reflects leveraged or fixed overhead, lower component costs, and lower logistics costs, partially offset by higher inventory reserves. During the quarter we opened our new system manufacturing facility at our East Coast Hub in Peachtree Corners, Georgia, commencing production of X and Xi systems at that site. We also opened our new Global Capability Centre in Bangalore, India, where we are co-locating our local commercial and training teams and the global center for IT and other shared service resources. As a reminder, given recent and ongoing capital investments, we expect a significant increase in depreciation expense in 2025 as we bring online additional facilities. Third quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 13%, compared with last year, driven by higher headcount, increased legal expenses, and higher customer facing activities. Consistent with the last couple of years, we have held pro forma R&D expenses at roughly 11% of revenue given our prioritization of investments in innovation that drive the quintuple aim and our growth. SG&A expenses continue to leverage as we benefit from prior investments that allow us to scale efficiently with growth. During the quarter we added approximately 617 employees, of which just over half were in our high volume I&A manufacturing facility in Mexicali to support procedure growth. On a year-to-date basis, through Q3 2024, pro forma operating margin was 36% of revenue, an increase of 184 basis points, compared to the same period in 2023 driven by higher gross margin and leverage of SG&A expenses. As a result of revenue growth and higher operating margins, on a year-to-date basis, pro forma EPS increased 25% from the prior year. Pro forma other income was $94.6 million for Q3, higher than $79.4 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher interest income. Given the interest rate environment, we expect that the average interest yield on our cushion investments will decline going into 2025. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 20.5%, reflecting discrete benefits of approximately $12 million, primarily relating to the expiration of statutory limitations for certain tax reserves and an adjustment to our deferred tax assets. Third quarter 2024 pro forma net income was $669 million or $1.84 per share, compared with $524 million or $1.46 per share for the third quarter of last year. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $565 million or $1.56 per share for the third quarter of 2024, compared with GAAP net income of $416 million or $1.16 per share for the third quarter of 2023. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee equity plans, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, litigation charges, and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended Q3 with cash and investments of $8.3 billion, higher than the $7.7 billion we ended last quarter. The sequential increase in cash and investments reflected cash generated from operating activities partially offset by capital expenditures of $248 million. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brandon to discuss our updated outlook.\nBrandon Lamb: Thank you, Jamie. I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2024, starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecasted full-year 2024 procedure growth within a range of 15.5% and 17%. We are now raising the low end from 15.5% to 16% and expect full-year 2024 procedure growth within a range of 16% and 17%. The low-end of the range assumes further softening and bariatric procedures along with increasing headwinds in Asia from physician strikes in Korea and from delayed tenders in domestic robotic systems in China impacting capital placements and therefore procedure growth. At the high end of the range, we assume bariatric stabilizes at current quarter growth rates and headwinds in Korea and China do not get worse. The range does not reflect significant impact to elective procedures as a result of IV shortages or other hurricane-related impacts. Turning to gross profit, we continue to expect pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of 68.5% and 69% of net revenue. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter, depending largely on product, regional, and trading mix and the impact of new product introductions. Turning to operating expenses, on our last call we forecasted full0year 2024 pro forma operating expense growth to be within a range of 10% and 13%. We are now lowering the high-end of our estimate and expect full-year 2024 pro forma operating expense growth to be within a range of 10% and 12%. We expect non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $670 million and $690 million in 2024. We are increasing our estimate for other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $325 million and $345 million in 2024. With regard to capital expenditures, we continue to estimate a range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, primarily for planned facility construction activities. With regard to income tax, we expect the pro forma income tax rate for 2024 to be within a range of 22% and 23% of pre-tax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to the first question in queue. Travis Steed, Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nTravis Steed: Maybe just a little more on thinking about the DV5 ramp between now and the mid-2025 broad launch, do you expect to make any more upgrades or add software? And I'd love to dig in a little bit on the customer reactions to some of the contribution margin benefits, contribution margin benefits of DV5, kind of, what you're seeing there on the early data and if hospital CFOs are resonating with some of that early profitable data for DV5?\nDave Rosa: Hey Travis, this is Dave. I will answer some of your questions around kind of where are we going from here to broad launch? So in terms of software updates, we'll continue to make them as they're scheduled in our plans. And you'll see those come out on a semi-routine basis. We have to get to broad launch as described in my comments, we have a release that will enable some of that hardware and some additional software features in that broad launch time frame. For the supply side of DV5, we expect that to increase modestly quarter-over-quarter as we get into next year and into broad launch. On the contribution margin side, maybe Jamie, over to you.\nJamie Samath: Yes, I'd just say that obviously there was a publication in one of the executive publications that we assisted with. It was illustrative in terms of the contribution margin gains that an institution might get given what we're seeing with respect to efficiency. We have a number of early surgeons that are KOLs that have sophistication in terms of use of DaVinci that are reporting improvements in console time, and that allows for both efficiency in the given procedure and perhaps the opportunity to have higher throughput on the platform. And I think that's part of the conversation with administration. I'd say that's early and I think we look to collect evidence and validation as we get into the broad launch. But early feedback from a number of our surgeons has been focused on the efficiency gains they've seen.\nOperator: And we'll go to the next question Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thanks for taking the question. One on international for me, one on procedures, if I may. The Korean approval, I think, came earlier than people expected. Do you have supply to launch there right away? And just what's the update on Japan timing? I heard the back and forth in the prepared remarks. And how long are you expecting the review process in Europe to take? And I had one follow-up.\nDave Rosa: Yes, thanks. We do have supply to be able to support Korea demand and so that is true. We have not outlined timing in Japan, so we remain in that back and forth. And then with respect to CE mark in Europe, it's no different from last quarter where we expect that near the end of next year 2025.\nLarry Biegelsen: Got it, that's helpful. And for Dave or Gary, we've heard you and key opinion leaders recently start talking about new procedures such as appendectomy, foregut, hepatobiliary and emergent procedures. Could you please tell us where you are in addressing these from a clinical, regulatory, and commercial standpoint, and how would you size some of these new procedures? Thanks.\nJamie Samath: Yes. With respect to foregut and HPB, we've actually been in those procedures in the U.S. for some time. They've been growing nicely for us. Currently the growth rates for them are accretive to the U.S. average. They are both relatively small categories and that's probably why they haven't gone a lot of air time in terms of our commentary. Appendectomy is much earlier for us. It's quite a small procedure. It is also a creative growth. I think what you're seeing with appendectomy is as surgeons have adopted Xi over time, as they've expanded their kind of taking a practice approach to general surgery, what you see is that then gets extended into emerging care settings, acute care settings, and they start to use Xi more routinely. We have done some clinical work on appendectomy. We do have an indication with the FDA in the U.S. On appendectomy. That's a small procedure for us and obviously is concentrated in immersion settings.\nOperator: Okay, and we'll go to the next question from Robbie Marcus, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRobbie Marcus: Yes, congrats on a great quarter. Two for me might both be for Jamie. I'll let you decide. Maybe first, the margins were once again really impressive, both gross margin and operating margin. Really the question is, how much more room do you feel like there is to go? We're just starting to see DaVinci 5 flow through, and I know there is definitely some depreciation benefit flowing through this year that probably wanes into next year and we're coming off a very heavy investment period. So I guess the question is, as we move forward, how should we think about the margin progression as you have these new products flowing through and the mix starts to evolve?\nJamie Samath: Yes, maybe just some framing first. I think we've consistently said we look to have margins that are kind of top tier with respect to our med tech peers. We've also said that we don't have a management expectation to have our op margins above 40%. I know they were at that level back pre-COVID, but we don't have a management objective to be back at that level and that's just us balancing the rate of investment with what we think is the right level of profitability. We were 37% of margin this quarter, 36% year-to-date. What I would expect is for 2025 on the gross margin front just given the significant incremental depreciation that we've described, you should expect gross margins to be a little lower next year as we start to take on board that incremental depreciation expense. And you'll have a period as those new facilities come online where, in fact, we're period expensing that depreciation, because you're early in the phase of kind of ramping production in those facilities versus capitalizing them into inventory. I think what we've said in the mid-term is we have the opportunity, we think, on gross margin to get back to 70%. That's our aspiration. But if you think about where we are right now, year-to-date, 36%, we don't have a management objective to be above 40%. There's a relatively narrow range over the mid-term to improve. The question of what we do over that midterm will also be balanced by how much we invest in R&D, which is going to be a function of the opportunities that we see.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. I appreciate that. And then as a follow-up, as we move into next year and you talked about expect more of the trade-ins coming from DaVinci 5 as you move into full launch. There's an opportunity, obviously, to repurpose and resell some of the refurbished Xis that you get traded in. Just maybe speak to the opportunity there, how we should think about that, and any immediate plans you can talk about. Thanks a lot.\nJamie Samath: Yes, so you should expect us to, as the trading cycle occurs, which by the way we think will be progressive and will occur over multiples of years, as Xis come back, we will, as we've done in the past, refurbish those. That does allow for segmentation that could be site of care segmentation, for example, in the U.S. and segmentation in markets internationally that are more consensitive. We haven't worked through exactly what those plans will be, but you could expect within that framing, that's kind of what we'll do with respect to refurbished Xis.\nOperator: And we'll go to the next line here. David Roman, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nDavid Roman: Thank you and good afternoon everybody. Maybe we can start on Ion. I think if you look in a variety of public forums, there's been a considerable amount of promotional activity both in the U.S. and Europe as you've launched in new markets. Maybe you could help us think about where we are in the Ion launch and adoption curve in each of the target geographies and how we should think about growth in that segment on a go-forward basis? And then I have one P&L follow-up.\nGary Guthart: Sure, I'll take that one. Hi David, it's Gary. In the U.S., I think Ion is progressing well in its first indication of biopsy of suspicious lung nodules. We think it's crossed the chasm. It should be in double-digit prevalence in terms of total biopsy use. So I think there the focus is a little bit less now on the earliest customers. I think the early customers have done great. We're pretty deeply penetrated into those sites of care. And the focus there will be on high utilization, high customer satisfaction, some innovation, and pursuit of additional indications inside the lung using the Ion platform. We're much earlier in our journey outside of the United States. So early experiences so far in Europe first started in the U.K. They're building some momentum off an early base and then early, early steps into Germany. Likewise early, early steps into China. So it's a little bit of a two-phased approach here. In the U.S., a strong move toward high utilization, high satisfaction, moving out of the first concentrated set of customers, and in OUS, it's really initiating the journey in different markets.\nDavid Roman: That's super helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up on the P&L. One of the things that was notable this quarter and has been the past couple is the increased percentage of systems being placed under usage agreements. And it's gone from about 12% earlier this year to about 15% now. Can you have a think about the trajectory of that contribution to the placement model and what that means for the P&L?\nJamie Samath: Well, so those arrangements are a subset of operating leases and obviously those arrangements are where the customer pays for system and service as they use the system. Those arrangements with the customers have an expectation of what the procedures will be done per year. That's reflected in the arrangement. And so then at target economics you should think of it as similar to a regular operating lease that's a fixed payment arrangement and operating leases in general are slightly accretive to a purchase, because of the embedded interest rate in there. Of course, the difference with a usage-based arrangement is then you have the risk of what is the actual usage of the customer in those usage-based arrangements. We have a distribution, as you would expect, in terms of what the usage rates are, and we engage with the customers regularly with respect to what their business plans are, particularly when they're not at the target. In terms of trajectory, obviously you've seen it grow. It is popular with customers. It is a way to both access additional capacity without having to consume capital budgets and it does lower the risk for the customer in terms of taking a new system relative to how well that's going to be utilized. We have provisions and protections in those arrangements for us and for the customer and we look at those routinely. I would expect it to continue to grow, but it's relatively highly penetrated in the U.S. and so that the rate of growth will likely moderate. In the international markets we're at a much earlier stage, so I think that's too early to call in terms of how that might grow.\nOperator: And we'll go to the line of Rick Wise of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nRick Wise: Gary, Dave, everybody. We continue to have a lot of conversations with surgeons, who are interested or potentially interested in DaVinci 5? And I'm not saying this is an accurate sample, but just it's our sample. I get the sense from the larger hospitals, the academic centers, that they're more waiting. They're waiting for dual console availability. And they're saying to me, as our smaller hospitals, that you're more focused right now on I'll call it mid to smaller institutions, non-academic, they're making decisions faster, they're less dependent on a dual console. Is that right? Is that what's going on? And I wonder what a couple things, whether procedure growth implications are affected positively or negatively by that. And when dual console is more available in the middle of next year when you're full-launch, I assume, do we see an acceleration in sort of multi-system, bigger hospital decision-making?\nGary Guthart: Dave, I'll let you speak to just dual console availability and what's going on there, and then we can speak a little bit to what the trends are. We'll answer those questions.\nDave Rosa: Hey Rick, and you said it. So in this, as we're ramping our supply capabilities, console is being prioritized with incremental single system deals. And so as we build our capacity, we will start producing additional consoles for dual system placements. In terms of prioritization and where they're being prioritized, I think our team is working with broad sets of customers and to understand what their needs are and if DaVinci 5 is the right system to meet their needs for their program. And I don't have a lot of information about how that may differ between smaller customers as you put it in academics or larger institutions.\nGary Guthart: I wouldn't anticipate a significant forecast model change one way or another. I think as we go to broad launch and the pipe opens up, we will seek to serve all those customers. I don't think it inflects procedure growth rate one way or another because of dual console and large versus small. I suspect that's a hard analysis to do and if you do it, I suspect the differences will be relatively small relative to what we expect.\nRick Wise: And a quick follow-up, if I could, on Hub. I think it was exciting to hear our in over 2,000 ORs just help us think through the early experience there and maybe the implications for both DaVinci 5 and again, procedures. Thank you.\nGary Guthart: Yes. So Hub as it exists today, and that includes our generation four compatibility as well as those that are linked to Gen 5. What does it do? It's a strong data recorder and media management device. A lot of those early installs are on-premise implementations versus the cloud. Customers enjoy for their ability to track their data and to assess post-op performance, which has been great. Over time, as we move forward and move toward cloud implementations and other things, I think that it provides them a lot of leverage there's a lot that we like about it. I think the core capability is really good. There are some things we want to work on. I think refinement, workflow, making those things really easy integration in DV5 is going to be great. We're really excited about it. I think it matters. So far, so good. I think we're at the beginning of the Hub journey, both in terms of penetration and in terms of future content not the end of it. And I'm proud of the progress the team is making.\nOperator: We're going to go over to the line of Adam Maeder, Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nAdam Maeder: Hi, good afternoon, congrats on the quarter and thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to ask for some additional color around the capital environment and how you're thinking about hospital budgets and appetite for larger piece of the capital heading into the end of the year in 2025. And I heard the commentary around Europe and China, it sounds like there's continued pressure there. Just curious, is that kind of status quo versus the first half of the year? Is it getting worse? And kind of how do you expect that to evolve going forward? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks\nGary Guthart: Jamie, why don't you take the broad answer, and then I'll touch on China at the end.\nJamie Samath: Yes. I think I'd characterize U.S. is relatively stable, albeit with a lot of interest in DaVinci 5. I think that's kind of raised the profile again in interest in robotics to some extent. But I'd characterize the overall capital environment is relatively stable. In Europe, what you're seeing particularly in countries like the U.K. and Germany is pressure on capital spending in the health care space, again, related to government budget pressures that exist there. And I think that's been similar for the last quarter or so. In the case of Europe, we have some government-related events that come in the next couple of quarters, but too early to predict how that might play out in terms of the changes in the capital dynamics.\nGary Guthart: Yes. Just turning to China. There's clearly broad stress across the health care market in total in China, there's kind of a rebaselining there in some of the value-based pricing that has gone through as well as some of the price caps that have gone through in our end of the market. So I think that pressure is still there. I think it will be there for some quarters. I don't think that resolves quickly. There's also in our universe, the entry of some domestic competitors that tend to get provincial preferences, the province in which they're headquartered tends to have a preference for them as they launch. And so you see that kind of show up as popcorn as it goes around. I think that will persist for a little while, too. So for us, I think it's not a surprise given the year we've had. I think ultimately, these things will wash through how long it takes for it to walk through and stabilizes as yet on them.\nOperator: We'll go to the line of Brandon Vazquez, William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Vazquez: Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. You have a good amount of DaVinci 5 systems out there. I was just curious if you could compare and contrast. Are there any kind of unique insights that you have in that DaVinci 5 installed base, whether it's what types of procedures they're doing or utilization within those accounts are those systems relative to the rest of the Xi base? And then maybe just one quick follow-up, I'll throw here now. Can you talk a little bit -- it sounds like innovation on a go-forward basis is really going to be coming a lot from software. Can you kind of compare and contrast the innovation cycle the speed at which you can launch new features on the software side versus what has historically been, I would guess, a little bit of a longer cycle in hardware?\nJamie Samath: Yes. So I may try to hit both of those -- on the DaVinci 5 side and the comparison to Xi, one of the things that we're pleased with is it is being used across a broad set of procedures. And so customers with the limited supply are really using them to their fullest. With respect to how do you compare DaVinci 5 utilization to Xi, it's really too soon to say. The installed base isn't big enough with a long enough history yet to give us a good data set to make those comparisons. On the software side, the -- there's kind of two buckets that we operate in there are sets of software and products that are nonmedical device. And those are able to have more rapid cycles of innovation and our ability to roll it out to the field. And then there is a second set that our 510(k) or governed by regulatory processes around the globe. And those will generally follow a longer cadence, probably still a bit quicker than you would see in major hardware changes and things like that. And so on the average, likely we'll see software upgrades and updates happen on a more -- on a higher cadence, but it kind of depends on which bucket they fall into.\nGary Guthart: I might challenge the assumption a little bit. I think there's still some hardware we want to do. I don't think hardware is going away. I think that's going to continue and DV5 has some opportunities for that, too. and we'll do the software that you just described. I think it's great, but we get a chance to do both. Operator, we'll take one more questioner, and then we'll close.\nOperator: And that's from the line of Matt Miksic, Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMatt Miksic: Thanks so much for squeezing me in. Maybe just a big picture kind of a follow-on question. I get some version of this question often from investors, talking about growth drivers, opportunities in procedure growth. And so maybe if you're looking at the U.S. market and the rate that you're growing now, obviously, where penetration is and where it could go over time. Do you expect maybe in the next couple of years or three years to be driven more by driving deeper into existing procedures and categories? Or do you see any sort of new large segments, important segments that you expect to help drive that growth would you say the mix looks like or any color you'd be able to add would be super helpful? Thanks\nGary Guthart: Yes. Thank you, Matt. It's a great question. I look at. I think in the U.S., we're -- I won't give you the exact split, but I think it's a balanced perspective. Clearly, we have approaching the back half of some curves and some procedures where it's really about depth. What do the folks who have not yet participated or are participating fully, what do they need from us to keep going and to serve the patients that way. There's still opportunity there. In some ways, there's plenty of opportunity. At the same time, as you start getting to the back half, you want to make sure you're looking for, we want to make sure we're looking for new opportunities and opportunities to serve a different set of patients that we haven't engaged before, and you're starting to see us do that, whether it's in new indications for Ion or SP. And we think actually in multiport, there's some opportunity and new indication also, although they'll tend to be more niche markets than really big ones. Over time, over the coming quarters, we'll tell you more about that as those opportunities mature. So thank you. That was our last question. In closing, we believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute intervention. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quintupling, better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams that are access to great care and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you again for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gary Guthart",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today. Q3 of 2024 was a good quarter for us with healthy procedure growth, solid capital placements and strong operational execution in a dynamic global environment. I'll kick off by providing a perspective on our platforms and our regions. Starting with our multiport system, we now have an install base of roughly 9,300 globally. Our five-year procedure compound annual growth rate in multi-port has been 17% with approximately 16 million total patients treated using DaVinci multi-port platforms of which approximately 10 million were in the past five years. Manufacturing logistics and service capability has increased over the past several years, helping assure availability for our customers, while managing margins. System stability taken across our multi-port product lines has been outstanding, setting a standard for dependability. We launched our fifth generation multi-port system in March this year and have installed 188 today with over 12,000 procedures completed using DaVinci 5 in roughly six months. DaVinci 5 is bringing outstanding improvements for surgeons, care teams, and hospitals in addition to first of their kind features that we think will improve patient outcomes. We're moving towards our broad launch and are well into the process of securing additional global regulatory clearances for DaVinci 5, which you'll hear about later in the call. Turning to our endoluminal system, we launched Ion in Q3 of 2019. Today, the Ion install base is 736, of which 722 are in the United States. Physicians have completed more than 150,000 lung biopsies using Ion to-date, each one of which uses a machine learning created anatomically segmented lung model based on the patient specific anatomy, personalized digital intervention for every case. Our five-year compound annual growth rate for Ion procedures has been 205%. There are over 100 peer-reviewed articles assessing Ion. Overall safety and accuracy data has been outstanding. Over the past year, we have focused on excellence in product quality, product availability, and customer experience. We have updated Ion with significant feature and software upgrades 5 times since its launch, and have made dozens of improvements to our catheters and vision probes. Over the next two years, we'll expand our efforts to place systems beyond the United States, to continue system and software innovation, to increase utilization in existing U.S. accounts, and in continued pursuit of additional indication. We launched DaVinci SP in Q3 of 2018 and the installed base now stands at 243. SP procedures have been growing at a five-year category of 55% with 67,000 total procedures completed to-date. We've seen strong SP performance in Korea encouraging early growth in Europe and Japan and have increased our cadence of regulatory activity globally to broaden its applicability. The SP clinical evidence base stands at over 500 peer review journal articles. SP has found stronger uptake outside the United States as clinical indications in Europe, Japan, Korea, and now Taiwan are broader than the U.S. Our SP team is focused on extending our instrument lineup, including stapling and advanced energy, on increasing indications in the U.S., on enabling proctoring networks in global markets, and on next generation SP system innovation. In our digital efforts, nearly 3,000 DaVinci virtual reality simulators are in the installed base, and surgeons complete approximately 15,000 hours of training on simulators per quarter. Our active surgeon users for My Intuitive app now exceed 14,000. Intuitive Hub is enabled in approximately 2,000 operating rooms. We have performed our analytics program custom hospital analytics over 4,000 times and at a run rate of several hundred per quarter. Our digital team is focused on three enabling pillars: digital tools that improve outcomes in the OR and interventional suite, tools that help create better care teams faster, and tools that drive efficiencies and lower total cost of ownership, all while pursuing outstanding capabilities in cybersecurity and data privacy. Dave will touch on our digital progress shortly. Regionally, we have been investing to build a balanced country and regional teams that allow us to serve customers globally with high-quality interactions. These include commercial activity, pair engagement, R&D, logistics, and production capabilities in region. This has been a multi-year effort that has increased customer satisfaction and strengthened our global capability. Our five-year compound annual growth rate for procedures in the Europe region has been 21%. In the Asia region, our five-year procedure CAGR has been 25%. And other markets outside the U.S. it has been 18%. Reimbursement coverage for robot-assistant surgery has been obtained or expanded for dozens of procedures in many of the countries we serve. That said, we're still relatively early in our opportunity to localize our capabilities to serve more patients around the world. Overall, our teams have been strengthening our ability to serve our customers globally at industrial scale, expanding the applicability of robot-assisted surgery and other interventions by pursuing new platforms, products and services, and obtaining new clinical indications. We've also been strengthening our digital ecosystem to support our customers and our company with high quality data and insight. The opportunity to improve outcomes for patients and our customers quintuple aim through advanced technology ecosystems like ours is bigger than ever and we are focused on discipline execution to get there. I now turn the time over to Dave to take you through clinical R&D and operational updates. Sure, I'll take that one. Hi David, it's Gary. In the U.S., I think Ion is progressing well in its first indication of biopsy of suspicious lung nodules. We think it's crossed the chasm. It should be in double-digit prevalence in terms of total biopsy use. So I think there the focus is a little bit less now on the earliest customers. I think the early customers have done great. We're pretty deeply penetrated into those sites of care. And the focus there will be on high utilization, high customer satisfaction, some innovation, and pursuit of additional indications inside the lung using the Ion platform. We're much earlier in our journey outside of the United States. So early experiences so far in Europe first started in the U.K. They're building some momentum off an early base and then early, early steps into Germany. Likewise early, early steps into China. So it's a little bit of a two-phased approach here. In the U.S., a strong move toward high utilization, high satisfaction, moving out of the first concentrated set of customers, and in OUS, it's really initiating the journey in different markets. Dave, I'll let you speak to just dual console availability and what's going on there, and then we can speak a little bit to what the trends are. We'll answer those questions. I wouldn't anticipate a significant forecast model change one way or another. I think as we go to broad launch and the pipe opens up, we will seek to serve all those customers. I don't think it inflects procedure growth rate one way or another because of dual console and large versus small. I suspect that's a hard analysis to do and if you do it, I suspect the differences will be relatively small relative to what we expect. Yes. So Hub as it exists today, and that includes our generation four compatibility as well as those that are linked to Gen 5. What does it do? It's a strong data recorder and media management device. A lot of those early installs are on-premise implementations versus the cloud. Customers enjoy for their ability to track their data and to assess post-op performance, which has been great. Over time, as we move forward and move toward cloud implementations and other things, I think that it provides them a lot of leverage there's a lot that we like about it. I think the core capability is really good. There are some things we want to work on. I think refinement, workflow, making those things really easy integration in DV5 is going to be great. We're really excited about it. I think it matters. So far, so good. I think we're at the beginning of the Hub journey, both in terms of penetration and in terms of future content not the end of it. And I'm proud of the progress the team is making. Jamie, why don't you take the broad answer, and then I'll touch on China at the end. Yes. Just turning to China. There's clearly broad stress across the health care market in total in China, there's kind of a rebaselining there in some of the value-based pricing that has gone through as well as some of the price caps that have gone through in our end of the market. So I think that pressure is still there. I think it will be there for some quarters. I don't think that resolves quickly. There's also in our universe, the entry of some domestic competitors that tend to get provincial preferences, the province in which they're headquartered tends to have a preference for them as they launch. And so you see that kind of show up as popcorn as it goes around. I think that will persist for a little while, too. So for us, I think it's not a surprise given the year we've had. I think ultimately, these things will wash through how long it takes for it to walk through and stabilizes as yet on them. I might challenge the assumption a little bit. I think there's still some hardware we want to do. I don't think hardware is going away. I think that's going to continue and DV5 has some opportunities for that, too. and we'll do the software that you just described. I think it's great, but we get a chance to do both. Operator, we'll take one more questioner, and then we'll close. Yes. Thank you, Matt. It's a great question. I look at. I think in the U.S., we're -- I won't give you the exact split, but I think it's a balanced perspective. Clearly, we have approaching the back half of some curves and some procedures where it's really about depth. What do the folks who have not yet participated or are participating fully, what do they need from us to keep going and to serve the patients that way. There's still opportunity there. In some ways, there's plenty of opportunity. At the same time, as you start getting to the back half, you want to make sure you're looking for, we want to make sure we're looking for new opportunities and opportunities to serve a different set of patients that we haven't engaged before, and you're starting to see us do that, whether it's in new indications for Ion or SP. And we think actually in multiport, there's some opportunity and new indication also, although they'll tend to be more niche markets than really big ones. Over time, over the coming quarters, we'll tell you more about that as those opportunities mature. So thank you. That was our last question. In closing, we believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute intervention. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quintupling, better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams that are access to great care and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you again for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months."

            "name": "Jamie Samath",
            "content": "Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis and will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Core metrics continue to be strong in Q3 with DaVinci procedure growth of 18%, installed base growth of DaVinci systems of 15%, and overall DaVinci system utilization up 3%. Procedure growth in Q3 benefited from a higher number of business days compared to the year ago period. On a day adjusted basis, Q3 procedure growth was 17%. U.S. procedures grew 16% driven by growth in benign general surgery. On a day adjusted basis, bariatrics procedures in the U.S. declined in the mid-single-digit range, similar to last quarter. OUS procedures grew 24%, reflecting strong growth in general surgery, gynecology, and thoracic procedures. Within our OUS markets, growth was strong in the U.K. and India and solid in Japan, Germany, France, and Italy. Procedure growth in South Korea improved from the prior quarter but was still below longer term historical trends given the ongoing precision strike. In China, procedure growth was below the corporate average given recent system placement trends reflecting several market dynamics that we have previously described and domestic robotic competition. With respect to capital performance, we placed 379 systems in the third quarter, compared with 312 systems in Q3 of last year. In the U.S., we placed 219 systems in quarter three, compared to 159 systems placed in Q3 of last year. U.S. system placements in the quarter included 110 DaVinci 5 placements. As supply of DaVinci 5 increases and we move into broad launch mid-next year, we expect that placements in the U.S. will progressively shift toward transactions. Outside the U.S., we placed 160 systems in quarter three, compared with 153 systems last year. Excluding trading transactions, net new system placements in OUS markets increased 28% year-over-year. Q3 system placements included 65 into Europe, 39 into Japan, and 14 into China, compared with 60 into Europe, 32 into Japan, and 10 into China in quarter three of last year. Placements in Europe continue to be challenged by ongoing government budget pressures impacting healthcare capital spending. Third quarter revenue was $2 billion, an increase of 17% from last year, driven by DaVinci procedure growth, expansion of the DaVinci installed base, and growth in our Ion business. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth was also 17%. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: leasing represented 58% of Q3 placements, higher than recent periods, reflecting relative capital strength in the U.S., where a much greater proportion of our customers prefer to lease systems. Q3 system average selling prices were $1.51 million, as compared to $1.4 million last year. Higher year-over-year system ASPs reflected a higher mix of DaVinci 5 and a lower mix of trade-ins. We'd recognize $24 million of lease buyout revenue in quarter three, compared with $28 million last quarter and $17 million last year. DaVinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,800, flat to the prior quarter and lower than last year's $1,830. The year-over-year decline in I&A per procedure was primarily driven by a lower mix of bariatrics procedures and a higher mix of procedures in markets served by distributors. Turning to our Ion platform, procedures grew 73% to approximately 25,000 procedures in the third quarter. In Q3, we placed 58 Ion systems, compared to 55 last year and 74 last quarter. As a reminder, first-half Ion placements reflected a catch up of backlog as supply of catheters and vision probes improved. Q3 Ion system placements included three placements in Europe and our first two placements in China. The install base of Ion systems increased 50% year-over-year to 736 systems, of which 296 are under operating lease arrangements. Third quarter SP procedure growth was 70%, with strong multi-specialty growth in Korea, strong growth in the U.S., and early-stage growth in Japan and Europe. 21 of the systems placed in the quarter were SP systems, of which 15 placements were in OUS markets. The SP installed base grew 54% from the year ago quarter to 243 systems. Moving on to the rest of the P&L, pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 69.1%, compared with 68.8% for the third quarter of 2023 and 70% last quarter. The year-over-year improvement in pro forma gross margin primarily reflects leveraged or fixed overhead, lower component costs, and lower logistics costs, partially offset by higher inventory reserves. During the quarter we opened our new system manufacturing facility at our East Coast Hub in Peachtree Corners, Georgia, commencing production of X and Xi systems at that site. We also opened our new Global Capability Centre in Bangalore, India, where we are co-locating our local commercial and training teams and the global center for IT and other shared service resources. As a reminder, given recent and ongoing capital investments, we expect a significant increase in depreciation expense in 2025 as we bring online additional facilities. Third quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 13%, compared with last year, driven by higher headcount, increased legal expenses, and higher customer facing activities. Consistent with the last couple of years, we have held pro forma R&D expenses at roughly 11% of revenue given our prioritization of investments in innovation that drive the quintuple aim and our growth. SG&A expenses continue to leverage as we benefit from prior investments that allow us to scale efficiently with growth. During the quarter we added approximately 617 employees, of which just over half were in our high volume I&A manufacturing facility in Mexicali to support procedure growth. On a year-to-date basis, through Q3 2024, pro forma operating margin was 36% of revenue, an increase of 184 basis points, compared to the same period in 2023 driven by higher gross margin and leverage of SG&A expenses. As a result of revenue growth and higher operating margins, on a year-to-date basis, pro forma EPS increased 25% from the prior year. Pro forma other income was $94.6 million for Q3, higher than $79.4 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher interest income. Given the interest rate environment, we expect that the average interest yield on our cushion investments will decline going into 2025. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 20.5%, reflecting discrete benefits of approximately $12 million, primarily relating to the expiration of statutory limitations for certain tax reserves and an adjustment to our deferred tax assets. Third quarter 2024 pro forma net income was $669 million or $1.84 per share, compared with $524 million or $1.46 per share for the third quarter of last year. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $565 million or $1.56 per share for the third quarter of 2024, compared with GAAP net income of $416 million or $1.16 per share for the third quarter of 2023. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee equity plans, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, litigation charges, and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended Q3 with cash and investments of $8.3 billion, higher than the $7.7 billion we ended last quarter. The sequential increase in cash and investments reflected cash generated from operating activities partially offset by capital expenditures of $248 million. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brandon to discuss our updated outlook. Yes, I'd just say that obviously there was a publication in one of the executive publications that we assisted with. It was illustrative in terms of the contribution margin gains that an institution might get given what we're seeing with respect to efficiency. We have a number of early surgeons that are KOLs that have sophistication in terms of use of DaVinci that are reporting improvements in console time, and that allows for both efficiency in the given procedure and perhaps the opportunity to have higher throughput on the platform. And I think that's part of the conversation with administration. I'd say that's early and I think we look to collect evidence and validation as we get into the broad launch. But early feedback from a number of our surgeons has been focused on the efficiency gains they've seen. Yes. With respect to foregut and HPB, we've actually been in those procedures in the U.S. for some time. They've been growing nicely for us. Currently the growth rates for them are accretive to the U.S. average. They are both relatively small categories and that's probably why they haven't gone a lot of air time in terms of our commentary. Appendectomy is much earlier for us. It's quite a small procedure. It is also a creative growth. I think what you're seeing with appendectomy is as surgeons have adopted Xi over time, as they've expanded their kind of taking a practice approach to general surgery, what you see is that then gets extended into emerging care settings, acute care settings, and they start to use Xi more routinely. We have done some clinical work on appendectomy. We do have an indication with the FDA in the U.S. On appendectomy. That's a small procedure for us and obviously is concentrated in immersion settings. Yes, maybe just some framing first. I think we've consistently said we look to have margins that are kind of top tier with respect to our med tech peers. We've also said that we don't have a management expectation to have our op margins above 40%. I know they were at that level back pre-COVID, but we don't have a management objective to be back at that level and that's just us balancing the rate of investment with what we think is the right level of profitability. We were 37% of margin this quarter, 36% year-to-date. What I would expect is for 2025 on the gross margin front just given the significant incremental depreciation that we've described, you should expect gross margins to be a little lower next year as we start to take on board that incremental depreciation expense. And you'll have a period as those new facilities come online where, in fact, we're period expensing that depreciation, because you're early in the phase of kind of ramping production in those facilities versus capitalizing them into inventory. I think what we've said in the mid-term is we have the opportunity, we think, on gross margin to get back to 70%. That's our aspiration. But if you think about where we are right now, year-to-date, 36%, we don't have a management objective to be above 40%. There's a relatively narrow range over the mid-term to improve. The question of what we do over that midterm will also be balanced by how much we invest in R&D, which is going to be a function of the opportunities that we see. Yes, so you should expect us to, as the trading cycle occurs, which by the way we think will be progressive and will occur over multiples of years, as Xis come back, we will, as we've done in the past, refurbish those. That does allow for segmentation that could be site of care segmentation, for example, in the U.S. and segmentation in markets internationally that are more consensitive. We haven't worked through exactly what those plans will be, but you could expect within that framing, that's kind of what we'll do with respect to refurbished Xis. Well, so those arrangements are a subset of operating leases and obviously those arrangements are where the customer pays for system and service as they use the system. Those arrangements with the customers have an expectation of what the procedures will be done per year. That's reflected in the arrangement. And so then at target economics you should think of it as similar to a regular operating lease that's a fixed payment arrangement and operating leases in general are slightly accretive to a purchase, because of the embedded interest rate in there. Of course, the difference with a usage-based arrangement is then you have the risk of what is the actual usage of the customer in those usage-based arrangements. We have a distribution, as you would expect, in terms of what the usage rates are, and we engage with the customers regularly with respect to what their business plans are, particularly when they're not at the target. In terms of trajectory, obviously you've seen it grow. It is popular with customers. It is a way to both access additional capacity without having to consume capital budgets and it does lower the risk for the customer in terms of taking a new system relative to how well that's going to be utilized. We have provisions and protections in those arrangements for us and for the customer and we look at those routinely. I would expect it to continue to grow, but it's relatively highly penetrated in the U.S. and so that the rate of growth will likely moderate. In the international markets we're at a much earlier stage, so I think that's too early to call in terms of how that might grow. Yes. I think I'd characterize U.S. is relatively stable, albeit with a lot of interest in DaVinci 5. I think that's kind of raised the profile again in interest in robotics to some extent. But I'd characterize the overall capital environment is relatively stable. In Europe, what you're seeing particularly in countries like the U.K. and Germany is pressure on capital spending in the health care space, again, related to government budget pressures that exist there. And I think that's been similar for the last quarter or so. In the case of Europe, we have some government-related events that come in the next couple of quarters, but too early to predict how that might play out in terms of the changes in the capital dynamics. Yes. So I may try to hit both of those -- on the DaVinci 5 side and the comparison to Xi, one of the things that we're pleased with is it is being used across a broad set of procedures. And so customers with the limited supply are really using them to their fullest. With respect to how do you compare DaVinci 5 utilization to Xi, it's really too soon to say. The installed base isn't big enough with a long enough history yet to give us a good data set to make those comparisons. On the software side, the -- there's kind of two buckets that we operate in there are sets of software and products that are nonmedical device. And those are able to have more rapid cycles of innovation and our ability to roll it out to the field. And then there is a second set that our 510(k) or governed by regulatory processes around the globe. And those will generally follow a longer cadence, probably still a bit quicker than you would see in major hardware changes and things like that. And so on the average, likely we'll see software upgrades and updates happen on a more -- on a higher cadence, but it kind of depends on which bucket they fall into."

            "name": "Dave Rosa",
            "content": "Thank you, Gary. Starting with procedures, DaVinci procedure growth in the quarter was 18%, aided by an additional business day relative to Q3 2023. Growth again centered on general surgery in the U.S., with accretive contributions to the global growth rate from Japan, Germany, France, and the U.K. In Asia, we have mixed market conditions, largely consistent with the first-half of the year. Jamie will describe these dynamics later in the call. Turning to capital, we placed 379 DaVinci systems in the quarter, including 110 DaVinci 5 systems and 21 SP systems. We also installed 58 Ion systems in the quarter. Capital placements were solved in the U.S., Japan, India, and our distribution markets, and capital pressure in Europe and China continued. System utilization, defined as procedures per installed clinical system per quarter, grew 4% globally year-over-year for our multi-port platforms, 9% for SP, and 11% for Ion. Turning to our finances, revenue grew 17% in the quarter and spending was within our expectations. Our spending reflects investment in research and development to support the growth of our platforms and digital tools, expansion of our manufacturing facilities, and planned leverage from our enabling functions. Jamie will take you through our finances in greater detail later in the call. In Q3, we continued our measured rollout of DaVinci 5 placing 110 systems as the launch progresses in line with our plans. We are encouraged by broad use of the platform across specialties with customers expressing a preference for DaVinci 5. Last month, about 1,200 healthcare professionals gathered at our annual user conference, Intuitive 360, to highlight various aspects of their robotic programs. Customers have completed over 12,000 cases with DaVinci 5, and several presented their early case data around efficiency and force feedback. A number of customers have reported console time savings when comparing DaVinci 5 to Xi, and we look forward to broader analyses as more data becomes available. For force feedback, Dr. Laila Rashidi from MultiCare Health in Tacoma, a leading voice on gentler surgery and its impact on recovery for her colorectal patients, described her results. Even with her focus on managing surgical forces, Dr. Rashidi's initial cases with DaVinci 5 show a further reduction in force of about 20% when force feedback is used. Force feedback is a complex technology that we have been pursuing for more than two decades, and it stems from a belief that less force on tissue can lead to improved patient experiences. We also believe force feedback may accelerate learning for care teams, and we will continue to study the use of force feedback with our customers. We expect more publications over the coming quarters, and our teams continue working hard to improve product margin and increase supply of force feedback instruments. As we have said before, maturing these insights will take time. Turning to our digital efforts, we believe that digital innovations on our DaVinci and Ion platforms can extract unique clinical and operational insights. Coupled with electronic medical record data, these insights should become a core part of improving outcomes, learning, and efficiencies in the future. To-date, we have data from millions of procedures that enable customers to review operational metrics, such as instruments used, procedure duration, and more. In addition, hundreds of thousands of these cases are connected to corresponding de-identified electronic medical records, enabling certain clinical and operational hypotheses to be tested. Case insights is our new analytical tool in My Intuitive that will add kinematic, force feedback, and video data to physicians' post-operative case reports, further enabling analyses to identify a connection between DaVinci system data and clinical or operational outcomes. We are at the early stages of innovative technology we believe will be powerful, but it will require rapid cycles of innovation and take time to build validated data sets. In Q3, we submitted our CE technical file in Europe. Last week, we received clearance for DaVinci 5 in Korea and are back and forth in the regulatory process in Japan. This quarter, we began shipping our DaVinci 5 broad launch hardware and completed a software update that addresses aspects of early customer feedback. We are driving toward broad launch mid-year of 2025 when we expect to be at scale on our manufacturing operations and will have released a software update enabling the integrated hub and simulator along with various digital and imaging features. Moving to instruments and accessories, in Q3 we obtained 510(k) clearance for our 8 millimeter SureForm 30 stapler expanding our advanced instrument portfolio of SureForm staplers that currently includes 12 millimeter versions of 60, 45, and 30-millimeter lengths. 8-millimeter SureForm 30 is primarily used in cases where the decreased diameter enables surgeons to better visualize and access tissue and tight spaces as often seen in thoracic or kidney procedures. We are starting our commercial journey in China with Ion, where we placed two systems and saw physicians perform their first cases. We will begin working with a number of medical centers to collect data that will inform our broader commercialization strategy in the country. In Europe, our early launch expanded into Germany and Italy. Turning to SP, in the quarter we received clearance with broad indications in Taiwan similar to Korea, Japan, and Europe. We also completed a U.S. 510(k) submission for a colorectal indication. Commercialization in Europe continues according to plan and we're encouraged by early customer interest for SP. Now I'd like to share with you some recently published peer review literature that we found to be notable. In addition to the specific data highlighted on this call, we encourage you to consider the wide body of evidence detailing these topics in published scientific studies over the years. In August, at the 2024 American Association for Oncology and Interventional Pulmonology Annual Conference, Dr. Bryan Husta from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center presented results from the CONFIRM study. CONFIRM is a prospective multi-center study evaluating outcomes from the integrated Ion Endoluminal System and Mobile Cone Beam CT in the biopsy of pulmonary nodules less than 2 centimeters in size. 155 patients from six centers throughout the U.S. were involved. With a median nodule size of 14 millimeters, the integrated platform enabled a tool-in nodule rate of 99.4%, with a diagnostic yield of 90% and zero pneumothorax observed. Subgroup analysis demonstrated consistent results across all centers, with high diagnostic yields observed regardless of nodule size, location, or presence of CT bronchus sign. The presented conclusion noted \u201cintegrated shape sensing robotic assisted bronchoscopy and mobile cone beam CT demonstrated a high diagnostic yield and excelled the safety for small complex nodules with reproducible results across physicians and institutions. These results suggested that integrated platform may be able to compete with a trans-thoracic biopsy approach in small nodules.\u201d Earlier this year, Dr. Maegawa from the Department of surgery at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, published in the journal surgery, a study comparing robotic and laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures for benign indications performed in 2022. Using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Database, over 59,000 patients were included in this study with over 53,000 in the laparoscopic arm and approximately 5,500 in the robotic assisted arm. Through a multivariable logistic regression analysis, which controlled for confounding factors, patients undergoing a robotic-assisted cholecystectomy had an 18% lower chance of experiencing a serious complication, as well as a 56% lower chance of a conversion to open and 24% lower risk of requiring hospitalization for more than 24 hours. The authors also looked at elective cholecystectomies only and reported a 46% lower chance of conversion to open, 59% lower chance of re-operation, and 30% lower odds of a hospitalization over 24 hours associated with robotic-assisted cholecystectomies. The authors concluded \u201cusing a large and recent national surgical database, the study showed that overall robotic cholecystectomies were independently associated with a lower risk of serious complications, lower rate of conversions to open, and lower risk of hospitalization greater than 24 hours when compared to laparoscopy. These findings suggest that the adoption of new technologies might enhance the safety of minimally invasive surgery in selected cases.\u201d In closing, we are committed to our 2024 priorities, supporting our measured launch of DaVinci 5 and our other new platforms by region, supporting surgeons' adoption of focused procedures, continuing to improve product quality and margins, and finally improving productivity in those functions that benefit from global scale. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie, who will take you through our finances and procedure highlights in greater detail. Hey Travis, this is Dave. I will answer some of your questions around kind of where are we going from here to broad launch? So in terms of software updates, we'll continue to make them as they're scheduled in our plans. And you'll see those come out on a semi-routine basis. We have to get to broad launch as described in my comments, we have a release that will enable some of that hardware and some additional software features in that broad launch time frame. For the supply side of DV5, we expect that to increase modestly quarter-over-quarter as we get into next year and into broad launch. On the contribution margin side, maybe Jamie, over to you. Yes, thanks. We do have supply to be able to support Korea demand and so that is true. We have not outlined timing in Japan, so we remain in that back and forth. And then with respect to CE mark in Europe, it's no different from last quarter where we expect that near the end of next year 2025. Hey Rick, and you said it. So in this, as we're ramping our supply capabilities, console is being prioritized with incremental single system deals. And so as we build our capacity, we will start producing additional consoles for dual system placements. In terms of prioritization and where they're being prioritized, I think our team is working with broad sets of customers and to understand what their needs are and if DaVinci 5 is the right system to meet their needs for their program. And I don't have a lot of information about how that may differ between smaller customers as you put it in academics or larger institutions."

Gary will introduce the call and provide an organization update. Dave will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Jamie will provide a review of our financial results. Then I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2024. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.\nGary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. The fundamentals of our business were healthy in the quarter, with solid procedure growth and strong capital placements resulting in healthy financial performance. In the quarter, we made good progress with all three of our system platforms, including taking our measured rollout of da Vinci 5 to our next phase, continuing to stabilize Ion supply in support of customer expansion and expanding da Vinci SP installs in Europe, while supporting SP procedure growth across regions. Some multi-port procedure headwinds continued from last quarter and we will describe these later on the call. Before turning the time over to Dave, I'd like to thank Marshall Mohr, our prior CFO and our outgoing Head of Global Business Services. Marshall will be taking his skills to pursuits outside of Intuitive in September this year, as he approaches his next endeavor. I thank him on behalf of all of us for his outstanding stewardship at Intuitive for the past 18 years. We are pleased to announce that in addition to his role as CFO, Jamie will expand his responsibilities to leading our information technology and global facilities teams. I'll now turn the time over to Dave, who will take you through commercial and operational highlights in greater detail.\nDave Rosa: Thank you, Gary. Starting with procedures, we experienced solid growth in the quarter of nearly 17% compared with a strong Q2 2023, which reflected the return of patients post pandemic. Cholecystectomy, colon resection, lung resection and foregut procedures led global procedure growth. General surgery led U.S. procedure growth in the second quarter and outside the U.S., procedure growth was led by non-urology procedures. Regional performance included strength in Europe, led by Germany, the U.K. and Italy. And in Asia, we have mixed market conditions largely consistent with Q1. Brian will describe these dynamics later in the call. Turning to capital, we placed 341 da Vinci systems in the quarter, of which 320 were multiport systems, including 70 da Vinci 5 systems. Our teams installed 21 SP systems and 74 Ion systems in the quarter, with solid capital placements in the U.S., Japan and India and pressure in Europe and China. System utilization defined as procedures per installed clinical system per quarter grew 2% globally year-over-year for our multiport platforms, lower than our historical trend, reflecting procedure strength a year ago due to patient backlogs. Utilization for SP and Ion continued to grow in the double digit range in the quarter. Turning to our finances, revenue growth of 14% in the quarter reflect solid procedure performance and strong capital placements. Product margins were above our expectations, reflecting a combination of cost reductions, fixed overhead leverage and some one-time nonrecurring benefits. Operating expenses reflected plan leverage in our enabling functions. Jamie will take you through our finances in greater detail later in the call. In Q2, we moved into the next phase of our rollout of da Vinci 5. Within the quarter, we placed 70 da Vinci 5 systems. As the launch continues to progress in line with our plans, customer feedback points to improvements in precision, imaging, ergonomics and integration, the combination of which customers indicate has led to overall efficiency improvements. Both Force Feedback and Case Insights bring new capabilities and analytics to surgery. We are encouraged by early insights these capabilities are presenting and are working hard to improve production and supply for Force Feedback instruments and smooth our computational pipelines and workflows for Case Insights. We expect these capabilities to be powerful and the maturity and evidence of impact to build over coming quarters. We launched new products thoughtfully centered around outstanding customer experiences. As our customers pursue operational and clinical excellence, we continue monitoring several key metrics across our measured rollout of da Vinci 5, as we ramp our supply and respond to customer input. We expect our measured rollout to continue through the first half of 2025. Adoption of our digital products and services grew nicely in the quarter, with routine use of My Intuitive App expanding to nearly 14,000 surgeons and surgeons using Intuitive Hub more than doubling versus a year ago. The long-term opportunity for computational tools is both significant and difficult. To recognize these benefits at scale requires a foundational infrastructure that includes robust, curated data, secure data warehousing and global privacy compliance. Our digital ecosystem, including Case Insights, leverages this infrastructure and enables us to collaborate with customers on a global scale to identify meaningful insights. These insights enable customers to optimize their robotic programs and ultimately reduce time to proficiency and improve clinical outcomes. As we said before, validations take time and are a worthy pursuit. Turning to Ion, our teams have made material progress resolving supply constraints on catheters and vision probes. Excellence in manufacturing at scale in this space is complex and we continue to reinforce our capabilities. Our commercialization in Europe continues according to plan and our teams are progressing towards commercialization in China. Turning to SP, last week we received FDA clearance for thoracic procedures. We will be measured in our thoracic indication launch, as we work to build a robust training and proctoring network, as well as bring stapling to our SP platform. In closing, we are committed to our 2024 priorities, supporting our measured launch of da Vinci 5 and our other new platforms by region, supporting surgeons adoption of focus procedures, continuing to improve product quality and margins and finally improving productivity in those functions that benefit from global scale. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie, who will take you through our finances in greater detail.\nJamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis and we'll also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Q2 da Vinci procedures grew 17%. The installed base of systems grew 14% to just over 9200 systems and average system utilization increased by 2%, lower than long-term historical averages, reflecting procedure strength in Q2 last year, as a result of patient backlogs U.S. procedures grew 14%, driven by growth in general surgery. Bariatric procedures in the U.S. declined in the mid-single digit range. OUS procedures grew 22%, reflecting strong growth in general surgery, gynecology and thoracic procedures. With respect to capital performance, we placed 341 systems in the second quarter, compared to 331 systems in Q2 of last year. In the U.S., we placed 149 systems in Q2, compared to 157 systems placed last year, reflecting in part lower trade ins. U.S. system placements in Q2 included 70 da Vinci 5 placements. Given a planned hardware and software update to da Vinci 5 in the second half of this year and continued focus on maturing, manufacturing and expanding capacity, we expect that da Vinci 5 placements will be constrained through the first half of 2025. Outside the U.S., we placed 192 systems in quarter two compared with 174 systems last year. Current quarter system placements included 71 into Europe, 41 into Japan and 14 into China, compared with 76 into Europe, 33 into Japan and 16 into China in Q2 of last year. We also saw relatively strong placements in India, as well as markets served by our distributors, including Australia. Placements in Europe reflect health system budget constraints, as several European governments are resetting capital spending post pandemic. Second quarter revenue was $2.2 billion, an increase of 14% from last year. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth was 15%. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. Leasing represented 51% of Q2 placements, relatively consistent with recent trends. However, given customer preference for our usage based models in the U.S. and the launch of da Vinci 5, we continue to expect the proportion of systems placed under lease arrangements to grow over time. Q2 system average selling prices were $1.44 million as compared to $1.39 million last year. Higher year-over-year system ASPs reflected a higher mix of da Vinci 5 and lower trade ins, partially offset by a higher mix of system placements in Japan with a weaker Yen exchange rate and lower pricing in China. In Q2 of 2023, trade-ins represented 18% of total system placements as compared to 6% in Q2 of 2024. We recognized $28 million of lease buyout revenue in quarter two, compared with $29 million last quarter and $12 million last year. da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,800, an increase of approximately $20 compared to last quarter. The sequential increase in I&A per procedure is primarily a result of customer ordering patterns in the U.S. Turning to our Ion platform, procedures grew 82% to approximately 23,200 procedures in the second quarter. During the quarter, we placed 74 Ion systems compared to 59 last year and 70 last quarter. During Q2, we caught up with the remaining backlog of system placements as supply of catheters and vision probes continued to improve. The in store base of Ion systems increased 56% year-over-year to 678 systems, of which 275 are under operating lease arrangements. Second quarter SP procedure growth accelerated to 74%, with strong growth in Korea and the U.S. and early stage growth in Japan and Europe. 21 of the systems placed in the quarter were SP systems, including ten systems placed in Europe. The SP installed base grew 56% from the year ago quarter to 222 systems. Moving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of 2024 was ahead of our expectations at 70%, compared with 68.5% for the second quarter of 2023 and 67.6% last quarter. Second quarter pro forma gross margin reflected certain one-time benefits that we do not expect to recur. Excluding these one-time benefits, pro forma gross margin would have been 69.5%. The sequential improvement in pro forma gross margin primarily reflects lower inventory reserves, cost reductions in certain purchase components, lower freight rates and leverage of fixed overhead. In accordance with our plans, product margins for our Ion and SP platforms improved in the quarter and will remain a focus for our business unit and manufacturing teams over the medium term. As a reminder, given recent and ongoing capital investments, we expect increased depreciation expense in the second half and a significant increase in depreciation expense starting in Q1 of 2025. Second quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 11% compared with last year, reflecting the ongoing benefit of planned leverage in enabling functions. We continue to prioritize investments in R&D to fund innovation and future growth. During the quarter, we added approximately 550 employees, of which roughly half were in our manufacturing operations to support growth in customer demand. Pro forma other income was $79.4 million for Q2, higher than $72.5 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher interest income. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22.5%, consistent with our expectations. Second quarter 2024 pro forma net income was $641 million or $1.78 per share, compared with $507 million or $1.42 per share for the second quarter of last year. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $527 million or $1.46 per share for the second quarter of 2024, compared with GAAP net income of $421 million or $1.18 per share for the second quarter of 2023. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee equity plans, employee stock based compensation, amortization of intangibles, litigation charges and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.7 billion, higher than the $7.3 billion we ended last quarter. The sequential increase in cash and investments reflected cash generated from operating activities, partially offset by capital expenditures of $309 million. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian.\nBrian King: Thank you, Jamie. Overall, second quarter procedure growth was 17% compared to 22% for the second quarter of 2023 and 16% last quarter. In the U.S., second quarter 2024 procedure growth was 14% compared to 19% for the second quarter of 2023 and 14% last quarter. Second quarter growth was led by procedures within general surgery, with strength in cholecystectomy and foregut procedures and also thoracic procedures. Bariatric procedure growth declined in the mid-single digit range. Outside of the U.S., second quarter procedure volume grew 22%, compared with 28% for the second quarter of 2023 and 20% last quarter. Growth was led by non-urology procedures with strength in colon resection, hysterectomy and lung resection procedures. In Europe, second quarter growth continued to be led by procedures beyond urology, primarily from general surgery and gynecology procedure categories. Germany, the U.K. and Italy procedure performance led the region with each experiencing strong growth in colon and rectal resection, hysterectomy and other general surgery procedures. In Asia, growth in the second quarter was led by Japan and India, while growth in China was stressed and Korea procedure growth continued to be impacted by physician strikes. In Japan, overall procedure growth was solid with continued strength in colon and rectal resection, gynecology and lung resection procedures. In India, while still in the early stage of adoption, we saw strength in gynecology and general surgery procedures, particularly with growth in hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, and hernia repair. China procedure growth was lower than prior period averages when compared to the same quarter a year ago, which experienced a recovery in procedures impacted by COVID. System utilization remained strong, while capital placements continue to be impacted by delayed tenders and emerging domestic robotic systems. Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. Earlier this year, Dr. Zhang and team from the Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine published a systematic review and meta-analysis in the International Journal of Surgery that looked at open, laparoscopic and robotic assisted surgery approaches to rectal cancer management. This meta-analysis covered 56 studies and included over 25,000 patients, of which approximately 11,000 patients received robotic assisted surgery, over 13,000 patients laparoscopic surgery and over 390 patients received open surgery. When compared to the control group of both laparoscopic and open procedures, patients undergoing a robotic assisted approach had an approximately 2 day shorter length of stay. Specifically, when compared to lap, the robotic assisted group was associated with a 1.7 day shorter length of stay. Relative to open surgery, the length of stay was 5.5 days shorter. The robotic assisted approach was also demonstrated a protective effect for converting to an open procedure, with 61% lower odds of conversion associated with robotics relative to the laparoscopic approach. Finally, when compared to the laparoscopic and open control group, the robotic assisted approach showed less estimated blood loss, approximately 40% lower odds of urinary retention and when compared to open, a higher number of harvested lymph nodes. The authors concluded, \"The robotic approach emerges as the most favorable option for managing rectal cancer when compared to open, laparoscopic and transanal techniques, as it delivers the finest blend of oncological, functional and patient recovery outcomes. The digital interface of surgical robots enables a shift in the paradigm of surgical training, facilitating shorter learning curves that are more comprehensive and notably reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with them\". I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2024. Starting with procedures, on our last call, we forecasted full year 2024 procedure growth within a range of 14% and 17%. We are now narrowing our forecast and expect full-year 2024 procedure growth of 15.5% to 17%. The low end of the range assumes further softening in bariatric procedures, along with increasing headwinds in Asia from prolonged physician strikes in Korea and in China from delayed tenders and emerging domestic robotic systems, impacting capital placements and therefore procedure growth. At the high end of the range, we assume bariatric stabilizes at current quarter rates and headwinds in Korea and China do not get worse. Turning to gross profit, we are increasing our pro forma gross profit margin to be within 68.5% and 69% of net revenue. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter, depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions. Turning to operating expenses, we are lowering our guidance for pro forma operating expense growth to be between 10% and 13%. We are refining our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $680 million to $700 million in 2024. We are narrowing our guidance for other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $300 million and $320 million in 2024. With regard to capital expenditures, we continue to estimate a range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, primarily for planned facility construction activities. With regard to income tax, there is no change to our guidance of 2024 pro forma income tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pretax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on a really nice quarter here. Of course, I have to start with da Vinci 5, really strong start here, 70 placements. I heard the comments about being constrained through the second half of 2025, but da Vinci 5 was almost half of your U.S. placement. So it looks like a strong launch. So how should we think about the ramp in da Vinci 5 placements in the second half? And how should we think about trade-ins going forward, which were probably a little lower than I expected this quarter in the U.S.? And I had one follow-up.\nJamie Samath: Hi, Larry, it's Jamie. I would say for the second half of 2024, you should expect dV 5 placements in the U.S. to increase modestly quarter-to-quarter and that in part reflects the fact that we do have this hardware, software update that we described. And so you have to organize how you do that build plan through the factory carefully for that update. And we said we'd be in a measured rollout through then the first half of 2025. With respect to how we've organized the measured rollout of dV 5, we've really focused the sales force on looking to place da Vinci 5 for incremental capacity for our customers versus the trading cycle. I think we'd rather get to a broad launch where we essentially have unconstrained supply relative to demand before we look at the trade-in cycle. Just a couple of comments on the trade-in cycle. I think I wouldn't expect a trade-in cycle to suddenly emerge and take off quickly. I think what we've seen in the past is that that's progressive and over multiples of years and in part that will reflect the fact that many customers will want to evaluate da Vinci 5, they want to see evidence grow over time in terms of its capability and feature set. And of course their desire for da Vinci 5 will depend on their individual program and what they see, the value of that in part given the higher pricing or lease costs for da Vinci 5.\nLarry Biegelsen: That's very helpful. And then I wanted to ask about China. You mentioned it a couple of times on the call today. We recently saw a new stimulus announced there and my question is and you've talked about the anti-corruption initiative, is that still having an impact and how are you guys thinking about the new stimulus that was announced there? Will that help drive placements? Thanks for taking the question.\nDave Rosa: Hi, Larry, it's Dave. Answering the second part of your question, first around the stimulus. In talking to our teams, we don't see that it's going to have a material impact on the placements of systems or an impact on the quota. With respect to kind of the operating environment of China and the anti-corruption that you referenced, there's no question that the operating environment remains challenging. The health system in China is kind of rebasing around economics and medtech, I think that's clear across the industry. On the placement side, customers are continuing to value our offerings clearly and we're seeing as, you know, the emergence of domestic systems. And so in spite of those challenges and everything that's going on in the environment in China, we're still seeing double digit growth in procedures. So we remain confident and look forward to continuing our investments and focus in China.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thanks for taking the questions, guys.\nOperator: And we'll look to next question from the line of Travis Steed, Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nTravis Steed: Hi, congrats on the good quarter. I wanted to maybe if there's any way you can help us understand the kind of the demand side of the dV 5 equation? I know we're in a constrained rollout, but 47% of the placements in the U.S. were dV 5 this quarter. And I don't know if there's any way to kind of rank order some of the factors you need to mark off and check off the list to kind of get the full launch, had the software hardware upgrade, but assume there's some other variables to consider as well.\nDave Rosa: Yes. Hi, Travis, it's Dave and again. There -- it's a couple of the factors that we've discussed in the past and it's really kind of three primary areas. One is making sure that we are maturing our supply chain and our manufacturing capacity, so that we're again able to get to the quality, to the cost, to the yields that we expect as we approach a broad launch. The second part is what Jamie described around the software and hardware update, where we're trying to get that integrated into our systems and balancing the factory output. And then the third thing is, listening to our customers. And so as these placements happen, we're listening to our customers and responding to their feedback and we'll be releasing some software updates along the way here in order to respond to that feedback. And so we want to get that in place before we get to product launch.\nGary Guthart: Travis, I would just add, your question, part of your question is on the demand side. I would say that in the early phase of a launch, you have a tendency to see early adopters look for the latest technology and also the larger institutions, the large IDNs. And so you have to kind of give it some time to see the full set of customers in terms of what that interest will be and the segments of customers, again, that will look for evidence to build over time, for customer belief to build over time. And so you probably need some time to see the full set of customers in terms of what the full picture of demand for da Vinci 5 is and again that take some time. Da Vinci 5 is a platform that, as we did with Xi will invest in overtime and so you'll build a set of capabilities also over time.\nTravis Steed: That's helpful. And Jamie, maybe on the gross margin side, very strong and only one time was 50 basis points, it was kind of under the pressure, maybe initially, gross margins would be a little lighter with dV 5. Just can you elaborate on the strength and margin this quarter?\nJamie Samath: Yes, I would just say that, we kind of describe from a sequential basis what drove the improvement quarter-on-quarter. It was lower inventory reserves. Our teams did an outstanding job with respect to component cost performance with our suppliers and in the logistics area. And that kind of came in earlier than we expected. Those are a set of teams that for a couple of years had been working on supply because of COVID and the pandemic. And what happened in terms of supply constraints and those teams in more recent periods have refocused on cost reductions. And we saw that come in early and so we were really pleased to see that. And so great performance in the quarter. You saw us improve the guidance for the year. I would say if we -- as we look at the second half, you will see increased depreciation, as I described. You will see a high proportion of the revenue be new products, da Vinci 5 and Ion and SP. In Q2, all of the 70 da Vinci 5 placements, only 11 of them were purchase arrangement. So kind of a muted effect in terms of gross margin in the quarter. The other placements are operating leases, where you see the economics play out over time.\nTravis Steed: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Okay, we'll go to the next line Robbie Marcus, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRobbie Marcus: Oh, great, thanks and I'll add congratulations on a very solid quarter here. I wanted to ask about the feedback in the field, you talked about in the script a bit. We've all talked to doctors and have heard from them. I'd love to hear from you both what the physicians are saying, but also what the institutions are saying. Clearly, demand is there 70 units this fast is really strong. But what's the pushback, if any, for centers? How do they feel about the ability to drive better economics and faster procedures and better outcomes with da Vinci 5 and the feedback so far from the physicians?\nDave Rosa: Yes, Rob, maybe I'll start. This is Dave. Just starting with some of the feedback that we've discussed before, you look at what customers are immediately appreciating and some of the things you would expect around ergonomics, increases in precision and vision, the head in UI, onscreen graphics and other things. And so taken together, each one of those features are leading to some efficiency gains in particular in sort of console time. And that has been kind of noticed across the customer base. And I think that's where we're starting -- we're hearing a little bit about what can that mean in terms of adding a procedure a day, increasing utilization of the system. And so that's what both our surgeon customers and our executive customers are noticing as a result of their investment in da Vinci 5. You know, some of the other features, Case Insights, Force Feedback, we're excited to work with customers and we know that's going to take time to develop and really quantify some of those impacts. In terms of pushback, today what we are seeing is a little bit what Jamie talked about. We are starting, customers will have to evaluate the value of da Vinci 5. We have these early adopters that are excited about what it can be. And as we move in through our measured launch, we will continue to have to underscore, and reinforce the value that it brings, and communicate that to executives and their teams.\nGary Guthart: I'll just jump in and add a little. We expect to be evaluated against the quadruple or the quintuple aim with regard to da Vinci 5. And we are confident that we are going to get there. I think we are going to develop the data to support that perspective. The apples-to-apples price differences aren't that great once you add inflator, and some of the other things that are built in. We have just got to justify that difference. One of the questions I would ask, and Dave, you can answer it, is are there any procedures that physicians prefer using da Vinci 5 Xi to da Vinci 5? In other words, is there any preference to stay with what they have got?\nDave Rosa: Yes. So, Gary, in all of my discussions and with the team, surgeons prefer the use of da Vinci 5 for the reasons we talked about.\nGary Guthart: So I think on the administrative side, as long as you can demonstrate that the quadruple aim or the quintuple aim is being satisfied, that they are getting value for the relatively modest apples-to-apples price increase, I think we feel pretty good. I would say on force reflection and on case insights, these are powerful foundational new capabilities that are going into the market. And I think that's really interesting. And we'll work with leading customers to start evaluating where do they make sense and where don't they. We of course believe that there are going to be procedures and patient populations where they make a ton of sense and they generate real value. So early, it is about data generation and research and feedback. And later, we will start to drive that through clinical publications and other things. So I think there is a left hand, right hand here. Some of it is what you get today. You get precision, you get imaging, you get ergonomics, you get throughput. There are some things that in this platform you get to participate in its research and development. That will come later. Then it is a core technology platform upon, which we can build. Jamie mentioned it earlier. So it is that set of sequences that gives us some confidence to keep pushing hard.\nRobbie Marcus: Well Gary, you anticipated my follow-up question. So let me ask another one here. One of the items of feedback I have heard from physicians is that case insights, and the force sensing can help existing physicians be better. But more importantly, it could help physicians that do a lot of lab procedures or open procedures make it easier for them to adjust to robotics. Is that something you are hearing? I know it is early in the launch here, but how do you think about those features and the ability to get more conversion from lab to robotic?\nDave Rosa: So, I do think there are several ways to consider force feedback and think about it. One of them is, we do think it can have an impact on learning curve. And so as laparoscopic surgeons, or newer surgeons to the platform adopted. We believe that force feedback and looking at force feedback through case insights, can improve their time to proficiency on the robot. When it comes to kind of longer term clinical outcomes and what force feedback and the data surrounding it, it's what Gary described. We believe it to be a powerful component of looking to the future and saying, how do we improve surgical outcomes? Does gentler surgery imparting less force on tissue have a difference in outcomes? Our hypothesis is strongly yes. And so that is what is going to take multiple quarters in time to develop. But I do believe there is kind of two segments where force feedback can have that impact.\nRobbie Marcus: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And we'll go to the next line. And that is the line of David Roman, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nDavid Roman: Thank you and good afternoon, everybody. I wanted to start on an Ion question, appreciating some of the supply chain dynamics that may have contributed positively to growth in the quarter. But maybe you could go into a little bit more detail about what you're seeing in the field from an adoption perspective, to what extent you're seeing higher diagnostic yields on Ion result in earlier intervention for patients and whether those interventions are taking place utilizing da Vinci or not?\nGary Guthart: Yes, so with respect to getting a patient into the diagnostic pipeline, that's kind of an independent variable from Ion and or da Vinci. And so that's through screening or incidental findings. But once they're in there, then Ion is offering really, really effective way to go and biopsy that lesion. And so, we look at kind of two main variables there. One is the size of the lesion, and then one is the diagnostic yield. And so the important part of this, is to diagnose smaller and smaller lesions. Now, the smaller the lesion, it is correlated to cancer stage. And that's where if you get it at stage 1A, you can have very, very high survival. So we're pushing towards smaller lesion size. And then diagnostic yields that are as good as possible, approaching TTNA levels or CT guided biopsy levels, and eventually we hope to exceed those. And so those together, Ion is proving to be a really effective tool at doing that well, while maintaining an improved safety profile over CT guided needle biopsy. And so, when somebody is diagnosed with Ion and it is deemed to be cancer, then oftentimes they may move to a da Vinci procedure. It's really up to the tumor board and that physician about the best way to treat that patient. It may be with da Vinci, it may be with radiation or some other alternative. So oftentimes they're coupled, but not all the time.\nDavid Roman: That's a very helpful context. Thank you. And maybe I could ask a financial question on the follow-up here. I think as I look at the operating expense targets for the year, most of the reduction actually looks like, it stems back to what might have been a slower start to the year. I think you grew OpEx about 7% in Q1 and saw an acceleration here in Q2. But maybe you could just help unpack a little bit about - a little bit of the dynamic underpinning the operating expense growth for the balance of the year. And how we should think about sort of normalized OpEx growth. Is that sort of the seven number where you started the year, kind of the low double-digit number where you're trending now? And then I don't know if you're willing to offer any perspective on the incremental depreciation, but you were kind of in like the $90 million range in Q1, $100 million range, excuse me, in Q1 of this year. Are we talking about a $10 million per quarter increase, $20 million? And any framing you give might be helpful on that side as well?\nJamie Samath: Yes. Quarter-to-quarter, it can be a little lumpy depending on those expenses the kind of - are not consistent across quarters. So I just say if you take the first half, OpEx grew 9%. And you look at the updated guidance, it says the second half grows 11% to 15%, 16-ish percent. So an acceleration in the second half. From a framing perspective, roughly we're looking to maintain R&D about revenue growth and it's been at 11%. Last couple of years, the first half is about 11%. And then you've seen us describe how we've been leveraging enabling functions. In terms of then what the OpEx guidance was on the last call versus what it is today, there are some of those lumpy expenses that are no longer in the year just, because of timing. We have looked at some headcount that we had planned for the year that, we've pushed into 2025. That's really around focus, not around anything other than focus. Where you see opportunities to continue to leverage maybe at greater rates than we expected, then we'll realize those efficiency benefits. But we do expect second half operating expenses to be higher than the first half. And that's primarily driven by depreciation. Not ready to be specific about what the relative increase in depreciation expense is, but it is contemplated in that ramp up in second half operating expenses.\nDavid Roman: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And we'll go to the next line. And that will be the line of Rick Wise, Stifel. Please go ahead.\nRick Wise: Good afternoon, everybody. Hi, Gary. Hi, Dave. Just - I was hoping that you could talk a little bit more about the procedure growth outlook broadly. You gave us - you bumped up the range, and we're very clear about the low-end factors at the low and the high end. But I was just curious, I'm not sure I understand from your perspective. Is our bariatric or GLP-1 pressure is leveling off here? Or have they leveled off? How reasonable is it to think you could get to the upper end? And sort of the same question for the China Asia pressures you talked about as well. Could you just elaborate a little bit on that? Thank you.\nGary Guthart: Yes. With regard to how to think about the range, I'm going to ask Brian to step in and do that. So Brian, do that, and then we'll come back to talk a little bit about GLP-1s and I'll perhaps take that. And then I think on China, I'll take it to Dave.\nBrian King: So Rick, I'm just going to reemphasize, or restate what the range was. So just ramp size 15.5% to 17%, is procedure guidance for the year. At the low end, we're assuming that bariatric procedures continues to soften. We did talk a bit about even last quarter and this quarter in Asia around physician strikes that were impacting procedures in Korea along with delayed tenders, impacting procedure or capital placements in China. Which therefore, impacts overall procedures, or procedure growth. And at the high end of the range, we're really assuming that, that bariatric or bariatric essentially stabilizes at current quarter rates. And again, that Korea and China do not get any worse.\nGary Guthart: Yes. Speaking of bariatrics, two effects are going on. The GLP-1s are changing to the surgical market. And even within that, there is some share change between laparoscopy and robotics that's going on. So you have two things that are coming through and they net out. It is not - the impact of GLP-1s on the bariatric surgery market from our perspective in aggregate has not bottomed yet. And the reality is I don't think anybody knows when and where that will exactly settle for a couple of reasons. I think some of it is looking at the puts and takes of effectiveness, and you have constrained access to the drugs and you have some new drugs in the pipeline. So that will play out over time. And if somebody told you they knew the answer, I'm not sure I believe them. Having said all that, we're not depressed about it. I think that it will play out. I think there's a role for bariatric surgery, and I think in our customers' hands with our systems, I think that surgery has done well. So I think we're just going to have to all go through it together. I think we're going to look that experience together. With regard to kind of longer-term outlook of procedures in China and overall sentiment. Dave, I'll kind of kick to you.\nDave Rosa: Yes. What I would say about the longer-term kind of outlook here is our offerings, when I said before, are highly valued in China. The systems are utilized at a high clip. And we're there's value that surgeons and patients place on high-quality, minimally invasive care. And so that's the, I think, the draw of this. In terms of some of the headwinds and to me, there are kind of two areas. One is the capital environment that we talked about, and with constrained capital environment and placements, it has an impact on procedure growth. And then, there's other areas around this kind of rebasing by the government around economics. And so, it has various impacts. It can have impacts in provinces around charge codes and that is another headwind for us in terms of procedure growth and utilization long-term.\nGary Guthart: One - two comments I'd make on both the headwinds. I think at some point, I'd expect both of them to be time limited. I think there'll be an equilibrium that will be found between GLP-1s and surgery at some point. I also feel like the rebase line in - the economic rebase line in China and the integration and emergence of domestic systems. But those things will start to find an equilibrium also. How long is that going to take, is I think what's underlying this question and the answer is we don't know. But I think that minimally invasive surgery in China is highly valued. There's a belief in robotic-assisted surgery as being important. And our products and ecosystem is valued. So, I think that we're enthusiastic about completing that.\nRick Wise: Yes. Gary, if I could just one follow-up. The question I have gotten, I think, most frequently post the launch of DV5 is what new procedure - what new incremental TAM will da Vinci 5 unlock? I had the privilege of interviewing Dave, who might be near at hand today, that question at SRS. And I said the way da Vinci 5 unlock the general surgery TAM, what will da Vinci 5 unlock and Dave very eloquently said it's going to unlock the routine use of robotic surgery every day. Do you agree with Dave? And is that are your customers understanding that vision, or getting that that's what you're aiming at just any reaction to those thoughts, I'd appreciate it? Thank you, Dave.\nDave Rosa: You're welcome, Rick.\nGary Guthart: Yes. I'll start - good you asked yes, I agree with him. No shock. Maybe just to reiterate our position. There's two different ways that it can help grow long-term. One way is to go deeper into the procedure base, we're in already to help care teams and physicians who have thus far not wanted to adopt, or have chosen not to adopt, or have had a barrier to adoption, to help them adopt. And that can be so - through some of the functionality of DV5 and what it does, a little bit of easier access to other capital for example, of Xis become more used in more places, it can release access constraints together as a portfolio, those are powerful things, and that speaks to what Dave spoke about. We don't think we're done getting additional indications on DV5 and those are things that could happen in the future. And as we get closer and see what those opportunities are, we'll describe them.\nRick Wise: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. We'll go to next line. Drew Ranieri, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDrew Ranieri: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just something that we also heard from SRS was that the DV - da Vinci Xi is still very well considered in the field and there are surgeons that still want to get their hands on it. So just can you talk a little bit more about some of the underlying demand for Xi in the U.S.? And Jamie, I think you pointed out too, that you kind of expect DV5 to sequentially improve throughout the year. So maybe just talk to us about what that means for Xi, given that you're having broader conversations with hospital administrators and surgeons as they're thinking about building capacity for robotic surgery?\nJamie Samath: Yes. I would just say in the U.S., demand for Xi kind of has two segments to it. You have customers that need incremental capacity, da Vinci 5 isn't available in the time that they need it. And so they're entering into arrangements with us, to take Xi now to serve that expansion of capacity they need. And then they have the upgrade right built into the arrangement to move to da Vinci 5 when it becomes available likely in broad launch. You have another segment of customers in the U.S. who are kind of wait and see with respect to, what the value will be of da Vinci 5. And again, they look for building evidence and kind of a broadening of customer belief, and part of that consideration is the profile of that customer, what their strategy is, what their procedure mix is. And of course, as part of the consideration, they're looking at the incremental price, which as Gary described, when you do the full stack isn't actually that significant. But - those customers that have tight capital budgets who like Xi, which is a capable system are more a wait and see. So I think in terms of - as you look forward, that will evolve with respect to how da Vinci capacity expands, and the extent to which then more customers can take that system. But there is a segment of customers that really like Xi.\nDrew Ranieri: And has there been any change in thinking about bringing da Vinci 5, to the broader global markets, I know that you're working on a couple of regulatory filings right now, but any update on timing or further market expansion? Thanks for taking the questions.\nJamie Samath: Yes. Just in terms of our OUS plans, I think it's consistent with what we have communicated, which is we're in discussions with Korea and Japan and don't expect to launch in Europe, before the end of next year. And so as we look beyond that, it's just too early to detail out those plans, and we'll let you know as they get a little bit more into focus here.\nOperator: Okay. And we'll go to the next line here. Adam Maeder, Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nAdam Maeder: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions and congrats on the nice quarter. Two from me. The first one is on DV5, and I specifically wanted to ask about the hardware and software changes that you plan to make, in the back half of the year. What are you hoping to improve upon? What are the magnitude of the changes that you plan to implement? It sounds like they're relatively minor, but wanted to confirm that. And then I had a follow-up? Thank you.\nDave Rosa: Sure, sure. I'll take that. So some of the near-term additions that we're talking about include the integration of hub capabilities of Intuitive Hub. And then from the surgeon having this head end experience, when they're in the console, they'll be able to start accessing and controlling Intuitive 3D models, being able to manipulate them from the console with the controls there. And also, they'll have the ability to access and replay intraoperative video. And then we'll also include and integrate in simulation. So that kind of gives you a flavor, I think, of some of the pieces that we're adding that we've talked about in these hardware and software upgrades. In addition, there will be some software upgrades that include responding to customer feedback as well. And some of the things that we've heard as we're going through our measured launch here. And then if you look a little further out, some intraoperative technology building blocks that we're working on, such as procedure step mapping and 3D depth mapping that will use some AI and ML algorithms and leverage this compute power of da Vinci 5. And those things will set us up for some more advanced features in the future that leverage that foundation.\nAdam Maeder: Highly good color, Dave. Thank you for that and for the follow-up. Wanted to ask about SP. Congrats on the thoracic indication. I'm curious how much you think that expands the opportunity for SP here in the states. I know you're also working on cold erectile, so curious if you have timelines there? And then together, does that kind of give you the indication base to push SP more aggressively in the U.S.? Thanks for taking the questions.\nDave Rosa: Yes. In terms of thoracic, in the early period, that procedure actually is optimal when you have a stapler and we're in development for a stapler for SP. And so, we'll be able to work with early adopters on the thoracic indication. But it's really when the stapler comes that you're able to kind of more robustly drive adoption. One of the advantages of SP is, of course then the opportunity to access the body in ways that, does less damage to healthy tissue. Today in the U.S., in terms of thoracic for multiple, we're already relatively highly penetrated. And so really the question then is relative value of SP compared to Xi. What was the second part of your question? I'm sorry, if you could repeat it?\nAdam Maeder: Yes, happy to. I was just asking about colorectal timing. I think you have the IDE study that's ongoing. And I think that will be your fourth indication once the colorectal indication is in hand. So does that kind of give you critical mass from an indication standpoint to kind of push more aggressively with SP in the U.S?\nDave Rosa: Yes. The work on the IDE has progressed. We don't have any additional detail at this point. And obviously, that then adds another category with respect to the set of indications in the U.S. And I think it does have - give us the opportunity to both supplement SP procedure growth in the U.S. And add to the growing utilization we see of the SP platform in the U.S., but I think we also have the opportunity for additional indications over time in the U.S. Colorectal like thoracic will also require the SP stapler.\nGary Guthart: Operator, we'll take one more question from one more call and then we'll wrap.\nOperator: Okay. That will be from the line Richard Newitter, Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nRichard Newitter: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe for Jamie, just Jamie in the past, you've talked about a long-term or an intermediate to long-term three, four-year time frame to get back above sustainably 70% gross margin. A, correct me if that's not true, but I'm pretty sure that's what you've said in the past. I'm just curious just with some of the initiatives maybe paying dividends earlier than expected and faster. I know you have some manufacturing transition going on for Ion disposables, that's a big initiative. Is it possible we're moving towards that goal a little faster sooner? I'd love to hear any thoughts there?\nJamie Samath: Specifically, 70% gross margin, that's not sustainable in the shorter term. It continues to be our aspiration to have gross margin at 70% in the medium term. There's work for us to do over that period with respect to obviously da Vince costs. We have to continue to progress on Ion and SP costs. And as we've said, we have incremental depreciation in the second half and more significant incremental depreciation next year. And so that will also require us to then manufacturing capacity related, which you build in chunks. We'll have to revenue leverage that incremental depreciation over a period of time. Certainly in terms of the baseline of where we are at, the cost reductions we described on component costs, and logistic costs have come in a little earlier and that's why we've raised the guidance, for gross margin for this year. But the aspiration for 70% gross margin is still a medium-term aspiration.\nDave Rosa: Thanks. In fact, if I could just maybe -- okay...\nGary Guthart: I'll wrap it there. Thank you. That was our last question. In closing, we believe that there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have now termed the quintupling, better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams, better access to great care and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision the future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking to you again in three months.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone, for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect at this time. Have a good day.",

            "name": "Gary Guthart",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today. The fundamentals of our business were healthy in the quarter, with solid procedure growth and strong capital placements resulting in healthy financial performance. In the quarter, we made good progress with all three of our system platforms, including taking our measured rollout of da Vinci 5 to our next phase, continuing to stabilize Ion supply in support of customer expansion and expanding da Vinci SP installs in Europe, while supporting SP procedure growth across regions. Some multi-port procedure headwinds continued from last quarter and we will describe these later on the call. Before turning the time over to Dave, I'd like to thank Marshall Mohr, our prior CFO and our outgoing Head of Global Business Services. Marshall will be taking his skills to pursuits outside of Intuitive in September this year, as he approaches his next endeavor. I thank him on behalf of all of us for his outstanding stewardship at Intuitive for the past 18 years. We are pleased to announce that in addition to his role as CFO, Jamie will expand his responsibilities to leading our information technology and global facilities teams. I'll now turn the time over to Dave, who will take you through commercial and operational highlights in greater detail. Travis, I would just add, your question, part of your question is on the demand side. I would say that in the early phase of a launch, you have a tendency to see early adopters look for the latest technology and also the larger institutions, the large IDNs. And so you have to kind of give it some time to see the full set of customers in terms of what that interest will be and the segments of customers, again, that will look for evidence to build over time, for customer belief to build over time. And so you probably need some time to see the full set of customers in terms of what the full picture of demand for da Vinci 5 is and again that take some time. Da Vinci 5 is a platform that, as we did with Xi will invest in overtime and so you'll build a set of capabilities also over time. I'll just jump in and add a little. We expect to be evaluated against the quadruple or the quintuple aim with regard to da Vinci 5. And we are confident that we are going to get there. I think we are going to develop the data to support that perspective. The apples-to-apples price differences aren't that great once you add inflator, and some of the other things that are built in. We have just got to justify that difference. One of the questions I would ask, and Dave, you can answer it, is are there any procedures that physicians prefer using da Vinci 5 Xi to da Vinci 5? In other words, is there any preference to stay with what they have got? So I think on the administrative side, as long as you can demonstrate that the quadruple aim or the quintuple aim is being satisfied, that they are getting value for the relatively modest apples-to-apples price increase, I think we feel pretty good. I would say on force reflection and on case insights, these are powerful foundational new capabilities that are going into the market. And I think that's really interesting. And we'll work with leading customers to start evaluating where do they make sense and where don't they. We of course believe that there are going to be procedures and patient populations where they make a ton of sense and they generate real value. So early, it is about data generation and research and feedback. And later, we will start to drive that through clinical publications and other things. So I think there is a left hand, right hand here. Some of it is what you get today. You get precision, you get imaging, you get ergonomics, you get throughput. There are some things that in this platform you get to participate in its research and development. That will come later. Then it is a core technology platform upon, which we can build. Jamie mentioned it earlier. So it is that set of sequences that gives us some confidence to keep pushing hard. Yes, so with respect to getting a patient into the diagnostic pipeline, that's kind of an independent variable from Ion and or da Vinci. And so that's through screening or incidental findings. But once they're in there, then Ion is offering really, really effective way to go and biopsy that lesion. And so, we look at kind of two main variables there. One is the size of the lesion, and then one is the diagnostic yield. And so the important part of this, is to diagnose smaller and smaller lesions. Now, the smaller the lesion, it is correlated to cancer stage. And that's where if you get it at stage 1A, you can have very, very high survival. So we're pushing towards smaller lesion size. And then diagnostic yields that are as good as possible, approaching TTNA levels or CT guided biopsy levels, and eventually we hope to exceed those. And so those together, Ion is proving to be a really effective tool at doing that well, while maintaining an improved safety profile over CT guided needle biopsy. And so, when somebody is diagnosed with Ion and it is deemed to be cancer, then oftentimes they may move to a da Vinci procedure. It's really up to the tumor board and that physician about the best way to treat that patient. It may be with da Vinci, it may be with radiation or some other alternative. So oftentimes they're coupled, but not all the time. Yes. With regard to how to think about the range, I'm going to ask Brian to step in and do that. So Brian, do that, and then we'll come back to talk a little bit about GLP-1s and I'll perhaps take that. And then I think on China, I'll take it to Dave. Yes. Speaking of bariatrics, two effects are going on. The GLP-1s are changing to the surgical market. And even within that, there is some share change between laparoscopy and robotics that's going on. So you have two things that are coming through and they net out. It is not - the impact of GLP-1s on the bariatric surgery market from our perspective in aggregate has not bottomed yet.

I also feel like the rebase line in - the economic rebase line in China and the integration and emergence of domestic systems. But those things will start to find an equilibrium also. How long is that going to take, is I think what's underlying this question and the answer is we don't know. But I think that minimally invasive surgery in China is highly valued. There's a belief in robotic-assisted surgery as being important. And our products and ecosystem is valued. So, I think that we're enthusiastic about completing that. Yes. I'll start - good you asked yes, I agree with him. No shock. Maybe just to reiterate our position. There's two different ways that it can help grow long-term.

            "name": "Jamie Samath",
            "content": "Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis and we'll also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Q2 da Vinci procedures grew 17%. The installed base of systems grew 14% to just over 9200 systems and average system utilization increased by 2%, lower than long-term historical averages, reflecting procedure strength in Q2 last year, as a result of patient backlogs U.S. procedures grew 14%, driven by growth in general surgery. Bariatric procedures in the U.S. declined in the mid-single digit range. OUS procedures grew 22%, reflecting strong growth in general surgery, gynecology and thoracic procedures. With respect to capital performance, we placed 341 systems in the second quarter, compared to 331 systems in Q2 of last year. In the U.S., we placed 149 systems in Q2, compared to 157 systems placed last year, reflecting in part lower trade ins. U.S. system placements in Q2 included 70 da Vinci 5 placements. Given a planned hardware and software update to da Vinci 5 in the second half of this year and continued focus on maturing, manufacturing and expanding capacity, we expect that da Vinci 5 placements will be constrained through the first half of 2025. Outside the U.S., we placed 192 systems in quarter two compared with 174 systems last year. Current quarter system placements included 71 into Europe, 41 into Japan and 14 into China, compared with 76 into Europe, 33 into Japan and 16 into China in Q2 of last year. We also saw relatively strong placements in India, as well as markets served by our distributors, including Australia. Placements in Europe reflect health system budget constraints, as several European governments are resetting capital spending post pandemic. Second quarter revenue was $2.2 billion, an increase of 14% from last year. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth was 15%. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. Leasing represented 51% of Q2 placements, relatively consistent with recent trends. However, given customer preference for our usage based models in the U.S. and the launch of da Vinci 5, we continue to expect the proportion of systems placed under lease arrangements to grow over time. Q2 system average selling prices were $1.44 million as compared to $1.39 million last year. Higher year-over-year system ASPs reflected a higher mix of da Vinci 5 and lower trade ins, partially offset by a higher mix of system placements in Japan with a weaker Yen exchange rate and lower pricing in China. In Q2 of 2023, trade-ins represented 18% of total system placements as compared to 6% in Q2 of 2024. We recognized $28 million of lease buyout revenue in quarter two, compared with $29 million last quarter and $12 million last year. da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,800, an increase of approximately $20 compared to last quarter. The sequential increase in I&A per procedure is primarily a result of customer ordering patterns in the U.S. Turning to our Ion platform, procedures grew 82% to approximately 23,200 procedures in the second quarter. During the quarter, we placed 74 Ion systems compared to 59 last year and 70 last quarter. During Q2, we caught up with the remaining backlog of system placements as supply of catheters and vision probes continued to improve. The in store base of Ion systems increased 56% year-over-year to 678 systems, of which 275 are under operating lease arrangements. Second quarter SP procedure growth accelerated to 74%, with strong growth in Korea and the U.S. and early stage growth in Japan and Europe. 21 of the systems placed in the quarter were SP systems, including ten systems placed in Europe. The SP installed base grew 56% from the year ago quarter to 222 systems. Moving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of 2024 was ahead of our expectations at 70%, compared with 68.5% for the second quarter of 2023 and 67.6% last quarter. Second quarter pro forma gross margin reflected certain one-time benefits that we do not expect to recur. Excluding these one-time benefits, pro forma gross margin would have been 69.5%. The sequential improvement in pro forma gross margin primarily reflects lower inventory reserves, cost reductions in certain purchase components, lower freight rates and leverage of fixed overhead. In accordance with our plans, product margins for our Ion and SP platforms improved in the quarter and will remain a focus for our business unit and manufacturing teams over the medium term. As a reminder, given recent and ongoing capital investments, we expect increased depreciation expense in the second half and a significant increase in depreciation expense starting in Q1 of 2025. Second quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 11% compared with last year, reflecting the ongoing benefit of planned leverage in enabling functions. We continue to prioritize investments in R&D to fund innovation and future growth. During the quarter, we added approximately 550 employees, of which roughly half were in our manufacturing operations to support growth in customer demand. Pro forma other income was $79.4 million for Q2, higher than $72.5 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher interest income. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22.5%, consistent with our expectations. Second quarter 2024 pro forma net income was $641 million or $1.78 per share, compared with $507 million or $1.42 per share for the second quarter of last year. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $527 million or $1.46 per share for the second quarter of 2024, compared with GAAP net income of $421 million or $1.18 per share for the second quarter of 2023. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee equity plans, employee stock based compensation, amortization of intangibles, litigation charges and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.7 billion, higher than the $7.3 billion we ended last quarter. The sequential increase in cash and investments reflected cash generated from operating activities, partially offset by capital expenditures of $309 million. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian. Hi, Larry, it's Jamie. I would say for the second half of 2024, you should expect dV 5 placements in the U.S. to increase modestly quarter-to-quarter and that in part reflects the fact that we do have this hardware, software update that we described. And so you have to organize how you do that build plan through the factory carefully for that update. And we said we'd be in a measured rollout through then the first half of 2025. With respect to how we've organized the measured rollout of dV 5, we've really focused the sales force on looking to place da Vinci 5 for incremental capacity for our customers versus the trading cycle. I think we'd rather get to a broad launch where we essentially have unconstrained supply relative to demand before we look at the trade-in cycle. Just a couple of comments on the trade-in cycle. I think I wouldn't expect a trade-in cycle to suddenly emerge and take off quickly. I think what we've seen in the past is that that's progressive and over multiples of years and in part that will reflect the fact that many customers will want to evaluate da Vinci 5, they want to see evidence grow over time in terms of its capability and feature set. And of course their desire for da Vinci 5 will depend on their individual program and what they see, the value of that in part given the higher pricing or lease costs for da Vinci 5. Yes, I would just say that, we kind of describe from a sequential basis what drove the improvement quarter-on-quarter. It was lower inventory reserves. Our teams did an outstanding job with respect to component cost performance with our suppliers and in the logistics area. And that kind of came in earlier than we expected. Those are a set of teams that for a couple of years had been working on supply because of COVID and the pandemic. And what happened in terms of supply constraints and those teams in more recent periods have refocused on cost reductions. And we saw that come in early and so we were really pleased to see that. And so great performance in the quarter. You saw us improve the guidance for the year. I would say if we -- as we look at the second half, you will see increased depreciation, as I described. You will see a high proportion of the revenue be new products, da Vinci 5 and Ion and SP. In Q2, all of the 70 da Vinci 5 placements, only 11 of them were purchase arrangement. So kind of a muted effect in terms of gross margin in the quarter. The other placements are operating leases, where you see the economics play out over time. Yes. Quarter-to-quarter, it can be a little lumpy depending on those expenses the kind of - are not consistent across quarters. So I just say if you take the first half, OpEx grew 9%. And you look at the updated guidance, it says the second half grows 11% to 15%, 16-ish percent. So an acceleration in the second half. From a framing perspective, roughly we're looking to maintain R&D about revenue growth and it's been at 11%. Last couple of years, the first half is about 11%. And then you've seen us describe how we've been leveraging enabling functions. In terms of then what the OpEx guidance was on the last call versus what it is today, there are some of those lumpy expenses that are no longer in the year just, because of timing. We have looked at some headcount that we had planned for the year that, we've pushed into 2025. That's really around focus, not around anything other than focus. Where you see opportunities to continue to leverage maybe at greater rates than we expected, then we'll realize those efficiency benefits. But we do expect second half operating expenses to be higher than the first half. And that's primarily driven by depreciation. Not ready to be specific about what the relative increase in depreciation expense is, but it is contemplated in that ramp up in second half operating expenses. Yes. I would just say in the U.S., demand for Xi kind of has two segments to it. You have customers that need incremental capacity, da Vinci 5 isn't available in the time that they need it. And so they're entering into arrangements with us, to take Xi now to serve that expansion of capacity they need. And then they have the upgrade right built into the arrangement to move to da Vinci 5 when it becomes available likely in broad launch. You have another segment of customers in the U.S. who are kind of wait and see with respect to, what the value will be of da Vinci 5. And again, they look for building evidence and kind of a broadening of customer belief, and part of that consideration is the profile of that customer, what their strategy is, what their procedure mix is. And of course, as part of the consideration, they're looking at the incremental price, which as Gary described, when you do the full stack isn't actually that significant. But - those customers that have tight capital budgets who like Xi, which is a capable system are more a wait and see. So I think in terms of - as you look forward, that will evolve with respect to how da Vinci capacity expands, and the extent to which then more customers can take that system. But there is a segment of customers that really like Xi. Yes. Just in terms of our OUS plans, I think it's consistent with what we have communicated, which is we're in discussions with Korea and Japan and don't expect to launch in Europe, before the end of next year. And so as we look beyond that, it's just too early to detail out those plans, and we'll let you know as they get a little bit more into focus here. Specifically, 70% gross margin, that's not sustainable in the shorter term. It continues to be our aspiration to have gross margin at 70% in the medium term. There's work for us to do over that period with respect to obviously da Vince costs. We have to continue to progress on Ion and SP costs. And as we've said, we have incremental depreciation in the second half and more significant incremental depreciation next year. And so that will also require us to then manufacturing capacity related, which you build in chunks. We'll have to revenue leverage that incremental depreciation over a period of time. Certainly in terms of the baseline of where we are at, the cost reductions we described on component costs, and logistic costs have come in a little earlier and that's why we've raised the guidance, for gross margin for this year. But the aspiration for 70% gross margin is still a medium-term aspiration."

            "content": "Thank you, Gary. Starting with procedures, we experienced solid growth in the quarter of nearly 17% compared with a strong Q2 2023, which reflected the return of patients post pandemic. Cholecystectomy, colon resection, lung resection and foregut procedures led global procedure growth. General surgery led U.S. procedure growth in the second quarter and outside the U.S., procedure growth was led by non-urology procedures. Regional performance included strength in Europe, led by Germany, the U.K. and Italy. And in Asia, we have mixed market conditions largely consistent with Q1. Brian will describe these dynamics later in the call. Turning to capital, we placed 341 da Vinci systems in the quarter, of which 320 were multiport systems, including 70 da Vinci 5 systems. Our teams installed 21 SP systems and 74 Ion systems in the quarter, with solid capital placements in the U.S., Japan and India and pressure in Europe and China. System utilization defined as procedures per installed clinical system per quarter grew 2% globally year-over-year for our multiport platforms, lower than our historical trend, reflecting procedure strength a year ago due to patient backlogs. Utilization for SP and Ion continued to grow in the double digit range in the quarter. Turning to our finances, revenue growth of 14% in the quarter reflect solid procedure performance and strong capital placements. Product margins were above our expectations, reflecting a combination of cost reductions, fixed overhead leverage and some one-time nonrecurring benefits. Operating expenses reflected plan leverage in our enabling functions. Jamie will take you through our finances in greater detail later in the call. In Q2, we moved into the next phase of our rollout of da Vinci 5. Within the quarter, we placed 70 da Vinci 5 systems. As the launch continues to progress in line with our plans, customer feedback points to improvements in precision, imaging, ergonomics and integration, the combination of which customers indicate has led to overall efficiency improvements. Both Force Feedback and Case Insights bring new capabilities and analytics to surgery. We are encouraged by early insights these capabilities are presenting and are working hard to improve production and supply for Force Feedback instruments and smooth our computational pipelines and workflows for Case Insights. We expect these capabilities to be powerful and the maturity and evidence of impact to build over coming quarters. We launched new products thoughtfully centered around outstanding customer experiences. As our customers pursue operational and clinical excellence, we continue monitoring several key metrics across our measured rollout of da Vinci 5, as we ramp our supply and respond to customer input. We expect our measured rollout to continue through the first half of 2025. Adoption of our digital products and services grew nicely in the quarter, with routine use of My Intuitive App expanding to nearly 14,000 surgeons and surgeons using Intuitive Hub more than doubling versus a year ago. The long-term opportunity for computational tools is both significant and difficult. To recognize these benefits at scale requires a foundational infrastructure that includes robust, curated data, secure data warehousing and global privacy compliance. Our digital ecosystem, including Case Insights, leverages this infrastructure and enables us to collaborate with customers on a global scale to identify meaningful insights. These insights enable customers to optimize their robotic programs and ultimately reduce time to proficiency and improve clinical outcomes. As we said before, validations take time and are a worthy pursuit. Turning to Ion, our teams have made material progress resolving supply constraints on catheters and vision probes. Excellence in manufacturing at scale in this space is complex and we continue to reinforce our capabilities. Our commercialization in Europe continues according to plan and our teams are progressing towards commercialization in China. Turning to SP, last week we received FDA clearance for thoracic procedures. We will be measured in our thoracic indication launch, as we work to build a robust training and proctoring network, as well as bring stapling to our SP platform. In closing, we are committed to our 2024 priorities, supporting our measured launch of da Vinci 5 and our other new platforms by region, supporting surgeons adoption of focus procedures, continuing to improve product quality and margins and finally improving productivity in those functions that benefit from global scale. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie, who will take you through our finances in greater detail. Hi, Larry, it's Dave. Answering the second part of your question, first around the stimulus. In talking to our teams, we don't see that it's going to have a material impact on the placements of systems or an impact on the quota. With respect to kind of the operating environment of China and the anti-corruption that you referenced, there's no question that the operating environment remains challenging. The health system in China is kind of rebasing around economics and medtech, I think that's clear across the industry. On the placement side, customers are continuing to value our offerings clearly and we're seeing as, you know, the emergence of domestic systems. And so in spite of those challenges and everything that's going on in the environment in China, we're still seeing double digit growth in procedures. So we remain confident and look forward to continuing our investments and focus in China. Yes. Hi, Travis, it's Dave and again. There -- it's a couple of the factors that we've discussed in the past and it's really kind of three primary areas. One is making sure that we are maturing our supply chain and our manufacturing capacity, so that we're again able to get to the quality, to the cost, to the yields that we expect as we approach a broad launch. The second part is what Jamie described around the software and hardware update, where we're trying to get that integrated into our systems and balancing the factory output. And then the third thing is, listening to our customers. And so as these placements happen, we're listening to our customers and responding to their feedback and we'll be releasing some software updates along the way here in order to respond to that feedback. And so we want to get that in place before we get to product launch. Yes, Rob, maybe I'll start. This is Dave. Just starting with some of the feedback that we've discussed before, you look at what customers are immediately appreciating and some of the things you would expect around ergonomics, increases in precision and vision, the head in UI, onscreen graphics and other things. And so taken together, each one of those features are leading to some efficiency gains in particular in sort of console time. And that has been kind of noticed across the customer base. And I think that's where we're starting -- we're hearing a little bit about what can that mean in terms of adding a procedure a day, increasing utilization of the system. And so that's what both our surgeon customers and our executive customers are noticing as a result of their investment in da Vinci 5. You know, some of the other features, Case Insights, Force Feedback, we're excited to work with customers and we know that's going to take time to develop and really quantify some of those impacts. In terms of pushback, today what we are seeing is a little bit what Jamie talked about. We are starting, customers will have to evaluate the value of da Vinci 5. We have these early adopters that are excited about what it can be. And as we move in through our measured launch, we will continue to have to underscore, and reinforce the value that it brings, and communicate that to executives and their teams. Yes. So, Gary, in all of my discussions and with the team, surgeons prefer the use of da Vinci 5 for the reasons we talked about. So, I do think there are several ways to consider force feedback and think about it. One of them is, we do think it can have an impact on learning curve. And so as laparoscopic surgeons, or newer surgeons to the platform adopted. We believe that force feedback and looking at force feedback through case insights, can improve their time to proficiency on the robot. When it comes to kind of longer term clinical outcomes and what force feedback and the data surrounding it, it's what Gary described. We believe it to be a powerful component of looking to the future and saying, how do we improve surgical outcomes? Does gentler surgery imparting less force on tissue have a difference in outcomes? Our hypothesis is strongly yes. And so that is what is going to take multiple quarters in time to develop. But I do believe there is kind of two segments where force feedback can have that impact. Yes. What I would say about the longer-term kind of outlook here is our offerings, when I said before, are highly valued in China. The systems are utilized at a high clip. And we're there's value that surgeons and patients place on high-quality, minimally invasive care. And so that's the, I think, the draw of this. In terms of some of the headwinds and to me, there are kind of two areas. One is the capital environment that we talked about, and with constrained capital environment and placements, it has an impact on procedure growth. And then, there's other areas around this kind of rebasing by the government around economics. And so, it has various impacts. It can have impacts in provinces around charge codes and that is another headwind for us in terms of procedure growth and utilization long-term. You're welcome, Rick. Sure, sure. I'll take that. So some of the near-term additions that we're talking about include the integration of hub capabilities of Intuitive Hub. And then from the surgeon having this head end experience, when they're in the console, they'll be able to start accessing and controlling Intuitive 3D models, being able to manipulate them from the console with the controls there. And also, they'll have the ability to access and replay intraoperative video. And then we'll also include and integrate in simulation. So that kind of gives you a flavor, I think, of some of the pieces that we're adding that we've talked about in these hardware and software upgrades. In addition, there will be some software upgrades that include responding to customer feedback as well. And some of the things that we've heard as we're going through our measured launch here. And then if you look a little further out, some intraoperative technology building blocks that we're working on, such as procedure step mapping and 3D depth mapping that will use some AI and ML algorithms and leverage this compute power of da Vinci 5. And those things will set us up for some more advanced features in the future that leverage that foundation. Yes. In terms of thoracic, in the early period, that procedure actually is optimal when you have a stapler and we're in development for a stapler for SP. And so, we'll be able to work with early adopters on the thoracic indication. But it's really when the stapler comes that you're able to kind of more robustly drive adoption. One of the advantages of SP is, of course then the opportunity to access the body in ways that, does less damage to healthy tissue. Today in the U.S., in terms of thoracic for multiple, we're already relatively highly penetrated. And so really the question then is relative value of SP compared to Xi. What was the second part of your question? I'm sorry, if you could repeat it? Yes. The work on the IDE has progressed. We don't have any additional detail at this point. And obviously, that then adds another category with respect to the set of indications in the U.S. And I think it does have - give us the opportunity to both supplement SP procedure growth in the U.S. And add to the growing utilization we see of the SP platform in the U.S., but I think we also have the opportunity for additional indications over time in the U.S. Colorectal like thoracic will also require the SP stapler. Thanks. In fact, if I could just maybe -- okay..."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder today\u2019s call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host, Head of Investor Relations for Intuitive Surgical, Brian King. Please go ahead.\nBrian King: Good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call. With me today we have Gary Guthart, our CEO, and Jamie Samath, our CFO. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent filings. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the events section under our investor relations page. Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarters business and operational highlights. Jamie will provide a review of our financial results. Then I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2024. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. And with that, I will turn it over to Gary.\nGary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. The first quarter of 2024 was a solid one for Intuitive, where core measures of our business remained healthy, including solid procedure growth and capital placements. Furthermore, our teams delivered important milestones across several parts of our Intuitive ecosystem, including launching our next generation of multi-port platform, da Vinci 5, launching our da Vinci SP platform in Europe, and improving our supply constraints for ion catheters. Some regional challenges existed in the quarter which we'll describe today. Taken together we remain enthusiastic about our opportunity and we'll work through near-term pressures by focusing on what we can control. Starting first with procedures, we experienced solid growth in the quarter of 16%, compared with a strong Q1 of \u201823, that was a result of elevated patient volume from the return of patients post-pandemic. Q1 of 2024, procedure performance was led by broad growth and general surgery in the United States and by procedures beyond urology outside the United States. Globally, cholecystectomy, colon resection, and foregut procedures led the way. Regional performance included strength in China, Germany, and the United Kingdom. In Japan, we saw a moderation of growth in urology as we reached higher levels of penetration, and Q1 2023 benefited from the return of patients and backlog. In Korea, growth was lower than our expectation, primarily due to a physician strike in the country, which began in February and has continued. Turning to capital, we placed 313 da Vinci systems in the quarter, of which 289 were multi-port systems, compared with 302 multi-port systems in Q1 of \u201823. SP placements were 24 in the quarter versus 10 systems a year ago, and Ion placements for the quarter were 70 versus 55 a year ago. Capital placements were solid in the United States, our global distribution markets, and in Germany. Placements in China appear to be impacted by delayed tenders and an apparent increase in provincial preference for domestic robotic competition. We saw some placement weakness in the U.K. as financial pressures in the NHS constrained access to capital. System utilization defined as procedures per installed system per quarter grew 1% globally year-over-year for our multi-port platform, lower than last quarter and our historical trend, a result of a strong placement year in 2023 in which the multi-port clinical install base grew 14%, while customers addressed a COVID-related backlog. For our newer platforms, utilization grew 10% for SP and 14% for ION in the quarter. Utilization is an important indicator of customer health and is a reflection of customers driving value from their systems. Turning to our finances, revenue growth of 11% in the quarter reflects solid procedure performance and capital placements. Average system selling prices declined modestly due to regional and product mix. Product margins were within our expectations, reflecting a higher mix of newer platforms. Operating expenses came in slightly below planned, resulting in pro forma operating profit growth of 18%. Jamie will take you through our finances in greater detail later in the call. In the quarter, we made good progress with our new platforms. In March, we received FDA clearance for our next generation multi-port platform, da Vinci 5. Within the quarter, we placed eight da Vinci 5 systems and surgeon completed the first cases. As we engage with customers during their activation of da Vinci 5, our customers are noting and appreciating improved precision, improved imaging, improved efficiency for surgeon and staff, improved ergonomics, and they are exploring the potential of force feedback where early surgeons are excited to test hypothesis about its procedural, clinical, and learning value. Digital analytical capabilities of da Vinci 5 are also drawing positive reviews. In parallel with customer support, we're working hard to optimize our supply chains and manufacturing capabilities for DaVinci 5 components. We will remain in our measured rollout as we stabilize supply and respond to customer input. Turning to Ion, our teams have made meaningful progress on resolving supply challenges for our catheter and Ion's vision probe, although work still remains to be done. Earlier this month, FDA reviewed our set of design and production changes and cleared an increase in an Ion catheter lives from five lives to eight lives, alleviating some supply constraints, while improving the economics for us and our customers. Also in March, we received NMPA clearance for Ion in China through a special review process for innovative medical devices. While NMPA clearance is only the first step toward commercialization in China, we believe Ion can play an important role in helping to address the significant burden of lung cancer in the country. Turning to SP, we received CE Mark in Europe with a broad set of indications in the quarter, and we placed eight systems. First cases in Europe were performed this April and were encouraged by early customer interest for SP. In closing, for 2024, our priorities are as follows. First, we'll support the measured launch of da Vinci 5 and our other new platforms by region. Second, we're focused on supporting surgeons' adoption of focus procedures. Third, we're focused on improving our product margins and quality. And finally, we're focused on improving productivity in those functions that benefit from global scale. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie who will take you through our finances in greater detail.\nJamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or proforma basis. And we'll also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our proforma and GAAP results is posted on our website. In Q1, da Vinci procedures grew 16%. The installed basis systems grew 14% to 8,887 systems. And average system utilization increased by 2%, lower than recent trends because of the strength in procedure growth and utilization in Q1 of last year that reflected a significant benefit from the treatment of patient backlogs. U.S. procedures grew 14%, driven by broad growth in general surgery. Bariatrics procedure growth in the U.S. continued to moderate and was flat year-over-year. OUS procedures grew 20%, reflecting strong growth in general surgery and thoracic procedures. Brian will provide additional detail on our clinical performance later in the call. Turning to capital, we placed 313 systems in the first quarter, compared to 312 systems in Q1 of last year. Excluding trading transactions, net new system placements grew 16% to 284 systems. In the U.S., we placed 148 systems in Q1, including eight da Vinci 5 placements, compared with 141 systems placed in Q1 of last year. Given constrained supply of da Vinci 5, system placements may be choppy this year as some customers that are interested in da Vinci 5 decide whether to acquire a fourth generation system with an upgrade rate or wait for adequate supply. Outside the U.S., we placed 165 systems in Q1, compared with 171 systems last year. Current quarter system placements included 84 into Europe, 20 into Japan, and 10 into China, compared with 101 into Europe, 16 into Japan, and 18 into China in Q1 of last year. Placements in the U.K. were below our expectations and lower than Q1 last year, because of the reallocation of NHS Capital Funding to help address industrial actions in the NHS. Placements in China continue to reflect the impact of domestic robotic competition and delayed tenders due to a broader central government focus on systematic governance across sectors, including healthcare. First quarter revenue was $1.89 billion, an increase of 11% from last year. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth was 12%. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: Leasing represented 51% of Q1 placements, compared with 42% in Q1 of last year. Given customer preference for our usage-based models in the U.S. and the launch of da Vinci 5, we continue to expect the proportion of systems placed under lease arrangements to grow over time. Q1 system average selling prices were $1.39 million as compared to $1.47 million last year. System ASPs were negatively impacted by regional and platform mix and lower pricing in China, partially offset by lower trade-ins. We recognized $29 million of leased buyout revenue in the first quarter, compared with $21 million last quarter and $24 million last year. da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,780, flat to last year and down $20, compared to the last quarter. The sequential decline in I&A per procedure is primarily a result of procedure mix in the U.S., given strong growth in cholecystectomy and the moderation of growth in bariatrics. We have also seen larger IDNs in the U.S. look for operational efficiencies by reducing inventory. Turning to Ion. There were approximately 19,500 Ion procedures in the first quarter, an increase of 90% as compared to last year. Since launching the Ion platform in 2019, on a cumulative basis, more than 100,000 procedures have now been performed. In Q1, we placed 70 Ion systems compared to 55 in Q1 of 2023 and 44 last quarter. Q1 results reflected a partial recovery from last quarter, as catheter supply improved. Our team continued to work on stabilizing supply of the catheter and vision probe. Q1 results included four Ion system placements in the U.K., following the European clearance last year. The installed base of Ion systems increased 61% year-over-year to 604 systems, of which 244 are under operating lease arrangements. 24 of the systems placed in the quarter were SP systems, including eight systems in Europe, reflecting clearance early in the quarter. First quarter SP procedure growth was 60%, with healthy growth in Korea and the U.S., and early-stage growth in Japan. In the U.S., during the quarter, we completed a 510(k) submission for a thoracic indication, made continued regulatory progress toward a colorectal submission and enrolled additional patients in our IDE for nipple-sparing mastectomy. The SP installed base grew 55% from the year-ago quarter to 201 systems. Moving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the first quarter of 2024 was 67.6%, compared with 67.2% for the first quarter of 2023 and 68% last quarter. The sequential reduction in pro forma gross margin primarily reflects higher fixed costs, including depreciation expense for expanded manufacturing capacity and higher costs associated with the launch of da Vinci 5. Our manufacturing and business unit teams made progress in the quarter on activities to improve gross margin over the medium term. This remains an area of key focus for us. First quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 7%, compared with last year, slightly lower than our -- than expectations due to the timing of certain expenses. Pro forma operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were 140 basis points lower than Q1 last year, reflecting planned leverage in enabling functions, partially offset by increased R&D to fund innovation and future growth. Pro forma other income was $72.5 million for Q1, higher than $67.1 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher interest income. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 22.5%, consistent with our expectations. First quarter 2024 pro forma net income was $544 million or $1.50 per share, compared with $444 million or $1.23 per share for the first quarter of last year. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $547 million, or $1.51 per share for the first quarter of 2024, compared with GAAP net income of $361 million, or $1.00 per share for the first quarter of 2023. First quarter GAAP tax expense was a benefit of $9 million, reflecting excess tax benefits associated with employee equity plans of $111 million. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website, and include excess tax benefits associated with employee equity plans, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, litigation charges, and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.3 billion, flat to the end of last year. The sequential changes in cash included cash generated from operating activities, offset by capital expenditures of $242 million and the net impact of employee equity plans of $46 million. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian.\nBrian King: Thank you, Jamie. Overall, first quarter procedure growth was 16% year-over-year, compared to 26% for the first quarter of 2023 and 21% last quarter. In the U.S., first quarter 2024 procedure growth was 14% year-over-year, compared to 26% for the first quarter of 2023 and 17% last quarter. First quarter growth was led by procedures within general surgery with strength in cholecystectomy, colon resection and foregut procedures. Growth in bariatrics procedures continued to moderate and was flat year-over-year. Outside of the U.S., first quarter procedure volume grew 20%, compared with 28% for the first quarter of 2023 and 29% last quarter. Over 70% of procedure volume growth led by procedures beyond urology with strength in colon resection, hysterectomy, and lung resection procedures. In Europe, first quarter growth continued to be led by general surgery and gynecology procedure categories. Germany and the U.K. procedure performance led the region with both experiencing strong growth in colon and rectal resection and hysterectomy procedures. In Asia, growth in the first quarter was led by China with strong procedure performance in urology and gynecology procedures. Year-over-year procedure growth in the country benefited from a comparison period where procedures were beginning to recover from COVID during the first quarter of 2023. In Japan, while we experienced a moderation in growth in urology, overall procedure growth was healthy, with strength in general surgery procedures such as colon and rectal resection and gynecology procedures. Effective June 1, 2024, five additional procedures will have reimbursement in Japan, with two existing rectal resection procedures receiving an increase in reimbursement for equivalency to laparoscopic surgery. The opportunity for these procedures is relatively modest, but continues to support the adoption of minimally invasive robotic surgery across a growing set of procedures. Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. In the first quarter of this year, Dr. J. John Choi and team from University of South Florida and Tampa, Florida published a meta-analysis of randomized control trials describing outcomes of robotic assisted abdominal pelvic surgery in the journal of surgical endoscopy. This analysis included a review of 50 publications published through April 2021, included over 4,800 patients from randomized control studies, and covered a variety of abdominal pelvic surgical procedures, including anti-reflex, gastrointestinal, colorectal, urologic, hernia repair, and gynecologic procedures. The authors compared robotic assisted outcomes with those from both open and laparoscopic procedures. When compared to the open approach, robotic assisted procedures had lower rates of post-operative complications, with a 32% lower risk of post-operative complications across all procedures, as well as less estimated blood loss, with a mean difference of 286.8 milliliters. Furthermore, length of stay was on average 1.7 days shorter for robotic assisted procedures. Relative to the laparoscopic approach, rates of conversion to open for the robotic assisted group was approximately half the rate of the laparoscopic approach. Length of stay was also shorter for robotic assisted procedures. Interestingly the authors also reported an analysis on the impact of surgeon experience comparing inexperienced versus experienced surgeons and found that the experienced robotic-assisted surgeons had a lower risk of intraoperative complications with significantly less risk in the experienced group, as compared with the laparoscopic group, as well as a lower risk of conversion to open for the experienced surgeon relative to the laparoscopic group, with comparable operative times compared to laparoscopy with experienced surgeons. The authors concluded, in part, that their results suggest robotic surgery may shorten length of stay and rates of conversion to open when compared to laparoscopy, with experience mitigating potential differences in operating time, while improving rates of intraoperative complications and conversions to open surgery. In March this year, Dr. Nicole Linares from the University of Texas Southwestern, along with colleagues from other hospitals and data support from the Intuitive Health Economics Outcomes Research Team, reported outcomes describing the use of robotic technology in emergency general surgery cases. Published in JAMA Surgery, this analysis used the PINC AI Healthcare Database, a database that collects data from over 800 facilities to identify adult patients undergoing urgent or emergent cholecystectomy, colectomy, inguinal and ventral hernia repairs between 2013 and 2021. For reference, emergent procedures were described as those required for life threatening or potentially disabling conditions, while urgent procedures were those where immediate intervention was needed and prioritized as first available. Over 1 million urgent or emergent procedures were identified. During the study period, the use of robotic assisted surgery for all procedures experienced a 3.5-fold increase in cholecystectomy, a 6-fold increase for colectomy, and 38-fold increase in inguinal hernia repairs. Notably, increases in the robotic assisted approach corresponded to decreases in the open approach for these procedures, as well as a decrease in laparoscopy for cholecystectomy and colectomy procedures. Furthermore, a propensity score matched analysis demonstrated a lower risk of conversion to open for the robotic assisted approach, when compared to laparoscopy. Cholecystectomy procedures with a 45% lower risk of conversion, colectomy with a 63% lower risk, inguinal hernia repair with a 79% lower risk, and ventral hernia repair with a 70% lower risk of conversion. The authors concluded \u201cthe application of robotic surgery and emergency general surgery has steadily increased in the past decade, which is especially useful in older patients with several comorbidities. As observed in this cohort study, compared with laparoscopic surgery, robotic surgery appears to have resulted in lower rates of conversion to open surgery from 2013 to 2021. Robotic surgery also leads to a shorter or comparable postoperative length of stay in the hospital. Nevertheless, open surgery remains a key component for most emergency general surgery. As robotic surgery continues to increase in emergency general surgery, barriers to implementation need to be addressed and optimized through coordinated efforts across stakeholders\u201d I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2024. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecasted full-year 2024 procedure growth within a range of 13% and 16%. We are now increasing our forecast and expect full-year 2024 procedure growth of 14% to 17%. The low-end of the range assumes further weakness in bariatrics procedures, along with challenges in China from increasing provincial robotic competition and delayed tenders impacting capital placements and therefore procedure growth. We also assume there is no benefit of patient backlog in the year. At the high-end of the range, we assume bariatrics continues at flat to slightly positive growth rates, and factors in China don't have a significant impact on our business. In addition, we assume any backlog of patients would decline throughout the year. Turning to gross profit. We continue to expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within 67% and 68% of net revenue. Pro forma gross profit margin in 2024 reflects the impact of growth in our newer products da Vinci 5, Ion and SP, and the impact of capital investments that will come on to support the growth of our business. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional, and trade in mix and the impact of new product mix. Turning to operating expenses, we are holding our guidance for performance operating expense growth to be between 11% and 15%. We continue to expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $680 million to $710 million in 2024. We are holding our guidance for other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $290 million and $320 million in 2024. With regard to capital expenditures, we continue to estimate a range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, primarily for plan facility construction activities. With regard to income tax, there is no change to our guidance of 2024 pro forma income tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pre-tax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go to the first question at this time and that's from Robbie Marcus, JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nRobbie Marcus: Oh, great. And congrats on a very nice quarter. Gary, I was hoping you could touch on, you know, what surprised me the most was the procedure volume off a really difficult quarter here 16%. Maybe walk us through your view of what's driving it? Obviously, you gave color on some of the procedures, but it's a really strong number, and what gives you the confidence that it's sustainable with the raise guidance through the rest of the year?\nGary Guthart: Yes, I'm going to turn that first question over to Jamie. Thanks Marcus. Jamie why don't you go and then I'll add a few thoughts thereafter.\nJamie Samath: Yes where we saw particular strength regionally was in the U.S. and the U.K. in particular. What you also see in OUS markets, as Brian described, is this continuing growth in procedures beyond urology. That first is focused on cancer procedures, colorectal thoracic, hysterectomy, some early stage growth in benign in our international markets. So the combination of those things, I think, were behind the performance in Q1. And as you kind of look at then the inputs from the teams, as we get feedback from our customers, I think then we kind of reflect that in the rest of the guidance. Obviously, the guidance is only up a point at the low and the high end of the range, so something we're watching carefully.\nGary Guthart: So, I think, Jamie, you got it.\nRobbie Marcus: Maybe just as a quick follow-up, I'm at the SAGES conference now and, you know, the doctor feedback is phenomenal on da Vinci 5 from our end and the doctors we spoke to. I was hoping you could just give us some early feedback on what you've heard across the field. Doctors' willingness and hospitals\u2019 willingness to not just add new systems, but upgrade the fleet and just what you've been hearing? Thanks a lot.\nGary Guthart: Yes, in terms of early feedback, we\u2019re hearing, I think what we were hoping for in terms of our design intent. They're appreciating the improvements to precision and imaging, to workflow and the team's efforts on human factors design and user interface, strong commentary on ergonomics, and I think force feedback is something that is new and will create opportunities to really understand the clinical implications of force application during surgery. I think that will be exciting and powerful over time. I think it's really hard for us, sitting where we are today, to predict the depth and timing of a replacement cycle. We're excited. I think that folks are excited about what's the potential of the product. That said, Xi is great. Xi has a lot of clinical indications, and we're going to have some supply constraints here as we work through our launch. Jamie, I don't know if there's anything you'd like to add to that.\nJamie Samath: Nope, I think you got it Gary.\nGary Guthart: Thanks, Robbie.\nOperator: Okay, we'll go to the next line, Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nLarry Biegelsen: [Technical Difficulty] for taking the question. I echo Robbie, congratulations on a nice quarter here. Just two on da Vinci 5 for me. Maybe starting with Gary, the supply constraints, when do you expect those to be resolved? How long into 2025 will the limited launch last and what will trigger the full launch?\nGary Guthart: Yes, thanks. Larry, there's three things that are going on for us. One of them is optimizing the supply chain, get -- making sure that we have the quality that we want that will for sure go through all of \u201824 in some part of the early part of \u201925, so that's one. The second thing is -- we want to incorporate feedback from our customers. We want to make sure that we're adjusting the things that we need to adjust to make sure that they're highly satisfied. And then the last thing is we have additional feature content and hardware improvements and other things that are planned that our design teams are going to execute on, whether it's software or other updates or some of the things we can do in imaging that we want to do as we bring it through. So it's kind of a three-part set of activities, and we think it's pretty well planned out. I wouldn't expect big changes from our plan, and if there are changes in the future, then we'll be sure to talk about them.\nLarry Biegelsen: That's helpful. And Gary, you haven't been specific about new indications that da Vinci 5 could open, but can you help us understand what the features are of da Vinci 5 that could allow physicians to do new procedures and why? Thanks for taking the question.\nGary Guthart: Yes, our first thought here and bringing the system to market has been to allow surgeons to go deeper into the existing indications we have already. So the indications for da Vinci 5 largely mirror the Xi index indications that we had already. But we do think that it will invite new surgeons and care teams into robotic assisted surgery. I think it allows us to deepen our relationship with that customer base, and we're excited about it. In terms of core capabilities, da Vinci 5 has some really core things. Better imaging that right now, today, it's better, and will get better over time. Precision and high performance and tracking performance allows for really subtle and fine surgical motions. And we think that's really powerful in its core. It's a core capability. Faster workflow opens new opportunities for people, too. So we do think there are additional clinical indications we can pursue. We are evaluating them. We have not finalized on everything yet. And likely they will require conversations with FDA. So we're not prepared at this time to tell you what they might be, but as we get a little closer and work through it then we'll describe it once we've settled our approach.\nOperator: And we will go to the next line Travis Steed, Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nTravis Steed: I wanted to ask a little bit more color on the strong Xi placements in the capital environment even ahead of the dV 5 launch. And it sounded like the message changed on system placements in 2023 or 2024. I think before it was system placements could be lower in 2024, and now it's just choppy. So does that mean there's a chance that system placements are up in 2024?\nJamie Samath: Yes, I mean\u2026\nGary Guthart: Jamie, why don't I.\nJamie Samath: Oh, go ahead, Gary.\nGary Guthart: No, Jamie, go ahead and take it, apologies.\nJamie Samath: Yes. I think the first dynamic is trading-ins. Given the limited supply in dV 5, those placements will be, during the measured launch, focused on incremental placements. So not a lot of trade activity coming from dV 5. And if you look at what's left in the install base for our third gen SI, you've got about 350 systems globally, of which 50 are in the U.S. So we do expect trading volumes to be down quite a bit in \u201824. With respect to overall system placements, I know we made the comments on the last call, but generally we don't guide system placements, so we'll let you run that through your models given the updated procedure guidance. But certainly we've acknowledged that placements could be choppy, while we're constrained on dv 5. In Q1, we didn't really see any customers pushing back on I don't want an Xi, we want to wait for dV 5. But since the launch, which obviously was only in March, we've had our Connect conference, we've had SAGES this week, a significant number of surgeons and executives have now seen dV 5 put their hands on it. So we're acknowledging that customers may choose to wait. We don't have enough evidence or indication yet to see which way that will go.\nTravis Steed: Great. Maybe, Gary, you could spend some time, just kind of a bigger picture question on dV 5 and the capabilities it brings to training, being able to practice some of the edge cases, helping with proctoring. I'm just curious how you see the impact on robotic surgery adoption and driving better outcomes from some of those dV 5 training capabilities that's going to roll out and how long some of this stuff actually is going to take?\nGary Guthart: In terms of raw capability, I think that it will help care teams acquire skills more quickly and it also helps them in the case. As you can kind of think of that as contact sensitive help. The device is kind of aware of where it is and what it's doing and can share that information with the care team, so that as they're doing things, whether it's changing tools or setting it up, it provides real-time help to help guide them through it. And I think that's a really good thing. It just makes it easier to use. Our Intuitive hub has integration, technologies that start with da Vinci 5 and will get better over time as we release software updates and hardware updates. And so that starts to close an analytical loop for our customers from what they're seeing in the case to video review to video analytics to feeding back information to their phones and their laptops and whatever their means are consuming that data is. So that gives them an analytical loop, which should also help. And we'll also continue to evolve our simulation training and some of our other packages, our online learning, that will help them as well. So I think all of this is going to take a little bit of time, but I think the design concept, I think our designers did a beautiful job. I think the design concept of integrating these ideas, making it easy for care teams, for surgeons to follow that journey should help us. Final point I'll make is that in our labs and during our early experience with da Vinci 5, it looks like forced reflection helps novice, new to robotics, new to robotics assistant surgery, require their skills faster. So it should invite more surgeons in and ease their journey. It remains to be proven. It's not done and done, but we think it's encouraging. And so stay tuned. I think keep asking that question and as the data starts to come out, we'll be pleased to share it with you.\nTravis Steed: Great. We will wait to see and congrats.\nOperator: Okay, and we'll go to the next line. Rick Wise, Stifel. Please go ahead.\nRick Wise: Good afternoon. Hi, Gary. Maybe it would be helpful to hear in a little more detail your thoughts on a couple of points that maybe some of the headwinds. Bariatrics flat year-over-year, I wasn't sure completely what I was hearing about trends. Is it getting worse still? Does the -- is the rate of pressure easing? I appreciate in talking about the guidance you talked about, a range, given the range of outcomes, but I assure make sure I understood what you are seeing?\nGary Guthart: Yes, let me share my perspective. Rick, thanks for the question, and then Brian, I'll kick it to you to talk about the range. I think what we can tell you is what we see and what we've seen is continued deceleration such that it's flat year-over-year. There are a lot of opinions out in the field and we can all talk to them. I think the reality is nobody really knows yet. We're going to have to look through it together and as a result it's going to be dynamic. We do know that bariatric surgery is well tolerated and it's a good option and we also know that people are interested in pharmaceuticals and that the pharmaceuticals work as long as you take them for a subset of the population and then stop working if you don't. What that means for future surgery, I think there's a range of opinions and I would not hang a lot of confidence on any of them just yet. And that's why we have a range. And Brian, perhaps you can just touch on how you see bariatric surgery affecting the range. Just reiterate that, if you would.\nBrian King: Sure. And just to reiterate again, the low end of the range assumes that there's further weakness in bariatric procedures, right? So at the low end of the range, further weakness in bariatric procedures. At the high end of the range, we assume that bariatrics continues at flat to slightly positive growth rates. And I think, again, to Gary's point, it will be dynamic and we're just going to have to see how it plays out throughout the year.\nRick Wise: Okay, great. And let me turn to some of the new and incremental features you talked about, Gary. I'm sure all of us on the call have been talking to doctors. I've been hearing a variety of additional features. Some sound quite compelling. Can you give us any flavor? I mean, first, I'd be happy to hear from you what some of them could be? But how quickly, given what you know today, when could we see those features that, again, I would assume would enhance the value? Are we going to see them this year, second-half, or is it more likely that's something for next year as you get supply chain where you want it to be? Thank you.\nGary Guthart: Yes, I think as we add capabilities and time, we have some imaging things that we want to do. We have some things in terms of software upgrades and analytics power and some things we want to do in terms of integration. That's much more likely to be \u201825 and later than \u201824. A lot of \u201824 will be making sure that we and our suppliers feel great about what we've got and then adapting to any immediate feedback that we see.\nOperator: And we will go to the next line. Adam Maeder, Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nAdam Maeder: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions, and congrats on the nice quarter. I wanted to start by asking about the force feedback instruments. I was hoping, Gary, you could share a little bit more color on the feedback that you're getting from clinicians thus far into launch? And then if I understand correctly, you have six force feedback instruments that are used across different common procedures. Will you look to expand the portfolio of that technology going forward? And if so, what might that look like? And then I had a follow-up, thank you.\nGary Guthart: Sure, we're getting a variety of feedback on the instruments themselves. Just a reminder for everyone, they have very sensitive sensors that are built into the distal end, in the body end of the instruments that are sterilizable and cleanable, and they report back contact forces with tissue which at a sensitive way, which has been a goal for us and for surgery for a long time. So it's a hard technology, we've been really excited to bring it to market. We will hear everything from, hey, I'm getting great results with da Vinci X and Xi today, that has very limited version of haptics. It really doesn't have in-body sensing. It does have a little something, but it's not sensing in the technical sense. And that's true, they're getting great results. So it's a new sense. That said, people are quite interested to explore where it will take them. And what's interesting is that when you're using a force sensing instrument, it's sensing whether you turn on force reflection into the surgeon's hands or not. So the surgeon can feel it, they can turn it on, or they can turn it off, but still measure so that they have the feeling experience of an X or an Xi. And what they find when they turn it on and off is that the amount of force that they apply during surgery to tissue decreases when force reflection into the hands is on. And so the big question is what's the clinical value of that? What will be the implications for patient outcomes by procedure and by technique? And that's what they're going to go explore and we will help them do that exploration. So now we're talking about the future, what could happen. I suspect, I believe, this is a personal opinion. There will be types of procedures and types of patients where having lower force applied to tissue during the surgery is going to be clinically meaningful. And we have to go prove that. So I think it's quite interesting. The technology is sophisticated. We are with our manufacturing partners learning how to make these at scale with good yield and robust. It's a worthy endeavor, but it is not easy and we're going to focus on it, make sure that we get what we want. We want to make sure we have robust and high yield products, we want to extend their lives to help the economics of our customers and our economics. So that is our first focus. As to the six instruments, I'm going look to Jamie as to whether the sixth number is right, I think it is. Certainly over time, we have the opportunity to extend it to other instruments. But that first set of six are the ones that we thought were right. Six is the right number, Jamie?\nJamie Samath: It is, and it's a combination of graspers and needle drivers, and those instruments are used in very common tasks, dissection, retraction and suturing.\nAdam Maeder: Thanks Adam.\nOperator: Alright, we'll go to the next line Drew Ranieri, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDrew Ranieri: Thank you taking the questions, maybe just on SP for a moment with the indication expansion in Europe. Can you talk about that a bit more, Gary? And I was hearing from a surgeon today that the CRSA Conference in November in Rome could be pretty important for just getting broader adoption from European surgeons, but does that inform how you could approach the U.S. market with a broader indication? And then I just had a follow-up.\nGary Guthart: Yes, yes, I'm actually here in Europe, have been for the last couple of weeks talking to SP surgeons here, I think the early uptake and early excitement is quite palpable. Where we've had broad indications, as you know, in Korea and now Japan, we've seen a nice uptake in adoption and good study, good clinical study. And I think that the surgeons here are building on that. They're learning from and adapting what they see in the rest of the world and getting excited about it. So I'm encouraged. How deep that goes? It's still early days here in Europe, we will see. But we're starting to see fairly long case studies in things like colorectal surgery coming out of Asia and other places. We have submitted, as Jamie had mentioned, for an additional indication in the United States, we have another one coming. We have IDE trials ongoing. So we have some national experiments to see what occurs. We know the experiment in Korea has worked out well. We're in process in Japan and now we're in the early experience for broad indications in Europe. That should help us generate data and accelerate additional indications over time in the U.S. And I have to say, I think It remains a build for SP, but I'm encouraged by the build.\nDrew Ranieri: Thank you. And maybe this is more for Jamie, but Jamie, could you talk about the commentary about lower pricing in China for the quarter? Just talk about that a little bit more and maybe put that into context on if this is temporary, if it's permanent or more to come and just the overall competitive situation in China would be great. Thank you.\nJamie Samath: Yes, it's primarily a function of the competitive environment we've described with the domestic robotic players. What we actually have now given last year, we qualified a domestically manufactured Xi is actually some segmentation between the domestically manufactured product and an imported product. And the domestic product gives us the opportunity to both participate in tenders that require a locally produced system, but also allows us to segment on price. But the primary impact on China pricing is really competition. And you kind of see that theme broadly with other MedTech players in terms of the impact of VBP. It doesn't apply in this case, but kind of the macro theme of pricing pressure does.\nOperator: And we'll go to the next line. And that will be Matt Miksic, Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMatt Miksic: Hey, Thanks so much for taking the questions and congrats on a really strong quarter against [Indiscernible]. So a couple of follow-ups, if I could on a couple of things that you mentioned, Gary, in your last answer around force feedback and sort of the clinical impacts of optimizing or reducing the force used during surgery, which is kind of buzzing around here at SAGES quite a bit this year in the sessions? And I'm wondering, you know, appreciate always the data that you talk about during the prepared remarks and recent clinical data. I'm wondering, you know, how far out are we going to see, you know, clinical reference like that to studies around the use of force feedback versus not, and also maybe efficiencies driven by a lot of the docs you're talking about, smoother operating arms and being able to get through cases faster. You know, is that a year out, are we six months, are we two years out for dV 5 research like that? And again, appreciate you taking the question.\nGary Guthart: Yes, it's a good question, Thank you. This is approximate, not specific, so take it with some error bars. But, you know, I think what you're going to see in force feedback study is going to be a progression. You'll see narrow series, single institution studies come out first that are kind of directional. They talk about what they're seeing in their own, and then you'll see a little bit, and that should be the kind of thing that comes out in the next 12 months. And then over the next period after that, over the next couple of years, you'll see multiple center trials that are comparing in a little more structured way. So I think you can predict the path of the journey, but I think this is something that you're going to see from narrower input to start to broader input in the next year to prospective studies that start to report over the next year after that. So I think it's a build, but I think it's going to be a powerful build in the end. I think with regard to efficiencies, we're hearing anecdotal reports already that the surge in autonomy features that are in da Vinci, the ability for them to control their own field and to control the equipment, the Hansler equipment in the room has been really positive and they're reporting efficiencies already. I think real-world evidence is going to be powerful on the efficiency side. I think that's the kind of thing that people can benchmark their own cases. We also our data collection capabilities between Intuitive Hub and the My Intuitive app allow them to measure that very quickly. So I think you'll see the real-world evidence of that build and it will be in the coming months and quarters and that will be exciting for us.\nMatt Miksic: That's great. Thank you.\nOperator: And we will go to the next line. Let's go to the line, Brandon Vazquez, William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Vazquez: Thanks for taking the question. I want to focus on Ion real quick. You had a nice rebound in the quarter there after some supply last quarter? Just curious, do you see a little bit of catch up there or not? And then even as these numbers are getting bigger, you're still putting up some really strong growth? So, curious where you're seeing the most growth there, new accounts or existing utilization and how sustainable you think it is?\nGary Guthart: Jamie, why don't you take that one?\nJamie Samath: Yes, I'd say it was a partial recovery in the quarter -- we haven't completely resolved both catheter supply and the vision probe. We still have a little bit of backlog in terms of number of systems that's pending, kind of, stabilization of that supply. With respect to where are we placing those systems, it's actually a blend between existing accounts and new accounts. We still have a number of opportunities for what I call green field accounts. So both are a focus for the sales team.\nBrandon Vazquez: Okay, and one quick follow-up maybe on the surgical side. The 1% utilization growth, I appreciate it, off of a tough comp and we're kind of normalizing. But I think we kind of, we usually use utilization growth as an indication for system placements and then it implies a certain procedure growth as well. Just talk to us a little bit about what you kind of think a below historical average utilization growth in the quarter might mean for those key moving pieces in the next couple of quarters. Thanks.\nJamie Samath: Yes, I mean -- go ahead, Gary.\nGary Guthart: I'll jump in and then Jamie take it. I think that in the prepared remarks, we had said you had a nice capital placement year and we had a bolus of post-COVID comeback into Q1. I think the uncertainty part of this is really just going to be what the inpatient volumes look like in the next quarters of 2024. In other words, just the patient census as it comes through. But you're right, I think that it's an indicator of capacity. So depending what that patient census looks like, that'll determine the high end and the low end of utilization growth in terms of how many procedures people want to put on those systems. Sorry Jamie, go ahead, you might discuss the modeling there.\nJamie Samath: I would just say that if you look at Q1 utilization over an extended period, look at what the CAGR is versus the year-over-year comparison, you see that stuff to be in a more normal range of 3% to 4%. I do think that in the year ago quarter, you had a number of institutions that actually stepped themselves up to do sprints with respect to their ability to treat patients. And so I do think that was elevated and at that level of utilization growth of 13%, it wasn't particularly sustainable. So as I look forward to the rest of the year, I'd expect some levels of utilization growth that let's say are closer to our long-term averages. There's still some patient backlog benefit in the year-ago quarters, even in Q2 and Q3. So it's not perfectly matched, but I think there's room for normalization over time.\nOperator: And we will go to the next question from the line of Jayson Bedford to Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nJayson Bedford: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just maybe Ion in China, obviously a large opportunity there. Just a couple questions, and I apologize if I missed this, but does Ion fall within the existing robotics quota? And then for Ion, you mentioned clearance is the first step? Can you just talk through the other steps to commercialization and associated timing of those steps? Thanks.\nJamie Samath: Yes, we have some work to put eye on at a point where it's actually available to sell, so that will take us some time. We're not expecting to have commercialization really until the back half of 2024. And China is a market where, like many cases, when we launch a new product in a market, we do that progressively as we kind of build our infrastructure in terms of training capabilities and engage with customers. So I'd say back up at \u201824 is when you start to see the potential for Ion placements in China.\nJayson Bedford: On the issue of is it competing for the same quota, Jamie?\nJamie Samath: Oh, sorry. Yes, our understanding is it is not in the quota given the price.\nJayson Bedford: Thank you.\nGary Guthart: And Jason, if you have one more follow-up, that will wrap it up for us.\nJayson Bedford: No, that's fine. Thank you.\nGary Guthart: Okay, that was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians, and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim. Better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams, and ultimately a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better, where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly, so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months.\nOperator: And thank you everyone for joining today's conference call. That does indeed conclude your conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gary Guthart",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today. The first quarter of 2024 was a solid one for Intuitive, where core measures of our business remained healthy, including solid procedure growth and capital placements. Furthermore, our teams delivered important milestones across several parts of our Intuitive ecosystem, including launching our next generation of multi-port platform, da Vinci 5, launching our da Vinci SP platform in Europe, and improving our supply constraints for ion catheters. Some regional challenges existed in the quarter which we'll describe today. Taken together we remain enthusiastic about our opportunity and we'll work through near-term pressures by focusing on what we can control. Starting first with procedures, we experienced solid growth in the quarter of 16%, compared with a strong Q1 of \u201823, that was a result of elevated patient volume from the return of patients post-pandemic. Q1 of 2024, procedure performance was led by broad growth and general surgery in the United States and by procedures beyond urology outside the United States. Globally, cholecystectomy, colon resection, and foregut procedures led the way. Regional performance included strength in China, Germany, and the United Kingdom. In Japan, we saw a moderation of growth in urology as we reached higher levels of penetration, and Q1 2023 benefited from the return of patients and backlog. In Korea, growth was lower than our expectation, primarily due to a physician strike in the country, which began in February and has continued. Turning to capital, we placed 313 da Vinci systems in the quarter, of which 289 were multi-port systems, compared with 302 multi-port systems in Q1 of \u201823. SP placements were 24 in the quarter versus 10 systems a year ago, and Ion placements for the quarter were 70 versus 55 a year ago. Capital placements were solid in the United States, our global distribution markets, and in Germany. Placements in China appear to be impacted by delayed tenders and an apparent increase in provincial preference for domestic robotic competition. We saw some placement weakness in the U.K. as financial pressures in the NHS constrained access to capital. System utilization defined as procedures per installed system per quarter grew 1% globally year-over-year for our multi-port platform, lower than last quarter and our historical trend, a result of a strong placement year in 2023 in which the multi-port clinical install base grew 14%, while customers addressed a COVID-related backlog. For our newer platforms, utilization grew 10% for SP and 14% for ION in the quarter. Utilization is an important indicator of customer health and is a reflection of customers driving value from their systems. Turning to our finances, revenue growth of 11% in the quarter reflects solid procedure performance and capital placements. Average system selling prices declined modestly due to regional and product mix. Product margins were within our expectations, reflecting a higher mix of newer platforms. Operating expenses came in slightly below planned, resulting in pro forma operating profit growth of 18%. Jamie will take you through our finances in greater detail later in the call. In the quarter, we made good progress with our new platforms. In March, we received FDA clearance for our next generation multi-port platform, da Vinci 5. Within the quarter, we placed eight da Vinci 5 systems and surgeon completed the first cases. As we engage with customers during their activation of da Vinci 5, our customers are noting and appreciating improved precision, improved imaging, improved efficiency for surgeon and staff, improved ergonomics, and they are exploring the potential of force feedback where early surgeons are excited to test hypothesis about its procedural, clinical, and learning value. Digital analytical capabilities of da Vinci 5 are also drawing positive reviews. In parallel with customer support, we're working hard to optimize our supply chains and manufacturing capabilities for DaVinci 5 components. We will remain in our measured rollout as we stabilize supply and respond to customer input. Turning to Ion, our teams have made meaningful progress on resolving supply challenges for our catheter and Ion's vision probe, although work still remains to be done. Earlier this month, FDA reviewed our set of design and production changes and cleared an increase in an Ion catheter lives from five lives to eight lives, alleviating some supply constraints, while improving the economics for us and our customers. Also in March, we received NMPA clearance for Ion in China through a special review process for innovative medical devices. While NMPA clearance is only the first step toward commercialization in China, we believe Ion can play an important role in helping to address the significant burden of lung cancer in the country. Turning to SP, we received CE Mark in Europe with a broad set of indications in the quarter, and we placed eight systems. First cases in Europe were performed this April and were encouraged by early customer interest for SP. In closing, for 2024, our priorities are as follows. First, we'll support the measured launch of da Vinci 5 and our other new platforms by region. Second, we're focused on supporting surgeons' adoption of focus procedures. Third, we're focused on improving our product margins and quality. And finally, we're focused on improving productivity in those functions that benefit from global scale. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie who will take you through our finances in greater detail. Yes, I'm going to turn that first question over to Jamie. Thanks Marcus. Jamie why don't you go and then I'll add a few thoughts thereafter. So, I think, Jamie, you got it. Yes, in terms of early feedback, we're hearing, I think what we were hoping for in terms of our design intent. They're appreciating the improvements to precision and imaging, to workflow and the team's efforts on human factors design and user interface, strong commentary on ergonomics, and I think force feedback is something that is new and will create opportunities to really understand the clinical implications of force application during surgery. I think that will be exciting and powerful over time. I think it's really hard for us, sitting where we are today, to predict the depth and timing of a replacement cycle. We're excited. I think that folks are excited about what's the potential of the product. That said, Xi is great. Xi has a lot of clinical indications, and we're going to have some supply constraints here as we work through our launch. Jamie, I don't know if there's anything you'd like to add to that. Thanks, Robbie. Yes, thanks. Larry, there's three things that are going on for us. One of them is optimizing the supply chain, get -- making sure that we have the quality that we want that will for sure go through all of \u201824 in some part of the early part of '25, so that's one. The second thing is -- we want to incorporate feedback from our customers. We want to make sure that we're adjusting the things that we need to adjust to make sure that they're highly satisfied. And then the last thing is we have additional feature content and hardware improvements and other things that are planned that our design teams are going to execute on, whether it's software or other updates or some of the things we can do in imaging that we want to do as we bring it through. So it's kind of a three-part set of activities, and we think it's pretty well planned out. I wouldn't expect big changes from our plan, and if there are changes in the future, then we'll be sure to talk about them. Yes, our first thought here and bringing the system to market has been to allow surgeons to go deeper into the existing indications we have already. So the indications for da Vinci 5 largely mirror the Xi index indications that we had already. But we do think that it will invite new surgeons and care teams into robotic assisted surgery. I think it allows us to deepen our relationship with that customer base, and we're excited about it. In terms of core capabilities, da Vinci 5 has some really core things. Better imaging that right now, today, it's better, and will get better over time. Precision and high performance and tracking performance allows for really subtle and fine surgical motions. And we think that's really powerful in its core. It's a core capability. Faster workflow opens new opportunities for people, too. So we do think there are additional clinical indications we can pursue. We are evaluating them. We have not finalized on everything yet. And likely they will require conversations with FDA. So we're not prepared at this time to tell you what they might be, but as we get a little closer and work through it then we'll describe it once we've settled our approach. Jamie, why don't I. No, Jamie, go ahead and take it, apologies. In terms of raw capability, I think that it will help care teams acquire skills more quickly and it also helps them in the case. As you can kind of think of that as contact sensitive help. The device is kind of aware of where it is and what it's doing and can share that information with the care team, so that as they're doing things, whether it's changing tools or setting it up, it provides real-time help to help guide them through it. And I think that's a really good thing. It just makes it easier to use. Our Intuitive hub has integration, technologies that start with da Vinci 5 and will get better over time as we release software updates and hardware updates. And so that starts to close an analytical loop for our customers from what they're seeing in the case to video review to video analytics to feeding back information to their phones and their laptops and whatever their means are consuming that data is. So that gives them an analytical loop, which should also help. And we'll also continue to evolve our simulation training and some of our other packages, our online learning, that will help them as well. So I think all of this is going to take a little bit of time, but I think the design concept, I think our designers did a beautiful job. I think the design concept of integrating these ideas, making it easy for care teams, for surgeons to follow that journey should help us. Final point I'll make is that in our labs and during our early experience with da Vinci 5, it looks like forced reflection helps novice, new to robotics, new to robotics assistant surgery, require their skills faster. So it should invite more surgeons in and ease their journey. It remains to be proven. It's not done and done, but we think it's encouraging. And so stay tuned. I think keep asking that question and as the data starts to come out, we'll be pleased to share it with you. Yes, let me share my perspective. Rick, thanks for the question, and then Brian, I'll kick it to you to talk about the range. I think what we can tell you is what we see and what we've seen is continued deceleration such that it's flat year-over-year. There are a lot of opinions out in the field and we can all talk to them. I think the reality is nobody really knows yet. We're going to have to look through it together and as a result it's going to be dynamic. We do know that bariatric surgery is well tolerated and it's a good option and we also know that people are interested in pharmaceuticals and that the pharmaceuticals work as long as you take them for a subset of the population and then stop working if you don't. What that means for future surgery, I think there's a range of opinions and I would not hang a lot of confidence on any of them just yet. And that's why we have a range. And Brian, perhaps you can just touch on how you see bariatric surgery affecting the range. Just reiterate that, if you would. Yes, I think as we add capabilities and time, we have some imaging things that we want to do. We have some things in terms of software upgrades and analytics power and some things we want to do in terms of integration. That's much more likely to be \u201825 and later than \u201824. A lot of \u201824 will be making sure that we and our suppliers feel great about what we've got and then adapting to any immediate feedback that we see. Sure, we're getting a variety of feedback on the instruments themselves. Just a reminder for everyone, they have very sensitive sensors that are built into the distal end, in the body end of the instruments that are sterilizable and cleanable, and they report back contact forces with tissue which at a sensitive way, which has been a goal for us and for surgery for a long time. So it's a hard technology, we've been really excited to bring it to market. We will hear everything from, hey, I'm getting great results with da Vinci X and Xi today, that has very limited version of haptics. It really doesn't have in-body sensing. It does have a little something, but it's not sensing in the technical sense. And that's true, they're getting great results. So it's a new sense. That said, people are quite interested to explore where it will take them. And what's interesting is that when you're using a force sensing instrument, it's sensing whether you turn on force reflection into the surgeon's hands or not. So the surgeon can feel it, they can turn it on, or they can turn it off, but still measure so that they have the feeling experience of an X or an Xi. And what they find when they turn it on and off is that the amount of force that they apply during surgery to tissue decreases when force reflection into the hands is on. And so the big question is what's the clinical value of that? What will be the implications for patient outcomes by procedure and by technique? And that's what they're going to go explore and we will help them do that exploration. So now we're talking about the future, what could happen. I suspect, I believe, this is a personal opinion. There will be types of procedures and types of patients where having lower force applied to tissue during the surgery is going to be clinically meaningful. And we have to go prove that. So I think it's quite interesting. The technology is sophisticated. We are with our manufacturing partners learning how to make these at scale with good yield and robust. It's a worthy endeavor, but it is not easy and we're going to focus on it, make sure that we get what we want. We want to make sure we have robust and high yield products, we want to extend their lives to help the economics of our customers and our economics. So that is our first focus. As to the six instruments, I'm going look to Jamie as to whether the sixth number is right, I think it is. Certainly over time, we have the opportunity to extend it to other instruments. But that first set of six are the ones that we thought were right. Six is the right number, Jamie? Yes, yes, I'm actually here in Europe, have been for the last couple of weeks talking to SP surgeons here, I think the early uptake and early excitement is quite palpable. Where we've had broad indications, as you know, in Korea and now Japan, we've seen a nice uptake in adoption and good study, good clinical study. And I think that the surgeons here are building on that. They're learning from and adapting what they see in the rest of the world and getting excited about it. So I'm encouraged. How deep that goes? It's still early days here in Europe, we will see. But we're starting to see fairly long case studies in things like colorectal surgery coming out of Asia and other places. We have submitted, as Jamie had mentioned, for an additional indication in the United States, we have another one coming. We have IDE trials ongoing. So we have some national experiments to see what occurs. We know the experiment in Korea has worked out well. We're in process in Japan and now we're in the early experience for broad indications in Europe. That should help us generate data and accelerate additional indications over time in the U.S. And I have to say, I think It remains a build for SP, but I'm encouraged by the build. Yes, it's a good question, Thank you. This is approximate, not specific, so take it with some error bars. But, you know, I think what you're going to see in force feedback study is going to be a progression. You'll see narrow series, single institution studies come out first that are kind of directional. They talk about what they're seeing in their own, and then you'll see a little bit, and that should be the kind of thing that comes out in the next 12 months. And then over the next period after that, over the next couple of years, you'll see multiple center trials that are comparing in a little more structured way. So I think you can predict the path of the journey, but I think this is something that you're going to see from narrower input to start to broader input in the next year to prospective studies that start to report over the next year after that. So I think it's a build, but I think it's going to be a powerful build in the end. I think with regard to efficiencies, we're hearing anecdotal reports already that the surge in autonomy features that are in da Vinci, the ability for them to control their own field and to control the equipment, the Hansler equipment in the room has been really positive and they're reporting efficiencies already. I think real-world evidence is going to be powerful on the efficiency side. I think that's the kind of thing that people can benchmark their own cases. We also our data collection capabilities between Intuitive Hub and the My Intuitive app allow them to measure that very quickly. So I think you'll see the real-world evidence of that build and it will be in the coming months and quarters and that will be exciting for us. Jamie, why don't you take that one? I'll jump in and then Jamie take it. I think that in the prepared remarks, we had said you had a nice capital placement year and we had a bolus of post-COVID comeback into Q1. I think the uncertainty part of this is really just going to be what the inpatient volumes look like in the next quarters of 2024. In other words, just the patient census as it comes through. But you're right, I think that it's an indicator of capacity. So depending what that patient census looks like, that'll determine the high end and the low end of utilization growth in terms of how many procedures people want to put on those systems. Sorry Jamie, go ahead, you might discuss the modeling there. And Jason, if you have one more follow-up, that will wrap it up for us. Okay, that was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians, and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim. Better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams, and ultimately a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better, where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly, so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months."

            "name": "Jamie Samath",
            "content": "Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or proforma basis. And we'll also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our proforma and GAAP results is posted on our website. In Q1, da Vinci procedures grew 16%. The installed basis systems grew 14% to 8,887 systems. And average system utilization increased by 2%, lower than recent trends because of the strength in procedure growth and utilization in Q1 of last year that reflected a significant benefit from the treatment of patient backlogs. U.S. procedures grew 14%, driven by broad growth in general surgery. Bariatrics procedure growth in the U.S. continued to moderate and was flat year-over-year. OUS procedures grew 20%, reflecting strong growth in general surgery and thoracic procedures. Brian will provide additional detail on our clinical performance later in the call. Turning to capital, we placed 313 systems in the first quarter, compared to 312 systems in Q1 of last year. Excluding trading transactions, net new system placements grew 16% to 284 systems. In the U.S., we placed 148 systems in Q1, including eight da Vinci 5 placements, compared with 141 systems placed in Q1 of last year. Given constrained supply of da Vinci 5, system placements may be choppy this year as some customers that are interested in da Vinci 5 decide whether to acquire a fourth generation system with an upgrade rate or wait for adequate supply. Outside the U.S., we placed 165 systems in Q1, compared with 171 systems last year. Current quarter system placements included 84 into Europe, 20 into Japan, and 10 into China, compared with 101 into Europe, 16 into Japan, and 18 into China in Q1 of last year. Placements in the U.K. were below our expectations and lower than Q1 last year, because of the reallocation of NHS Capital Funding to help address industrial actions in the NHS. Placements in China continue to reflect the impact of domestic robotic competition and delayed tenders due to a broader central government focus on systematic governance across sectors, including healthcare. First quarter revenue was $1.89 billion, an increase of 11% from last year. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth was 12%. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: Leasing represented 51% of Q1 placements, compared with 42% in Q1 of last year. Given customer preference for our usage-based models in the U.S. and the launch of da Vinci 5, we continue to expect the proportion of systems placed under lease arrangements to grow over time. Q1 system average selling prices were $1.39 million as compared to $1.47 million last year. System ASPs were negatively impacted by regional and platform mix and lower pricing in China, partially offset by lower trade-ins. We recognized $29 million of leased buyout revenue in the first quarter, compared with $21 million last quarter and $24 million last year. da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,780, flat to last year and down $20, compared to the last quarter. The sequential decline in I&A per procedure is primarily a result of procedure mix in the U.S., given strong growth in cholecystectomy and the moderation of growth in bariatrics. We have also seen larger IDNs in the U.S. look for operational efficiencies by reducing inventory. Turning to Ion. There were approximately 19,500 Ion procedures in the first quarter, an increase of 90% as compared to last year. Since launching the Ion platform in 2019, on a cumulative basis, more than 100,000 procedures have now been performed. In Q1, we placed 70 Ion systems compared to 55 in Q1 of 2023 and 44 last quarter. Q1 results reflected a partial recovery from last quarter, as catheter supply improved. Our team continued to work on stabilizing supply of the catheter and vision probe. Q1 results included four Ion system placements in the U.K., following the European clearance last year. The installed base of Ion systems increased 61% year-over-year to 604 systems, of which 244 are under operating lease arrangements. 24 of the systems placed in the quarter were SP systems, including eight systems in Europe, reflecting clearance early in the quarter. First quarter SP procedure growth was 60%, with healthy growth in Korea and the U.S., and early-stage growth in Japan. In the U.S., during the quarter, we completed a 510(k) submission for a thoracic indication, made continued regulatory progress toward a colorectal submission and enrolled additional patients in our IDE for nipple-sparing mastectomy. The SP installed base grew 55% from the year-ago quarter to 201 systems. Moving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the first quarter of 2024 was 67.6%, compared with 67.2% for the first quarter of 2023 and 68% last quarter. The sequential reduction in pro forma gross margin primarily reflects higher fixed costs, including depreciation expense for expanded manufacturing capacity and higher costs associated with the launch of da Vinci 5. Our manufacturing and business unit teams made progress in the quarter on activities to improve gross margin over the medium term. This remains an area of key focus for us. First quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 7%, compared with last year, slightly lower than our -- than expectations due to the timing of certain expenses. Pro forma operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were 140 basis points lower than Q1 last year, reflecting planned leverage in enabling functions, partially offset by increased R&D to fund innovation and future growth. Pro forma other income was $72.5 million for Q1, higher than $67.1 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher interest income. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 22.5%, consistent with our expectations. First quarter 2024 pro forma net income was $544 million or $1.50 per share, compared with $444 million or $1.23 per share for the first quarter of last year. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $547 million, or $1.51 per share for the first quarter of 2024, compared with GAAP net income of $361 million, or $1.00 per share for the first quarter of 2023. First quarter GAAP tax expense was a benefit of $9 million, reflecting excess tax benefits associated with employee equity plans of $111 million. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website, and include excess tax benefits associated with employee equity plans, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, litigation charges, and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.3 billion, flat to the end of last year. The sequential changes in cash included cash generated from operating activities, offset by capital expenditures of $242 million and the net impact of employee equity plans of $46 million. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian. Yes where we saw particular strength regionally was in the U.S. and the U.K. in particular. What you also see in OUS markets, as Brian described, is this continuing growth in procedures beyond urology. That first is focused on cancer procedures, colorectal thoracic, hysterectomy, some early stage growth in benign in our international markets. So the combination of those things, I think, were behind the performance in Q1. And as you kind of look at then the inputs from the teams, as we get feedback from our customers, I think then we kind of reflect that in the rest of the guidance. Obviously, the guidance is only up a point at the low and the high end of the range, so something we're watching carefully. Nope, I think you got it Gary. Yes, I mean... Oh, go ahead, Gary. Yes. I think the first dynamic is trading-ins. Given the limited supply in dV 5, those placements will be, during the measured launch, focused on incremental placements. So not a lot of trade activity coming from dV 5. And if you look at what's left in the install base for our third gen SI, you've got about 350 systems globally, of which 50 are in the U.S. So we do expect trading volumes to be down quite a bit in \u201824. With respect to overall system placements, I know we made the comments on the last call, but generally we don't guide system placements, so we'll let you run that through your models given the updated procedure guidance. But certainly we've acknowledged that placements could be choppy, while we're constrained on dv 5. In Q1, we didn't really see any customers pushing back on I don't want an Xi, we want to wait for dV 5. But since the launch, which obviously was only in March, we've had our Connect conference, we've had SAGES this week, a significant number of surgeons and executives have now seen dV 5 put their hands on it. So we're acknowledging that customers may choose to wait. We don't have enough evidence or indication yet to see which way that will go. It is, and it's a combination of graspers and needle drivers, and those instruments are used in very common tasks, dissection, retraction and suturing. Yes, it's primarily a function of the competitive environment we've described with the domestic robotic players. What we actually have now given last year, we qualified a domestically manufactured Xi is actually some segmentation between the domestically manufactured product and an imported product. And the domestic product gives us the opportunity to both participate in tenders that require a locally produced system, but also allows us to segment on price. But the primary impact on China pricing is really competition. And you kind of see that theme broadly with other MedTech players in terms of the impact of VBP. It doesn't apply in this case, but kind of the macro theme of pricing pressure does. Yes, I'd say it was a partial recovery in the quarter -- we haven't completely resolved both catheter supply and the vision probe. We still have a little bit of backlog in terms of number of systems that's pending, kind of, stabilization of that supply. With respect to where are we placing those systems, it's actually a blend between existing accounts and new accounts. We still have a number of opportunities for what I call green field accounts. So both are a focus for the sales team. Yes, I mean -- go ahead, Gary. I would just say that if you look at Q1 utilization over an extended period, look at what the CAGR is versus the year-over-year comparison, you see that stuff to be in a more normal range of 3% to 4%. I do think that in the year ago quarter, you had a number of institutions that actually stepped themselves up to do sprints with respect to their ability to treat patients. And so I do think that was elevated and at that level of utilization growth of 13%, it wasn't particularly sustainable. So as I look forward to the rest of the year, I'd expect some levels of utilization growth that let's say are closer to our long-term averages. There's still some patient backlog benefit in the year-ago quarters, even in Q2 and Q3. So it's not perfectly matched, but I think there's room for normalization over time. Yes, we have some work to put eye on at a point where it's actually available to sell, so that will take us some time. We're not expecting to have commercialization really until the back half of 2024. And China is a market where, like many cases, when we launch a new product in a market, we do that progressively as we kind of build our infrastructure in terms of training capabilities and engage with customers. So I'd say back up at \u201824 is when you start to see the potential for Ion placements in China. Oh, sorry. Yes, our understanding is it is not in the quota given the price."
