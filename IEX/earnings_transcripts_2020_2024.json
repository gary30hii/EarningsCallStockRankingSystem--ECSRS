A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Thank you. You may begin.\nMike Yates: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Let me start by saying, thank you for joining us for a discussion of the IDEX fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial highlights. Last night we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the three months and the year ending December 31, 2020. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today's webcast can be accessed on our company's website at www.idexcorp.com. Joining me today is Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Grogan, our Chief Financial Officer. The format for our call today is as follows: we will begin with Eric providing an overview of the state of IDEX's businesses, including a recap of our recent performance and how we are viewing 2021. Eric will then provide an update on a few initiatives that we believe are key to IDEX's culture, before moving into a review of our order performance and providing our 2021 outlook for our end markets. Bill will then discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results. And we'll conclude with an outlook for the first quarter and full year 2021. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access the complete replay, beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes, by dialing the toll-free number 877-660-6853 and entering conference ID 13712088. Or you may simply log on to our company\u2019s homepage for the webcast replay. Before we begin, a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the Safe Harbor language in last night's press release in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO. Eric?\nEric Ashleman: Thank you, Mike. I'd like to start by thanking our people all around the world who have risen to the occasion during such a challenging year. It's been a year full of challenge and change, with the numerous safety protocols and disruptions in the marketplace. In that environment, our people continue to shine. So to all the IDEX team members listening in on this call, thank you. Because of the protocols we have in place, the disruptions in our operations have been limited. The COVID trends across Europe, North America and India have been troubling and we continue to follow those developments closely and remain steadfast in providing a safe place for our employees to work. We continue to deliver solutions for our customers during a challenging year, focusing on the critical innovation we need to support our long-term strategy, as well as producing new products to help the fight against the pandemic. Bill will walk through the details shortly. With customer focused strong execution and our ability to react quickly to unpredictable events, helped us deliver a relatively strong performance in 2020, a true testament to our resiliency. Liquidity was a primary focus of our management strategy as the pandemic hit and I'm happy to say that we were able to drive record free cash flow this year. As we address the challenges in front of us, we see a path to bullishness for 2021. We have seen a steady recovery in our end markets, which we will detail in a few slides. The diversity and quality of our businesses continues to serve us well, ensuring that we can weather any storm and quickly capitalize when market conditions improve. While the pandemic still presents many challenges to solve, we are starting to see a focus pivot back to core commercial endeavors, as we and our customers prepare for a world healed from the ravages of COVID-19. Our businesses remain focused on operating safely and we are prepared to leverage our supply chains and react to increased demands. A year like 2020 truly test the culture of a company. Are you rooted in strong values that people really live and believe? If so, you'll be better prepared to survive and even thrive. IDEX is that kind of company and it served us well in a year none of us could have ever predicted. I'm proud of the culture we have built at IDEX. It is admired by many, but we can strengthen it still. We leverage our culture and mission to bind together a uniquely decentralized and diverse company and our commitment to work even harder to support diversity equity and inclusion is tied directly to this important aspect of IDEX differentiation. Our resiliency, agility and fundamental ability to execute have IDEX exceptionally well positioned to play off as aggressively as we move forward. We are actively investing to support our best organic growth bets and we have ramped up our capital spending to support very exciting initiatives. The M&A markets are moving again and we are expanding our capabilities to execute on strategic acquisitions. In January, we announced an agreement to acquire ABEL Pumps and expect that deal to close in the first quarter. We actively seek to deploy additional capital to acquire IDEX-like businesses, as well as make some calculated bets in new technologies, to bolster our growth potential to further strengthen our portfolio and enhance our return to shareholders. Moving to slide seven. As I just mentioned, the strength of IDEX comes from the IDEX difference, a teachable methodology where great teams working together in a superior culture focused on the critical things that matter with a natural orientation towards the most important needs of their customers. Our culture is a significant focus and one of my key leadership priorities. To that end, we are making ongoing improvements based on feedback we received from our employees every day. Last month the IDEX Foundation, which was created to positively impact the communities in which we live and work, took a significant step forward as part of these efforts. IDEX committed $6 million to boost sponsored activities across the company. The foundation formerly added equity and opportunity as a lasting and fully funded part of its mission, creating opportunities for underserved disadvantaged people of color in our communities. This donation allows the foundation to more than double its annual giving. In addition to initiatives focused on equity and opportunity, we will continue the great work our people have been doing in our communities like building homes for the homeless, renovating community centers, and supporting schools and learning opportunities for young people. This month, we will host more than a dozen facilitative employee focus groups around the world. The feedback from our employees will help shape our path forward in diversity equity inclusion. Developing a formal framework and goals for our DE&I program is something we have all deployed at the senior leadership level making it a top priority. As part of that commitment, I intend to have a Senior DE&I leader in place reporting directly to me later this year. We will continue to grow and advance our culture as a key element of differentiation. You have my commitment on that. Turning now to our commercial results on slide eight. Broad rebound in order rates we discussed in the third quarter continued as our fourth quarter organic orders were up 7% compared to the prior year. We entered the quarter with optimism based on the strength of the third quarter improvement and that continued into the fourth quarter. Excluding timing on large OEM blanket orders year-over-year, our monthly order rates improved throughout the quarter. FMT organic orders for the fourth quarter were up 3%, driven by project orders in our water businesses continued strength in agriculture and recovery in industrial day rate businesses. HST organic orders were up 6% in the fourth quarter, driven by new product initiatives in life sciences and the recovery in auto and semicon continuing to boost our Sealing Solutions businesses. Finally, Fire & Safety/Diversified organic orders were up 15% in the quarter. Dispensing saw significant improvement as retailers began to release pent-up demand for equipment refreshes banded after a strong bounce back in the third quarter continued to improve based on auto market strength. And Fire & Safety saw growth in several product lines. A year ago, as we entered 2020, we talked about the general industrial slowdown that we were seeing and what a flat to down 2% to 5% world looked like for IDEX. We have proactively taken strategic actions to address these factors. We then faced the onset of the pandemic and we responded to it with purpose. As we close out 2020 and look forward, we are optimistic that our units and markets are quickly on a path to pre-COVID levels. The actions that we took in 2019 and 2020 have left us well positioned as we move into 2021. Turning to slide nine. We provide our current outlook for primary end markets. In our Fluid & Metering Technology segment, industrial day rates continue to tick up in the fourth quarter further solidifying the optimism that we discussed last quarter. We see this increase driven largely by OpEx needs of our customers. We continue to see large capital projects remain on hold. We anticipate that broader signs of economic stability and higher degrees of certainty on COVID recovery timing is required before capital projects begin to move again. But the investment discussions are happening. Our Water business has continued to show resiliency and we are closely monitoring the toll that 2020 will take on municipal budgets in 2021 and beyond. The strength in agriculture that we've called out for the previous two quarters has continued and we expect it to grow in 2021. Energy markets continue to remain challenged with markets still down compared to 2019 levels. Stabilization of these businesses is largely dependent on increases in fuel prices driving new capital investments in oil and gas. Turning to the Health and Science Technologies segment. As we discussed last quarter we have identified opportunities and applications to help fight COVID across each of our segments but particularly in HST. We were able to drive approximately $30 million of revenue in 2020 and expect to generate about the same amount in 2021 related to these initiatives. While some of this revenue is one-time in nature, we believe the technologies and applications we have developed here will generate recurring opportunities in 2022 and beyond. So, relative to our $25 million to $100 million of opportunities we highlighted, we'll achieve about $60 million. AI improved during the fourth quarter and looks to be on the rebound in 2021. In life sciences, we saw an offset by continued weakness in IVD/BIO as lab capacity is still largely focused on COVID response putting on hold other projects and initiatives. The strength in semicon that we mentioned last quarter has continued. In addition our ceilings business has benefited from a rebound in automotive. We see continued recovery in 2021 for the auto market, particularly driven by strength in European car sales in China and India. Food and pharma has also remained a bright spot as our businesses continue to benefit from growth in MPT projects and Microfluidics business. Moving to the Fire & Safety/Diversified segment, we saw continued improvement in most of our markets. The largest driver was the significant improvement in the dispensing market as large retailers increase demand for equipment refreshes, combined with order strength in the Asia dispensing markets. As mentioned previously, the pace of the auto recovery continues to exceed expectations springing on our BAND-IT business. Fire & Rescue businesses continued to see strong order performance and we believe that we are seeing a recovery in the OEM businesses driving through some of the delays in backlog concerns we referenced last quarter. As with all our municipal businesses, we continue to closely monitor the impact on budgets to see if there are any lagging effects from COVID response spending. As I highlighted in my previous remarks, we are optimistic about the market recovery we are seeing across most of our markets. And we need to be prepared for potential interruptions, particularly in the first half of 2021. Our teams have shown the ability to address these short-term shocks proactively. And the strategic actions we have taken across our businesses, has us well positioned to be able to ride the positive momentum, we're seeing as we exit the issue of the pandemic. With that, I'll turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results for the quarter and full year.\nBill Grogan: Thanks, Eric. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on slide 11. Q4 orders of $679 million were up 10% overall and up 7% organically. Organic orders increased across each of our segments, with drivers highlighted by Eric in his previous comments. For the year orders were down 3% overall and down 4% organically, with strong organic order recovery in the fourth quarter, partially offsetting the 18% organic order decline we saw in the second quarter at the height of the pandemic. Fourth quarter sales of $615 million were up 2% overall, but down 1% organically. Our industrial and energy markets led the decline, but did have positive organic growth of around 60% of our reporting units led by strong performance in our ceilings MPT and dispensing businesses. Full year sales of $2.4 billion were down 6% overall and down 9% organically, driven by the impact of COVID, industrial market softness and challenges in oil and gas. Q4 gross margins contracted 20 basis points to 43.8%, driven by a decline in volume and unfavorable sales mix, partially offset by price capture. For the full year, gross margins contracted 140 basis points. Excluding the impact of the FMD inventory step-up, adjusted gross margins contracted 130 basis points to 43.9% driven by volume declines in sales mix, offset by our continued ability to capture price and drive operational productivity. Fourth quarter operating margin was 22.6%, up 50 basis points compared to prior year. Full year operating margin was 22.1%, down 110 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 23.4% for the fourth quarter, up 10 basis points compared to prior year and 22.8% for the year, down 140 basis points compared to 2019. I'll discuss the drivers of operating income on the following slide. Our Q4 effective tax rate was 22.2%, which was higher than the prior year ETR of 20.6%, due to the revaluation of foreign deferred income tax balances driven by changes in foreign tax rates. Fourth quarter adjusted net income was $105 million, resulting in an EPS of $1.37, up $0.04 or 3% over prior year adjusted EPS. Full year adjusted net income was $397 million, resulting in adjusted EPS of $5.19, down $0.61 or 11% compared to prior year. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $149 million, up 9% compared to prior year and was 142% of adjusted net income. For the year, free cash flow was $518 million, a record for IDEX, up 9% versus last year and 131% of adjusted net income driven by strong working capital performance. Moving on to slide 12. We're going to review our full year adjusted operating income. As Eric mentioned, we faced unprecedented challenges in 2020, but the structural and discretionary actions we took were critical to lessen the volume impact on our income and margins. Using a similar framework as we have for the previous two quarters, we wanted to walk through the components of our full year adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income declined $66 million for the year. With organic sales down around $247 million, we would have expected a negative impact in operating income of $148 million at roughly 60% contribution margin rate. The $148 million was offset by $58 million of executed operational actions, $23 million from the impact of restructuring actions combined with $35 million of discretionary cost control items and $10 million of price net productivity and negative business mix. Finally, we had $7 million of reduced variable compensation for the year. This yielded a better than expected flow-through of 34%. Again organic flow-through is based on taking reported sales and op income less the impact of FX and acquisitions, which was roughly $77 million on the top line and $7 million of profit. Overall, our team's focused on quickly managing the crisis at hand and effectively managing costs to mitigate revenue declines and has IDEX well positioned to leverage the recovery we expect in 2021. Moving on to guidance, I'm on slide 13. Based on current order rates and expected market recoveries, we see an accelerating 2021 and expect organic revenue for the year to be up 6% to 8%. This translates to an EPS impact of roughly $0.75 to $0.95 depending on our top line results. We expect our productivity initiatives to more than offset inflation providing $0.04 of benefits. The structural cost actions we have taken are expected to provide $0.12 of EPS benefit in the year. As we move past the pandemic we will aggressively invest in both organic and inorganic opportunities. As business recovers we will loosen discretionary cost controls as appropriate. As mentioned previously, we expect approximately two-thirds of the discretionary cost to return over time. Additionally, we will be making investments to enhance our ability to execute and integrate M&A opportunities as we view this as a critical time to enhance our capabilities, as well as continue to fund our targeted organic growth initiatives. These discretionary add-backs and strategic investments will provide approximately $0.19 to $0.26 of pressure in our 2021 guidance. Next we anticipate $0.08 to $0.11 headwind from variable compensation as we reset our incentive comp for the year. Finally FMD has 1/4 of inorganic results which we expect to provide $3 million of revenue, but provide $0.03 of EPS pressure. The structural actions we have made to improve FMD's profit profile based on the situation in the energy market will get FMD back to positive op profit in the second quarter. Now let's take a look at a couple of non-operational items. First we expect an $0.18 headwind from tax primarily related to discrete benefits we realized in 2020 associated with equity vesting and option exercising. Second, we expect a 2% tailwind from FX providing $0.13 of EPS benefit. So in summary we are projecting organic revenue growth of 6% to 8% for the year and EPS expectations are in the range of $5.65 to $5.95, a 9% to 15% increase over 2020. Moving to Slide 14. Let me provide some additional details regarding our 2021 guidance for both the first quarter and full year. In Q1 we are projecting EPS to range from $1.38 to $1.42 with organic revenue growth of 2% to 4% and operating margins of approximately 23.5%. The Q1 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. We expect a 3% top line benefit from the impact of FX and corporate costs in the first quarter are expected to be around $18 million. Turning to some additional details for the full year guidance. Again we're projecting full year EPS in the range of $5.65 to $5.95 with full year organic revenue to be up 6% to 8% with operating margins between 23.5% to 24.5%. We expect FX to provide a 2% benefit to top line results. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $55 million. And free cash flow is expected to be between 115% to 120% of net income. Corporate costs are expected to be approximately $70 million for the year. Finally our earnings guidance excludes any associated cost or earnings with future acquisitions or restructuring charges. Abel Pump is not included in these estimates and we will revise guidance once that deal is closed. With that I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts. \nEric Ashleman: Thanks Bill. Before questions, I would like to once again thank our employees and stakeholders for their contributions to what I consider exceptional execution in a challenging environment. We have proven the resilience of our businesses and clearly demonstrated the impact of the IDEX difference in our operating model. While we are not completely out of the woods this is a time for optimism. And I believe that our businesses are well positioned to focus on the critical priorities that will accelerate our growth on the other side of the pandemic. With that let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Poliniak: Want to go back to your comment Eric on M&A and this concept of technology and investing there, could you maybe give us a little bit of color on what that means in terms of size or if there's verticals? And then also how are you reconciling those opportunities with the historical discipline that IDEX has always held with M&A? \nEric Ashleman: Yes. Well it's great to talk to you Allison. Thank you. So look I -- we talked a little bit here before about obviously we think that the technology cycle is compressed a lot. And no doubt it was already kind of flying in a dynamic way. So as we're thinking about that at IDEX, we're thinking about organic bets and development that we're going to do internally, but no doubt we're going to have to appropriate some of this from the outside world. And I think that -- you can think of that as a range of technologies. I mean for a lot of our component products it's probably going to come down to things like sensors and data readouts. From other businesses that we have it might be more analytical in nature. So it's going to take some of the inputs that we're able to provide in a severe duty space and come up to some determinant outcome and present that to our customers. So I think it would run the gamut from -- everything from embedded sensors and control elements up to frankly some software pieces that might be out there that would stick and sit very nice comfortably next to some pieces of our business. And I just think ultimately the call on that is going to be speed, speed and the ability to impact a solution in a way that we think will give us some differentiated edge. No doubt, when you're looking at assets especially on the inorganic side the economics can often work in different ways. And so we challenge our teams to think about value creation in a different way as well, in terms of how it might extend our solution bring us closer to customers lead to other open doors. So we're spending an awful lot of time on that as a team; Bill and I and the rest of the senior team and really putting our heads together and what that will look like for IDEX but we're excited about it.\nAllison Poliniak-Cusic: That's helpful. And then I just want to go to your comment on capital projects. It sounds like you're getting some inquiries or they're starting to increase there. But the balance of that going forward potentially sounds like it's almost like a reopening kind of theme there. Are you feeling like there's starting to be sort of this pent-up demand as people look out into the balance of 2021? Just any thoughts there.\nEric Ashleman: Yes. Well I think so. As you know I mean, especially I'll just take the FMD segment in general. There's a ton of support there on the day rate side and much of the improvement that we've seen in Q3 and Q4 and that's where it's coming from. The system is working. People are adding shifts. There's just more output. And we come along with that. And then there's an important component of project business that we would need to see to kind of take it to the next level. And I will say that you don't see a lot of that yet in the actual order numbers that we have as good as they are. But the discussions that support that the discussions around spec points and applications and problems that we can solve you can feel that building. And I think that's behind some of the optimism that we feel, coming ahead particularly as the virus the course of the virus becomes more understood.\nAllison Poliniak-Cusic: Great. Thanks a lot. I\u2019ll pass it along.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Allison.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Hi, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Hey, Eric. So congratulations. You get your first quarter under your belt. And as we look at the results and the quality of the earnings it looks just like vintage IDEX and seeing the incrementals come back. But could you share with us any like high-level thoughts here now where do you think you'll be focusing a little bit differently where might there be an Eric imprint here as CEO? Is \u2013 I suspected a lot of it is just continued focus on 80:20 and the IDEX way but just broad strokes how you're thinking about that now?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. Sure Deane. Look I think some of it we touched on in my opening comments. I mean I would actually start with the cultural aspects. I think one of the reasons we performed as well as we have we've been as nimble as we have I mean it really comes back to what we built here in terms of a culture and an organizational mentality that allows us to course correct and really focus on things without frankly a lot of control coming from Bill or I or the rest of the team. So in an environment that probably has even more of that, going to the next level there is hugely important. Then I think, partially thinking back a bit to the comments around Allison's question technology and how that's going to layer across the solution sets that we have at IDEX, recognizing we've got a lot of different states of evolution depending on the companies, that's a place where I'm spending an awful lot of time to make sure that we're thoughtful and not in some ways kind of overdoing it with a center-led answer because that's not really the appropriate response. And then I would end with certainly capital allocation and a lot of focus on how we can frankly put some more of it to work. The environment's tough but we're doing some things around focused resources, focused pieces of the company and a lot of just very iterative thinking as a team of how we can tackle that and frankly capitalize on the engine that we really built over the last two years. I mean I think we're uniquely positioned here even in a difficult environment to bring that to bear.\nDeane Dray: That's really helpful. And I think you've given some good insight into how you're thinking about the end markets, that Page 9 was especially helpful, as was the bridge that Bill walked us through. So if I could just take a moment and ask for more specifics on your muni outlook, because that came up a couple of different times where you talked about the toll that COVID is taking. But there's like two pieces to muni. One is water, which tends to be more resilient in Fire & Rescue a little more CapEx. But what are your assumptions on muni budgets and spending here on those two areas? \nEric Ashleman: Yes. I mean, no doubt that's definitely an area that we're watching with a lot of focus. As you know, I mean those markets tend to lag an awful lot. And so something bad happens in the world and it takes a while for it to read through. And then of course, if you think of kind of our exposure layered on top of it, particularly the two areas that you mentioned, we're doing very important work that that many times is buffered against some of it. So on the water side we're heavily tilted towards the analytical side, analytical services and support. And so even if a system has to make do with infrastructure might have to delay some kind of \u2013 lay out a heavy infrastructure, they often turn to our kind of work to make sure that they're leveraging the system that they do have. Frankly, also on the water side, I mean if we go into an era, where the environmental compliance has stepped up a bit, that's another dynamic that helps us there. So that's against that sort of other trend that we are watching around budget support and budget assurance. So the two things are kind of working there together but we see that same resiliency. Fire & Rescue, again this is one of the most global stories that we have. And so no doubt in the more mature spaces CapEx purchases, considering where the source of that funding is going to come from is always something that we're thinking about and tracking. But we are \u2013 we course, correct a bit here. And so it's a different story in some of the emerging markets where we've got great presence and frankly a lot of technology and people on the ground. So I think that global breadth helps us on that side as well. But no doubt we're watching the same dynamics that you all are. As we go forward, we're looking to see if there's backstopping and support or not all over the world and -- but we think we're well positioned.\nDeane Dray: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Deane.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Halloran: Hey, good morning everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Hi, Mike.\nMike Halloran: So let's start on the demand curve here. Obviously, understand the optimism comments. Really good to hear. Is that -- how is that optimism embedded in the guidance range? How are you thinking about trends as you work through the year here? And any commentary on how customers are thinking about what their spend patterns look like, and how much optimism is there in the channel when you're having those conversations? And I guess one more tail to that what do you think that means for the next couple of years?\nBill Grogan: Mike maybe I'll start off with the first part of your question relative to how we're thinking about pacing through the year in our guidance, I think, it's kind of consistent sequential improvement as we progress through the year. When you look at the 6% to 8% and where we are in the first quarter, there is kind of a gradual improvement that we need to achieve each quarter that's reasonable. When you think about the 6% to 8% between the segments, HST a little bit on the high end FMT and the middle and FSD on the lower side. So, generally balanced with small sequential improvements as we progress. And obviously, we have some targeted growth things that will phase out through the year that could inflect that plus or minus. But we're not looking for significant growth in any specific quarter as we progress through the year.\nEric Ashleman: Yes. Mike I just would continue to point to, I mean, in many ways what we're calling internal is sort of predictable uncertainty. There's a lot of stuff going on no doubt, but it's at least found a level where one of the things we've noticed all around the world is certainly -- we're going to keep the machines on keep the factories running, keep the borders open, keep product moving. It might be difficult at times, but that assurance is there. And certainly with some good signs in terms of virus mitigation that provides another piece of assurance. And then I think most people recognize, there's a lot of pent-up energy more broadly that if things continue to go this way, it would be released at some point. And again IDEX has such broad exposure. We think we'd participate in that. \nMike Halloran : So, third question just maybe some thoughts on supply chains how they look for you specifically; what channel inventories look like? And then lastly, how are you thinking about price cost dynamics? \nEric Ashleman: Yes sure. On -- with no doubt the supply chain is tricky to maneuver. I mean, we're seeing that as well as everybody else. I mean, the ports are clogged up and they've got some staffing issues in both of the coasts. And the containers are in the wrong places all of that stuff. And just frankly, there's not enough aircraft in the sky. So we're not immune to that. However, as you know, we are very localized generally in terms of our supply our production and our sell-through into markets. It's a very localized model. And so I think relative to a lot of people we probably don't experience it at the same levels  Our teams now for quite a while frankly even going back to the times where we were talking a lot more about tariffs and things like that have been thinking about where we have key sources of supply how we can make that frankly more flexible. And to this day every Tuesday we kind of go around the horn and talk both about kind of how we're holding up in terms of the virus how we're navigating supply chains. And fortunately we've been able to react and navigate around that and that's the go-forward assumption for us. \nMike Halloran : Appreciate it. Thank you.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Summerville : Thanks and good morning guys. Can you maybe talk about a little bit about the order of cadence you experienced through the quarter? It sounds like things got better what you've seen so far in January and if you wouldn't mind adding some geographic overlay to that as well. \nEric Ashleman : Yes. So relatively the order pattern through the quarter we mentioned it a little bit in the prepared remarks our day rate businesses continue to progress as we march through the fourth quarter. We had some timing of OEM blanket that made the absolute month numbers a little bit choppy. But for the things that we look as indicator the sequential improvement was there and that's continued on to January with another positive month of broad-based order improvement across all of our businesses. On the geographic side, I think it was a really strong performance in Asia in Europe. And North America lagged a little bit only because of hey that's where most of our core industrial and energy exposure is. It was the only area that was the lowest out of the 3 but again still sequentially improving. \nMatt Summerville : And then realizing dispensing's a fairly small piece of overall IDEX it can still kind of bounce around FSD a bit. I would imagine some of the orders you received maybe for future periods. Is there any sort of sequential cadence we should be thinking about as it pertains to FSD because of some of that lumpiness as we fine-tune our models? \nEric Ashleman : Yes. It's obviously a strong order quarter for dispensing. I would say it's going to pace out through the first three quarters of the year for the most part maybe a little bit more heavily weighted towards the first two quarters, because we did receive some orders for the full year from several customers. \nMatt Summerville: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Graham: Hey, good morning. Eric congratulations on your first solo quarter. Good luck.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you, Scott.\nScott Graham: So I wanted to maybe get a little bit more on your 6% to 8% organic for the year, which obviously suggests a pretty steady, but pretty healthy improvement 2Q, 3Q, 4Q. And maybe specifically in FMT, where you're kind of saying that's sort of like in the middle what are the markets that you're looking at in FMT that are going to be the drivers for that level of growth as the year progresses?\nEric Ashleman: Well, I mean, as you know, Scott, I mean, FMT is such a broad collection catch-all of a wide variety of industrial markets. But it \u2013 honestly it runs the gamut. So food production is in there. Anything related to \u2013 starting to work on infrastructure and build-out of highways and buildings and things we're going to participate there as well. So the chemical sector kind of coming back to life. We've got a significant presence there. I mean, it really is that sort of broad-based support coming from the industrial sector largely in kind of our mature geographic markets that just day rates that's kind of in the first chapter of it. I think the projects that we talked about earlier are starting to come on starting to get funded. You put those two things together that's sort of what the picture would look like in it. We see it as a pretty steady march. I mean, it's not like a hockey stick out there. We just think the line sort of continues as the world heals.\nScott Graham: Right. Well, you're shorter cycle, so that makes sense. Bill one for you. Could you give us an idea, I know you guys have been kind enough in the past to kind of share with us your revenues that are from OpEx which includes the day rates versus CapEx. What was the exit rate on that? \nBill Grogan: I would say, it's more heavily OpEx related. Again to Eric's comments relative to the larger capital projects, I think the conversations around those are picking up. We haven't seen a significant increase in order book relative to those things falling through the unknown. \nScott Graham: Would you say Bill that OpEx is maybe 70%, 75% of the revenue run rate right now?\nBill Grogan: Yeah, plus or minus. It's around there. \nScott Graham: Great. Thanks.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Good morning, guys. I wanted to focus on Health & Science Technologies for a second. So you gave some color there on the rapid tests coming roughly in line with kind of what you thought revenue-wise. But what are the puts and takes elsewhere in the business throughout the year? Because it seems \u2013 I 'm actually surprised that life sciences is more stable and analytically instrumentation just given what we're seeing with other companies. I don't know. I guess, what are you seeing in 2021 in that segment and how that is going to ebb and flow throughout the year?\nEric Ashleman: Well, I mean, look I think the analytical instrumentation story for us it's a pretty mature business. It was \u2013 obviously it faced some headwinds last year like a lot of life sciences did related to sort of up and down the street medical things and analytical services. We did see a nice bounce back there in the fourth quarter for AI. I think it kind of returns to its sort of historical rates as we go forward. The IVD/BIO side, which is also pretty mature that's the one that's still got the most pressure on it. It's much more dependent on people going and visiting labs and then has a consumable stream that tends to be out ahead of capital purchases and that's kind of where we come in. So consider that a bit of an offset to the AI story. And then pretty quickly, we get into the more dynamic pieces of this related to the works that we do in genomics. And obviously, the rapid test is the most dynamic of them all. So we put all that together. I think we tried to lay that out here. But I would say in general look this is a robust sector. It's obviously doing work that the world needs right now. We think we're well positioned in all of it. And the single biggest catalyst for us still remains that that work we're doing around the testing program.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. Is \u2013 based on your orders order trends what \u2013 I guess, looking out to 2021 for the full year, is it safe to say Fluid & Metering probably leads followed by HST and then Fire & Safety, or I guess can you rank order those organically?\nBill Grogan: For orders or sales? \nAndrew Buscaglia: For sales I mean.\nBill Grogan: Yeah. No, I think I mentioned a little bit earlier. I think HST is probably on the higher end FMC is down the middle and FSD's on the low end. If you picked \u2013 \nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. Sorry I missed that. Okay. And then just one last one. On M&A, you guys indicated a quarter or two ago that there were some deals in HST perking up. Anything \u2013 any update there or anything just broadly on M&A?\nEric Ashleman: Well, look as I said in the \u2013 both in the comments at the beginning and some of the questions here, I mean, we've got a lot of work going on in frankly all three segments. So I wouldn't say, that one is tilted more than the other. I mean we've got good opportunities in all three. We've got teams associated in and positioned in places where we're focused in all three. So, I'd hesitate to color it, as landed one way or another.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. All right. Thank you guys.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Giordano with Cowen. Please proceed with your questions.\nFrancisco Amador: Hey guys. Good morning. This is Francisco on for Joe. I wanted to ask with regards to slide 9 which is obviously very helpful, your general thoughts on automotive. We've seen some headlines on potential production cuts coming from the shortage in semiconductors. How exposed are you to that, and if you can just provide some incremental commentary there, please?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. Well, I mean, no doubt, we've seen the same headlines. I mean, this is still a relatively small piece of IDEX. I mean, we have exposure there in a couple of businesses and none of which is related to the electronics side. So, look, I think what we've seen so far the momentum is the recovery of an industry that was largely kind of shutdown for decent parts of the year. And then, frankly, most of our growth there is through growth of platforms. The technologies where we're actually focused, our team has done just a great job of being able to introduce that to more and more people, more and more players in the market. And then, secure those wings. And then -- wins and we would see them run out over several years. So, we haven't seen a big interruption. But again, we're not in that sort of same area the part spends. And we've got really good exposure to the platform wins in a couple of businesses.\nFrancisco Amador: Thanks. That's helpful. And just going back quickly to the M&A topic, just on the environment, would you say, it's more favorable than it was a couple of quarters ago? I think you guys mentioned, at some point that, multiples were still pretty high and people were maybe not as willing to sell. How has that changed in the last couple of months?\nEric Ashleman: Well, I mean, like the valuation remains certainly high and rich. And maybe because of that and some of the confidence that, we're seeing generally put those two things together I would say, the flow of properties for sale is better. And it continues to grow, kind of with the confidence in insurance, kind of same things that we're citing here. So, valuation was frankly high before. We think it's high now. We think it will stay at these elevated levels as we go forward. That's the challenge for us. But, we think we've got the -- certainly have the firepower to do the work both in terms of the teams the franchises we're thinking of building around and the demonstrated ability to execute and drive value in a company.\nFrancisco Amador: Great. Thank you very much.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management, for closing remarks.\nEric Ashleman: Okay. Well, hey, thanks for everybody joining. And I know there's always a lot of IDEX folks that join this call as well. So, I do want to -- once again I want to thank, everybody across IDEX for the really, really hard work and solid execution in 2020 and frankly a great start already to the year here. So thank you for your efforts there. I think, as you can see, I mean, we're pretty -- we're cautiously bullish. And we're leaning forward. We're generally optimistic about, where things are going here. No doubt, there's a lot of uncertainty that's still out there. But I think if we learned anything in 2020, it's how resilient everybody is. And how quickly we can kind of course correct and I think our company does that, better than many. So, we've got the people in place. We've got the teams. We've got focus. And I'm just really, really pleased to be here and leading the charge with Bill and others. So, thanks for your interest and time today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines, at this time. And have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Bill Grogan",
            "content": "Thanks, Eric. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on slide 11. Q4 orders of $679 million were up 10% overall and up 7% organically. Organic orders increased across each of our segments, with drivers highlighted by Eric in his previous comments. For the year orders were down 3% overall and down 4% organically, with strong organic order recovery in the fourth quarter, partially offsetting the 18% organic order decline we saw in the second quarter at the height of the pandemic. Fourth quarter sales of $615 million were up 2% overall, but down 1% organically. Our industrial and energy markets led the decline, but did have positive organic growth of around 60% of our reporting units led by strong performance in our ceilings MPT and dispensing businesses. Full year sales of $2.4 billion were down 6% overall and down 9% organically, driven by the impact of COVID, industrial market softness and challenges in oil and gas. Q4 gross margins contracted 20 basis points to 43.8%, driven by a decline in volume and unfavorable sales mix, partially offset by price capture. For the full year, gross margins contracted 140 basis points. Excluding the impact of the FMD inventory step-up, adjusted gross margins contracted 130 basis points to 43.9% driven by volume declines in sales mix, offset by our continued ability to capture price and drive operational productivity. Fourth quarter operating margin was 22.6%, up 50 basis points compared to prior year. Full year operating margin was 22.1%, down 110 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 23.4% for the fourth quarter, up 10 basis points compared to prior year and 22.8% for the year, down 140 basis points compared to 2019. I'll discuss the drivers of operating income on the following slide. Our Q4 effective tax rate was 22.2%, which was higher than the prior year ETR of 20.6%, due to the revaluation of foreign deferred income tax balances driven by changes in foreign tax rates. Fourth quarter adjusted net income was $105 million, resulting in an EPS of $1.37, up $0.04 or 3% over prior year adjusted EPS. Full year adjusted net income was $397 million, resulting in adjusted EPS of $5.19, down $0.61 or 11% compared to prior year. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $149 million, up 9% compared to prior year and was 142% of adjusted net income. For the year, free cash flow was $518 million, a record for IDEX, up 9% versus last year and 131% of adjusted net income driven by strong working capital performance. Moving on to slide 12. We're going to review our full year adjusted operating income. As Eric mentioned, we faced unprecedented challenges in 2020, but the structural and discretionary actions we took were critical to lessen the volume impact on our income and margins. Using a similar framework as we have for the previous two quarters, we wanted to walk through the components of our full year adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income declined $66 million for the year. With organic sales down around $247 million, we would have expected a negative impact in operating income of $148 million at roughly 60% contribution margin rate. The $148 million was offset by $58 million of executed operational actions, $23 million from the impact of restructuring actions combined with $35 million of discretionary cost control items and $10 million of price net productivity and negative business mix. Finally, we had $7 million of reduced variable compensation for the year. This yielded a better than expected flow-through of 34%. Again organic flow-through is based on taking reported sales and op income less the impact of FX and acquisitions, which was roughly $77 million on the top line and $7 million of profit. Overall, our team's focused on quickly managing the crisis at hand and effectively managing costs to mitigate revenue declines and has IDEX well positioned to leverage the recovery we expect in 2021. Moving on to guidance, I'm on slide 13. Based on current order rates and expected market recoveries, we see an accelerating 2021 and expect organic revenue for the year to be up 6% to 8%. This translates to an EPS impact of roughly $0.75 to $0.95 depending on our top line results. We expect our productivity initiatives to more than offset inflation providing $0.04 of benefits. The structural cost actions we have taken are expected to provide $0.12 of EPS benefit in the year. As we move past the pandemic we will aggressively invest in both organic and inorganic opportunities. As business recovers we will loosen discretionary cost controls as appropriate. As mentioned previously, we expect approximately two-thirds of the discretionary cost to return over time. Additionally, we will be making investments to enhance our ability to execute and integrate M&A opportunities as we view this as a critical time to enhance our capabilities, as well as continue to fund our targeted organic growth initiatives. These discretionary add-backs and strategic investments will provide approximately $0.19 to $0.26 of pressure in our 2021 guidance. Next we anticipate $0.08 to $0.11 headwind from variable compensation as we reset our incentive comp for the year. Finally FMD has 1/4 of inorganic results which we expect to provide $3 million of revenue, but provide $0.03 of EPS pressure. The structural actions we have made to improve FMD's profit profile based on the situation in the energy market will get FMD back to positive op profit in the second quarter. Now let's take a look at a couple of non-operational items. First we expect an $0.18 headwind from tax primarily related to discrete benefits we realized in 2020 associated with equity vesting and option exercising. Second, we expect a 2% tailwind from FX providing $0.13 of EPS benefit. So in summary we are projecting organic revenue growth of 6% to 8% for the year and EPS expectations are in the range of $5.65 to $5.95, a 9% to 15% increase over 2020. Moving to Slide 14. Let me provide some additional details regarding our 2021 guidance for both the first quarter and full year. In Q1 we are projecting EPS to range from $1.38 to $1.42 with organic revenue growth of 2% to 4% and operating margins of approximately 23.5%. The Q1 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. We expect a 3% top line benefit from the impact of FX and corporate costs in the first quarter are expected to be around $18 million. Turning to some additional details for the full year guidance. Again we're projecting full year EPS in the range of $5.65 to $5.95 with full year organic revenue to be up 6% to 8% with operating margins between 23.5% to 24.5%. We expect FX to provide a 2% benefit to top line results. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $55 million. And free cash flow is expected to be between 115% to 120% of net income. Corporate costs are expected to be approximately $70 million for the year. Finally our earnings guidance excludes any associated cost or earnings with future acquisitions or restructuring charges. Abel Pump is not included in these estimates and we will revise guidance once that deal is closed. With that I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts. Mike maybe I'll start off with the first part of your question relative to how we're thinking about pacing through the year in our guidance, I think, it's kind of consistent sequential improvement as we progress through the year. When you look at the 6% to 8% and where we are in the first quarter, there is kind of a gradual improvement that we need to achieve each quarter that's reasonable. When you think about the 6% to 8% between the segments, HST a little bit on the high end FMT and the middle and FSD on the lower side. So, generally balanced with small sequential improvements as we progress. And obviously, we have some targeted growth things that will phase out through the year that could inflect that plus or minus. But we're not looking for significant growth in any specific quarter as we progress through the year. I would say, it's more heavily OpEx related. Again to Eric's comments relative to the larger capital projects, I think the conversations around those are picking up. We haven't seen a significant increase in order book relative to those things falling through the unknown. Yeah, plus or minus. It's around there. For orders or sales? Yeah. No, I think I mentioned a little bit earlier. I think HST is probably on the higher end FMC is down the middle and FSD's on the low end. If you picked \u2013"

            "name": "Eric Ashleman",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. I'd like to start by thanking our people all around the world who have risen to the occasion during such a challenging year. It's been a year full of challenge and change, with the numerous safety protocols and disruptions in the marketplace. In that environment, our people continue to shine. So to all the IDEX team members listening in on this call, thank you. Because of the protocols we have in place, the disruptions in our operations have been limited. The COVID trends across Europe, North America and India have been troubling and we continue to follow those developments closely and remain steadfast in providing a safe place for our employees to work. We continue to deliver solutions for our customers during a challenging year, focusing on the critical innovation we need to support our long-term strategy, as well as producing new products to help the fight against the pandemic. Bill will walk through the details shortly. With customer focused strong execution and our ability to react quickly to unpredictable events, helped us deliver a relatively strong performance in 2020, a true testament to our resiliency. Liquidity was a primary focus of our management strategy as the pandemic hit and I'm happy to say that we were able to drive record free cash flow this year. As we address the challenges in front of us, we see a path to bullishness for 2021. We have seen a steady recovery in our end markets, which we will detail in a few slides. The diversity and quality of our businesses continues to serve us well, ensuring that we can weather any storm and quickly capitalize when market conditions improve. While the pandemic still presents many challenges to solve, we are starting to see a focus pivot back to core commercial endeavors, as we and our customers prepare for a world healed from the ravages of COVID-19. Our businesses remain focused on operating safely and we are prepared to leverage our supply chains and react to increased demands. A year like 2020 truly test the culture of a company. Are you rooted in strong values that people really live and believe? If so, you'll be better prepared to survive and even thrive. IDEX is that kind of company and it served us well in a year none of us could have ever predicted. I'm proud of the culture we have built at IDEX. It is admired by many, but we can strengthen it still. We leverage our culture and mission to bind together a uniquely decentralized and diverse company and our commitment to work even harder to support diversity equity and inclusion is tied directly to this important aspect of IDEX differentiation. Our resiliency, agility and fundamental ability to execute have IDEX exceptionally well positioned to play off as aggressively as we move forward. We are actively investing to support our best organic growth bets and we have ramped up our capital spending to support very exciting initiatives. The M&A markets are moving again and we are expanding our capabilities to execute on strategic acquisitions. In January, we announced an agreement to acquire ABEL Pumps and expect that deal to close in the first quarter. We actively seek to deploy additional capital to acquire IDEX-like businesses, as well as make some calculated bets in new technologies, to bolster our growth potential to further strengthen our portfolio and enhance our return to shareholders. Moving to slide seven. As I just mentioned, the strength of IDEX comes from the IDEX difference, a teachable methodology where great teams working together in a superior culture focused on the critical things that matter with a natural orientation towards the most important needs of their customers. Our culture is a significant focus and one of my key leadership priorities. To that end, we are making ongoing improvements based on feedback we received from our employees every day. Last month the IDEX Foundation, which was created to positively impact the communities in which we live and work, took a significant step forward as part of these efforts. IDEX committed $6 million to boost sponsored activities across the company. The foundation formerly added equity and opportunity as a lasting and fully funded part of its mission, creating opportunities for underserved disadvantaged people of color in our communities. This donation allows the foundation to more than double its annual giving. In addition to initiatives focused on equity and opportunity, we will continue the great work our people have been doing in our communities like building homes for the homeless, renovating community centers, and supporting schools and learning opportunities for young people. This month, we will host more than a dozen facilitative employee focus groups around the world. The feedback from our employees will help shape our path forward in diversity equity inclusion. Developing a formal framework and goals for our DE&I program is something we have all deployed at the senior leadership level making it a top priority. As part of that commitment, I intend to have a Senior DE&I leader in place reporting directly to me later this year. We will continue to grow and advance our culture as a key element of differentiation. You have my commitment on that. Turning now to our commercial results on slide eight. Broad rebound in order rates we discussed in the third quarter continued as our fourth quarter organic orders were up 7% compared to the prior year. We entered the quarter with optimism based on the strength of the third quarter improvement and that continued into the fourth quarter. Excluding timing on large OEM blanket orders year-over-year, our monthly order rates improved throughout the quarter. FMT organic orders for the fourth quarter were up 3%, driven by project orders in our water businesses continued strength in agriculture and recovery in industrial day rate businesses. HST organic orders were up 6% in the fourth quarter, driven by new product initiatives in life sciences and the recovery in auto and semicon continuing to boost our Sealing Solutions businesses. Finally, Fire & Safety/Diversified organic orders were up 15% in the quarter. Dispensing saw significant improvement as retailers began to release pent-up demand for equipment refreshes banded after a strong bounce back in the third quarter continued to improve based on auto market strength. And Fire & Safety saw growth in several product lines. A year ago, as we entered 2020, we talked about the general industrial slowdown that we were seeing and what a flat to down 2% to 5% world looked like for IDEX. We have proactively taken strategic actions to address these factors. We then faced the onset of the pandemic and we responded to it with purpose. As we close out 2020 and look forward, we are optimistic that our units and markets are quickly on a path to pre-COVID levels. The actions that we took in 2019 and 2020 have left us well positioned as we move into 2021. Turning to slide nine. We provide our current outlook for primary end markets. In our Fluid & Metering Technology segment, industrial day rates continue to tick up in the fourth quarter further solidifying the optimism that we discussed last quarter. We see this increase driven largely by OpEx needs of our customers. We continue to see large capital projects remain on hold. We anticipate that broader signs of economic stability and higher degrees of certainty on COVID recovery timing is required before capital projects begin to move again. But the investment discussions are happening. Our Water business has continued to show resiliency and we are closely monitoring the toll that 2020 will take on municipal budgets in 2021 and beyond. The strength in agriculture that we've called out for the previous two quarters has continued and we expect it to grow in 2021. Energy markets continue to remain challenged with markets still down compared to 2019 levels. Stabilization of these businesses is largely dependent on increases in fuel prices driving new capital investments in oil and gas. Turning to the Health and Science Technologies segment. As we discussed last quarter we have identified opportunities and applications to help fight COVID across each of our segments but particularly in HST. We were able to drive approximately $30 million of revenue in 2020 and expect to generate about the same amount in 2021 related to these initiatives. While some of this revenue is one-time in nature, we believe the technologies and applications we have developed here will generate recurring opportunities in 2022 and beyond. So, relative to our $25 million to $100 million of opportunities we highlighted, we'll achieve about $60 million. AI improved during the fourth quarter and looks to be on the rebound in 2021. In life sciences, we saw an offset by continued weakness in IVD/BIO as lab capacity is still largely focused on COVID response putting on hold other projects and initiatives. The strength in semicon that we mentioned last quarter has continued. In addition our ceilings business has benefited from a rebound in automotive. We see continued recovery in 2021 for the auto market, particularly driven by strength in European car sales in China and India. Food and pharma has also remained a bright spot as our businesses continue to benefit from growth in MPT projects and Microfluidics business. Moving to the Fire & Safety/Diversified segment, we saw continued improvement in most of our markets. The largest driver was the significant improvement in the dispensing market as large retailers increase demand for equipment refreshes, combined with order strength in the Asia dispensing markets. As mentioned previously, the pace of the auto recovery continues to exceed expectations springing on our BAND-IT business. Fire & Rescue businesses continued to see strong order performance and we believe that we are seeing a recovery in the OEM businesses driving through some of the delays in backlog concerns we referenced last quarter. As with all our municipal businesses, we continue to closely monitor the impact on budgets to see if there are any lagging effects from COVID response spending. As I highlighted in my previous remarks, we are optimistic about the market recovery we are seeing across most of our markets. And we need to be prepared for potential interruptions, particularly in the first half of 2021. Our teams have shown the ability to address these short-term shocks proactively. And the strategic actions we have taken across our businesses, has us well positioned to be able to ride the positive momentum, we're seeing as we exit the issue of the pandemic. With that, I'll turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results for the quarter and full year. Thanks Bill. Before questions, I would like to once again thank our employees and stakeholders for their contributions to what I consider exceptional execution in a challenging environment. We have proven the resilience of our businesses and clearly demonstrated the impact of the IDEX difference in our operating model. While we are not completely out of the woods this is a time for optimism. And I believe that our businesses are well positioned to focus on the critical priorities that will accelerate our growth on the other side of the pandemic. With that let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions. Yes. Well it's great to talk to you Allison. Thank you. So look I -- we talked a little bit here before about obviously we think that the technology cycle is compressed a lot. And no doubt it was already kind of flying in a dynamic way. So as we're thinking about that at IDEX, we're thinking about organic bets and development that we're going to do internally, but no doubt we're going to have to appropriate some of this from the outside world. And I think that -- you can think of that as a range of technologies. I mean for a lot of our component products it's probably going to come down to things like sensors and data readouts. From other businesses that we have it might be more analytical in nature. So it's going to take some of the inputs that we're able to provide in a severe duty space and come up to some determinant outcome and present that to our customers. So I think it would run the gamut from -- everything from embedded sensors and control elements up to frankly some software pieces that might be out there that would stick and sit very nice comfortably next to some pieces of our business. And I just think ultimately the call on that is going to be speed, speed and the ability to impact a solution in a way that we think will give us some differentiated edge. No doubt, when you're looking at assets especially on the inorganic side the economics can often work in different ways. And so we challenge our teams to think about value creation in a different way as well, in terms of how it might extend our solution bring us closer to customers lead to other open doors. So we're spending an awful lot of time on that as a team; Bill and I and the rest of the senior team and really putting our heads together and what that will look like for IDEX but we're excited about it. Yes. Well I think so. As you know I mean, especially I'll just take the FMD segment in general. There's a ton of support there on the day rate side and much of the improvement that we've seen in Q3 and Q4 and that's where it's coming from. The system is working. People are adding shifts. There's just more output. And we come along with that. And then there's an important component of project business that we would need to see to kind of take it to the next level. And I will say that you don't see a lot of that yet in the actual order numbers that we have as good as they are. But the discussions that support that the discussions around spec points and applications and problems that we can solve you can feel that building. And I think that's behind some of the optimism that we feel, coming ahead particularly as the virus the course of the virus becomes more understood. Thanks, Allison. Hi, Deane. Yes. Sure Deane. Look I think some of it we touched on in my opening comments. I mean I would actually start with the cultural aspects. I think one of the reasons we performed as well as we have we've been as nimble as we have I mean it really comes back to what we built here in terms of a culture and an organizational mentality that allows us to course correct and really focus on things without frankly a lot of control coming from Bill or I or the rest of the team. So in an environment that probably has even more of that, going to the next level there is hugely important. Then I think, partially thinking back a bit to the comments around Allison's question technology and how that's going to layer across the solution sets that we have at IDEX, recognizing we've got a lot of different states of evolution depending on the companies, that's a place where I'm spending an awful lot of time to make sure that we're thoughtful and not in some ways kind of overdoing it with a center-led answer because that's not really the appropriate response. And then I would end with certainly capital allocation and a lot of focus on how we can frankly put some more of it to work. The environment's tough but we're doing some things around focused resources, focused pieces of the company and a lot of just very iterative thinking as a team of how we can tackle that and frankly capitalize on the engine that we really built over the last two years. I mean I think we're uniquely positioned here even in a difficult environment to bring that to bear. Yes. I mean, no doubt that's definitely an area that we're watching with a lot of focus. As you know, I mean those markets tend to lag an awful lot. And so something bad happens in the world and it takes a while for it to read through. And then of course, if you think of kind of our exposure layered on top of it, particularly the two areas that you mentioned, we're doing very important work that that many times is buffered against some of it. So on the water side we're heavily tilted towards the analytical side, analytical services and support. And so even if a system has to make do with infrastructure might have to delay some kind of \u2013 lay out a heavy infrastructure, they often turn to our kind of work to make sure that they're leveraging the system that they do have. Frankly, also on the water side, I mean if we go into an era, where the environmental compliance has stepped up a bit, that's another dynamic that helps us there. So that's against that sort of other trend that we are watching around budget support and budget assurance. So the two things are kind of working there together but we see that same resiliency. Fire & Rescue, again this is one of the most global stories that we have. And so no doubt in the more mature spaces CapEx purchases, considering where the source of that funding is going to come from is always something that we're thinking about and tracking. But we are \u2013 we course, correct a bit here. And so it's a different story in some of the emerging markets where we've got great presence and frankly a lot of technology and people on the ground. So I think that global breadth helps us on that side as well. But no doubt we're watching the same dynamics that you all are. As we go forward, we're looking to see if there's backstopping and support or not all over the world and -- but we think we're well positioned. Thanks, Deane. Hi, Mike. Yes. Mike I just would continue to point to, I mean, in many ways what we're calling internal is sort of predictable uncertainty. There's a lot of stuff going on no doubt, but it's at least found a level where one of the things we've noticed all around the world is certainly -- we're going to keep the machines on keep the factories running, keep the borders open, keep product moving. It might be difficult at times, but that assurance is there. And certainly with some good signs in terms of virus mitigation that provides another piece of assurance. And then I think most people recognize, there's a lot of pent-up energy more broadly that if things continue to go this way, it would be released at some point. And again IDEX has such broad exposure. We think we'd participate in that. Yes sure. On -- with no doubt the supply chain is tricky to maneuver. I mean, we're seeing that as well as everybody else. I mean, the ports are clogged up and they've got some staffing issues in both of the coasts. And the containers are in the wrong places all of that stuff. And just frankly, there's not enough aircraft in the sky. So we're not immune to that. However, as you know, we are very localized generally in terms of our supply our production and our sell-through into markets. It's a very localized model. And so I think relative to a lot of people we probably don't experience it at the same levels  Our teams now for quite a while frankly even going back to the times where we were talking a lot more about tariffs and things like that have been thinking about where we have key sources of supply how we can make that frankly more flexible. And to this day every Tuesday we kind of go around the horn and talk both about kind of how we're holding up in terms of the virus how we're navigating supply chains. And fortunately we've been able to react and navigate around that and that's the go-forward assumption for us. Thanks Mike. Yes. So relatively the order pattern through the quarter we mentioned it a little bit in the prepared remarks our day rate businesses continue to progress as we march through the fourth quarter. We had some timing of OEM blanket that made the absolute month numbers a little bit choppy. But for the things that we look as indicator the sequential improvement was there and that's continued on to January with another positive month of broad-based order improvement across all of our businesses. On the geographic side, I think it was a really strong performance in Asia in Europe. And North America lagged a little bit only because of hey that's where most of our core industrial and energy exposure is. It was the only area that was the lowest out of the 3 but again still sequentially improving. Yes. It's obviously a strong order quarter for dispensing. I would say it's going to pace out through the first three quarters of the year for the most part maybe a little bit more heavily weighted towards the first two quarters, because we did receive some orders for the full year from several customers. Thank you, Scott. Well, I mean, as you know, Scott, I mean, FMT is such a broad collection catch-all of a wide variety of industrial markets. But it \u2013 honestly it runs the gamut. So food production is in there. Anything related to \u2013 starting to work on infrastructure and build-out of highways and buildings and things we're going to participate there as well. So the chemical sector kind of coming back to life. We've got a significant presence there. I mean, it really is that sort of broad-based support coming from the industrial sector largely in kind of our mature geographic markets that just day rates that's kind of in the first chapter of it. I think the projects that we talked about earlier are starting to come on starting to get funded. You put those two things together that's sort of what the picture would look like in it. We see it as a pretty steady march. I mean, it's not like a hockey stick out there. We just think the line sort of continues as the world heals. Thanks, Scott. Well, I mean, look I think the analytical instrumentation story for us it's a pretty mature business. It was \u2013 obviously it faced some headwinds last year like a lot of life sciences did related to sort of up and down the street medical things and analytical services. We did see a nice bounce back there in the fourth quarter for AI. I think it kind of returns to its sort of historical rates as we go forward. The IVD/BIO side, which is also pretty mature that's the one that's still got the most pressure on it. It's much more dependent on people going and visiting labs and then has a consumable stream that tends to be out ahead of capital purchases and that's kind of where we come in. So consider that a bit of an offset to the AI story. And then pretty quickly, we get into the more dynamic pieces of this related to the works that we do in genomics. And obviously, the rapid test is the most dynamic of them all. So we put all that together. I think we tried to lay that out here. But I would say in general look this is a robust sector. It's obviously doing work that the world needs right now. We think we're well positioned in all of it. And the single biggest catalyst for us still remains that that work we're doing around the testing program. Well, look as I said in the \u2013 both in the comments at the beginning and some of the questions here, I mean, we've got a lot of work going on in frankly all three segments. So I wouldn't say, that one is tilted more than the other. I mean we've got good opportunities in all three. We've got teams associated in and positioned in places where we're focused in all three. So, I'd hesitate to color it, as landed one way or another. Yeah. Well, I mean, no doubt, we've seen the same headlines. I mean, this is still a relatively small piece of IDEX. I mean, we have exposure there in a couple of businesses and none of which is related to the electronics side. So, look, I think what we've seen so far the momentum is the recovery of an industry that was largely kind of shutdown for decent parts of the year. And then, frankly, most of our growth there is through growth of platforms. The technologies where we're actually focused, our team has done just a great job of being able to introduce that to more and more people, more and more players in the market. And then, secure those wings. And then -- wins and we would see them run out over several years. So, we haven't seen a big interruption. But again, we're not in that sort of same area the part spends. And we've got really good exposure to the platform wins in a couple of businesses. Well, I mean, like the valuation remains certainly high and rich. And maybe because of that and some of the confidence that, we're seeing generally put those two things together I would say, the flow of properties for sale is better. And it continues to grow, kind of with the confidence in insurance, kind of same things that we're citing here. So, valuation was frankly high before. We think it's high now. We think it will stay at these elevated levels as we go forward. That's the challenge for us. But, we think we've got the -- certainly have the firepower to do the work both in terms of the teams the franchises we're thinking of building around and the demonstrated ability to execute and drive value in a company. Thank you. Okay. Well, hey, thanks for everybody joining. And I know there's always a lot of IDEX folks that join this call as well. So, I do want to -- once again I want to thank, everybody across IDEX for the really, really hard work and solid execution in 2020 and frankly a great start already to the year here. So thank you for your efforts there. I think, as you can see, I mean, we're pretty -- we're cautiously bullish. And we're leaning forward. We're generally optimistic about, where things are going here. No doubt, there's a lot of uncertainty that's still out there. But I think if we learned anything in 2020, it's how resilient everybody is. And how quickly we can kind of course correct and I think our company does that, better than many. So, we've got the people in place. We've got the teams. We've got focus. And I'm just really, really pleased to be here and leading the charge with Bill and others. So, thanks for your interest and time today."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the IDEX Corporation's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to your host, Mike Yates. Thank you. You may begin.\nMike Yates: Great. Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Let me start by saying thank you for joining our discussion of the IDEX third quarter 2020 financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our Company's financial and operating performance for the three months ending September 30, 2020. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today's webcast can be accessed on our Company's website at www.idexcorp.com. Joining me today is Andy Silvernail and Bill Grogan, additionally, Eric Ashleman, our President and recently announced CEO of IDEX, will be joining us as well.\nAndy Silvernail: Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone. Before we dive into our third quarter results, I'd like to take a moment and talk about the leadership transition we announced yesterday. After 12 wonderful years at IDEX and nearly a decade as Chief Executive Officer, I'm stepping down as Chairman and CEO in mid-December. I'm delighted that the Board of Directors has selected our President and COO, Eric Ashleman as IDEX's new CEO, effective December 15, 2020. Eric is a uniquely capable leader, who has a clear choice for the role. He and I have worked closely together since I joined IDEX. We work side-by-side to establish our strategy, build our culture and deliver value for all of our stakeholders. Eric brings extensive knowledge of our business, deep insights into our markets and a passion for bringing up the best of our people. My decision comes after deep reflection. Leaving IDEX has been the greatest prier to my career. It's a significantly different Company today than when I joined in 2009. We've accelerated our transformation from an acquisition-based holding Company, into a high-performing global enterprise that improves lives on a daily basis. With this strong foundation, IDEX is positioned for continued growth and value creation. So it's a good time for change for two reasons. First, IDEX is ready. We've let a remarkable Company through this pandemic crisis, our mission has never mattered more, our culture and financial position has never been stronger and our team has never been more capable. To that end, we're fortunate to have Eric, as the next IDEX CEO. He's a proven leader who has delivered excellence for our shareholders and our broad stakeholders for the past 13 years. Second, I'm ready. For the last couple of years, many of you have asked me about my career thoughts. I've always said that I love IDEX, but I thought 10 years is about the right shelf life for a public company CEO. I could never have dreamed what we were accomplished over the span. We've built an organization that advances and save lives of millions of people around the globe. We have created a highly engaged organization that is among the best in the world. We've impacted our communities through compassion and generosity with the support of the IDEX foundation. And we have delivered for our owners, producing total shareholder return of greater than 530%. For me personally, I'm excited for a new phase of life that brings along new challenges and opportunities for me and my family. I'm going to become Chairman, CEO, and an owner of Madison Industries, one of the world's largest private companies. This new opportunity offers a chance to build another great organization and make positive change in the world over a very long horizon. I am confident now is the right time to pass the torch and welcome IDEX's next generation of leadership. On a personal note, Eric has been a true partner and a dear friend to me. And, I'm confident that this transition to CEO will be seamless for our Company, employees and all of our stakeholders. As this is my last earnings call, I want to say how grateful I am to have worked alongside our incredibly talented team, the last 12 years. It has been an honor to serve as Chairman and CEO, and to be part of a Company like IDEX. I also want to thank all of our investors and analysts on the phone, who are with us today for the support through the years. The future of IDEX is very bright. We have reached new levels of industry leadership and sustained value creation and we will do so again under, Eric as our CEO. As Mike, mentioned, Eric is joining Bill and I for the earnings call. Bill and I will walk through our assessment and analysis and view of the future as we normally do. We'll then turn to Q&A and Eric will join the conversation and talk about the future. I'll now turn to our results for the third quarter. We continue to see a strong sequential rebound in orders, with September 2020, topping the same month last year. That's a good sign. I want to thank all of our people around the globe, who've risen to the occasion. And a year no one could have predicted, our people continued to shine. So to all of the IDEX team members listening on this call, thank you. A time like this truly tests the culture of the Company. Are you rooted in strong values that people really live and believe? If so, you will be better prepared to survive and even thrive. IDEX is this kind of company and it's serving us well. Because of the protocols we've put in place, the disruptions we've seen in our operations have been limited. We have protected our people within the workplace and we will do so even if the COVID trends are moving in the wrong way. We continue to focus on solving our customers' greatest challenges, many of which have shifted this year. That has reinforced the need to stay close to our customers even when we have to remain socially distanced to understand their needs. Bill will walk through the details shortly, but as you've seen, our organic sales are down 12% year-over-year falling at the better end of our predicted range. Importantly, organic orders were down only 5% and continued to improve sequentially, a trend that is continuing in October. Been a diversified company helps a great deal in times like these, while certain sectors like energy continue to struggle, other aspects of the economy are booming. This diversity gives us strength, limiting our exposure to any one sector. The financial controls we put in place early continue to serve us well. We are delivering strong profitability and exceptional cash flow as we have pivot to growth, we have ramped up our capital spending and investment to support some really exciting initiatives. We've also seen activity in the M&A market start to pick up. While those pillars of safety, business continuity and liquidity, are also part of our pandemic operating focus, it is time to aggressively play offense. I'm turning to Slide 7. That increased focus on playing offense has us involved in some exciting new opportunities. A variety of our businesses are producing new solutions for cleaning and disinfecting public spaces. One shine example is a sprayer, that uses electrostatically charged particles to envelope a surface, not just hit the side base in sprayer. We anticipate solutions like this will continue to be in demand, not just during this pandemic but for years to come as public demand for cleaning and disinfection will be forever changed by this period of time. We also have an exciting new opportunity to partner with customers to develop a highly accurate point of care solution for diagnostic testing for COVID-19. Our IDEX Health & Science team is hard at work ramping up. With public health experts increasingly predicting that the coronavirus will be like influenza, remain in circulation even after vaccines are widely available, we anticipate this will be a significant new program for our Company for the foreseeable future. I'll share more about that in a moment. We also continue to see machines used in production of pharmaceuticals and vaccines. Insourcing critical API manufacturing is a key initiative for several countries, and last quarter, we shared our microfluidizer processors are key technology for manufacturing vaccine adjuvants. Vaccine adjuvants are immune stimulators added to many vaccines commonly used today. By using the adjuvant in a vaccine, the body can often produce a better immune response to the antigen, while also allowing vaccine manufacturers to be able to produce more doses of vaccine with less antigen. Our team was excited to recently deliver machines for use in producing advanced supplies of one of the leading vaccines in testing today. We are also working actively with other vaccine manufacturers as the world prepares for an unprecedented race for production and distribution of this critical piece of the puzzle for solving the COVID-19 crisis. I'm moving to Slide 8. In Health & Science, our products are being used to help and enable rapid highly accurate testing of COVID-19. Our things microfluidic cartridges are a key technology used to diagnose COVID-19 infection in the point of care molecular market, which allows testing to be done near the patient versus being sent to a laboratory. Our technology-enabled demilitarization of complex laboratory workflows, by integrating pumps, valves, sample, reagent management and signal detection, in order to provide a simple workflow for the operator of the instrument. This instrument operator only needs to add the patient sample to the cartridge, insert it in the instrument and then push a button to run the test. Our microfluidics capabilities allow for high volume production and consistent repeatable results that are needed to combat COVID-19. In addition, H&S has optical filters and several diagnostic instruments that are used for COVID-19 testing. We provide various footer components designed in, in vitro diagnostic instruments used for COVID-19. We have the gassers, pumps, manifolds and fluidic connections in these IVD instruments that typically analyze blood samples. We also have both optics and fluidics assemblies and next-generation DNA sequencers being used to analyze COVID-19 to better understand the virus and track it spread. I'm proud of how our businesses have answered the call over the past two quarters and work closely with our customers to innovate and deliver critical solutions to the marketplace. Alright, I'm moving to Slide 9. We provide an update on the state of our primary end markets. We saw sequential improvement in most of our end markets with some of our more challenged markets including auto and dispensing recovering faster than we anticipated. In fluid metering, the broader industrial softness and the volatility in oil and gas has continued though we did see a pickup in daily order rates in the month of September, which provides optimism as we close out the year and we head into 2021. Significant capital investment by our customers continues to be on hold and in a broader market recovery and reduction in global economic uncertainty. Our water business has continued to show resiliency impacted only by timing delays in some municipal projects. As we called out last quarter, agriculture has performed well, it's growing optimism and investment held up in the quarter. In Health & Science, semicon has continued to outpace our expectations and was strong sequentially and year-over-year. Our sealing business recovered nicely in the quarter through the resumption of activity in the auto market. Additionally, the product innovations, I discussed earlier helped generate positive momentum for us in multiple end markets including industrial. On the other side, analytical instrumentation and some aspects of VD/BIO, we continue to see that as medical industry is focused on COVID-19, other investments in lab equipment were delayed and we've not yet seen the activity materially pickup. Moving to Fire & Safety and Diversified. We saw sequential improvement in most of our markets. Recovery in auto and retail are big stories driving a rebound in our BAND-IT and Dispensing businesses. Fire rescue continued to see strong performance, but we have been impacted by production delays at OEMs pushing projects out and extending lead times for municipal deliveries. Backlog in these businesses continue to be strong and we're working closely with our customers to monitor delivery schedules and assess the impact of COVID-19 on future year municipal budgets. Previously funded projects continue to go and demand for our new products in these businesses has been strong. We are overall optimistic about the market recovery we've seen in the third quarter and continue to believe that the diversified nature of our businesses has helped mitigate the impact of the global economic decline. Our dedication to our customers and ability to respond and innovate quickly has continued to generate momentum for us to combat market declines. As we head into the fourth quarter, we expect to see a pickup in order rates, particularly in our day rate businesses, as an indicator of further recovery. Okay. I'm moving to Slide 10. I want to provide some additional context to the organic order trends we've seen over the past two quarters. We saw a broad rebound in order rates in the third quarter, recovering from organic declines and as much as 23% in the second quarter. To organic growth in the month of September, all of our segments participated in this trend. FMT organic orders improved each month, driven by strength to agriculture and stabilization and industrial, as well as a slight pickup in energy. HST was driven by a recovery in the auto market and targeted new product initiatives, as well as the positive momentum in semicon and pharma that I mentioned earlier. Finally, Diversified's organic orders saw dramatic improvements at BAND-IT and Dispensing, as auto and aerospace businesses open back up and capital spending returned in the paint markets. On top of the year-over-year improvements, we also experienced sequential increases with FMT up 12% HST, up 6% and FSD up 11% versus the second quarter. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results for the quarter.\nBill Grogan: Thanks Andy. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 12. Q3 orders of $570 million were down 3% overall and 5% organically. As Andy just mentioned, we saw a broad bounce back in order rates across our businesses and monthly sequential improvement in organic order rates throughout the quarter. Third quarter sales of $581 million were down 7% overall and down 12% organically. Industrial energy markets remain challenged in the quarter and one of the main contributors of the organic declines. As mentioned before, we saw recovery in the auto and dispensing markets as well as continued strength in semi and pharma to help to offset those headwinds, coupled with the benefit of new applications and innovations we have made in response to COVID-19. We're able to drive organic sales to the top end of our previous estimates. Q3 adjusted gross margin declined 190 basis points to 43.3%, primarily driven by lower volume, the dilutive impact of acquisitions and business mix, partially offset by price and the continued impact of cost control actions we have taken. Gross margin was up 70 basis points sequentially versus the second quarter. Third quarter adjusted operating margin was 23.1%, down 210 basis points from the prior year mainly driven by lower volume leverage and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by the restructuring actions and discretionary cost controls. We also saw sequential improvement in op margin increasing 200 basis points from Q2. Our Q3 effective tax rate was 14.4%, which was lower than the 18.6% in the prior year due to discrete benefits associated with the recent changes to the global intangible low tax income regulations. This was a multi-year true-up going back to the start of tax reform and we only have a minor benefit on a rate going forward. Third quarter adjusted net income was $106 million resulting in an adjusted EPS of $1.40 down $0.12 or 8% compared to prior-year EPS. When compared to our second quarter year-to-date tax rate, the reduced ETR increased adjusted EPS by approximately $0.11 in the quarter. Finally, free cash flow was $135 million for the quarter, down 7% compared to the prior year and was 128% of net income, a conversion rate higher than last year. The strong performance was a result of a significant focus and discipline on working capital management. The teams continue to drive our DSO lower and improve our past due rate as well as increase our inventory turns. We continue to demonstrate our ability to drive cash flow conversion in excess of net income. Moving on to Slide 13. As we discussed in our previous earnings call, we continue to take the necessary steps to manage cost and mitigate the significant impact of reduced volume. Our adjusted operating income declined $23 million in the quarter, with organic sales down $75 million, we would have expected a negative impact on operating income of approximately $45 million at roughly 60% contribution margin. This $45 million was offset by $25 million of executed operational initiatives, $7 million from the impact of restructuring actions taken in Q4 of last year and the second quarter of this year, $13 million of discretionary cost control items and $5 million of price and net productivity that was partially offset by $6 million of negative product and business mix primarily associated with FMT. The $13 million of discretionary cost actions in the quarter was lower compared to the $15 million we referenced last quarter, primarily due to modest increases in spend to support and service our customers, as well as some targeted investments we made in growth initiatives. Overall, our teams continue to do an exceptional job of managing costs to mitigate revenue declines. As Andy discussed earlier, we have ensured that we are well-positioned to pivot to offense and continue to invest in initiatives to generate growth in the fourth quarter and beyond. With that, I'd like to turn it back over to Andy, to summarize our Q4 expectations and provide some final thoughts.\nAndy Silvernail: Thank you, Bill. I'm on Slide 14 everyone. As I mentioned earlier, we are firmly what I call Phase 3, of the pandemic response, living with the virus. I'm proud of how our teams have adapted and innovated in this environment, our teams have embraced our mission and our values and have been diligent executing our COVID-19 playbook. We maintain optimism to the market recovery we've experienced will continue and we've seen the benefit of the proactive steps we took at the end of last year and throughout the early phases of pandemic, positioning IDEX to remain strong, while taking advantage of new opportunities. We expect revenue in the fourth quarter will be down between 3% and 5% organically based on our current backlog position and expected daily order rates. We are in close contact with our customer base and we continue to look for signs of confidence and capital spending, that will be the catalyst for sustained recovery. We continue to make strategic investments in our business, just for further long-term growth, we remain disciplined in our efforts to manage costs. To conclude, this quarter was a great display of the strength of the IDEX business model. From the resiliency of our base business to our ability to respond to challenges quickly and deliver innovative solutions to our customers. I continue to remain optimistic about our prospects to come and think about coming out of this crisis even stronger than when we entered it with new opportunities for growth on the horizon. With that let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: First question would be for Eric, and look no one should be surprised that you were picked to take the helm based upon your role as COO for a number of years and most recently as President. So you've had the opportunity to be part of the leadership team for a number of years, but you've also had the opportunity to make your own assessment about the opportunities at IDEX. So I'd be really interested in hearing just at the outset? What kinds of changes might you be considering or just at least the areas of focus that you think you would be taking initially? And I'd be remiss if I didn't ask about your commitment to the 80-20 business system? Thank you.\nEric Ashleman: Sure, sure thank you, Deane. It's great to talk with you and great to talk with everybody here. I'm excited to get going. Look I think as we think about focus and priorities, I want to make sure that we all appreciate that this is a story of continuity alongside purposeful evolution. So I have worked for Andy for 12 years, every day he has been part of IDEX. I guess since I'm reported to him.\nAndy Silvernail: Yes.\nEric Ashleman: And for the last five years, I've served as the COO of the company. And so side-by-side, I mean we have been - partners in all the major decisions that we've made along the way that have evolved the company to where we are today and that certainly includes 80-20. I mean that is at the cornerstone of what we call the IDEX difference. And so, maybe less appreciated is the evolution - the organizational evolution that's happened alongside all of that. So in these five years, I mean, we've been very, very deliberate to work on developing other voices that are now part of the senior team and have been. Frankly, our group executives joined our senior team over a year ago. I look down the table here at Bill. Bill was my original operating partner in finance. So this is a team effort, it has been a team effort. And so, the strategy that's in my head is the same one that we've been working on all these years. Now that being said look that the world is definitely in a dynamic spot now. There is a pandemic in front of us. There is things like digitalization that are happening all over the place. And we've got a thing or things like aggressive capital deployment and how we're going to work all of that in this environment. So those priorities were here before this day, they remain very firmly in front of me as we go forward. And I absolutely - I'm an advocate of 80-20. It's a way of thinking as much as it's a part of the operating model.\nDeane Dray: That's great to hear. And just second question would be more along the lines of the issues at hand. And I'm especially interested in getting some more color around these COVID business products and service opportunities. I know you've sized it at $25 million to $100 million, and maybe you can give us some additional color about the potential time to revenue and will this all be organic in terms of the investment, might there be any JVs acquisitions along the way, but if you can start with time to revenue? Thanks.\nEric Ashleman: Yes, sure, sure. So look, there is multiple phases. I mean this is no doubt a dynamic world. I mean this - most of these applications didn't exist in our minds sooner than March of this year. So we have some elements and components that are - that they're moving now. They're part of the fight today. They are embedded in our sales numbers that you're looking at. I would say that the bulk of the opportunities and some of the things that we talked about here today. They're a little further out, they are compressed development cycles. They are very, very active now. And we would see a lot of them starting to get some initial market traction in early 2021, but some very, very important milestones along the way that we're working with different partners and customers to bring those to bear. They are organic in nature now, certainly as things continue to develop and evolve that inorganic opportunities to make them bigger and more impactful would be something we would absolutely consider.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Halloran with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Halloran: Eric, congratulations very well deserved. Andy, it's been a good decade. I'll miss working with you. It's been a pleasure.\nAndy Silvernail: Thank you, Mike.\nMike Halloran: You're going to do awesome at Madison obviously, but we'll miss you here. Eric will be a great replacement, but we'll definitely miss you.\nAndy Silvernail: Thanks.\nMike Halloran: So thanks for everything, over the years. So with that first question, I know - the partial answer to this, but just want to confirm, with Eric you're taking over. I'm guessing the willingness desire and ability to push forward on the M&A strategy doesn't really change. So just confirm that and given the thoughts on how you're thinking about the funnel as we sit here today actionability and ability to convert?\nEric Ashleman: Yes well, absolutely. The focus remains very, very high on that front. I mean ultimately IDEX was built that way through acquisition. So, I think as the pandemic unfolded obviously, things froze up in the early days. We've seen things free up now. The process as you might imagine is quite different. I mean we're - none of us are in airplanes. We're doing a lot of it remotely and virtually, but we've adopted just as we've adapted our businesses in that way. And I think as we look forward, this is an area of huge focus for our team, the group executive is one of the big reasons we brought them onto our senior team and so, frankly we could get more hands on the opportunity itself. And so, we're looking aggressively. I think, we're looking for properties that are - they've got to be good IDEX businesses, that's something that we're always going to keep firmly in our sites that you could imagine in times like this that. This is a complex operating environment and businesses that might not be able to handle it quite, as well, but are very, very differentiated would be something that we think we could bring a lot of value to. And so, we're considering that as an extension of sort of our normal course and the normal filters that we use as we think about businesses we'd like to own. But I can assure you it absolutely remains a fundamental piece of the day and a priority for us.\nMike Halloran: And secondarily, good to see the sequential trends continuing to October here, maybe some initial thoughts on next year and how you're handicapping things internally. Obviously one of IDEX's mantras is to be able to adjust and adapt to whatever the environment looks like, but how are you thinking about linearity trends in the next year and any kind of thoughts along those lines at this point?\nAndy Silvernail: Yes Mike, maybe I'll just touch on it first and then let Eric go deeper on it. So really no real difference from how we thought about it last quarter. If you look at the sequential improvement that we've seen go back from second quarter - first quarter, third quarter - second quarter, third quarter and that's sequential gain and we're now in that 3% to 5% down. The last really tough comp will be Q1 of next year. And I think we'll know a lot more going into that quarter, but I will say going into the fourth quarter. We always look at the backlog load and that gives us a confidence level and we are at the higher end of our normal backlog load going into the quarter. That's a really good sign it gives a lot of work around that 3% to 5% organic. First quarter will be a tough comp and then, but if you keep thinking about the sequentials. And you think about that acceleration that puts us in a good spot for the entire year as you think about it. I know Eric, you put a lot of thought into this as we are prepping for our budgets and going through a strat plan.\nEric Ashleman: Yes, yes. And absolutely, Mike you know as well. I mean, we stay agile and reactive along the way that always serves us well. So as we think about the variability that's still in front of us at least in the next quarter or two till we get a handle on where the pandemic is going to go. I mean we've set up an operating cadence that allows us to course-correct and adjusts really, really well. And so, I mean a good example of that you can see in our opening comments. I mean we've got - we've taken the structural actions where we need to really fast. In fact, we took some of them even before the pandemic first showed up in the early spring. And at the same time, we've been able to rally and pivot resources around the opportunities that we outlined as we talked about fighting the pandemic. That's the way we do business and it works equally well for things on the downside because of more variability or opportunities that are accelerated and in front of us even sooner. And so that's how we're going to run the company and follow that course.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Poliniak: Congrats Eric, and echo everybody's comments Andy it's hard to see you go, but best of luck there.\nAndy Silvernail: Thank you.\nAllison Poliniak: Just kind of reflecting back over your tenure, Andy, as you had this vision for IDEX when you first took the helm, how far off has it been veered off of that vision, obviously very successful still. And then also what surprised you over the years most with the enterprise as you went through that tenure?\nAndy Silvernail: Yes, I guess, Allison you're asking that question a good time, you can imagine I'm pretty reflective right now about everything we've done together. I think that the early kernels, I'll remember back and the folks from IDEX who are listening to this call, they'll remember. We had - our global leadership meeting in March of 2012. And when you look at what Eric, just referred to is what we internally call the IDEX difference which is around great teams 80-20, and obsessive focus on the customer. We started laying those kernels out then. And from there, they grew and what you found was that is that kernel grew and you dug in deeper. You saw that the levers that really matter are actually very few. When you get right down to it, the levers that matter are very few. And Eric and I have had about 10,000 conversations over the years in offices, in airplanes, in conference rooms at each other's houses, talking about how to make that real and talking about how do you get these big concepts that sound like frankly stupid corporate speak down to the people, who actually do the work. And that's where we've dug in really deep. And so, the levers that matter, the first thing is, do you have a mission that people care about, right, did the people actually care about the work that they're doing and how they're impacting the world. And when you get a compelling mission, it aligns everybody really quickly. Second is, do you have good businesses or bad businesses. I've been in good businesses and I've been bad businesses and Eric I know, I've been in some pretty bad ones too. And those are - those are instructive, right, because bad businesses you spend a lot of time on problems that you can absolutely frankly never fix. And so position yourself into good businesses and that means acquisition and it also means that approach to 80-20 all along because within any business, there are - there is a great business and there is bad business and you got to work through that on a constant basis. And you got to move resources, right. You got to move resources to the things that matter most, where profits really exist, where you have a differentiated position. The last - the next one is great teams. One of the interesting things about IDEX, we have 45 businesses, we have 45 corner offices, and we've seen time and again when you put a great leader in, it is like a light switch. It's not slow, it's fast, how - what they do with the business, and if you combine that great leader and leadership team with a great business, there is a magic that happens there that is just incredible. And then I'd say the last thing is process discipline. And if you think about this as an exponential equation, right, and you bring process discipline to bear for us that happens to be the elements of the IDEX difference, that really is the formula or the equation that Eric and I and the team have been putting together for years and years and years. Yes, Allison, in terms of some of the learnings, they all go into those buckets. If I could go back in time and pull and change a couple of things. Look, there have been times when I moved to slow with leaders who weren't getting it done and I've learned that you can't do that, right. People either buy-in or they don't. It's very hard to convince somebody that they should do something that they are opposed to out of the gates. And so you got to get people who are excited and you got to ride those horses. Asset choices, look, I really do believe that in this next phase of life and Eric is incredibly well-positioned to do this. Acquisitions are going to matter a lot and we've made some really good asset choices, we made a couple of bad ones. And again, kind of like choosing good and bad. When you choose bad, it hurts, and when you choose. Good. It's amazing what they do. And I'll just - I'll reference, one the first business we bought - that I bought is part of IDEX was PPE and that was in 2010, I wasn't CEO yet and it's a little business in England and what you saw there was for all the elements of what makes IDEX special, and we've gone from that little business in England to $300 million platform, that is just an incredible part of our business. That's the model that I think we need to follow here going forward. And so, Allison, I appreciate the question, it definitely is a reflective time.\nAllison Poliniak: Great, thanks for the perspective. And just turning to the comment around sort of living with the virus makes sense, is that reflected in sort of your current order trends that you're seeing from customers, we're just seeing Germany going back into a lockdown here, just trying to - I guess better understand how you're thinking about that potential volatility here with the resurgence happening at this point?\nEric Ashleman: Well, I'll take that one, Allison. So look I think ever since the pandemic started here. I mean, we've seen that volatility enter our order book and we're always going to have two ways that we delineated, we've got kind of that every day replenishment cycle that happens in a lot of our component businesses. And then honestly, as long as the system is on states pretty constant. And so, irrespective of border closings and other things, it generally has held up pretty well, what tends to move on us is, are a little bit more project-intensive businesses, larger unit of - units of measure and they're very much affected by the view of the world around us. So I think as we see this, no doubt. I think this next wave will be different than the one we saw in March, because everybody kind of recognizes the economic consequence of that and everybody has done a better job of tooling the organizations up to be able to live with it and coexist with it. So we're expecting more volatility as the cases go up, but I don't see that it should knock us off the trend path that we're on, as we just continue to live with it. And that goes for IDEX that goes for any other business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Summerville: Yes, I echo everyone's comment and congrats to everyone. So a question on the COVID-19 opportunities you've identified, the 25 to 100. I assume that's kind of an ongoing run rate you're looking for I guess organically what sort of spend that is associated with going out to get that revenue and what sort of defines the high and low-end of that range?\nAndy Silvernail: So maybe I'll take a first shot at that. I would say, we've made some initial investments in the quarter from an investment perspective as we worked with our customers to get some of these things and get some traction on early development. Obviously, we've invested in some capital to support some initiatives relative to tooling, some of these opportunities relative that range could be sizable. Obviously, we've got multiple partners with each of the applications, all the volatility we've talked about, who is ultimately going to end up winning is one factor, and then two, the commercial viability of whoever wins in the marketplace will also be another variable. So that's why it's a wide range for now, obviously, Eric highlighted, we were spending a ton of time on these initiatives across several different businesses. And I think we want more visibility coming out of the year and early first quarter, and be able to size that up a little bit better for you when we talk about 2021.\nMatt Summerville: And then maybe just another just quick question on M&A, would you say in the last 90 days or so. The actionability in the pipeline - the actionability in the funnel is actually getting better and what are you seeing from a multiple standpoint?\nAndy Silvernail: That was certainly the actionability I think is quite a bit better. I think everybody has found a way to actually do the work in a remote way. In many ways, everybody else is kind of get their head around the fact that this is going to be with us for a while and yet things are going to continue and businesses going to go on, all of that helps. And then of course, there is things - it seems like, there is ample liquidity as well, for certainly for us and for others. So the actionability is high, the process is slightly different. I would say on the valuation. There is not a lot of change. It's high. It's high and I think it's a long-term view and certainly for the businesses that we're going to be attracted to, they have tremendous long-term potential. And so those out years if anything we're looking at, we're anticipating are going to be strong and the sellers have a firm belief that that's the case as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nNathan Jones: Congratulations on the new role, Eric. And Andy, congratulations on pretty phenomenal 10-year run here. It's been my pleasure and privilege to work with you and get to know you over that time. So I'd like to wish you and your family all the best>\nAndy Silvernail: Thank you, Nathan.\nNathan Jones: Just getting on to a few questions here on maybe some of the red dots on the end markets, energy and the analytical instrumentation. Just like to get your thoughts on the potential timing of recovery there. I mean, energy is probably a little bit longer than the analytical instrumentation side. But I think, Andy, you talked about focus on the vaccine taking away from - maybe some sales there, it looks like maybe we're getting towards a point where our vaccine is going to be out and available and production facilities will be put in place and maybe some of that focus moves around. So just any thoughts you have on timing of recovery in both of those businesses.\nAndy Silvernail: Yes. I'll touch on it first and let Eric, kind of go from there. The interesting thing is both, Eric and I were group executives in charge of that business at one point. So we won't know it really well. Look, I think what you're seeing here is, counterintuitive to what's happening in that marketplace, right. Because if you look at analytical instrumentation, one would think that immediately because there are health-related issues that it should be growing. The reality is that a lot of the stuff that happens in that big AI space is being pushed away right now because priorities are going over to other spend. It's very much our expectation that as we get into. I don't think any later than the mid-point next year, that starts to improve. And so obviously, we had a lot of confidence. It's a really good business for us. So Eric, your thoughts?\nEric Ashleman: Yes, it's certainly the same thing. And then of course there is a consumables dynamic there, that's kind of out ahead of us. We're generally making the componentry for the equipment, so even if things recover, there is a little bit of a lag there as you go through a consumable stream and then into the actual devices themselves. But I agree with that.\nNathan Jones: Any comments on the energy market and the potential pace of recovery there?\nAndy Silvernail: Yes. Well, on the energy side, of course, as you know, we tend to be more downstream and associated with things like custody transfer and mobile applications. And so, less resilient - or less tied to the wellhead in places like that. And so I think ultimately, we've seen a little bit of improvement here now. I mean obviously that that took a hard hit initially and some of this is probably pent up demand that's coming back, but I think it's going to be a while, it's going to be a while for the energy markets to kind of sort themselves out often when you get it down to where we do business. It depends on things like building trucks for mobile fleets that actually do the work of custody transfer. And so those are the kind of decisions that have to be made, the confidence that has to be there, but certainly we're much happier to be a little further down the stream than up in the front of it.\nNathan Jones: And given top - sorry, go ahead.\nEric Ashleman: So Nathan, the only thing I'd add is we talked about specific initiatives, we had an energy relative to lock last year that was a huge initiative for us. Obviously, that business this year has seen significant contraction, which is I think weighing on FMT a lot more than we had expected coming into the year. So just as folks will poke around a little bit on why FMT's margins and volumes are down a little bit more with a run rate business improving that was fairly large for that group,\nAndy Silvernail: Well, and that of course has a political question associated with it as well.\nEric Ashleman: Yes, exactly.\nNathan Jones: Is vehicle miles traveled really the best indicator we can look at for the energy business?\nAndy Silvernail: Let me jump in, on that one. One of the problems is kind of big macro things is we actually do business in a lot of the micro areas. And so, if you're going to make a big energy call, of course, that's going to influence us. But if you think about our business, we're at the micro level.\nNathan Jones: Do you feel like the cost structure in those businesses that is struggling the most is aligned with demand now, are they targeted cost actions that you can, that you can take you?\nAndy Silvernail: So like we're taking the opportunity now to make some of those actions. We opened up a factory down in Oklahoma actually ahead of the pandemic, it's been a big assist to us. I mean, we intentionally built that with some extra floor space for any potential and we're leveraging that now, we're doing some structural work around the footprint of the Company, because I think this is a good time to think about sort of taking - taking a down situation and creating competitive advantage out of it. And by moving some of the structure around the way we are, it actually allows us to augment or increase some of the innovative potential we have in a business, while at the same time doing the right things and just base administration. And so we're - yes, we're, we're pretty active efforts underway in this area right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Graham: I thought I was surprised when Larry resigned. And you took over Andy. This is double that, but for sure, you've had an amazing run here to say that you've had a good run is an understatement, great value creation, you and Eric are a terrific team. So, congrats to you, Andy. And, Eric anyone that knows you, knows that you're up for the challenge. So I love your line about this being a story of continuity. So thanks for the last nine years, Andy, and Eric look forward to the next 10 with you.\nAndy Silvernail: Thanks, Scott.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Scott.\nScott Graham: This is maybe more of - the first question is maybe more of a question for Bill the more - who's I'm certain is more of a mathematician than me, but could you walk us through the organic flowthrough of 37 and then the total flowthrough was 53 on the, on the operating income walk. I'm - I guess I'm having a little trouble, mass challenge that I can be on how we get there on $3 million of sale - $3 million of income, but maybe I'm just not understanding it.\nBill Grogan: Yes. So maybe we'll start with that, so on the acquisition and FX piece that's $3 million of income on roughly $30 million of sales. So only a 10% contribution from that aspect, which is extremely dilutive to the overall margin. So when you exclude that, and you just look at our core business like-for-like last year versus this year, right, the cost actions, the things we've done within our core business materially reduce the organic flow through to from what we'd expect of 60% down to less than 40%.\nScott Graham: That makes a lot of sense. So next question is same for you again here, Bill, what is the $13 million of discretionary look like in the fourth quarter and then sort of what are you looking at as sort of the reversals for next year with sales now starting to get better?\nBill Grogan: Yes. I mean, we targeted once we get back to normal run rate levels. Obviously, discretionary expense relative to doing business post-COVID will be different but adding back about two-thirds of that on a consistent basis going forward. Yes, we ramped up our spend slightly in the third quarter probably up slightly again here in the fourth quarter with increased volumes. So-- although the network from all the way back if you're doing modeling I'd assume roughly 80% of that cost coming back on a longer-term basis.\nScott Graham: One other question, if I may, the $25 million to $100 million range, which we've all been talking about. I didn't hear you say kind of where you are on that spectrum right now, I can see how really, you're focused on the areas that really are kind of for keeps areas. So that does become a part of the organic, but where are you on that curve?\nBill Grogan: Well, with revenue year-to-date, obviously we're on - we're below the low and that's full-year run rate on an annualized basis. So we've got some wins that we started to experience obviously, in the first half of the year that have continued on here in Q4. I think some of the items that will ramp us to the top end of the range are things again we won't have full visibility here until we get into 2021.\nAndy Silvernail: Yes. And just to think about what those triggers are right. So some of them, as Bill said they're already there. We're already winning, it's already in the base business, so to speak, right. You'll - you won't lap that till the second half of next year for the most part. And then you've got some big digital events, right. So the work we're doing on COVID testing, the work we're doing on vaccines. As I said, last quarter, if those go in the right direction for us, they are huge wins and we'll get to the top end of the range fast, but if they don't, they're not there. So I caution anyone to build those into your models. The top end of that range until we have the know of whether we're aligned with wins and whether that has momentum.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nBrett Linzey: First, yes, congrats to Andy, appreciate all the years of insight and best of luck to Eric. Wanted to come back to the order trends, the improvement is encouraging, were you able to spike out how much of that improvement was market versus share gain. And I imagine you had some of the COVID opportunity wins in September, October orders, any color you could give us there?\nAndy Silvernail: Yes. So look, I think from a big piece of that is general market recovery, because so much of what we do at IDEX is a broad basket across a wide variety of industries. But no doubt, when we can see and isolate the places where we know we're winning share one of which we talked about here in the COVID story chapter in terms of some components that we already have placed that are helping that fight. But I would say the bulk of what you're seeing here in the near term is for sequential recovery of industrial markets that we participate in.\nBrett Linzey: And then, just wanted to shift back to the comments on the muni budgets and some of the work you're doing there. Do you expect a lagged effect into next year, is the backlogs get monetized they need to replenish? And just curious what you know - what some of that work that you're doing on budgets in those particular businesses is informing about the outlook there next year?\nAndy Silvernail: Yes, I would say, I mean, there is always a little bit of a lagging element in the municipal markets, and it's not - it's not ubiquitous you have some towns and municipalities that are pretty aggressive, and they are thinking through now the consequences and the actions. In some cases, that actually accelerate some work, if they're trying to spend money that they have available. I'd say the bulk of most of the market that we're interfacing with is stucked in the same variability that we are and are trying to imagine what could be in front of them as we go into 2021. Open questions of - in the case of the US Federal support, and whether or not, it comes or doesn't. So I think there is going to be a lagging element there that we're thinking about, but I - we're very close to our customers. We kind of do this town by town, jurisdiction by state province and municipality. And so for us it ultimately turns into a series of pins on a map, a bunch of discrete discussions that generally sum up the way I've described it, but we navigate through that field of opportunity as we go.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Wertheimer: Andy, thanks for the reflections on a great run, it was wonderful distillation and Eric, on the comments and continuity and evolution. And I'd like to - if I can encourage us a little bit more of that, really my question is, given all that you and the organization has done with margins with the success of 80-20 and how margins have come up, it does seem like you can add more value to pools of capital you acquire versus what you might have expected seven or ten years ago. And so, does that mean that acquisitions could have a larger role in the future? Eric, you touched on this briefly. And then do you have specific sort of changes you're making to the organization to push that along, if so? Thanks.\nAndy Silvernail: Yes, sure. I appreciate the nature of the question, I'll take it. Yes to both questions. So as we become more evolved internally and better understood, frankly the impact of all of the work that we've done around 80-20 and the IDEX difference and we've seen us apply it to our own businesses and things that we've acquired along the way, it makes us more confidence about what we can do on the outside world. And so we've been very, very purposely thinking about that, we've built it into the modeling that we do as wherever - as we're looking at IDEX like businesses on the outside. And again, from an organizational perspective, a lot of the work that certainly I've been working on in the last few years is to get a number of leaders ready to begin to spend a significant amount of their time on this work. So we're doing that in the background. And then, I think going forward, look, as we said earlier, the valuations are high. Our discipline remains very, very tight and focused. And so, we're going to have to - we're going to have to spend the time beating the bushes to find these kind of opportunities, get them in front of us and analyze them thoroughly and that's going to take some resources as well. So one of the things we're thinking about as the world improves and things lever up is making some purposeful investments to support the continued evolution of this work and keeping at a very high priority.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay. That's a helpful answer. Thank you. And then just if I can just add on one small one on the back of it. I mean do you expect as you do all that you'll have a consistent cadence on acquisitions and flow or - you're obviously not - you're still relatively small and can be opportunistic, you're thinking it can study out a bit or is that not in that part of the goal and just take opportunities where they come? And I'll stop. Thank you.\nAndy Silvernail: Well, I mean - I think there's always been a little bit of a sine wave at least in the time that I've been here, it seems like wins break. And it tends to come in clumps and so I think I think we're prepared to have it continue that way. I mean, we think about resourcing in a way that would support it. And so maybe intensively level loading, it wouldn't be something that we would do as a purposeful way to sort of balance things out because what it might do is actually causes to think about opportunities in a different way than we actually should. So I think there still be a little bit of kind of time-to-time some clustering that we will see, but we set up the organization and we certainly have the capital resources to be able to handle it that way.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joe Giordano with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Giordano: Good afternoon, and congrats to Andy and Eric, both on their opportunities. So best of luck to you both.\nAndy Silvernail: Thanks.\nJoe Giordano: Yes. I wanted to just hear your comments on backlog going into the fourth quarter kind of at the higher end of what it normally might look like and I think, Allison touched on this earlier, but are you calculating haircutting a little bit with what you're saying or at least internally how you're talking to your people in terms of budgeting about just some of the stuff you're seeing over the last week and country starting to shut down, like how are you thinking about deployment of growth capital and things like that near term with some of these kind of more recent developments?\nEric Ashleman: Well, so, look, I think we have a general approach here that is very agile, very reactive. And to be honest, what we're going through and what we're seeing here now, we planned for this back in March. I mean as soon as people started to recognize that there would likely be a second wave of the call. We built that into our thinking so the fact that we are in it now yes, that we're very cautious about the variability that's out there. We're super hesitant and unless we have to do it to put in kind of fixed cost back into the business given this environment. So let's treat it variably if we can, but I have to say that while it's certainly concerning for all of us as citizens in many ways, we sort of set this up as a planned event. We thought it would be here. It is here and we're going to stay as variable and agile as we can as we go through it.\nJoe Giordano: And Eric, you're taking over an organization that's in a really good spot and if you can replicate what's happened over the last 10 years, I think you'd be pretty happy with it. But just curious you're taking over an organization that's still then is like twice the size in terms of revenue as when Andy did. So, what kind of different things you have to think about just given the size of the organization and what's happened over the last decade?\nEric Ashleman: Yes no, thanks. Well certainly, I mean this is a well-positioned company in a great spot. I will take that. I know it presents opportunities along the way, the bar is high and we need to continue to raise it. But I'm very, very thankful that it's in the state that it is now. That being said, as we go forward, there's things that we've talked about. We're certainly more of a global company today than we were even back when Andy joined. I think that even the things we think of acquiring and we have acquired the unit of measure is a little larger. We know the story that Andy talked about with our sealing business, we've done the work to integrate that and bring it together with other like businesses. And that will no doubt continue to be a chapter for us as we go forward. And that's - complex work that takes certain skill sets that we've been building for. So, as I said in the very beginning, I see an awful lot of continuity at play here to keep this company in a great position and take it forward. But there are those little nuances along the way that I think are appropriate that we have in mind that are going to take it to the next level.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Buscaglia: So first off, where you guys had - the commentary is very interesting on the HST segment with the $25 million to $100 million opportunity. So how do we - I hesitate to - like you said, put that in the model at this point, but I guess what are some headlines, or what should we be tracking to see if the likelihood of this is going forward? Or is it something that we cannot know you guys would have to know internally and wait for another update?\nEric Ashleman: Well look, I think there is - a few environmental things that we can all track. This is - we're making an assumption here that as Andy said in the beginning that we're going to co-exist with this virus for quite a while. So even the vaccines that are planned to be here, we're anticipating that they're not going to going to wipe out necessarily the virus that's out there and there's going to be a continual need for testing of this type. So I think - all of us tracking that the requirements, the necessary nature of the kind of work that we're doing on both fronts is an environmental factor that would support this. But they're very specific, I mean these are - this is really specific technology science and commercial adoption that has to happen here. And as Bill said, I think certainly we'll give you an indication along the way when we reach different milestones and it's starting to find its way into our sales stream - order and sales stream. So, I think there is a slight environmental component, but a lot of it is very specific for us.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Yes, okay. Okay and with regard to the orders in the quarter. So that - it's nice to see those trending in the right direction exiting the quarter, where orders in any specific segment surprising to you throughout the quarter and how they trended specifically FMT - I'm curious, how that trended each month, and does there seems to be the laggard here obviously important segment to the story?\nBill Grogan: Yes and I would say - Andy referred to it, we saw improvement across all three segments obviously FMT is lagging a little bit relative to the end-market exposures, but the pickup we saw on a month-to-month basis was pretty close linearly to how we performed overall.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Andrew Silvernail for closing comments.\nAndy Silvernail: Yes, thank you very much. Look, I do have a few closing comments. One, just around the business, as a whole and two just a few thank you's that I'd like to set out and then I'll turn it over to Eric - to wrap it up. So, look as I exit this company. Yes, I appreciate the position that we're in and the quality of this business. It is an awesome business, as I answered, Allison's question and I walked through those four things: quality of business, matters an awful lot and mission matters an awful lot. And we're in a great spot. Second, we've got positive momentum frankly I would never have made the decision to leave IDEX, if we were in the spot. We had been in at the end of the first quarter and the second quarter and it gives me great confidence. And as long as I'm alive my name is going to be associated with IDEX and I want this company to absolutely blow the doors off and we have really good momentum. And then the last thing is there is a great team. Oftentimes, the investment community focus is on a singular person and it's just never so and under my time as the leader of this company. We've been successful because we've had a great team and Eric has a great team, as we go forward. So, I have a lot of confidence in where this business is going. And just a few thank you's. First, I want to thank everybody at IDEX, as I mentioned before, this is just been a privilege and the highlight of my professional career to work with all of you. I can't tell you how many days, I've gone home and had conversations with my wife and conversations with my kids about the joy to work with the people at IDEX. You're just first rate, there is nobody in the world to hold the candle to you guys and you brought me just incredible joy and I just want to thank you very much. To the investor and the analyst community, everybody on the phone here today and those who might listen, sometimes is a bad rap, that between a company, management and the investment community, that somehow, it's just negative Bs that exist. And for me anyway, it just isn't true. There are a lot of you guys on the phone today, you guys are my friends and you have helped me get better, you've pushed us to get better, you've asked a difficult question. And difficult questions are how you get better and it's one of the things we do it IDEX all the time we asked a difficult question. And part of that comes because you guys ask the difficult question. And it's just been a privilege to work with you. And then just to my friend, Eric excuse me. We have worked together for 12 years, and people think about professional relationship and we obviously have that. But he is also my dear friend and as much as I am glad that I made him better, as a leader. He has made me equally, if not more, better, as a leader. And there is not a better executive in the world I have ever worked with than Eric and this company is in great hands.\nEric Ashleman: Well, thank you very much for that. Thanks very much for that. As we often do we end in a lot of the same summary points. I think this business is really, really well positioned. I couldn't be more excited about where it is now and where it's going to go. This transition is smooth and seamless. We are going to execute this, everybody is leaning forward here and our priority priorities are constant. I just like - feel really, really good here. And that's the first question, I think is the right one. I mean we know it's important. We worked on it together and we're going to continue to legacy and the work that you've done, Andy. Few people, I'd like to thank as well. I'd certainly like to thank all the hardworking folks across IDEX. I'm excited to be continuing the journey with them. I'd like to thank our Board, for their confidence and support. And then I absolutely would like to thank my friend, Andy. It has been an amazing run from that very first day he came to my business in 2009 and introduced himself. And so after a long time, we're transitioning from boss and partner to mentor, and continued friend. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And we thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thanks Andy. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 12. Q3 orders of $570 million were down 3% overall and 5% organically. As Andy just mentioned, we saw a broad bounce back in order rates across our businesses and monthly sequential improvement in organic order rates throughout the quarter. Third quarter sales of $581 million were down 7% overall and down 12% organically. Industrial energy markets remain challenged in the quarter and one of the main contributors of the organic declines. As mentioned before, we saw recovery in the auto and dispensing markets as well as continued strength in semi and pharma to help to offset those headwinds, coupled with the benefit of new applications and innovations we have made in response to COVID-19. We're able to drive organic sales to the top end of our previous estimates. Q3 adjusted gross margin declined 190 basis points to 43.3%, primarily driven by lower volume, the dilutive impact of acquisitions and business mix, partially offset by price and the continued impact of cost control actions we have taken. Gross margin was up 70 basis points sequentially versus the second quarter. Third quarter adjusted operating margin was 23.1%, down 210 basis points from the prior year mainly driven by lower volume leverage and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by the restructuring actions and discretionary cost controls. We also saw sequential improvement in op margin increasing 200 basis points from Q2. Our Q3 effective tax rate was 14.4%, which was lower than the 18.6% in the prior year due to discrete benefits associated with the recent changes to the global intangible low tax income regulations. This was a multi-year true-up going back to the start of tax reform and we only have a minor benefit on a rate going forward. Third quarter adjusted net income was $106 million resulting in an adjusted EPS of $1.40 down $0.12 or 8% compared to prior-year EPS. When compared to our second quarter year-to-date tax rate, the reduced ETR increased adjusted EPS by approximately $0.11 in the quarter. Finally, free cash flow was $135 million for the quarter, down 7% compared to the prior year and was 128% of net income, a conversion rate higher than last year. The strong performance was a result of a significant focus and discipline on working capital management. The teams continue to drive our DSO lower and improve our past due rate as well as increase our inventory turns. We continue to demonstrate our ability to drive cash flow conversion in excess of net income. Moving on to Slide 13. As we discussed in our previous earnings call, we continue to take the necessary steps to manage cost and mitigate the significant impact of reduced volume. Our adjusted operating income declined $23 million in the quarter, with organic sales down $75 million, we would have expected a negative impact on operating income of approximately $45 million at roughly 60% contribution margin. This $45 million was offset by $25 million of executed operational initiatives, $7 million from the impact of restructuring actions taken in Q4 of last year and the second quarter of this year, $13 million of discretionary cost control items and $5 million of price and net productivity that was partially offset by $6 million of negative product and business mix primarily associated with FMT. The $13 million of discretionary cost actions in the quarter was lower compared to the $15 million we referenced last quarter, primarily due to modest increases in spend to support and service our customers, as well as some targeted investments we made in growth initiatives. Overall, our teams continue to do an exceptional job of managing costs to mitigate revenue declines. As Andy discussed earlier, we have ensured that we are well-positioned to pivot to offense and continue to invest in initiatives to generate growth in the fourth quarter and beyond. With that, I'd like to turn it back over to Andy, to summarize our Q4 expectations and provide some final thoughts. Yes. So maybe we'll start with that, so on the acquisition and FX piece that's $3 million of income on roughly $30 million of sales. So only a 10% contribution from that aspect, which is extremely dilutive to the overall margin. So when you exclude that, and you just look at our core business like-for-like last year versus this year, right, the cost actions, the things we've done within our core business materially reduce the organic flow through to from what we'd expect of 60% down to less than 40%. Yes. I mean, we targeted once we get back to normal run rate levels. Obviously, discretionary expense relative to doing business post-COVID will be different but adding back about two-thirds of that on a consistent basis going forward. Yes, we ramped up our spend slightly in the third quarter probably up slightly again here in the fourth quarter with increased volumes. So-- although the network from all the way back if you're doing modeling I'd assume roughly 80% of that cost coming back on a longer-term basis. Well, with revenue year-to-date, obviously we're on - we're below the low and that's full-year run rate on an annualized basis. So we've got some wins that we started to experience obviously, in the first half of the year that have continued on here in Q4. I think some of the items that will ramp us to the top end of the range are things again we won't have full visibility here until we get into 2021. Yes and I would say - Andy referred to it, we saw improvement across all three segments obviously FMT is lagging a little bit relative to the end-market exposures, but the pickup we saw on a month-to-month basis was pretty close linearly to how we performed overall."

            "name": "Andy Silvernail",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone. Before we dive into our third quarter results, I'd like to take a moment and talk about the leadership transition we announced yesterday. After 12 wonderful years at IDEX and nearly a decade as Chief Executive Officer, I'm stepping down as Chairman and CEO in mid-December. I'm delighted that the Board of Directors has selected our President and COO, Eric Ashleman as IDEX's new CEO, effective December 15, 2020. Eric is a uniquely capable leader, who has a clear choice for the role. He and I have worked closely together since I joined IDEX. We work side-by-side to establish our strategy, build our culture and deliver value for all of our stakeholders. Eric brings extensive knowledge of our business, deep insights into our markets and a passion for bringing up the best of our people. My decision comes after deep reflection. Leaving IDEX has been the greatest prier to my career. It's a significantly different Company today than when I joined in 2009. We've accelerated our transformation from an acquisition-based holding Company, into a high-performing global enterprise that improves lives on a daily basis. With this strong foundation, IDEX is positioned for continued growth and value creation. So it's a good time for change for two reasons. First, IDEX is ready. We've let a remarkable Company through this pandemic crisis, our mission has never mattered more, our culture and financial position has never been stronger and our team has never been more capable. To that end, we're fortunate to have Eric, as the next IDEX CEO. He's a proven leader who has delivered excellence for our shareholders and our broad stakeholders for the past 13 years. Second, I'm ready. For the last couple of years, many of you have asked me about my career thoughts. I've always said that I love IDEX, but I thought 10 years is about the right shelf life for a public company CEO. I could never have dreamed what we were accomplished over the span. We've built an organization that advances and save lives of millions of people around the globe. We have created a highly engaged organization that is among the best in the world. We've impacted our communities through compassion and generosity with the support of the IDEX foundation. And we have delivered for our owners, producing total shareholder return of greater than 530%. For me personally, I'm excited for a new phase of life that brings along new challenges and opportunities for me and my family. I'm going to become Chairman, CEO, and an owner of Madison Industries, one of the world's largest private companies. This new opportunity offers a chance to build another great organization and make positive change in the world over a very long horizon. I am confident now is the right time to pass the torch and welcome IDEX's next generation of leadership. On a personal note, Eric has been a true partner and a dear friend to me. And, I'm confident that this transition to CEO will be seamless for our Company, employees and all of our stakeholders. As this is my last earnings call, I want to say how grateful I am to have worked alongside our incredibly talented team, the last 12 years. It has been an honor to serve as Chairman and CEO, and to be part of a Company like IDEX. I also want to thank all of our investors and analysts on the phone, who are with us today for the support through the years. The future of IDEX is very bright. We have reached new levels of industry leadership and sustained value creation and we will do so again under, Eric as our CEO. As Mike, mentioned, Eric is joining Bill and I for the earnings call. Bill and I will walk through our assessment and analysis and view of the future as we normally do. We'll then turn to Q&A and Eric will join the conversation and talk about the future. I'll now turn to our results for the third quarter. We continue to see a strong sequential rebound in orders, with September 2020, topping the same month last year. That's a good sign. I want to thank all of our people around the globe, who've risen to the occasion. And a year no one could have predicted, our people continued to shine. So to all of the IDEX team members listening on this call, thank you. A time like this truly tests the culture of the Company. Are you rooted in strong values that people really live and believe? If so, you will be better prepared to survive and even thrive. IDEX is this kind of company and it's serving us well. Because of the protocols we've put in place, the disruptions we've seen in our operations have been limited. We have protected our people within the workplace and we will do so even if the COVID trends are moving in the wrong way. We continue to focus on solving our customers' greatest challenges, many of which have shifted this year. That has reinforced the need to stay close to our customers even when we have to remain socially distanced to understand their needs. Bill will walk through the details shortly, but as you've seen, our organic sales are down 12% year-over-year falling at the better end of our predicted range. Importantly, organic orders were down only 5% and continued to improve sequentially, a trend that is continuing in October. Been a diversified company helps a great deal in times like these, while certain sectors like energy continue to struggle, other aspects of the economy are booming. This diversity gives us strength, limiting our exposure to any one sector. The financial controls we put in place early continue to serve us well. We are delivering strong profitability and exceptional cash flow as we have pivot to growth, we have ramped up our capital spending and investment to support some really exciting initiatives. We've also seen activity in the M&A market start to pick up. While those pillars of safety, business continuity and liquidity, are also part of our pandemic operating focus, it is time to aggressively play offense. I'm turning to Slide 7. That increased focus on playing offense has us involved in some exciting new opportunities. A variety of our businesses are producing new solutions for cleaning and disinfecting public spaces. One shine example is a sprayer, that uses electrostatically charged particles to envelope a surface, not just hit the side base in sprayer. We anticipate solutions like this will continue to be in demand, not just during this pandemic but for years to come as public demand for cleaning and disinfection will be forever changed by this period of time. We also have an exciting new opportunity to partner with customers to develop a highly accurate point of care solution for diagnostic testing for COVID-19. Our IDEX Health & Science team is hard at work ramping up. With public health experts increasingly predicting that the coronavirus will be like influenza, remain in circulation even after vaccines are widely available, we anticipate this will be a significant new program for our Company for the foreseeable future. I'll share more about that in a moment. We also continue to see machines used in production of pharmaceuticals and vaccines. Insourcing critical API manufacturing is a key initiative for several countries, and last quarter, we shared our microfluidizer processors are key technology for manufacturing vaccine adjuvants. Vaccine adjuvants are immune stimulators added to many vaccines commonly used today. By using the adjuvant in a vaccine, the body can often produce a better immune response to the antigen, while also allowing vaccine manufacturers to be able to produce more doses of vaccine with less antigen. Our team was excited to recently deliver machines for use in producing advanced supplies of one of the leading vaccines in testing today. We are also working actively with other vaccine manufacturers as the world prepares for an unprecedented race for production and distribution of this critical piece of the puzzle for solving the COVID-19 crisis. I'm moving to Slide 8. In Health & Science, our products are being used to help and enable rapid highly accurate testing of COVID-19. Our things microfluidic cartridges are a key technology used to diagnose COVID-19 infection in the point of care molecular market, which allows testing to be done near the patient versus being sent to a laboratory. Our technology-enabled demilitarization of complex laboratory workflows, by integrating pumps, valves, sample, reagent management and signal detection, in order to provide a simple workflow for the operator of the instrument. This instrument operator only needs to add the patient sample to the cartridge, insert it in the instrument and then push a button to run the test. Our microfluidics capabilities allow for high volume production and consistent repeatable results that are needed to combat COVID-19. In addition, H&S has optical filters and several diagnostic instruments that are used for COVID-19 testing. We provide various footer components designed in, in vitro diagnostic instruments used for COVID-19. We have the gassers, pumps, manifolds and fluidic connections in these IVD instruments that typically analyze blood samples. We also have both optics and fluidics assemblies and next-generation DNA sequencers being used to analyze COVID-19 to better understand the virus and track it spread. I'm proud of how our businesses have answered the call over the past two quarters and work closely with our customers to innovate and deliver critical solutions to the marketplace. Alright, I'm moving to Slide 9. We provide an update on the state of our primary end markets. We saw sequential improvement in most of our end markets with some of our more challenged markets including auto and dispensing recovering faster than we anticipated. In fluid metering, the broader industrial softness and the volatility in oil and gas has continued though we did see a pickup in daily order rates in the month of September, which provides optimism as we close out the year and we head into 2021. Significant capital investment by our customers continues to be on hold and in a broader market recovery and reduction in global economic uncertainty. Our water business has continued to show resiliency impacted only by timing delays in some municipal projects. As we called out last quarter, agriculture has performed well, it's growing optimism and investment held up in the quarter. In Health & Science, semicon has continued to outpace our expectations and was strong sequentially and year-over-year. Our sealing business recovered nicely in the quarter through the resumption of activity in the auto market. Additionally, the product innovations, I discussed earlier helped generate positive momentum for us in multiple end markets including industrial. On the other side, analytical instrumentation and some aspects of VD/BIO, we continue to see that as medical industry is focused on COVID-19, other investments in lab equipment were delayed and we've not yet seen the activity materially pickup. Moving to Fire & Safety and Diversified. We saw sequential improvement in most of our markets. Recovery in auto and retail are big stories driving a rebound in our BAND-IT and Dispensing businesses. Fire rescue continued to see strong performance, but we have been impacted by production delays at OEMs pushing projects out and extending lead times for municipal deliveries. Backlog in these businesses continue to be strong and we're working closely with our customers to monitor delivery schedules and assess the impact of COVID-19 on future year municipal budgets. Previously funded projects continue to go and demand for our new products in these businesses has been strong. We are overall optimistic about the market recovery we've seen in the third quarter and continue to believe that the diversified nature of our businesses has helped mitigate the impact of the global economic decline. Our dedication to our customers and ability to respond and innovate quickly has continued to generate momentum for us to combat market declines. As we head into the fourth quarter, we expect to see a pickup in order rates, particularly in our day rate businesses, as an indicator of further recovery. Okay. I'm moving to Slide 10. I want to provide some additional context to the organic order trends we've seen over the past two quarters. We saw a broad rebound in order rates in the third quarter, recovering from organic declines and as much as 23% in the second quarter. To organic growth in the month of September, all of our segments participated in this trend. FMT organic orders improved each month, driven by strength to agriculture and stabilization and industrial, as well as a slight pickup in energy. HST was driven by a recovery in the auto market and targeted new product initiatives, as well as the positive momentum in semicon and pharma that I mentioned earlier. Finally, Diversified's organic orders saw dramatic improvements at BAND-IT and Dispensing, as auto and aerospace businesses open back up and capital spending returned in the paint markets. On top of the year-over-year improvements, we also experienced sequential increases with FMT up 12% HST, up 6% and FSD up 11% versus the second quarter. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results for the quarter. Thank you, Bill. I'm on Slide 14 everyone. As I mentioned earlier, we are firmly what I call Phase 3, of the pandemic response, living with the virus. I'm proud of how our teams have adapted and innovated in this environment, our teams have embraced our mission and our values and have been diligent executing our COVID-19 playbook. We maintain optimism to the market recovery we've experienced will continue and we've seen the benefit of the proactive steps we took at the end of last year and throughout the early phases of pandemic, positioning IDEX to remain strong, while taking advantage of new opportunities. We expect revenue in the fourth quarter will be down between 3% and 5% organically based on our current backlog position and expected daily order rates. We are in close contact with our customer base and we continue to look for signs of confidence and capital spending, that will be the catalyst for sustained recovery. We continue to make strategic investments in our business, just for further long-term growth, we remain disciplined in our efforts to manage costs. To conclude, this quarter was a great display of the strength of the IDEX business model. From the resiliency of our base business to our ability to respond to challenges quickly and deliver innovative solutions to our customers. I continue to remain optimistic about our prospects to come and think about coming out of this crisis even stronger than when we entered it with new opportunities for growth on the horizon. With that let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions. Yes. Thank you, Mike. Thanks. Yes Mike, maybe I'll just touch on it first and then let Eric go deeper on it. So really no real difference from how we thought about it last quarter. If you look at the sequential improvement that we've seen go back from second quarter - first quarter, third quarter - second quarter, third quarter and that's sequential gain and we're now in that 3% to 5% down. The last really tough comp will be Q1 of next year. And I think we'll know a lot more going into that quarter, but I will say going into the fourth quarter. We always look at the backlog load and that gives us a confidence level and we are at the higher end of our normal backlog load going into the quarter. That's a really good sign it gives a lot of work around that 3% to 5% organic. First quarter will be a tough comp and then, but if you keep thinking about the sequentials. And you think about that acceleration that puts us in a good spot for the entire year as you think about it. I know Eric, you put a lot of thought into this as we are prepping for our budgets and going through a strat plan. Thank you. Yes, I guess, Allison you're asking that question a good time, you can imagine I'm pretty reflective right now about everything we've done together. I think that the early kernels, I'll remember back and the folks from IDEX who are listening to this call, they'll remember. We had - our global leadership meeting in March of 2012. And when you look at what Eric, just referred to is what we internally call the IDEX difference which is around great teams 80-20, and obsessive focus on the customer. We started laying those kernels out then. And from there, they grew and what you found was that is that kernel grew and you dug in deeper. You saw that the levers that really matter are actually very few. When you get right down to it, the levers that matter are very few. And Eric and I have had about 10,000 conversations over the years in offices, in airplanes, in conference rooms at each other's houses, talking about how to make that real and talking about how do you get these big concepts that sound like frankly stupid corporate speak down to the people, who actually do the work. And that's where we've dug in really deep. And so, the levers that matter, the first thing is, do you have a mission that people care about, right, did the people actually care about the work that they're doing and how they're impacting the world. And when you get a compelling mission, it aligns everybody really quickly. Second is, do you have good businesses or bad businesses. I've been in good businesses and I've been bad businesses and Eric I know, I've been in some pretty bad ones too. And those are - those are instructive, right, because bad businesses you spend a lot of time on problems that you can absolutely frankly never fix. And so position yourself into good businesses and that means acquisition and it also means that approach to 80-20 all along because within any business, there are - there is a great business and there is bad business and you got to work through that on a constant basis. And you got to move resources, right. You got to move resources to the things that matter most, where profits really exist, where you have a differentiated position. The last - the next one is great teams. One of the interesting things about IDEX, we have 45 businesses, we have 45 corner offices, and we've seen time and again when you put a great leader in, it is like a light switch. It's not slow, it's fast, how - what they do with the business, and if you combine that great leader and leadership team with a great business, there is a magic that happens there that is just incredible. And then I'd say the last thing is process discipline. And if you think about this as an exponential equation, right, and you bring process discipline to bear for us that happens to be the elements of the IDEX difference, that really is the formula or the equation that Eric and I and the team have been putting together for years and years and years. Yes, Allison, in terms of some of the learnings, they all go into those buckets. If I could go back in time and pull and change a couple of things. Look, there have been times when I moved to slow with leaders who weren't getting it done and I've learned that you can't do that, right. People either buy-in or they don't. It's very hard to convince somebody that they should do something that they are opposed to out of the gates. And so you got to get people who are excited and you got to ride those horses. Asset choices, look, I really do believe that in this next phase of life and Eric is incredibly well-positioned to do this. Acquisitions are going to matter a lot and we've made some really good asset choices, we made a couple of bad ones. And again, kind of like choosing good and bad. When you choose bad, it hurts, and when you choose. Good. It's amazing what they do. And I'll just - I'll reference, one the first business we bought - that I bought is part of IDEX was PPE and that was in 2010, I wasn't CEO yet and it's a little business in England and what you saw there was for all the elements of what makes IDEX special, and we've gone from that little business in England to $300 million platform, that is just an incredible part of our business. That's the model that I think we need to follow here going forward. And so, Allison, I appreciate the question, it definitely is a reflective time. So maybe I'll take a first shot at that. I would say, we've made some initial investments in the quarter from an investment perspective as we worked with our customers to get some of these things and get some traction on early development. Obviously, we've invested in some capital to support some initiatives relative to tooling, some of these opportunities relative that range could be sizable. Obviously, we've got multiple partners with each of the applications, all the volatility we've talked about, who is ultimately going to end up winning is one factor, and then two, the commercial viability of whoever wins in the marketplace will also be another variable. So that's why it's a wide range for now, obviously, Eric highlighted, we were spending a ton of time on these initiatives across several different businesses. And I think we want more visibility coming out of the year and early first quarter, and be able to size that up a little bit better for you when we talk about 2021. That was certainly the actionability I think is quite a bit better. I think everybody has found a way to actually do the work in a remote way. In many ways, everybody else is kind of get their head around the fact that this is going to be with us for a while and yet things are going to continue and businesses going to go on, all of that helps. And then of course, there is things - it seems like, there is ample liquidity as well, for certainly for us and for others. So the actionability is high, the process is slightly different. I would say on the valuation. There is not a lot of change. It's high. It's high and I think it's a long-term view and certainly for the businesses that we're going to be attracted to, they have tremendous long-term potential. And so those out years if anything we're looking at, we're anticipating are going to be strong and the sellers have a firm belief that that's the case as well. Thank you, Nathan. Yes. I'll touch on it first and let Eric, kind of go from there. The interesting thing is both, Eric and I were group executives in charge of that business at one point. So we won't know it really well. Look, I think what you're seeing here is, counterintuitive to what's happening in that marketplace, right. Because if you look at analytical instrumentation, one would think that immediately because there are health-related issues that it should be growing. The reality is that a lot of the stuff that happens in that big AI space is being pushed away right now because priorities are going over to other spend. It's very much our expectation that as we get into. I don't think any later than the mid-point next year, that starts to improve. And so obviously, we had a lot of confidence. It's a really good business for us. So Eric, your thoughts? Yes. Well, on the energy side, of course, as you know, we tend to be more downstream and associated with things like custody transfer and mobile applications. And so, less resilient - or less tied to the wellhead in places like that. And so I think ultimately, we've seen a little bit of improvement here now. I mean obviously that that took a hard hit initially and some of this is probably pent up demand that's coming back, but I think it's going to be a while, it's going to be a while for the energy markets to kind of sort themselves out often when you get it down to where we do business. It depends on things like building trucks for mobile fleets that actually do the work of custody transfer. And so those are the kind of decisions that have to be made, the confidence that has to be there, but certainly we're much happier to be a little further down the stream than up in the front of it. Well, and that of course has a political question associated with it as well. Let me jump in, on that one. One of the problems is kind of big macro things is we actually do business in a lot of the micro areas. And so, if you're going to make a big energy call, of course, that's going to influence us. But if you think about our business, we're at the micro level. So like we're taking the opportunity now to make some of those actions. We opened up a factory down in Oklahoma actually ahead of the pandemic, it's been a big assist to us. I mean, we intentionally built that with some extra floor space for any potential and we're leveraging that now, we're doing some structural work around the footprint of the Company, because I think this is a good time to think about sort of taking - taking a down situation and creating competitive advantage out of it. And by moving some of the structure around the way we are, it actually allows us to augment or increase some of the innovative potential we have in a business, while at the same time doing the right things and just base administration. And so we're - yes, we're, we're pretty active efforts underway in this area right now. Thanks, Scott. Yes. And just to think about what those triggers are right. So some of them, as Bill said they're already there. We're already winning, it's already in the base business, so to speak, right. You'll - you won't lap that till the second half of next year for the most part. And then you've got some big digital events, right. So the work we're doing on COVID testing, the work we're doing on vaccines. As I said, last quarter, if those go in the right direction for us, they are huge wins and we'll get to the top end of the range fast, but if they don't, they're not there. So I caution anyone to build those into your models. The top end of that range until we have the know of whether we're aligned with wins and whether that has momentum. Yes. So look, I think from a big piece of that is general market recovery, because so much of what we do at IDEX is a broad basket across a wide variety of industries. But no doubt, when we can see and isolate the places where we know we're winning share one of which we talked about here in the COVID story chapter in terms of some components that we already have placed that are helping that fight. But I would say the bulk of what you're seeing here in the near term is for sequential recovery of industrial markets that we participate in. Yes, I would say, I mean, there is always a little bit of a lagging element in the municipal markets, and it's not - it's not ubiquitous you have some towns and municipalities that are pretty aggressive, and they are thinking through now the consequences and the actions. In some cases, that actually accelerate some work, if they're trying to spend money that they have available. I'd say the bulk of most of the market that we're interfacing with is stucked in the same variability that we are and are trying to imagine what could be in front of them as we go into 2021. Open questions of - in the case of the US Federal support, and whether or not, it comes or doesn't. So I think there is going to be a lagging element there that we're thinking about, but I - we're very close to our customers. We kind of do this town by town, jurisdiction by state province and municipality. And so for us it ultimately turns into a series of pins on a map, a bunch of discrete discussions that generally sum up the way I've described it, but we navigate through that field of opportunity as we go. Yes, sure. I appreciate the nature of the question, I'll take it. Yes to both questions. So as we become more evolved internally and better understood, frankly the impact of all of the work that we've done around 80-20 and the IDEX difference and we've seen us apply it to our own businesses and things that we've acquired along the way, it makes us more confidence about what we can do on the outside world. And so we've been very, very purposely thinking about that, we've built it into the modeling that we do as wherever - as we're looking at IDEX like businesses on the outside. And again, from an organizational perspective, a lot of the work that certainly I've been working on in the last few years is to get a number of leaders ready to begin to spend a significant amount of their time on this work. So we're doing that in the background. And then, I think going forward, look, as we said earlier, the valuations are high. Our discipline remains very, very tight and focused. And so, we're going to have to - we're going to have to spend the time beating the bushes to find these kind of opportunities, get them in front of us and analyze them thoroughly and that's going to take some resources as well. So one of the things we're thinking about as the world improves and things lever up is making some purposeful investments to support the continued evolution of this work and keeping at a very high priority. Well, I mean - I think there's always been a little bit of a sine wave at least in the time that I've been here, it seems like wins break. And it tends to come in clumps and so I think I think we're prepared to have it continue that way. I mean, we think about resourcing in a way that would support it. And so maybe intensively level loading, it wouldn't be something that we would do as a purposeful way to sort of balance things out because what it might do is actually causes to think about opportunities in a different way than we actually should. So I think there still be a little bit of kind of time-to-time some clustering that we will see, but we set up the organization and we certainly have the capital resources to be able to handle it that way. Thanks. Yes, thank you very much. Look, I do have a few closing comments. One, just around the business, as a whole and two just a few thank you's that I'd like to set out and then I'll turn it over to Eric - to wrap it up. So, look as I exit this company. Yes, I appreciate the position that we're in and the quality of this business. It is an awesome business, as I answered, Allison's question and I walked through those four things: quality of business, matters an awful lot and mission matters an awful lot. And we're in a great spot. Second, we've got positive momentum frankly I would never have made the decision to leave IDEX, if we were in the spot. We had been in at the end of the first quarter and the second quarter and it gives me great confidence. And as long as I'm alive my name is going to be associated with IDEX and I want this company to absolutely blow the doors off and we have really good momentum. And then the last thing is there is a great team. Oftentimes, the investment community focus is on a singular person and it's just never so and under my time as the leader of this company. We've been successful because we've had a great team and Eric has a great team, as we go forward. So, I have a lot of confidence in where this business is going. And just a few thank you's. First, I want to thank everybody at IDEX, as I mentioned before, this is just been a privilege and the highlight of my professional career to work with all of you. I can't tell you how many days, I've gone home and had conversations with my wife and conversations with my kids about the joy to work with the people at IDEX. You're just first rate, there is nobody in the world to hold the candle to you guys and you brought me just incredible joy and I just want to thank you very much. To the investor and the analyst community, everybody on the phone here today and those who might listen, sometimes is a bad rap, that between a company, management and the investment community, that somehow, it's just negative Bs that exist. And for me anyway, it just isn't true. There are a lot of you guys on the phone today, you guys are my friends and you have helped me get better, you've pushed us to get better, you've asked a difficult question. And difficult questions are how you get better and it's one of the things we do it IDEX all the time we asked a difficult question. And part of that comes because you guys ask the difficult question. And it's just been a privilege to work with you. And then just to my friend, Eric excuse me. We have worked together for 12 years, and people think about professional relationship and we obviously have that. But he is also my dear friend and as much as I am glad that I made him better, as a leader. He has made me equally, if not more, better, as a leader. And there is not a better executive in the world I have ever worked with than Eric and this company is in great hands."

            "content": "Sure, sure thank you, Deane. It's great to talk with you and great to talk with everybody here. I'm excited to get going. Look I think as we think about focus and priorities, I want to make sure that we all appreciate that this is a story of continuity alongside purposeful evolution. So I have worked for Andy for 12 years, every day he has been part of IDEX. I guess since I'm reported to him. And for the last five years, I've served as the COO of the company. And so side-by-side, I mean we have been - partners in all the major decisions that we've made along the way that have evolved the company to where we are today and that certainly includes 80-20. I mean that is at the cornerstone of what we call the IDEX difference. And so, maybe less appreciated is the evolution - the organizational evolution that's happened alongside all of that. So in these five years, I mean, we've been very, very deliberate to work on developing other voices that are now part of the senior team and have been. Frankly, our group executives joined our senior team over a year ago. I look down the table here at Bill. Bill was my original operating partner in finance. So this is a team effort, it has been a team effort. And so, the strategy that's in my head is the same one that we've been working on all these years. Now that being said look that the world is definitely in a dynamic spot now. There is a pandemic in front of us. There is things like digitalization that are happening all over the place. And we've got a thing or things like aggressive capital deployment and how we're going to work all of that in this environment. So those priorities were here before this day, they remain very firmly in front of me as we go forward. And I absolutely - I'm an advocate of 80-20. It's a way of thinking as much as it's a part of the operating model. Yes, sure, sure. So look, there is multiple phases. I mean this is no doubt a dynamic world. I mean this - most of these applications didn't exist in our minds sooner than March of this year. So we have some elements and components that are - that they're moving now. They're part of the fight today. They are embedded in our sales numbers that you're looking at. I would say that the bulk of the opportunities and some of the things that we talked about here today. They're a little further out, they are compressed development cycles. They are very, very active now. And we would see a lot of them starting to get some initial market traction in early 2021, but some very, very important milestones along the way that we're working with different partners and customers to bring those to bear. They are organic in nature now, certainly as things continue to develop and evolve that inorganic opportunities to make them bigger and more impactful would be something we would absolutely consider. Yes well, absolutely. The focus remains very, very high on that front. I mean ultimately IDEX was built that way through acquisition. So, I think as the pandemic unfolded obviously, things froze up in the early days. We've seen things free up now. The process as you might imagine is quite different. I mean we're - none of us are in airplanes. We're doing a lot of it remotely and virtually, but we've adopted just as we've adapted our businesses in that way. And I think as we look forward, this is an area of huge focus for our team, the group executive is one of the big reasons we brought them onto our senior team and so, frankly we could get more hands on the opportunity itself. And so, we're looking aggressively. I think, we're looking for properties that are - they've got to be good IDEX businesses, that's something that we're always going to keep firmly in our sites that you could imagine in times like this that. This is a complex operating environment and businesses that might not be able to handle it quite, as well, but are very, very differentiated would be something that we think we could bring a lot of value to. And so, we're considering that as an extension of sort of our normal course and the normal filters that we use as we think about businesses we'd like to own. But I can assure you it absolutely remains a fundamental piece of the day and a priority for us. Yes, yes. And absolutely, Mike you know as well. I mean, we stay agile and reactive along the way that always serves us well. So as we think about the variability that's still in front of us at least in the next quarter or two till we get a handle on where the pandemic is going to go. I mean we've set up an operating cadence that allows us to course-correct and adjusts really, really well. And so, I mean a good example of that you can see in our opening comments. I mean we've got - we've taken the structural actions where we need to really fast. In fact, we took some of them even before the pandemic first showed up in the early spring. And at the same time, we've been able to rally and pivot resources around the opportunities that we outlined as we talked about fighting the pandemic. That's the way we do business and it works equally well for things on the downside because of more variability or opportunities that are accelerated and in front of us even sooner. And so that's how we're going to run the company and follow that course. Well, I'll take that one, Allison. So look I think ever since the pandemic started here. I mean, we've seen that volatility enter our order book and we're always going to have two ways that we delineated, we've got kind of that every day replenishment cycle that happens in a lot of our component businesses. And then honestly, as long as the system is on states pretty constant. And so, irrespective of border closings and other things, it generally has held up pretty well, what tends to move on us is, are a little bit more project-intensive businesses, larger unit of - units of measure and they're very much affected by the view of the world around us. So I think as we see this, no doubt. I think this next wave will be different than the one we saw in March, because everybody kind of recognizes the economic consequence of that and everybody has done a better job of tooling the organizations up to be able to live with it and coexist with it. So we're expecting more volatility as the cases go up, but I don't see that it should knock us off the trend path that we're on, as we just continue to live with it. And that goes for IDEX that goes for any other business. Yes, it's certainly the same thing. And then of course there is a consumables dynamic there, that's kind of out ahead of us. We're generally making the componentry for the equipment, so even if things recover, there is a little bit of a lag there as you go through a consumable stream and then into the actual devices themselves. But I agree with that. So Nathan, the only thing I'd add is we talked about specific initiatives, we had an energy relative to lock last year that was a huge initiative for us. Obviously, that business this year has seen significant contraction, which is I think weighing on FMT a lot more than we had expected coming into the year. So just as folks will poke around a little bit on why FMT's margins and volumes are down a little bit more with a run rate business improving that was fairly large for that group, Yes, exactly. Thanks, Scott. Well, so, look, I think we have a general approach here that is very agile, very reactive. And to be honest, what we're going through and what we're seeing here now, we planned for this back in March. I mean as soon as people started to recognize that there would likely be a second wave of the call. We built that into our thinking so the fact that we are in it now yes, that we're very cautious about the variability that's out there. We're super hesitant and unless we have to do it to put in kind of fixed cost back into the business given this environment. So let's treat it variably if we can, but I have to say that while it's certainly concerning for all of us as citizens in many ways, we sort of set this up as a planned event. We thought it would be here. It is here and we're going to stay as variable and agile as we can as we go through it. Yes no, thanks. Well certainly, I mean this is a well-positioned company in a great spot. I will take that. I know it presents opportunities along the way, the bar is high and we need to continue to raise it. But I'm very, very thankful that it's in the state that it is now. That being said, as we go forward, there's things that we've talked about. We're certainly more of a global company today than we were even back when Andy joined. I think that even the things we think of acquiring and we have acquired the unit of measure is a little larger. We know the story that Andy talked about with our sealing business, we've done the work to integrate that and bring it together with other like businesses. And that will no doubt continue to be a chapter for us as we go forward. And that's - complex work that takes certain skill sets that we've been building for. So, as I said in the very beginning, I see an awful lot of continuity at play here to keep this company in a great position and take it forward. But there are those little nuances along the way that I think are appropriate that we have in mind that are going to take it to the next level. Well look, I think there is - a few environmental things that we can all track. This is - we're making an assumption here that as Andy said in the beginning that we're going to co-exist with this virus for quite a while. So even the vaccines that are planned to be here, we're anticipating that they're not going to going to wipe out necessarily the virus that's out there and there's going to be a continual need for testing of this type. So I think - all of us tracking that the requirements, the necessary nature of the kind of work that we're doing on both fronts is an environmental factor that would support this. But they're very specific, I mean these are - this is really specific technology science and commercial adoption that has to happen here. And as Bill said, I think certainly we'll give you an indication along the way when we reach different milestones and it's starting to find its way into our sales stream - order and sales stream. So, I think there is a slight environmental component, but a lot of it is very specific for us. Well, thank you very much for that. Thanks very much for that. As we often do we end in a lot of the same summary points. I think this business is really, really well positioned. I couldn't be more excited about where it is now and where it's going to go. This transition is smooth and seamless. We are going to execute this, everybody is leaning forward here and our priority priorities are constant. I just like - feel really, really good here. And that's the first question, I think is the right one. I mean we know it's important. We worked on it together and we're going to continue to legacy and the work that you've done, Andy. Few people, I'd like to thank as well. I'd certainly like to thank all the hardworking folks across IDEX. I'm excited to be continuing the journey with them. I'd like to thank our Board, for their confidence and support. And then I absolutely would like to thank my friend, Andy. It has been an amazing run from that very first day he came to my business in 2009 and introduced himself. And so after a long time, we're transitioning from boss and partner to mentor, and continued friend. Thank you very much."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX. Thank you. You may begin.\nMike Yates: Great. Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Let me start by saying thank you for joining us for a discussion of the IDEX second quarter 2020 financial highlights.

With that, I\u2019ll now turn this call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Andy Silvernail. Andy?\nAndy Silvernail: Thanks Mike. I want to start by thanking all the people across IDEX. They've really stepped up with the challenges that COVID-19 has presented and have embraced the evolving protocols along the way. As COVID-19 has impacted families globally, we've not been spared loss here at IDEX, and I want to make sure that all of our teams know how proud we are of their contributions. In a crisis, especially one as devastating as this, your true values are exposed and the culture that we've built at IDEX is stronger than ever. We continue to supply our customers with critically enabling products across the globe, meeting their challenging demands, and partnering with them to rapidly support and develop innovative new products to battle COVID-19. I'm going to share one of those examples here in a few minutes. Our businesses continue to deliver during this pandemic. With our internal safety protocols and resilient supply chain, we've been able to deliver products with limited interruptions. When issues have arisen, the teams have been able to react quickly and mitigate the impact on our business and customers. While we have experienced significant sales increases, our balanced end market exposure and mission critical product offerings have limited these declines. The diversification into various life sciences, pharma, and municipal applications have lessened than the more cyclical declines in energy and general industrial end markets. Also, our operating and finance teams across the globe did an excellent job of deleveraging the balance sheet and helping to drive record second quarter free cash flow. We converted at 193% of adjusted net income.  Finally, we\u2019ve continue to be proactive on mitigating the bottom line impact from the historical economic dislocation created by the virus. We've ramped down all non-essential expenses to mitigate our organic decrementals at less than 40%. We're leveraging and restructuring actions that we took in 2019, along with new actions that were required in several of our businesses that we'll see more prolonged volume impacts. As these organizations right size for the new normal, we've increased investments in several other businesses to capitalize on several short-term COVID-19 opportunities, as well as invest in projects that will support our longer-term growth. We've made -- we've made swift and smart decisions to keep our people safe, keep our business moving, and ensure our financial performance making sure that we do everything we can to help win the COVID-19 fight. Turning to slide seven. We outlined four key strategies to operate in the COVID-19 world in early March. Focusing on this framework has been a key part of our ability to perform across our businesses. From a safety perspective, protecting our teams as we remain open has been our priority. The standards we've implemented globally have been effective in keeping operations consistently running with minimal work stoppages across our facilities. We've evolved our protocols and have implemented mandatory face coverings in all of our facilities to protect our employees and limit the spread of COVID-19. As I mentioned earlier, our operations and supply chain team have done an excellent job ensuring business continuity. We continue to improve our operational preparedness and bolster our supply chain with plans to help avoid business disruptions. We anticipate continued volatility in the months ahead, and the dynamic planning support structure we've built should serve our businesses well. Our actions in the second quarter have minimized any concerns we have with liquidity. We issued $500 million of new bonds to pay off our 2020 notes and bolster our cash position. We had record second quarter cash flow, and we have $746 million of cash on our balance sheet and full capacity on our revolver. The efforts of our teams have put us in great financial position, and we have more than enough capital to fund all of our operational needs due to the pandemic as well as position us to take advantage of other capital deployment opportunities. Lastly, our leaders are spending more time playing offense. Our teams continue to innovate and bring new products to market that capture short-term opportunities, but also lever our portfolio to capitalize on longer-term secular trends that are evolving as a result of pandemic, particularly around testing for viruses and antibodies as well as the creation of a vaccine. I would go into more detail on more of those opportunities here in minute. We also see the M&A markets open up with more deals starting to come through. While it's still going to be a challenging year from an M&A perspective, we're more optimistic in our ability to get a deal done than we were 90 days ago. With that update on the status of the COVID-19 playbook, I'd like to spend a few minutes walking you through one of the products that's a critical technology in the mass production of vaccines. I'm on slide eight. In the HST segment, products from our microfluidics product line within our Materials Processing Technologies' business are keys to help bring a vaccine for COVID-19 to market. Our Microfluidizer processors are key technology used to manufacture the vaccine adjuvants required for several of the vaccine trials. Vaccine adjuvants are immune stimulators added to many vaccines commonly used today. By using an adjuvant in a vaccine, the body can produce a better immune response to the antigen with the germ, while also allowing vaccine manufacturers to be able to produce more doses of vaccine with less antigen.  In addition to vaccine adjuvants, Microfluidizer processors can be used to manufacture lipid nanoparticles, that are key ingredients with a new mRNA style vaccines currently in the pipeline. The team at MPT has done a fantastic job responding to the increasing demands in the market for COVID-19 vaccine testing and preproduction, and has quickly aligned priorities to meet this market need and participate in the fight against the pandemic. This highlights just one of the ways IDEX businesses have answered the call and wholeheartedly embraced our mission of trusted solutions improving lives. We're moving now to slide nine. We've outlined here how we're seeing the current environment impact our primary end markets. In our Fluid & Metering Technology segment, we've seen a broader industrial softness that we called out at the end of 2019, become exacerbated by the pandemic as well as volatility in the oil and gas markets. Our industrial businesses have seen a decline in volume due to the lack of capital investment from our customers. While we've seen the like-for-like replacement sales and these businesses hold up well because the critical nature of its components, the impact of the soft market impact that pandemic and delaying capital projects has led to broader declines. Our water business, while down year-over-year, has held up well as municipal projects have largely been continuing with some delays as municipalities have responded to critical needs of the communities that they serve. Similarly, agriculture has held up reasonably well, given a stronger spring season in U.S. and relatively optimistic demand from growers. In the Health & Science Technology segment, we've seen two bright spots coming from both the opportunities I discussed previously, as well as a strong rebound in the semiconductor market in 2020, which has largely been driven by demand for 5G products. We've seen semicon come out of the downward cycle that they had experienced over the past 18 months. On the other hand, analytical instrumentation, industrial and automotive markets have been impacted significantly. In AI, as the medical industry focused on COVID-19, other investments in lab equipment were delayed and we're just now seeing those investments start to pick up. Auto experience a wide ranging production shutdown significantly impacting our ceiling business. We expect some modest sequential improvement as we move into Q3, but expect these markets to remain challenged in the short, medium term. Moving to Fire & Safety/Diversified. We also saw the automotive and aerospace industry shutdown in the U.S., significantly impact our BAND-IT business. Additionally, we've seen lower capital spending globally impact our dispensing business as many customers are delaying replacement and upgrades, as they assess the pandemic's impact on their business. Our fire and rescue businesses, while countercyclical similar to other municipal businesses, so a non-committed capital projects pushed out due to municipalities prioritizing COVID-19 response and only engage in mandatory equipment purchases. Previously funded projects continue to go and demand for our new products and offerings and fire and rescue are partially offsetting these project delays. As I mentioned previously, we firmly believe in the strength of the IDEX business model. While there will be continued softness to some of our harder hit businesses our diversified end market offerings will mitigate the impact of some of the cyclical declines that we've experienced. Our investments in life sciences, pharma and municipal markets have helped provide countercyclical opportunities that we believe will continue to somewhat offset the weakness in these markets.  With that, let me stop here, and Bill, I'll turn it over to you for the financial results for the quarter. \nBill Grogan: Thanks, Andy. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on slide 11. Q2 orders of $522 million were down 17% overall and 18% organically. As Andy just mentioned, the slowdown in our industrial end markets, volatility in oil and gas, and the compounding impact of the pandemic saw year-over-year declines in most of our geographies and end markets. Pacing for the quarter seemed to bottom out in May, with April orders down 18%, May down 23% and June down 13%. Second quarter sales of $561 million were down 13% overall and 17% organically. While we were able to maintain operations effectively and avoided extended facility shutdowns, the interruption of automotive and transportation markets decreased CapEx spending in energy and general industrial and weakness in dispensing led to the organic sales declines. As mentioned before which are relative strengths from a bounce back in semicon and new applications we've developed in response to the pandemic.  Q2 adjusted gross margins declined 290 basis points to 42.6%, primarily driven by lower volume, the diluted impact of acquisitions and business mix, partially offset by strong price capture and cost actions, which I will detail out on the next slide. Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 21.1% down 340 basis points from prior year, mainly driven by lower volume leverage and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by a restructuring actions and discretionary cost controls. Our Q2 effective tax rate was 22.7%, which was higher than the 21.7% in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in the excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation. Second quarter adjusted net income was $84 million, resulting in EPS of $1.10 down, $0.40 or 27% compared to the prior year EPS. Finally, free cash flow was a record of $161 million for the quarter, up 36% compared to prior year period and was 193% of net income. The strong performance was result of significant focus and discipline on working capital management aided by federal tax payments pushed to the third quarter. The teams delever the balance sheet with the lower sales volume, primarily through collecting cash from our customers, past due AR was the lowest it's been in several years.  The reduction of receivables will stabilize with the sales volumes. So, we did not view this level of free cash flow performance sustainable going forward, but we are confident in our ability to drive cash flow conversion in excess of 100% of net income. Moving on to slide 12. As we discussed our Q1 earnings release, we dimensioned our cost structure and identified both discretionary structural cost actions we could take to help mitigate the impact of reduced volume. While our overall adjusted operating income declined $38 million in the quarter, we would have expected the $110 million organic sales decline to have a negative impact on operating income of $66 million and our robust 60% contribution margin rate. This $66 million was offset by $25 million in executed operational actions, $5 million from the impact of restructuring taken in the fourth quarter of 2019 combined with $15 million of discretionary cost controls taken in the quarter, along with $5 million of price and net productivity that was partially offset by negative product and business mix. To reconcile the $15 million of discretionary cost actions for you, we identified $120 million of actions we could take at revenue declines of 35% in our last call. The quarterly impact would have been $30 million with sales down 17%, roughly half of what our scenario depicted, our discretionary savings of $15 million is also about half of the target. While the teams did an excellent job in the second quarter mitigating a revenue decline, we saw the need to take additional restructuring actions in several businesses to rightsize their organizations for their new normal. The additional structural actions that were taken were focused in those businesses that we believe will be --will experience a longer term impact from the pandemic and underlying market softness. These businesses had to make some difficult decisions, but prudently responded to the existing economic circumstances while also supporting their long-term growth initiatives. These actions will provide another $10 million of annualized savings for us starting in the third quarter. Turning to slide 13 on liquidity. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months ending June 30 was $516 million or 138% of net income. As mentioned before, we continue to be well-positioned to weather the current environment. We expect to generate free cash flow in excess of net income as we focus on cost containment and working capital management. Cash and cash equivalence totaled $746 million at the end of the quarter. We also have full availability of our $800 million revolving credit facility. With cash on hand, available financing and conservative leverage, we are confident in our ability to continue to meet our obligations, fund operations and make critical investments in the business. We're addressed our prior 300 million 2020 notes during the quarter by issuing 500 million of 3% senior notes due in 2030, ensuring that we have adequate liquidity and capital as we pivot the offense. The proactive steps that we executed in the first half to enhance our focus on liquidity and working capital have resulted in record free cash flow for the quarter. And although, we are confident in our current position, we continue to actively monitor conditions with our customers and suppliers to ensure that we're able to react to any market condition. With that, I would like to turn it back over to Andy to summarize our Q3 expectations and provide some final thoughts.\nAndy Silvernail: Thanks, Bill. I'm on slide 14 folks. As I mentioned last quarter, we believe we will continue to operate in challenging environment. We do not anticipate the economic recovery from this unprecedented situation will be a straight line, and we expect that we will continue to see certain markets remain challenged, while others bounce back more quickly. The strength is in our business model and our people, and we will continue to make prudent decisions to navigate the environment effectively. We feel strongly that the actions we've taken to position in the company to weather the existing environment, but as importantly to rebound strongly as we come out of the other side. We remain well-structured from an operational, talent and financial perspective, but we acknowledged the challenges that we'll face across all of our business units, and we expect that the revenue in the third quarter will be down 12% to 17% organically. While we expect modest sequential growth from some markets that have started to recover, we know that some other markets will continue to be challenged. We're focused on balancing the need to take responsible cost control actions, while investing in areas that will allow us to recover quickly. We look forward to additional ways to play offense and deploy solutions that help in the fight and provide opportunities for us to generate long-term growth. To conclude, I'm extremely proud of how our employees have responded to this crisis. The teamwork that has been displayed as we rolled out evolving safety protocols responded quickly to volatile market conditions and ultimately deliver critical solutions for our customers is a testament to the mission and the values of our company and the great people who are central to the IDEX difference. While we have started to learn how to live and operate in this new world, there'll be further challenges that we face in the coming months. From what I've seen from our team, I have no doubt that we'll continue to meet and overcome these challenges as they come. With that, let me pause here, Melissa, and turn it over for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Mike Halloran with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Halloran: Hey, good morning, everyone. Hope everyone's doing well.\nAndy Silvernail: Hey, Mike.\nMike Halloran: So, let's start kind of where you left off there, Andy. Not a linear recovery from here, maybe some thoughts on how July has shaped up? What kind of assumptions are embedded as you think about the rest of the year and the type of curve or how you think things play out, and then maybe a little bit more timeframe the next year, year and a half? What's the organization planning for as it sits here? Obviously you guys are going to be positioned to be very fluid and be able to attack the problems or opportunities as they come, but what's the base case for improvement as you guys look at and how you're planning for things? \nAndy Silvernail: Thanks Mike. So, Mike, let me call it -- I'll break this into two parts to that answer. Let me tackle the short-term piece. So, let\u2019s take -- maybe kind of three parts, what's happening right now, what we expect the rest of the year, and as best you can starting to think a little bit about 2021 and the ultimate recovery. Look, short term, July has continued to improve, which is a good sign. So, we did all of our operating reviews here over the last week or so. And I would say pretty consistently across our businesses, we are seeing sequential improvement and that's what gives us confidence to believe that we did hit the bottom in May. You heard Bill talk about sequentially kind of what this looked like, and July is looking a lot like June, maybe even a little bit better than that. And so, barring another kind of global shutdown and/or major issues with this surge that we're seeing, I think we can expect to see this sequential improvement through the balance of the year. And I would guess that when we're talking 90 days from now, we're talking about guidance in the single digit to low-double-digit range on the top line. That's what I'm hopeful for, Mike. But to be clear, that is all with a big caveat of what's happening in the surge in the United States. And also we're seeing really what is a tragic situation in many parts of the emerging world. So, there is a big caveat around all of this. In terms of the longer-term recovery, I'm still very much where I have been since we talked in March on your conference call. And that said, we are going to be in bumpy territory until there is a vaccine. I really do believe that. Obviously, we're pretty close to some of the work that's being done here in our HST segment in particular. I think the news that is out there is good news on what we're seeing relative to the vaccine. But I think we're all learning real time that number one, these vaccines may not be effective. They may take longer -- I would say very optimistic scenarios that are out there right now, and the virus can mutate. And so, our current thinking is very much around, you start to see sequential improvement through the third and the fourth quarter, and I would expect the first quarter, and then you assume you get a vaccine sometime in the first part of the year that gets deployed throughout, I think that's when you start to see a much more aggressive acceleration.\nMike Halloran: No. No, that's helpful. And then, second piece on the M&A side, the prepared remarks, tough environment, but a little bit more optimistic.\nAndy Silvernail: Yeah.\nMike Halloran: A couple fold here. One, what is the approach you guys are taking in this environment at a high level? And two, what's driving the optimism behind the thought process?\nAndy Silvernail: Yeah. So, at a high level, it really is all about staying very close to your knitting. It's pretty hard to do a deal in this environment with something that is an adjacency that you don't know very well. And the reason for that is diligence is just a lot more challenging. We're involved in diligence in a couple of different deals right now. And one is a European based business. One is, is in the U.S. And you just -- it's just not like it was six months ago, you can't kind of physically get out there and do the stuff that you need to do in the way that you have in the past. And so, you've got to know your markets really well, and you've got to know the essential structure of that business and what you can do with that business pretty intimately in this environment. So that's kind of a high level. What we've seen here in the past 60 days is simply more deal flow. More -- people who we've talked to for years and years and years, and we've had relationships with been cultivating, there's more conversation to be had. If you recall one of the questions that was -- I was asked back, I think, on our last call was, how do you get confident? And I said, when you start to feel solid ground around cash flow, and I feel really good about understanding the trajectory of our cash flows. Obviously, we had a phenomenal cash flow quarter. We will get some benefit of more deleveraging in third and fourth quarter with inventory. And so, now I just -- I feel very, very good about our underlying cash flows. And then, therefore, our ability to predict what a business that is similar to us is going to do with these underlying cash flows. \nMike Halloran: So, could then you put that also in context of how you're balancing M&A, and then buybacks as we sit here today, pull back on buybacks because of the environment, not because of liquidity and/or maybe feel better about the M&A side, so a better place to put capital. Any thoughts there.\nAndy Silvernail: Yeah. So, let me answer that in two ways. So, first, we slowed down -- we suspended buybacks in the middle of the quarter or the beginning of the quarter, really. We bought pretty aggressively early on as the stock went down and then, with the -- just incredible uncertainty, we paused it. We did have 10b5-1 in place in the second quarter. And so, we're open to repurchase shares. So, that is -- there's no doubt about it. And we have plenty of both capital availability and authorization from our Board. So, we can do it there. As always Mike, we would much prefer to acquire, right? It builds a business strategically, allows us to compound capital. It creates opportunity for our people. And so that always remains the highest priority after fully funding our business. And so, we're going to continue to push there. Prices have basically remained the same for the most part. And so, the trade off in interest rates and some drop in cash flows because of the pandemic are kind of effectively balancing each other out in terms of valuation. And so, from an overall value perspective, we're kind of where we were six months ago.\nMike Halloran: Yeah. No, that makes a lot of sense. I appreciate the time.\nAndy Silvernail: Yeah. Thanks Mike. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nAndy Silvernail: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Andy, if you think back like a year and a half ago, we had investor meetings with you and we talked about what the playbook was in a normal recession. \nAndy Silvernail: Yeah. \nDeane Dray: So, like -- clearly, this is anything, but normal. But there's still a playbook that you're running and maybe just want to refresh us on this. So, when I look on slide 12, this is very telling, but just you could amplify a couple points for us. We see the part you cannot control and that's the near-term organic volume and we see what that dropped through is. Now, to the right, we get the total flow through after all of your cost cutting and there's a lot of strategy and what you're going to cut and how you're going to cut. So, the first question is -- that to the far right, the total flow through, is that an outcome or is that a target? So, that's -- and as you answer the question, addressed that. And then where are we in terms of how deep will you cut? How much of a growth opportunity are you protecting on the other side of this? Maybe we can start there.\nAndy Silvernail: Yeah, you bet. You bet. So, if you -- the way to think about this is from a playbook perspective, as you recall, we go into any given year with really a battle plan of what you do on the downside, right? So, you're building a contingency plan. And we executed on that. We viewed 2020 as having a relatively high likelihood for a mild recession, right? That's where we were in the fourth quarter of last year. And so we took $15 million to $20 million of actions. And you can see that sitting in that next line over FY 2019 cost actions, that's the $5 million that we got in the quarter around that. And then as you start moving over, we laid out for people a plan or scenario as things got really ugly at the end of last quarter, we laid that out saying, Hey, your business went down as much as 35%, there was $120 million of costs, that we could go after, call it discretionary or variable cost that we could go after, which obviously was very aggressive. And unfortunately got misinterpreted if we were going to execute that. And we had to clarify that with some people. And then another $40 million of call it breaks the glass, right? And so, as you start to move over to the right, we did execute about half of that discretionary. So, that's the $15 million that you got in the quarter. And then you keep moving over to the right end. We obviously -- a good mix of price productivity and acquisitions. And then we also decided, Deane, that we have number of businesses that we think are going to be challenged for considerably -- structurally the business is now different. And we did some incremental restructuring in the quarter. What I would tell you right now is there's a little bit left to do in the third quarter, based on where we are today. It's not a time, it's a little bit. And then assuming that the bottom doesn't fall out. We're in a very good spot right now. We don't have more to do, but we can, right? We've got -- we still got another half of that discretionary that we talked about, that's available. And that $40 million of break the glass, so to speak, we are doing a little bit of that in some businesses, but that is not ubiquitous across the IDEX.\nDeane Dray: That's real helpful. And if I can switch gears and go back to the side on the microfluidics. For a second there, I thought I was in a Danaher conference call. So just a couple of questions. \nAndy Silvernail: A lot of the same markets.\nDeane Dray: Yes, sir. A couple of questions here on the application. And then, broadly, are you seeing investments yet on this whole wave of the reassuring of the U.S. pharmaceutical production capacity? So, two questions. One, for this application on page eight, are you both in vaccine discovery and also vaccine production and then all the farmer reassuring? Are you seeing any of that? \nAndy Silvernail: Yeah. So the answer to your first question is yes and yes. Or A question and question B, it's yes and yes. \nDeane Dray: So production and discovery \u2026\nAndy Silvernail: And production.\nDeane Dray: \u2026 of the vaccine, and then eventually production, it gets used in both.\nAndy Silvernail: Well, so on the discovery piece of this, it's more in our life science business where we're playing in analytical instrumentation and biotech via sequencing. And if you -- this example here with a Microfluidizer, it is -- this is not new technology, so to speak being it's just now being brought to a scale that we've never seen before. And we're in a very unique position to be able to scale up a market leading technology and what is going to be an unbelievable boom in this business, right, around that. Because we're going to see lots of vaccines produced that actually never get used because all of the money that's flowing through that system. And so we are -- we've been a market leader here and will continue to be going forward.  Deane, I'm sorry. Can you repeat the second question?\nDeane Dray: Pharmaceutical reassuring?\nAndy Silvernail: Yeah. Yes. There is -- that is definitely happening to a degree. I think it's going to be slower than a lot of people think. It's not easy just to pick everything up. But we absolutely will play as that trend continues. And there will be certainly along some of the more sensitive areas. There's no doubt that that's happening. And we will benefit from that particularly in AI and our -- in our material process business, it will play a big role in that. And then to some degree in our analytical instrumentation and life sciences business.\nDeane Dray: That's real helpful. Thank you.\nAndy Silvernail: Thanks Deane. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Summerville: Thanks. This is just more of a geographic question. Can you give a little bit of color in the quarter around the 17% organic, what you experienced in North America versus Europe versus China? And then similarly, maybe at least, some qualification around directionally how's things progressed in the geographies as things shutdown and opened up during the quarter. Just maybe more color around order rates there in as well, if you could.\nAndy Silvernail: Yeah, sure. So, if you look at the geographic breakdown, the U.S. was a little bit worse. Europe was kind of right on, and an Asia was better. China was actually positive for the quarter, which was a good sign, but we really got hammered in India because it fundamentally just went to zero, right? I mean, there was some sales, but there was such a massive shutdown in India. And those are really the big markets that matter for us. In terms of how things flowed that -- those numbers that Bill gave you around the months that was pretty consistent around the world with what I would say is Asia getting better or China rather than getting better, faster. So that was kind of one anomaly relative to the other data. But then everything really has followed the reopening. So, as you've seen reopening, you've seen improvement as you've seen shutdowns. You've seen business follow suit very, very closely, so that that's kind of the best forward run to what's going to happen to a business is what's happening relative to -- business getting back to business or things being aggressively shutdown.\nMatt Summerville: You mentioned on the microfluidics type of opportunity, but it also sounds like you're stepping up growth investments elsewhere. Can you maybe frame some of those up? And are there -- is there any way to sort of size up the magnitude of potential opportunity here with what you're seeing?\nAndy Silvernail: Yeah. So, we've got some things that I'm going to call, they're not particularly high beta and we know how to do them today, meaning there's an application and we know how to do it. So, I'll give you an example in spraying technologies and compressors or in the continued global ventilator build-up, our gas business is playing in there. Those are pieces of business that are that are kind of happening today. And are -- you can see the path going forward. They may come down, but you know how to do it and the businesses is there. And those are the things that are in the -- those are over $10 million total that you're seeing, right? So, those are the kind of -- that's the kind of size we're talking about. These are big overall programs that are hitting and are very attractive. Then you've got some things, Matt, that are a lot more -- that a much higher beta. So, we are doing a bunch of work on some revolutionary testing protocols where we have some really interesting technology and a lot of money is flowing from the outside towards these things. And what I would say is they're either going to be very big, we're talking tens of millions or the technologies don't work and they don't turn into anything. So, there's just a -- there's a lot more volatility around new technologies that we're playing in kind of where the end market goes, how quickly does global testing capability ramp up? Because when you think about testing capability, it's not just COVID testing that we're talking about. There's a -- our thesis and I believe this is correct, as you're going to see a reset of global testing capacity, because you're going to -- no one wants to get caught with this again. And so, I think you're going to see a multiyear build-up of testing capacity. So, two very different types of things, but you're talking in the tens of millions depending upon the success in the commercial markets.\nMatt Summerville: Great. Thanks, Andy.\nAndy Silvernail: Thanks Matt. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, guys. Good morning.\nAndy Silvernail: Good morning.\nAllison Poliniak: Just want to build on Deane's question around that the playbook that you talked about. Obviously, the portfolio was quite stressed in the quarter, but as we moved to that playbook, did anything come to light in terms of a process, a business, or even a regional exposure that you're kind of questioning now that you might kind of go back and have to revisit once things stabilize here?\nAndy Silvernail: Do you mean a -- first, a business that became vulnerable or something like that? Is that what you mean, Allison?\nAllison Poliniak: Vulnerable or sort of the way you're doing business today that maybe you have to kind of rethink some of that process? Anything that came to light that was pretty unique as you kind of moved through the stress that we had this quarter. It might be an early question here because we're still going through it.\nAndy Silvernail: Yeah. So, I think a couple of things that regard, Allison. The first thing I'd say is I'm going to make a general statement, so not around any specific business, is our ability to work at a distance that we've just all proven that out, right? And I don't like the concept of everyone thinking that we should all work remotely from now. And I think that's a horrible idea. But the ability to intimately work with customers and suppliers at a distance with -- I would say, equal or better outcomes, is I think is going to change a lot of things. I think our ability to understand our customer better and at a more frequent clip, with the comfort level that everyone has now built with technology, I think that's actually a really big deal. And it's important for our business like ours, that so application centric, so the ability to understand the problem, the ability to serve, the ability to problem fix in vitro, I think that's actually pretty important. So, that's a big one. Second, I would say is, the blessing in the curse at times of an IDEX, right, are these very, very high contribution margins. And we love them and we don't want to -- we obviously don't want to give them up. But I think our ability to make some things more variable is important, Right? And so, I think in some of our businesses where the fixed cost is wonderful when you're ramping boy, when it turns the other way it can get painful. So, you've got a few businesses out there that I think over time, we're going to do -- want to do more work on can you make things more variable? Then I guess, I think maybe the last thing I'd say is, is I think everyone has been surprised or at least we have been surprised at what you think is fixed and what you think is variable. It's a lot more flexible than maybe people had their head around. And if you just told me a year ago that we could do what we've done with our cost structure, I'm not sure I would have believed it Allison, to be candid with you. And I think we've demonstrated to ourselves our ability to do that. And I think going forward, how do you keep those lessons learned, and make sure that we have as dynamic a P&L and balance sheet as we can both on the upside and the downside.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Great color. Thanks. And then, I guess, just a question on the municipal facing markets. Obviously, you said you saw some pressure with rescue and fire, water was holding and better. Have you -- with talking to those customers, is there a concern that as we head into 2021 that there could be incremental pressure on those? Obviously, we're seeing the news every day about various cities and municipalities becoming under financial strain, how are you viewing that market -- those markets? And is this something that you would anticipate some level of government funding coming in at some point?\nAndy Silvernail: Yeah. So, I think -- look, if you went back and looked at the financial crisis from 12 years ago, the municipal businesses held up well, and then 18 months or so later you saw the suffering. And I think -- I don't think it's going to take 18 months this time because I think everybody has learned how to react more quickly. And I do expect there to be a whole around municipal budgets, globally. And then I think what will happen is you are likely to get a -- some kind of step in, in terms of federal funding again -- or sovereign funding from governments because some of the stuff that's being delayed right now, because they're moving people and money to COVID related things, it's going to create actually a demand hole going into -- excuse me -- it's going to create a hole that you're going to have to fill with demand next year. And so, there's a little bit of compound and it's going to happen here. So, I do think that it will be -- I do think you'll see a hole here over the next 12 to 24 months. I think it's likely that you'll have some level of federal funding that will step in. But I think either way there will be a negative comp as you think about the next year or two.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thanks. That's helpful. Thank you.\nAndy Silvernail: Thanks, Allison.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please proceed with your question. \nNathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.\nAndy Silvernail: Hi, Nathan.\nNathan Jones: I'd like to go back to slide 12 as well. And I'm going to ask you a few questions about what that might look like when we change it to Q3. Your FY 2019 cost actions should still have five on that bar.\nAndy Silvernail: Yeah.\nNathan Jones: You said you have got about half of the discretionary costs out. So, if you got this discretionary cost bar be 30 in Q3, or should it be some number between 15 and 30?\nAndy Silvernail: No. I'm sorry, Nathan, if there's any confusion on that. The 30 is what would have happened if we had seen our business go down by 35%, right? So, in the quarter, our business was down about 17% organically. And so that -- so we went after about half of that discretionary. So just to make sure everyone on the phone understands exactly what we're talking about. If you went back to our presentation in the -- after the first quarter, the $120 million that we outlined was a cost that we could potentially take out based on 35% volume decrease, we've had about half of that. So, it got to about half of the discretionary. That's what that 15 is. So, if you think about the third quarter, I would expect something around the 15, but again, volume dependent. So, if we do -- if we end up kind of closer to the 12, maybe that number is a little bit lower, but I think the 15 is probably a good number. Bill, would you concur with that?\nBill Grogan: Yeah. I agree. It will be pretty close to 15 next quarter, plus or minus.\nAndy Silvernail: Yeah.\nNathan Jones: Got it. And then, the price productivity and make should be roughly the same. Maybe it's a little lower. I mean, I know you've talked about maybe less than a point of price this year, so maybe that's four or five, something like that. And then we have other 2.5 from the structural cost actions that you've taken in 2Q.\nBill Grogan: Correct.\nAndy Silvernail: Yeah.\nNathan Jones: Okay. So, your organic flow through numbers probably going to be something like -- maybe a 35 or something like that by the time we get to the end of Q3?\nBill Grogan: That was in that ballpark.\nAndy Silvernail: Yeah. I think, that\u2019s -- yes, in the ballpark.\nNathan Jones: Okay. Then the next question I wanted to ask is on this overall like 12 to 17 organic guide. Clearly, you had the lowest order number in May. You turn your inventory about every six weeks. So, you should have basically worked through that already. If not -- in the early part of July you go to 3.8 year comp year-over-year, we've talked about things getting sequentially a little bit better. Maybe you can talk about what would have to happen to be at the low end at that 17, that would seem to be -- you'd have to say some kind of disruption in supply chains or shutdowns or something like that to be at minus 17. And maybe what you would need to say in order to get better than that minus 12. Because it looks to me at the moment, like you should be trending at least towards the better end of that range rather than the worst end.\nAndy Silvernail: Yeah. The answer to this question is really straightforward, Nathan. I think to be at the bottom end of that means that the negative 17, it would have to -- they have to look like this past quarter effectively, right, in terms of how that bumped along. And to be better than the 12, which obviously I don't see right now because we just -- there's no evidence to that. And we did take down backlog in the quarter. I think you'd have to see more sequential improvement. That's why that 12 to 17 feels -- really feels right. But I can see a scenario -- there's a potential scenario with that gets a little bit better. And less the scenario where it gets worse and it's worse than the 17 is we get a massive shutdown. And one of the things to keep in mind here also is you're seeing a surge in cases in the U.S. Obviously, Europe has done significantly better at managing this than the U.S. has. So, there's a lot of uncertainty there. And then, frankly, this presidential election is just starting to kick off. And I think it's -- it brings an awful lot of uncertainty into the world. And so, this is probably going to be the nastiest presidential election in that we've seen in our modern history. And it's going to cause an awful lot of volatility that I'm concerned about that. So, those are two things that could make it worse. But I don't see that at this point. I don't see it worse than the 17.\nNathan Jones: I know you guys plan for the worst and hope for the best. One last one. Would you expect to burn backlog during the third quarter, or relatively stable?\nAndy Silvernail: Bill, what do you think there?\nBill Grogan: Yeah, relatively stable.\nNathan Jones: Okay. Thanks very much for your time.\nAndy Silvernail: Thanks, Nathan. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Graham: Can you hear me?\nAndy Silvernail: Sure, can Scott. Good morning.\nScott Graham: Hey, good morning. I have several questions around the guidance as well. First of all, maybe go back to the second quarter guidance, which was minus 15 to 25. And you did a minus 17, so you sort of came on the better end of that. What surprised you versus the midpoint in the quarter?\nAndy Silvernail: Yeah. So, you remember when we gave that guidance, the world was just starting to unwind. And frankly, it was very hard to understand what that downside could be. We felt like we could very easily understand what it took to get to 15. We felt like it was very hard to understand what was coming relative to the low end of those expectations. So, it was -- we were definitely in a world 90 days ago that our ability to call the top line was significantly worse than our ability right now. There's still volatility in our businesses, but you are seeing -- if you look across our key industrial businesses, you are seeing the flattening of the order rates, which is a great sign. As you know, we keep a very close watch on our short cycle businesses. They tend to tell us a lot. The volatility that existed 90 days ago has definitely come down substantially in day rates.  And so, we feel a lot better around calling this range. So, we had a 10 point range at the end of last quarter, and we've now shrunk that down to a five point range. And typically, right, we're a two point range, one to two. And so, I think our ability to call things is getting much better and assuming that this trend continues and we don't get a massive disruption, I think you'll see us be able to keep tightening that range as we get 90 days from now.\nScott Graham: Okay.\nBill Grogan: The only thing I'd add to that, I think there was a -- there's the commercial variability, but then there was the unknown operational uptime and supply chain uptime where I think we got more comfortable with those two aspects that helped us narrow the range. And the things that Andy identified as potential risks within the quarter, kind of give us the range that we have now.\nAndy Silvernail: Right\nScott Graham: No. I get that, I guess. And in Andy's answer, it sounds to me like the third quarter guidance you feel better about -- sort of it's a little bit more scientific than the second quarter guidance. I guess, to that same end, I would maybe wonder why -- if you're thinking the things improving sequentially, it just seems like if you just did a minus 17 and what I think most of us thought was going to be the worst quarter in the history of history. Things bottomed out in May. I guess, I'm still -- I'm still not quite sure how -- there's even a 17 organic in that guidance. I mean, what's your caution here on that number?\nAndy Silvernail: Well, look, here a couple of things. We have a one and a half data points, meaning we have the month of June and we have part of July for things sequentially getting better. And I think that if what we're seeing right now holds that negative 12 feels right, right? So -- and that would be sequentially better. If -- the downside, the 17 is -- if you see some kind of significant issue around, again, the surge that we're seeing in the United States, just remember the actual numbers are worse today than they were when we were all panicked, right? The actual data is worse and -- in the United States in particular. And we're now just starting to see the effects in the emerging world. So the 17 is basically saying that things backslide substantially and they -- and they look like they actually did in the second quarter. Now, remember when we were sitting here at 90 days ago, none of us had any idea what the real downside scenario was. And I do feel like we've been able to bracket that and understand that in a much better way, Scott, that gives me confidence in that 12 to 17. I have a lot more confidence in the 12 to 17 than I did in the 15 to 25. A lot more confidence.\nScott Graham: Yes. It sounds like that. And so just two other quick follow-ups. Number one, let's just look at the minus 12 or let's us look at the midpoint of the 3Q guidance. Which of the markets, the end markets on that really cool page with the -- I think it's on page 12. Yeah. No, not page 12, nine. Which of the markets there -- which of the markets or the swing factors that gets you better? Could you tell us that?\nAndy Silvernail: You're talking about the checkerboard slide, Scott?\nScott Graham: Yeah.\nAndy Silvernail: Yeah. So I think -- look, the things that have the most volatility and then right now are in FMT and diversified. And so the -- if you look at where the negative volatility has been, it's really been dominated around general industrial and then things that are touching transportation effectively, right, and oil and gas obviously, we -- that's kind of a different animal exacerbated by all of this. I think that the general industrial bottoming and starting to improve is what would drive a better outcome. And I would also say that is the most vulnerable to a second downtick. So, there's going to be the most volatility around industrial, chemical. Those two stand out to me.  And then I'd put dispensing, if you go over to Fire & Safety, dispensing and automotive, and dispensing is a little bit different animal, because there's actually something interesting happening there, which is on the consumer side of dispensing that business is actually booming, meaning that if you look at the big box retailers and the folks who are selling paint, that business is actually booming, but they're just not buying, because they're pushing up their capital spend. Where I would say on the industrial side, it's actually -- it's more correlated with what's actually happening in the markets. But you could definitely see a meaningful uptick in dispensing if people get more confidence. And then certainly around transportation, auto is starting to come back, which is a great sign. Clearly, aerospace is a different issue in our BAND-IT business, which is great mix for us, has had some negatives relative to transportation, specifically aerospace.\nScott Graham: That's hugely helpful. Would you mind if I just snuck one more question here for Bill? So, I guess, I was a little bit curious about the break the glass, $40 million potential. I'm assuming that that's a structural cost reduction number for potential. And I'm wondering why it's not a larger number than that.\nBill Grogan: Well, I mean, it's compounding on $20 million of actions we took in Q4. So, if you look at that total bucket, that'd be $60 million.\nScott Graham: 40 is potential, I thought you said. I'm just trying to understand like it, if that structural -- and if it's not, please tell me -- if that's structural, it would seem like there is -- would be -- what does that number exactly break the glass?\nAndy Silvernail: You're taking out is the fundamental fixed cost of the business, which is facilities and people, right? That is a -- that's a really big number. And just to give you a sense of it, right, when we laid out the $15 million to $20 million last year, that was a sizeable number and meaningful, but again, kind of structured around a -- what we thought might be a mild recession. But to give you some sense of it in 2008, 2009, Bill, I can't remember -- I want to say we took out $40 million total during that\u2026\nBill Grogan: A little bit less, but around there.\nAndy Silvernail: And that was total, Scott, including discretionary, right? And right now, we are at a total run rate. Bill, is at $90 million. Is that the number?\nBill Grogan: Yeah. If you add in the discretionary, correct.\nAndy Silvernail: Yeah.\nBill Grogan: Yeah. I mean, again, the discretionary will ramp down as sales improve. So that would assume kind of the current run rate revenue decline.\nAndy Silvernail: Yeah. So we have been hugely aggressive around cost out.\nScott Graham: Well, frame that way. I understand it better. Thanks a lot, guys.\nAndy Silvernail: Yeah. Thanks. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from line of Joe Giordano with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning. This is Robert in for Joe.\nAndy Silvernail: Hi, Robert.\nUnidentified Analyst: Just wanted to turn back -- hey, good morning. Just wanted to turn back to M&A, real quick. I know this is kind of a very strange downturn that we're seeing right here with economics of companies that might've gone down dramatically, but the price of the businesses that they're trying to sell have not. So, just wondering what you're seeing in terms of valuation and how people are thinking about like selling their companies and what price days, or just kind of how you're thinking about that situation?\nAndy Silvernail: Yeah. If you just kind of look at the general math, what I would say is that the -- when you balance off the cash earnings decline that we're seeing in target relative to the drop in interest rates, when you actually kind of do the math on valuations, it actually neutralizes pretty close, Robert, with some gap to an increase in an aggregate valuation on a cash flow basis, a little bit. But they do offset pretty closely. So, look, people have not changed their expectations on valuation that has definitely not happened. The down stroke was too brief. The public markets came back so aggressively that private sellers -- they tend to build their expectations off of public markets. And so, at least anyone who's sophisticated. And so, look, the valuation expectations have stayed elevated. \nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. That\u2019s great. Thanks very much. I'll pass it along.\nAndy Silvernail: Thanks, Robert.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Silvernail now for any final comments.\nAndy Silvernail: Thank you very much. Well, thank you everybody for your time here and your patients and understanding what's happening in the world. Obviously, we're all experiencing this together. And two things that I asked you to kind of take away. Number one, the mission of this company and the values of this company have been tested. And I think everybody has been tested. And I am just incredibly proud of how all the people across IDEX have responded to this. They have responded with compassion. They have responded with action. They have responded with discipline and prudence. And it's just -- it really warms your heart as a leader to see those values, not only stick, but deepen in a moment like this. Second, back -- over the last few years, I've talked about what happens to a company like ours in difficult times. And one of the things that I have been very proud about is that our ability to maintain cash earnings in difficult times. I have always claimed that that's something that we could do certainly over a shorter period, say a given year. And I think what you see here in the second quarter is exactly that, right? We had an incredible cash flow performance. And if you think of it as from a cash, EPS standpoint, that's really impressive. And as we go through the rest of the year, obviously, we won't have the same opportunity with AR that we had here in the last quarter, but we will with inventory. And I expect us when we look back on this year, obviously, we'll all think about this and the difficulty that we had. But I think it will show once again, the durability of a company like IDEX and the business model that this company has. And I think it\u2019s really something else. And I'm really -- it's a pleasure for me to have the ability to lead this business. So, with that, I'll thank you all for attending and look forward to talking to you all here over the next 90 days. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Bill Grogan",
            "content": "Thanks, Andy. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on slide 11. Q2 orders of $522 million were down 17% overall and 18% organically. As Andy just mentioned, the slowdown in our industrial end markets, volatility in oil and gas, and the compounding impact of the pandemic saw year-over-year declines in most of our geographies and end markets. Pacing for the quarter seemed to bottom out in May, with April orders down 18%, May down 23% and June down 13%. Second quarter sales of $561 million were down 13% overall and 17% organically. While we were able to maintain operations effectively and avoided extended facility shutdowns, the interruption of automotive and transportation markets decreased CapEx spending in energy and general industrial and weakness in dispensing led to the organic sales declines. As mentioned before which are relative strengths from a bounce back in semicon and new applications we've developed in response to the pandemic.  Q2 adjusted gross margins declined 290 basis points to 42.6%, primarily driven by lower volume, the diluted impact of acquisitions and business mix, partially offset by strong price capture and cost actions, which I will detail out on the next slide. Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 21.1% down 340 basis points from prior year, mainly driven by lower volume leverage and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by a restructuring actions and discretionary cost controls. Our Q2 effective tax rate was 22.7%, which was higher than the 21.7% in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in the excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation. Second quarter adjusted net income was $84 million, resulting in EPS of $1.10 down, $0.40 or 27% compared to the prior year EPS. Finally, free cash flow was a record of $161 million for the quarter, up 36% compared to prior year period and was 193% of net income. The strong performance was result of significant focus and discipline on working capital management aided by federal tax payments pushed to the third quarter. The teams delever the balance sheet with the lower sales volume, primarily through collecting cash from our customers, past due AR was the lowest it's been in several years.  The reduction of receivables will stabilize with the sales volumes. So, we did not view this level of free cash flow performance sustainable going forward, but we are confident in our ability to drive cash flow conversion in excess of 100% of net income. Moving on to slide 12. As we discussed our Q1 earnings release, we dimensioned our cost structure and identified both discretionary structural cost actions we could take to help mitigate the impact of reduced volume. While our overall adjusted operating income declined $38 million in the quarter, we would have expected the $110 million organic sales decline to have a negative impact on operating income of $66 million and our robust 60% contribution margin rate. This $66 million was offset by $25 million in executed operational actions, $5 million from the impact of restructuring taken in the fourth quarter of 2019 combined with $15 million of discretionary cost controls taken in the quarter, along with $5 million of price and net productivity that was partially offset by negative product and business mix. To reconcile the $15 million of discretionary cost actions for you, we identified $120 million of actions we could take at revenue declines of 35% in our last call. The quarterly impact would have been $30 million with sales down 17%, roughly half of what our scenario depicted, our discretionary savings of $15 million is also about half of the target. While the teams did an excellent job in the second quarter mitigating a revenue decline, we saw the need to take additional restructuring actions in several businesses to rightsize their organizations for their new normal. The additional structural actions that were taken were focused in those businesses that we believe will be --will experience a longer term impact from the pandemic and underlying market softness. These businesses had to make some difficult decisions, but prudently responded to the existing economic circumstances while also supporting their long-term growth initiatives. These actions will provide another $10 million of annualized savings for us starting in the third quarter. Turning to slide 13 on liquidity. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months ending June 30 was $516 million or 138% of net income. As mentioned before, we continue to be well-positioned to weather the current environment. We expect to generate free cash flow in excess of net income as we focus on cost containment and working capital management. Cash and cash equivalence totaled $746 million at the end of the quarter. We also have full availability of our $800 million revolving credit facility. With cash on hand, available financing and conservative leverage, we are confident in our ability to continue to meet our obligations, fund operations and make critical investments in the business. We're addressed our prior 300 million 2020 notes during the quarter by issuing 500 million of 3% senior notes due in 2030, ensuring that we have adequate liquidity and capital as we pivot the offense. The proactive steps that we executed in the first half to enhance our focus on liquidity and working capital have resulted in record free cash flow for the quarter. And although, we are confident in our current position, we continue to actively monitor conditions with our customers and suppliers to ensure that we're able to react to any market condition. With that, I would like to turn it back over to Andy to summarize our Q3 expectations and provide some final thoughts. Yeah. I agree. It will be pretty close to 15 next quarter, plus or minus. Correct. That was in that ballpark. Yeah, relatively stable. The only thing I'd add to that, I think there was a -- there's the commercial variability, but then there was the unknown operational uptime and supply chain uptime where I think we got more comfortable with those two aspects that helped us narrow the range. And the things that Andy identified as potential risks within the quarter, kind of give us the range that we have now. Well, I mean, it's compounding on $20 million of actions we took in Q4. So, if you look at that total bucket, that'd be $60 million. A little bit less, but around there. Yeah. If you add in the discretionary, correct. Yeah. I mean, again, the discretionary will ramp down as sales improve. So that would assume kind of the current run rate revenue decline."

            "name": "Andy Silvernail",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. I want to start by thanking all the people across IDEX. They've really stepped up with the challenges that COVID-19 has presented and have embraced the evolving protocols along the way. As COVID-19 has impacted families globally, we've not been spared loss here at IDEX, and I want to make sure that all of our teams know how proud we are of their contributions. In a crisis, especially one as devastating as this, your true values are exposed and the culture that we've built at IDEX is stronger than ever. We continue to supply our customers with critically enabling products across the globe, meeting their challenging demands, and partnering with them to rapidly support and develop innovative new products to battle COVID-19. I'm going to share one of those examples here in a few minutes. Our businesses continue to deliver during this pandemic. With our internal safety protocols and resilient supply chain, we've been able to deliver products with limited interruptions. When issues have arisen, the teams have been able to react quickly and mitigate the impact on our business and customers. While we have experienced significant sales increases, our balanced end market exposure and mission critical product offerings have limited these declines. The diversification into various life sciences, pharma, and municipal applications have lessened than the more cyclical declines in energy and general industrial end markets. Also, our operating and finance teams across the globe did an excellent job of deleveraging the balance sheet and helping to drive record second quarter free cash flow. We converted at 193% of adjusted net income.  Finally, we've continue to be proactive on mitigating the bottom line impact from the historical economic dislocation created by the virus. We've ramped down all non-essential expenses to mitigate our organic decrementals at less than 40%. We're leveraging and restructuring actions that we took in 2019, along with new actions that were required in several of our businesses that we'll see more prolonged volume impacts. As these organizations right size for the new normal, we've increased investments in several other businesses to capitalize on several short-term COVID-19 opportunities, as well as invest in projects that will support our longer-term growth. We've made -- we've made swift and smart decisions to keep our people safe, keep our business moving, and ensure our financial performance making sure that we do everything we can to help win the COVID-19 fight. Turning to slide seven. We outlined four key strategies to operate in the COVID-19 world in early March. Focusing on this framework has been a key part of our ability to perform across our businesses. From a safety perspective, protecting our teams as we remain open has been our priority. The standards we've implemented globally have been effective in keeping operations consistently running with minimal work stoppages across our facilities. We've evolved our protocols and have implemented mandatory face coverings in all of our facilities to protect our employees and limit the spread of COVID-19. As I mentioned earlier, our operations and supply chain team have done an excellent job ensuring business continuity. We continue to improve our operational preparedness and bolster our supply chain with plans to help avoid business disruptions. We anticipate continued volatility in the months ahead, and the dynamic planning support structure we've built should serve our businesses well. Our actions in the second quarter have minimized any concerns we have with liquidity. We issued $500 million of new bonds to pay off our 2020 notes and bolster our cash position. We had record second quarter cash flow, and we have $746 million of cash on our balance sheet and full capacity on our revolver. The efforts of our teams have put us in great financial position, and we have more than enough capital to fund all of our operational needs due to the pandemic as well as position us to take advantage of other capital deployment opportunities. Lastly, our leaders are spending more time playing offense. Our teams continue to innovate and bring new products to market that capture short-term opportunities, but also lever our portfolio to capitalize on longer-term secular trends that are evolving as a result of pandemic, particularly around testing for viruses and antibodies as well as the creation of a vaccine. I would go into more detail on more of those opportunities here in minute. We also see the M&A markets open up with more deals starting to come through. While it's still going to be a challenging year from an M&A perspective, we're more optimistic in our ability to get a deal done than we were 90 days ago. With that update on the status of the COVID-19 playbook, I'd like to spend a few minutes walking you through one of the products that's a critical technology in the mass production of vaccines. I'm on slide eight. In the HST segment, products from our microfluidics product line within our Materials Processing Technologies' business are keys to help bring a vaccine for COVID-19 to market. Our Microfluidizer processors are key technology used to manufacture the vaccine adjuvants required for several of the vaccine trials. Vaccine adjuvants are immune stimulators added to many vaccines commonly used today. By using an adjuvant in a vaccine, the body can produce a better immune response to the antigen with the germ, while also allowing vaccine manufacturers to be able to produce more doses of vaccine with less antigen.  In addition to vaccine adjuvants, Microfluidizer processors can be used to manufacture lipid nanoparticles, that are key ingredients with a new mRNA style vaccines currently in the pipeline. The team at MPT has done a fantastic job responding to the increasing demands in the market for COVID-19 vaccine testing and preproduction, and has quickly aligned priorities to meet this market need and participate in the fight against the pandemic. This highlights just one of the ways IDEX businesses have answered the call and wholeheartedly embraced our mission of trusted solutions improving lives. We're moving now to slide nine. We've outlined here how we're seeing the current environment impact our primary end markets. In our Fluid & Metering Technology segment, we've seen a broader industrial softness that we called out at the end of 2019, become exacerbated by the pandemic as well as volatility in the oil and gas markets. Our industrial businesses have seen a decline in volume due to the lack of capital investment from our customers. While we've seen the like-for-like replacement sales and these businesses hold up well because the critical nature of its components, the impact of the soft market impact that pandemic and delaying capital projects has led to broader declines. Our water business, while down year-over-year, has held up well as municipal projects have largely been continuing with some delays as municipalities have responded to critical needs of the communities that they serve. Similarly, agriculture has held up reasonably well, given a stronger spring season in U.S. and relatively optimistic demand from growers. In the Health & Science Technology segment, we've seen two bright spots coming from both the opportunities I discussed previously, as well as a strong rebound in the semiconductor market in 2020, which has largely been driven by demand for 5G products. We've seen semicon come out of the downward cycle that they had experienced over the past 18 months. On the other hand, analytical instrumentation, industrial and automotive markets have been impacted significantly. In AI, as the medical industry focused on COVID-19, other investments in lab equipment were delayed and we're just now seeing those investments start to pick up. Auto experience a wide ranging production shutdown significantly impacting our ceiling business. We expect some modest sequential improvement as we move into Q3, but expect these markets to remain challenged in the short, medium term. Moving to Fire & Safety/Diversified. We also saw the automotive and aerospace industry shutdown in the U.S., significantly impact our BAND-IT business. Additionally, we've seen lower capital spending globally impact our dispensing business as many customers are delaying replacement and upgrades, as they assess the pandemic's impact on their business. Our fire and rescue businesses, while countercyclical similar to other municipal businesses, so a non-committed capital projects pushed out due to municipalities prioritizing COVID-19 response and only engage in mandatory equipment purchases. Previously funded projects continue to go and demand for our new products and offerings and fire and rescue are partially offsetting these project delays. As I mentioned previously, we firmly believe in the strength of the IDEX business model. While there will be continued softness to some of our harder hit businesses our diversified end market offerings will mitigate the impact of some of the cyclical declines that we've experienced. Our investments in life sciences, pharma and municipal markets have helped provide countercyclical opportunities that we believe will continue to somewhat offset the weakness in these markets.  With that, let me stop here, and Bill, I'll turn it over to you for the financial results for the quarter. Thanks, Bill. I'm on slide 14 folks. As I mentioned last quarter, we believe we will continue to operate in challenging environment. We do not anticipate the economic recovery from this unprecedented situation will be a straight line, and we expect that we will continue to see certain markets remain challenged, while others bounce back more quickly. The strength is in our business model and our people, and we will continue to make prudent decisions to navigate the environment effectively. We feel strongly that the actions we've taken to position in the company to weather the existing environment, but as importantly to rebound strongly as we come out of the other side. We remain well-structured from an operational, talent and financial perspective, but we acknowledged the challenges that we'll face across all of our business units, and we expect that the revenue in the third quarter will be down 12% to 17% organically. While we expect modest sequential growth from some markets that have started to recover, we know that some other markets will continue to be challenged. We're focused on balancing the need to take responsible cost control actions, while investing in areas that will allow us to recover quickly. We look forward to additional ways to play offense and deploy solutions that help in the fight and provide opportunities for us to generate long-term growth. To conclude, I'm extremely proud of how our employees have responded to this crisis. The teamwork that has been displayed as we rolled out evolving safety protocols responded quickly to volatile market conditions and ultimately deliver critical solutions for our customers is a testament to the mission and the values of our company and the great people who are central to the IDEX difference. While we have started to learn how to live and operate in this new world, there'll be further challenges that we face in the coming months. From what I've seen from our team, I have no doubt that we'll continue to meet and overcome these challenges as they come. With that, let me pause here, Melissa, and turn it over for questions. Hey, Mike. Thanks Mike. So, Mike, let me call it -- I'll break this into two parts to that answer. Let me tackle the short-term piece. So, let's take -- maybe kind of three parts, what's happening right now, what we expect the rest of the year, and as best you can starting to think a little bit about 2021 and the ultimate recovery. Look, short term, July has continued to improve, which is a good sign. So, we did all of our operating reviews here over the last week or so. And I would say pretty consistently across our businesses, we are seeing sequential improvement and that's what gives us confidence to believe that we did hit the bottom in May. You heard Bill talk about sequentially kind of what this looked like, and July is looking a lot like June, maybe even a little bit better than that. And so, barring another kind of global shutdown and/or major issues with this surge that we're seeing, I think we can expect to see this sequential improvement through the balance of the year. And I would guess that when we're talking 90 days from now, we're talking about guidance in the single digit to low-double-digit range on the top line. That's what I'm hopeful for, Mike. But to be clear, that is all with a big caveat of what's happening in the surge in the United States. And also we're seeing really what is a tragic situation in many parts of the emerging world. So, there is a big caveat around all of this. In terms of the longer-term recovery, I'm still very much where I have been since we talked in March on your conference call. And that said, we are going to be in bumpy territory until there is a vaccine. I really do believe that. Obviously, we're pretty close to some of the work that's being done here in our HST segment in particular. I think the news that is out there is good news on what we're seeing relative to the vaccine. But I think we're all learning real time that number one, these vaccines may not be effective. They may take longer -- I would say very optimistic scenarios that are out there right now, and the virus can mutate. And so, our current thinking is very much around, you start to see sequential improvement through the third and the fourth quarter, and I would expect the first quarter, and then you assume you get a vaccine sometime in the first part of the year that gets deployed throughout, I think that's when you start to see a much more aggressive acceleration. Yeah. Yeah. So, at a high level, it really is all about staying very close to your knitting. It's pretty hard to do a deal in this environment with something that is an adjacency that you don't know very well. And the reason for that is diligence is just a lot more challenging. We're involved in diligence in a couple of different deals right now. And one is a European based business. One is, is in the U.S. And you just -- it's just not like it was six months ago, you can't kind of physically get out there and do the stuff that you need to do in the way that you have in the past. And so, you've got to know your markets really well, and you've got to know the essential structure of that business and what you can do with that business pretty intimately in this environment. So that's kind of a high level. What we've seen here in the past 60 days is simply more deal flow. More -- people who we've talked to for years and years and years, and we've had relationships with been cultivating, there's more conversation to be had. If you recall one of the questions that was -- I was asked back, I think, on our last call was, how do you get confident? And I said, when you start to feel solid ground around cash flow, and I feel really good about understanding the trajectory of our cash flows. Obviously, we had a phenomenal cash flow quarter. We will get some benefit of more deleveraging in third and fourth quarter with inventory. And so, now I just -- I feel very, very good about our underlying cash flows. And then, therefore, our ability to predict what a business that is similar to us is going to do with these underlying cash flows. Yeah. So, let me answer that in two ways. So, first, we slowed down -- we suspended buybacks in the middle of the quarter or the beginning of the quarter, really. We bought pretty aggressively early on as the stock went down and then, with the -- just incredible uncertainty, we paused it. We did have 10b5-1 in place in the second quarter. And so, we're open to repurchase shares. So, that is -- there's no doubt about it. And we have plenty of both capital availability and authorization from our Board. So, we can do it there. As always Mike, we would much prefer to acquire, right? It builds a business strategically, allows us to compound capital. It creates opportunity for our people. And so that always remains the highest priority after fully funding our business. And so, we're going to continue to push there. Prices have basically remained the same for the most part. And so, the trade off in interest rates and some drop in cash flows because of the pandemic are kind of effectively balancing each other out in terms of valuation. And so, from an overall value perspective, we're kind of where we were six months ago. Yeah. Thanks Mike. Good morning, Deane. Yeah. Yeah, you bet. You bet. So, if you -- the way to think about this is from a playbook perspective, as you recall, we go into any given year with really a battle plan of what you do on the downside, right? So, you're building a contingency plan. And we executed on that. We viewed 2020 as having a relatively high likelihood for a mild recession, right? That's where we were in the fourth quarter of last year. And so we took $15 million to $20 million of actions. And you can see that sitting in that next line over FY 2019 cost actions, that's the $5 million that we got in the quarter around that. And then as you start moving over, we laid out for people a plan or scenario as things got really ugly at the end of last quarter, we laid that out saying, Hey, your business went down as much as 35%, there was $120 million of costs, that we could go after, call it discretionary or variable cost that we could go after, which obviously was very aggressive. And unfortunately got misinterpreted if we were going to execute that. And we had to clarify that with some people. And then another $40 million of call it breaks the glass, right? And so, as you start to move over to the right, we did execute about half of that discretionary. So, that's the $15 million that you got in the quarter. And then you keep moving over to the right end. We obviously -- a good mix of price productivity and acquisitions. And then we also decided, Deane, that we have number of businesses that we think are going to be challenged for considerably -- structurally the business is now different. And we did some incremental restructuring in the quarter. What I would tell you right now is there's a little bit left to do in the third quarter, based on where we are today. It's not a time, it's a little bit. And then assuming that the bottom doesn't fall out. We're in a very good spot right now. We don't have more to do, but we can, right? We've got -- we still got another half of that discretionary that we talked about, that's available. And that $40 million of break the glass, so to speak, we are doing a little bit of that in some businesses, but that is not ubiquitous across the IDEX. A lot of the same markets. Yeah. So the answer to your first question is yes and yes. Or A question and question B, it's yes and yes. And production. Well, so on the discovery piece of this, it's more in our life science business where we're playing in analytical instrumentation and biotech via sequencing. And if you -- this example here with a Microfluidizer, it is -- this is not new technology, so to speak being it's just now being brought to a scale that we've never seen before. And we're in a very unique position to be able to scale up a market leading technology and what is going to be an unbelievable boom in this business, right, around that. Because we're going to see lots of vaccines produced that actually never get used because all of the money that's flowing through that system. And so we are -- we've been a market leader here and will continue to be going forward.  Deane, I'm sorry. Can you repeat the second question? Yeah. Yes. There is -- that is definitely happening to a degree. I think it's going to be slower than a lot of people think. It's not easy just to pick everything up. But we absolutely will play as that trend continues. And there will be certainly along some of the more sensitive areas. There's no doubt that that's happening. And we will benefit from that particularly in AI and our -- in our material process business, it will play a big role in that. And then to some degree in our analytical instrumentation and life sciences business. Thanks Deane. Yeah, sure. So, if you look at the geographic breakdown, the U.S. was a little bit worse. Europe was kind of right on, and an Asia was better. China was actually positive for the quarter, which was a good sign, but we really got hammered in India because it fundamentally just went to zero, right? I mean, there was some sales, but there was such a massive shutdown in India. And those are really the big markets that matter for us. In terms of how things flowed that -- those numbers that Bill gave you around the months that was pretty consistent around the world with what I would say is Asia getting better or China rather than getting better, faster. So that was kind of one anomaly relative to the other data. But then everything really has followed the reopening. So, as you've seen reopening, you've seen improvement as you've seen shutdowns. You've seen business follow suit very, very closely, so that that's kind of the best forward run to what's going to happen to a business is what's happening relative to -- business getting back to business or things being aggressively shutdown. Yeah. So, we've got some things that I'm going to call, they're not particularly high beta and we know how to do them today, meaning there's an application and we know how to do it. So, I'll give you an example in spraying technologies and compressors or in the continued global ventilator build-up, our gas business is playing in there. Those are pieces of business that are that are kind of happening today. And are -- you can see the path going forward. They may come down, but you know how to do it and the businesses is there. And those are the things that are in the -- those are over $10 million total that you're seeing, right? So, those are the kind of -- that's the kind of size we're talking about. These are big overall programs that are hitting and are very attractive. Then you've got some things, Matt, that are a lot more -- that a much higher beta. So, we are doing a bunch of work on some revolutionary testing protocols where we have some really interesting technology and a lot of money is flowing from the outside towards these things. And what I would say is they're either going to be very big, we're talking tens of millions or the technologies don't work and they don't turn into anything. So, there's just a -- there's a lot more volatility around new technologies that we're playing in kind of where the end market goes, how quickly does global testing capability ramp up? Because when you think about testing capability, it's not just COVID testing that we're talking about. There's a -- our thesis and I believe this is correct, as you're going to see a reset of global testing capacity, because you're going to -- no one wants to get caught with this again. And so, I think you're going to see a multiyear build-up of testing capacity. So, two very different types of things, but you're talking in the tens of millions depending upon the success in the commercial markets. Thanks Matt. Good morning. Do you mean a -- first, a business that became vulnerable or something like that? Is that what you mean, Allison? Yeah. So, I think a couple of things that regard, Allison. The first thing I'd say is I'm going to make a general statement, so not around any specific business, is our ability to work at a distance that we've just all proven that out, right? And I don't like the concept of everyone thinking that we should all work remotely from now. And I think that's a horrible idea. But the ability to intimately work with customers and suppliers at a distance with -- I would say, equal or better outcomes, is I think is going to change a lot of things. I think our ability to understand our customer better and at a more frequent clip, with the comfort level that everyone has now built with technology, I think that's actually a really big deal. And it's important for our business like ours, that so application centric, so the ability to understand the problem, the ability to serve, the ability to problem fix in vitro, I think that's actually pretty important. So, that's a big one. Second, I would say is, the blessing in the curse at times of an IDEX, right, are these very, very high contribution margins. And we love them and we don't want to -- we obviously don't want to give them up. But I think our ability to make some things more variable is important, Right? And so, I think in some of our businesses where the fixed cost is wonderful when you're ramping boy, when it turns the other way it can get painful. So, you've got a few businesses out there that I think over time, we're going to do -- want to do more work on can you make things more variable? Then I guess, I think maybe the last thing I'd say is, is I think everyone has been surprised or at least we have been surprised at what you think is fixed and what you think is variable. It's a lot more flexible than maybe people had their head around. And if you just told me a year ago that we could do what we've done with our cost structure, I'm not sure I would have believed it Allison, to be candid with you. And I think we've demonstrated to ourselves our ability to do that. And I think going forward, how do you keep those lessons learned, and make sure that we have as dynamic a P&L and balance sheet as we can both on the upside and the downside. Yeah. So, I think -- look, if you went back and looked at the financial crisis from 12 years ago, the municipal businesses held up well, and then 18 months or so later you saw the suffering. And I think -- I don't think it's going to take 18 months this time because I think everybody has learned how to react more quickly. And I do expect there to be a whole around municipal budgets, globally. And then I think what will happen is you are likely to get a -- some kind of step in, in terms of federal funding again -- or sovereign funding from governments because some of the stuff that's being delayed right now, because they're moving people and money to COVID related things, it's going to create actually a demand hole going into -- excuse me -- it's going to create a hole that you're going to have to fill with demand next year. And so, there's a little bit of compound and it's going to happen here. So, I do think that it will be -- I do think you'll see a hole here over the next 12 to 24 months. I think it's likely that you'll have some level of federal funding that will step in. But I think either way there will be a negative comp as you think about the next year or two. Thanks, Allison. Hi, Nathan. Yeah. No. I'm sorry, Nathan, if there's any confusion on that. The 30 is what would have happened if we had seen our business go down by 35%, right? So, in the quarter, our business was down about 17% organically. And so that -- so we went after about half of that discretionary. So just to make sure everyone on the phone understands exactly what we're talking about. If you went back to our presentation in the -- after the first quarter, the $120 million that we outlined was a cost that we could potentially take out based on 35% volume decrease, we've had about half of that. So, it got to about half of the discretionary. That's what that 15 is. So, if you think about the third quarter, I would expect something around the 15, but again, volume dependent. So, if we do -- if we end up kind of closer to the 12, maybe that number is a little bit lower, but I think the 15 is probably a good number. Bill, would you concur with that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think, that's -- yes, in the ballpark. Yeah. The answer to this question is really straightforward, Nathan. I think to be at the bottom end of that means that the negative 17, it would have to -- they have to look like this past quarter effectively, right, in terms of how that bumped along. And to be better than the 12, which obviously I don't see right now because we just -- there's no evidence to that. And we did take down backlog in the quarter. I think you'd have to see more sequential improvement. That's why that 12 to 17 feels -- really feels right. But I can see a scenario -- there's a potential scenario with that gets a little bit better. And less the scenario where it gets worse and it's worse than the 17 is we get a massive shutdown. And one of the things to keep in mind here also is you're seeing a surge in cases in the U.S. Obviously, Europe has done significantly better at managing this than the U.S. has. So, there's a lot of uncertainty there. And then, frankly, this presidential election is just starting to kick off. And I think it's -- it brings an awful lot of uncertainty into the world. And so, this is probably going to be the nastiest presidential election in that we've seen in our modern history. And it's going to cause an awful lot of volatility that I'm concerned about that. So, those are two things that could make it worse. But I don't see that at this point. I don't see it worse than the 17. Bill, what do you think there? Thanks, Nathan. Sure, can Scott. Good morning. Yeah. So, you remember when we gave that guidance, the world was just starting to unwind. And frankly, it was very hard to understand what that downside could be. We felt like we could very easily understand what it took to get to 15. We felt like it was very hard to understand what was coming relative to the low end of those expectations. So, it was -- we were definitely in a world 90 days ago that our ability to call the top line was significantly worse than our ability right now. There's still volatility in our businesses, but you are seeing -- if you look across our key industrial businesses, you are seeing the flattening of the order rates, which is a great sign. As you know, we keep a very close watch on our short cycle businesses. They tend to tell us a lot. The volatility that existed 90 days ago has definitely come down substantially in day rates.  And so, we feel a lot better around calling this range. So, we had a 10 point range at the end of last quarter, and we've now shrunk that down to a five point range. And typically, right, we're a two point range, one to two. And so, I think our ability to call things is getting much better and assuming that this trend continues and we don't get a massive disruption, I think you'll see us be able to keep tightening that range as we get 90 days from now. Right Well, look, here a couple of things. We have a one and a half data points, meaning we have the month of June and we have part of July for things sequentially getting better. And I think that if what we're seeing right now holds that negative 12 feels right, right? So -- and that would be sequentially better. If -- the downside, the 17 is -- if you see some kind of significant issue around, again, the surge that we're seeing in the United States, just remember the actual numbers are worse today than they were when we were all panicked, right? The actual data is worse and -- in the United States in particular. And we're now just starting to see the effects in the emerging world. So the 17 is basically saying that things backslide substantially and they -- and they look like they actually did in the second quarter. Now, remember when we were sitting here at 90 days ago, none of us had any idea what the real downside scenario was. And I do feel like we've been able to bracket that and understand that in a much better way, Scott, that gives me confidence in that 12 to 17. I have a lot more confidence in the 12 to 17 than I did in the 15 to 25. A lot more confidence. You're talking about the checkerboard slide, Scott? Yeah. So I think -- look, the things that have the most volatility and then right now are in FMT and diversified. And so the -- if you look at where the negative volatility has been, it's really been dominated around general industrial and then things that are touching transportation effectively, right, and oil and gas obviously, we -- that's kind of a different animal exacerbated by all of this. I think that the general industrial bottoming and starting to improve is what would drive a better outcome. And I would also say that is the most vulnerable to a second downtick. So, there's going to be the most volatility around industrial, chemical. Those two stand out to me.  And then I'd put dispensing, if you go over to Fire & Safety, dispensing and automotive, and dispensing is a little bit different animal, because there's actually something interesting happening there, which is on the consumer side of dispensing that business is actually booming, meaning that if you look at the big box retailers and the folks who are selling paint, that business is actually booming, but they're just not buying, because they're pushing up their capital spend. Where I would say on the industrial side, it's actually -- it's more correlated with what's actually happening in the markets. But you could definitely see a meaningful uptick in dispensing if people get more confidence. And then certainly around transportation, auto is starting to come back, which is a great sign. Clearly, aerospace is a different issue in our BAND-IT business, which is great mix for us, has had some negatives relative to transportation, specifically aerospace. You're taking out is the fundamental fixed cost of the business, which is facilities and people, right? That is a -- that's a really big number. And just to give you a sense of it, right, when we laid out the $15 million to $20 million last year, that was a sizeable number and meaningful, but again, kind of structured around a -- what we thought might be a mild recession. But to give you some sense of it in 2008, 2009, Bill, I can't remember -- I want to say we took out $40 million total during that... And that was total, Scott, including discretionary, right? And right now, we are at a total run rate. Bill, is at $90 million. Is that the number? Yeah. Yeah. So we have been hugely aggressive around cost out. Yeah. Thanks. Hi, Robert. Yeah. If you just kind of look at the general math, what I would say is that the -- when you balance off the cash earnings decline that we're seeing in target relative to the drop in interest rates, when you actually kind of do the math on valuations, it actually neutralizes pretty close, Robert, with some gap to an increase in an aggregate valuation on a cash flow basis, a little bit. But they do offset pretty closely. So, look, people have not changed their expectations on valuation that has definitely not happened. The down stroke was too brief. The public markets came back so aggressively that private sellers -- they tend to build their expectations off of public markets. And so, at least anyone who's sophisticated. And so, look, the valuation expectations have stayed elevated. Thanks, Robert. Thank you very much. Well, thank you everybody for your time here and your patients and understanding what's happening in the world. Obviously, we're all experiencing this together. And two things that I asked you to kind of take away. Number one, the mission of this company and the values of this company have been tested. And I think everybody has been tested. And I am just incredibly proud of how all the people across IDEX have responded to this. They have responded with compassion. They have responded with action. They have responded with discipline and prudence. And it's just -- it really warms your heart as a leader to see those values, not only stick, but deepen in a moment like this. Second, back -- over the last few years, I've talked about what happens to a company like ours in difficult times. And one of the things that I have been very proud about is that our ability to maintain cash earnings in difficult times. I have always claimed that that's something that we could do certainly over a shorter period, say a given year. And I think what you see here in the second quarter is exactly that, right? We had an incredible cash flow performance. And if you think of it as from a cash, EPS standpoint, that's really impressive. And as we go through the rest of the year, obviously, we won't have the same opportunity with AR that we had here in the last quarter, but we will with inventory. And I expect us when we look back on this year, obviously, we'll all think about this and the difficulty that we had. But I think it will show once again, the durability of a company like IDEX and the business model that this company has. And I think it's really something else. And I'm really -- it's a pleasure for me to have the ability to lead this business. So, with that, I'll thank you all for attending and look forward to talking to you all here over the next 90 days. Take care."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. Thank you. You may begin.\nMike Yates: Thank you, Diago. Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Let me start by saying thank you for joining us for a discussion of the IDEX first quarter 2020 financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company\u2019s financial and operating performance for the three months ending March 31, 2020. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today\u2019s webcast, can be accessed on our company\u2019s website at www.idexcorp.com. Joining me today is Andy Silvernail, our Chairman and CEO; and Bill Grogan, our Chief Financial Officer. The format for our call today is as follows. We\u2019ll begin with Andy providing an overview of IDEX performance drivers and addressing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, as well as the company\u2019s response to date. Bill will then discuss our first quarter 2020 financial results and walk you through an assessment of the company\u2019s liquidity and financial durability through several scenarios. And finally, Andy will conclude with our current framework for second quarter and closing remarks. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes by dialing the toll-free number 877-660-6853 and entering conference ID number 13694804, or you may simply log on to our company\u2019s homepage for the webcast replay. Before we begin a brief reminder, this call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the Safe Harbor language in last night\u2019s press release and in IDEX\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Andy Silvernail.\nAndrew Silvernail: Thank you, Mike. I appreciate everyone joining the IDEX Q1 earnings call today. I\u2019m starting off on Slide 6. The world is spinning with great uncertainty. But as you leave this call today, I want you to feel certain about one thing, IDEX is well-positioned to survive and thrive through this COVID-19 crisis. We have the quality of businesses, we have the people, and we have the financial wherewithal. We\u2019ve invested our company aggressively over the years to build a very special organization. Most important, we\u2019ve built the culture. We built a culture with incredibly talented teams who run great businesses that matter to the world. Our culture has helped us react very early to this crisis. We\u2019ve made swift and smart decisions to keep our people safe, to keep our businesses moving and ensure liquidity, making sure that we do everything we can to help win this COVID-19 fight. IDEX has an important mission that we capture in four words, :trusted solutions, improving lives.\u201d Our mission has never been more important. In a world consumed with physical, emotional, and the financial impact of COVID-19, IDEX plays a critical role in keeping people safe and healthy, while helping directly with the fight to defeat it. I\u2019m going to move now to Slide 7. There are so many ways that IDEX is in this fight. In our Fluid & Metering segment, we enable food, energy, and industrial supply chains. In Fire & Safety/Diversified, we\u2019ve acted swiftly to quadruple the production of our mobile medical tents used by hospitals as they struggle to handle the surge in COVID-19 cases. And in Health & Science Technologies, we\u2019re making compressors used in ventilators, mobile carts that produce hospital grade air where it\u2019s not available, and compressors for mobile disinfecting sprayers. And, of course, we\u2019re also a critical supplier enabling the genetic sequencing that decoded the RNA of the coronavirus, enabling the development of tests for COVID-19 and its antibodies, as well as finding therapies and hopefully, an eventual vaccine. There are dozens more examples across the company where we bring essential products to a market in need. I\u2019m turning now to Slide 8. I want to pause here for a moment and thank all of our people across IDEX, especially those in manufacturing, shipping, and other roles that require a presence in our facilities. We have robust safety protocols at our sites worldwide to protect our people performing essential jobs. The safety of our people will always be the most important consideration as we continue in this new environment. In a crisis, especially one as devastating as this, your true values are exposed. I\u2019ve never been prouder of the people of IDEX. From the first sign of the COVID-19 crisis in China, our teams have been collaborating, problem-solving, and acting. While great strategy is a product of this crisis, we\u2019re also seeing the best in who we are. I\u2019m now moving on to Slide 9. On March 20, I held a conference call with investors, where I laid out our operating context and our priorities to steer IDEX successfully through this crisis. Much has changed in five weeks, but our point of view and our priorities remain the same. We\u2019ve built our strategy and our operating plans based on four phases of this evolving crisis. I believe we\u2019re now moving out of Phase 1, the acute phase; and into Phase 2, which will be a period of ongoing uncertainty and significant challenge for the next three to six months. There\u2019ll be a little visibility as quarantines are lifted, and we all work to gradually restart the economy safely. During this phase, we expect to see a significant drop in demand and production capability as customers, suppliers, and our own teams are regularly impacted by shutdowns and shortages. The third phase will be learning to live and work with COVID-19. This will require significant changes to much of what we do, and this period will extend until there is a solution that gives people confidence to engage socially and professionally without fear. While this phase will not be easy, we\u2019ve seen from our businesses in China, which have rebounded quickly that we can successfully pivot our approach. The final phase will be the post virus world. I know we all look forward to this day when normal returns. I\u2019m convinced, however, that normal will be redefined just as it has been another severe crisis. Like the Great Depression, the Second World War, 9/11, and The Financial Crisis, there will be significant and permanent societal and economic changes. The coronavirus will shape our lives and our economy in countless ways, some easily predictable and others yet unknown. Over the next 12 to 18 months, as we move through these phases, it is our job as leaders to successfully transverse phases one through three and enter Phase 4 with a company that\u2019s financially strong and an organization that is positioned to thrive. I\u2019m now turning to Slide 10. We\u2019ve outlined four strategies that guide our way to a better future. Our top priority is safety, protecting our teams as we try to remain open to serve customers that are essential to our society. While we are normally highly decentralized, this is a time when we have carefully weighed safety protocols and mandated certain standards worldwide. These have included temperature checks at the beginning of all shifts, guidelines for face coverings, cleaning and sanitizing practices, and processes for addressing a variety of scenarios from COVID-19 cases to possible exposures. Our COVID-19 issues and response team has led the way and regularly provides guidance to our local sites as issues arise. And because of the strong procedures we have in place and the handful of incidences where employees have contracted the virus, few if any coworkers have been quarantined. Not only is this good for business, but it\u2019s great for the health, well-being, and morale of our employees. I\u2019m glad to report that every IDEX employee who has contracted COVID-19 has so far recovered. To ensure business continuity, which is our second priority, we have developed plans for each site to use in the event of a ramp down of operations. We want to ensure these are handled smoothly and in a way that prepares the business to return quickly to operations. We are also regularly addressing supply chain concerns. While our supply chains are generally shorter than many of our other global manufacturers, we have quickly addressed issues from lockdowns and travel restrictions. So far, our business continuity planning, like our security plans, have helped us avoid more significant business disruptions. In the months ahead, we expect we\u2019ll be choppier. This extensive planning and support structure we\u2019ve built should serve our businesses well. Our third area of focus is liquidity. IDEX entered this time with a strong cash position and we have remained cash flow positive since the beginning of the crisis. Our goal is to remain so throughout, protecting our liquidity and our balance sheet. We\u2019re working with our businesses and finance leaders to help them manage through a period unlike anything they\u2019ve seen in their careers. Bill Grogan, our CFO, has instituted daily cash management practices that he is working with all of our leaders across the globe. Finally, we\u2019re playing offense. That means different things in different areas of our business. In some instances, it means pivoting to focus on the needs of customers who are now booming as they\u2019re selling essential products. In other instances, it\u2019s meant helping businesses in need, like we did in Novotema that\u2019s just outside Bergamo in Italy that was closed. Our sister company, PPE in England, stepped in and produce seals for a medical ventilator manufacturer as the Novotema was struggling. Playing offense also means being prepared to accelerate acquisitions when the market unfreezes and a thoughtful approach to share repurchases. With that, I\u2019m going to pause here. I\u2019m going to turn things over to Bill, and he is going to walk you through an overview of our financials and liquidity.\nWilliam Grogan: Thanks, Andy. I\u2019ll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 12. Q1 orders of $645 million were down 2% overall and organically. The slowdown in our industrial end markets that we discussed during our previous call was compounded by the impact of the pandemic in most of our geographies and end markets. However, there was positive momentum in our life sciences and pharma businesses. The backlog we\u2019ve built will help fill the decrease in orders we expect in Q2. First quarter sales of $594 million were 4% \u2013 were down 4% overall and 5% organically. Results early in the quarter were better-than-expected in most areas of the business outside of China. But as the impact of COVID-19 ramped, most of our businesses, with the exception of life sciences and pharma, took a negative turn and drove us to the low-end of our guide. Q1 gross margins expanded 10 basis points to 45.7% and were up in all three segments, primarily driven by strong price capture, continued productivity initiatives and discretionary cost control. These actions more than offset the negative margin impact of lower volume leverage. Operating margin was 23.5%, down 30 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by the dilutive impact of the Velcora acquisition, which had op margin of 8%, but EBITDA margin of 25% and lower volume leverage. This was offset by our gross margin expansion and SG&A cost actions we took in the fourth quarter of last year. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 20%, which was higher than the 19.5% in the prior year due to a reduction in excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation. First quarter net income was $102 million, resulting in an EPS of $1.33, down $0.11, or 8% compared to the prior year EPS. Finally, free cash flow was $72 million, down 5% compared to the prior year, but was 71% of net income, compared to 69% last year. Turning to Slide 13, our liquidity. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months ending March 31 was $473 million, or 113% of net income. We continue to be well-positioned to weather the current environment. IDEX has consistently generated positive free cash flow in excess of net income through margin expansion, ongoing working capital initiatives and an effective capital allocation philosophy. LTM adjusted leverage was 1.5 times, providing sufficient capacity to fund all of our business needs and allowing us to quickly pivot to offense as the economic environment improves. Leverage increased slightly in the quarter as we drew $150 million on our revolver in late March in response to temporary challenges in the short-term funding markets. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $569 million at the end of the quarter. We also have $642 million of availability under our $800 million revolving credit facility. With cash on hand, available financing and conservative leverage, we are confident in our ability to continue to meet our obligations, fund operations and make critical investments in the business. In relation to $300 million of notes due at the end of the year, we are currently exploring potential options, including availing ourselves to the capital markets. As Andy mentioned, we have put in place additional processes to enhance our focus on liquidity, and we are actively monitoring conditions with our customers and suppliers to ensure that we\u2019re able to maintain positive cash flow and mitigate the impact of a challenging environment on cash and working capital. We\u2019re taking all necessary actions to make sure we\u2019re appropriately positioned to operate effectively during this period. Moving on to Slide 14. While we believe that we are well suited to operate in this environment, we\u2019re continually monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on our operations and are modeling a number of possible scenarios. These examples are meant to give our investors a picture of our durability, not a reflection of what we expect for full-year sales. Under our current cost structure, which reflects the structural actions we took in the fourth quarter of 2019, we believe that our annualized break-even revenue, the point at which we continue to generate positive cash flow, is approximately $1.8 billion, or 30% decrease to our 2019 sales results. To be proactive in this uncertain environment, we have developed a playbook with actions to reduce that break-even point. We\u2019ve identified approximately $120 million worth of additional cost reductions, which will drive our break-even revenue closer to down 35%. This would include bonus actions, eliminating travel, marketing and supplies and many other discretionary cost items. If the conditions warrant it, we\u2019re prepared to take structural cost actions and generate an additional $40 million of reductions, resulting in a break-even revenue point of down 40%. Lastly, although we intend to fund our dividend, if we were to suspend it, our break-even point would be as low as 50% down on an annualized basis. We\u2019re taking all prudent actions to manage discretionary spending, as we continue to gauge the impact of this volatile environment. At this point, we do not believe that further structural actions are necessary, but we\u2019re staying closely tuned into our end markets and supply chains and are prepared to take additional steps if necessary. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Andy to review our current view on the second quarter.\nAndrew Silvernail: Thanks, Bill. Hey, everybody, I\u2019m on slide 15. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we believe the next three to six months are going to be extremely challenging. Everyone will face the same uncertainty as we reopen the economy safely and execute environment, where COVID-19 exists and impacts operations potentially in waves. While we believe strongly in the IDEX business model and we\u2019re very well-positioned, we acknowledge the challenges that we face across our business units. We expect revenue in the second quarter could be down as much as 15% to 25%. We know that some of our end markets will be significantly challenged, but those headwinds will be somewhat offset as we continue to deliver mission-critical components to essential customers worldwide. We\u2019ve taken prudent actions to significantly reduce our discretionary cost across our businesses and the steps we took in the fourth quarter of 2019 have positioned us to react to a market that is significantly more challenging than we expected when we started the year. We are closely monitoring our markets and our businesses and we will react quickly to changes. To conclude, I\u2019m extremely proud of how our employees have responded to this crisis. And even though the next 12 to 18 months will be challenging for all of us, I know that we will meet this challenge and come out stronger on the other side. With that, let me pause here and turn it over to questions from the audience. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ll be conducting our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Please state your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nAndrew Silvernail: Good morning, Deane. Hey, it\u2019s great to hear the IDEX team, and I\u2019m wishing everyone the best. I appreciate the \u2013 all the details in terms of the potential scenarios this morning. And the first question really picks up where Bill left off on Page 14 on those scenarios\u2026\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes.\nDeane Dray: \u2026because Andy, I want to say for the past year, you\u2019ve been asked about the IDEX playbook for a normal recession.\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes.\nDeane Dray: And it really feels like \u2013 I don\u2019t even know what that is anymore, because we\u2019re far beyond that.\nAndrew Silvernail: Even do we, Deane.\nDeane Dray: So it\u2019s just \u2013 the idea here, as you said, if things progress or get worse, it just feels like we\u2019re already there.\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes.\nDeane Dray: So talk about it, and I know this is a tough conversation, but the deep \u2013 deeper cuts that you\u2019re likely going to have to take, like is that $120 million of cost out, is that enough? What\u2019s \u2013 what are the milestones that you\u2019re looking for here and then maybe some comments on decrementals?\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes, you bet. So, first of all, that first look at the $120 million, that stuff that we are very actively putting our arms around and taking the cost out of. And obviously, you can see that it even impacted in a positive way to some degree in the first quarter, because we started those actions really as we are coming into February and early part of March, and so there\u2019s some benefits there. So, we\u2019re grabbing that lever already, and we\u2019re grabbing it very aggressively, Deane. So that\u2019s the first thing. One of the main priorities that I have going through this crisis is to maintain as much of the structure and the talent that we can in IDEX appropriately. And so, I\u2019m willing for a short period of time to eat some of the incremental costing to maintain that talent base and to position the company well. That being said, as you know, we\u2019re a very diversified and decentralized business. And so, you have companies that \u2013 some companies are absolutely growing in this environment and some are really taking it on the chin. And so, we\u2019ll have to get the appropriate footprint in the appropriate places depending upon how much deeper and how much longer this goes. And \u2013 but our first priority is to certainly keep the integrity of IDEX intact as much as possible. So, I look at that that secondary group of actions, that the incremental $40 million as steps that we will take if we have to, but would prefer not to, Deane. In terms of decrementals, if you look at it on a sequential basis versus year-over-year, I think, that\u2019s probably a good way to look at it. Obviously, we\u2019re a very high contribution margin company. So, we\u2019re \u2013 we have contribution margins in the low-60s. And so, if we can offset a good chunk of that and end up in the 40s or 50s without having to make massive structural changes to the company, we would do so within the short term. But obviously, in the longer-term, you\u2019ve got to have the appropriate cost structure.\nDeane Dray: That\u2019s really helpful. And then I just \u2013 I appreciate the four phases that you\u2019ve laid out. And I don\u2019t want to minimize how much heavy lifting, and frankly some pain to get through all four of these phases. But looking beyond into that new normal and maybe the idea of when you will start to shift to offense\u2026\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes.\nDeane Dray: \u2026and you\u2019ve got balance sheet now. You didn\u2019t chase expensive deals the last couple of years. When does M&A make sense? We know markets have to normalize a bit, but when do you start to flip the switch and play offense here?\nAndrew Silvernail: Well, some of that is in our control and some is not. In terms of overall playing offense, we\u2019re doing some of it right now, Deane. We are \u2013 if you look across our businesses, those places where essential products are booming, so disinfection, many of our Health & Science markets, pharma reshoring, which we think is going to be a major trend. We\u2019re playing offense now. We have redirected our people and investment and are making sure that we can first and foremost help with this fight but also make sure that we\u2019re doing the right things for our shareholders, our owners. And so, some of that\u2019s happening now. As it regards to M&A, there are really two challenges with M&A. First \u2013 the first one is having enough confidence in your own situation to deploy that liquidity in that balance sheet, and the second is that you have willing sellers. We are doing an awful lot of work right now on both sides of that equation. So let me talk about the liquidity side. So, there\u2019s liquidity that is to survive that a lot of people are having to utilize. And at the end of this, they will have a stretched balance sheet in the very difficult circumstances. That is not our situation, and I don\u2019t want it to be our situation. Our drive and why we have so much focus on this breakeven level of cash flow is because I want a balance sheet that is deployable \u2013 aggressively deployable as the world starts to settle itself. And so, if we can maintain this north of $1 billion of liquidity, as cash flows become more certain and the markets stabilizes, we will get aggressive, no doubt about that. Now the other side of that equation is who are the sellers. And so, as you can imagine right now, and you guys are talking to a lot of folks, that\u2019s frozen \u2013 it\u2019s just a frozen marketplace. I think it will take through a quarter or so for that to start to unfreeze when Boards of Directors and families are going to look at this situation and recognize that it\u2019s going to take a while and that an attractive price in this marketplace might make sense. But I think it will take a little bit of time, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Thank you, and best of luck to everyone.\nAndrew Silvernail: Thanks, Deane.\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. Please state your question.\nMichael Halloran: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nAndrew Silvernail: Good morning, Mike.\nWilliam Grogan: Good morning, Mike.\nMichael Halloran: So a couple of things. First, when you look at that down 15% to 25%, what\u2019s that predicated on? Is that based on what you\u2019re seeing now? Are there signs of stability after that initial shock downward? Any kind of context on what kind of logic you\u2019re using to get to the 15% to 25% down?\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes. So I\u2019d \u2013 what I\u2019d first say is that the 15% is our experience as March unfolded and what we\u2019re seeing here in early April. And being a short cycle business, we certainly saw the reaction pretty quickly, both on the ups and the downs, by the way, in terms of the things that are struggling. The industrial businesses are certainly taking it on the chin, more so than other businesses. So if you look at FMT, that\u2019s just going to be more painful there. You\u2019ve got the combination of the coronavirus impact and then, of course, what\u2019s happening in the energy world that that\u2019s unfolding. So that 15% is what we\u2019ve been experienced here for, call it, six, seven weeks, Mike. My view is, it\u2019s likely to get worse than the 15%, and we see kind of slippage happening in a number of places that especially have more impact if you\u2019ve got, say, if you\u2019re in energy, you\u2019re in transportation, those places, in particular, are really getting pounded and others are holding up. So I feel pretty comfortable with that range, Mike.\nMichael Halloran: And then you alluded to it earlier, but maybe just talk about how you guys are thinking about what the structural changes could look like here? What are some of the things that you\u2019re thinking you might rotate to, obviously, some of the pharma medical stuff you\u2019ve already mentioned?\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes.\nMichael Halloran: Anything else you\u2019re thinking about? And then how do you prepare for it in the short-term here and bounce that with all the other things as you have up in the air?\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes. I think one of the things that really works in our favor in this environment is our structure. It could be an impediment. We put that rapid response team in place very early on, because we knew that, that our decentralization and in terms of kind of how we\u2019re structured worldwide, we knew that we could end up with kind of 45 different answers. And so there were certain things that you just couldn\u2019t have 45 different answers on, and we\u2019ve been able to move very quickly. In this case, in terms of playing offense, Mike, our structure helps us a ton, because the places that are really struggling with massive demand falloffs, you can isolate them specifically and you can start redirecting resources to things that are exciting. I\u2019ll give you an example. So in the world of Health & Science, we have a significant demand for engineering right now because of all the new things that are developing, whether it\u2019s from testing, which you\u2019re seeing PCR tests take off that we\u2019re helping with, we needed engineering and we actually redirected engineering from our business in rescue to help our business in Health & Science. And so we\u2019re doing a bunch of things like that, Mike. So we\u2019re definitely moving to those opportunities and moving people and resources. In terms of the big structural changes that they\u2019re \u2013 I think they\u2019re going to happen around a lot of things touching our Health & Science world. I think if I think about, say, the food, supply chain, that\u2019s going to be an area that I think will be impacted. There\u2019s a lot of talk of reshoring in terms of moving things out of more difficult or more risky environments. I think that will happen, that was already happening, but it\u2019s not like a big boom, I think, it\u2019s a relatively slow phase. But overall, I feel like we\u2019re positioned well and our structure really helps us move to the areas where opportunity and demand are likely to be and move away from places they\u2019re likely to be hit harder.\nMichael Halloran: Thanks for that. And then one, just clarification on Slide 14, the break-even cash flow.\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes.\nMichael Halloran: Is that a free cash flow before CapEx or after CapEx?\nAndrew Silvernail: After. Correct, Bill?\nMichael Halloran: All right, great. Thank you. I appreciate it.\nAndrew Silvernail: Bill, that\u2019s right, isn\u2019t it?\nWilliam Grogan: Yes.\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes.\nMichael Halloran: Yes, great. I thought, so I just want to make sure. I appreciate it.\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities. Please state your question.\nScott Graham: Hey, good morning. And as usual, Andy, thank you for your frankness and clarity.\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes. Thanks, Scott.\nScott Graham: Oh, sure. So I just want to make sure that, we\u2019re \u2013 that I\u2019m at least thinking about what you\u2019re saying about decrementals correctly. So if we\u2019re at 15% to 20% thinking for decline in this quarter\u2019s sales, if I choose the midpoint and say minus 20%, just for example sake\u2026\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes.\nScott Graham: \u2026taking that number, multiplying it by 50% and that\u2019s your decline in operating income this quarter, it is as simple as that, right?\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes, plus or minus. Yes.\nScott Graham: Okay.\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes, that\u2019s close enough. Yes.\nScott Graham: And within that, how much of the $120 million discretionary are we talking about? In other words, what I\u2019m trying to get to here is that\u2026\nAndrew Silvernail: Oh, I gotcha. Yes.\nScott Graham: \u2026if it\u2019s $50 million this quarter, next quarter, it could be $40 million and so on, that would be helpful?\nAndrew Silvernail: Okay. I think I understand your question, Scott. But if I don\u2019t get it, right, just reiterate or help me out here. So the $120 million is an annual number, right? And because we\u2019re not that seasonal and our fixed cost structure doesn\u2019t \u2013 isn\u2019t that variable, you could basically take the $30 million a quarter. And that that\u2019s going to come out of there. And that\u2019s pretty much coming out now. It might be a little bit more as time goes on, but that \u2013 that\u2019s coming up pretty darn rapidly. And that\u2019s what enables you to go from instead of having to be a 62% or 63% negative flow through, that\u2019s what helps you kind of ratchet or ratchet that down over time. So, Bill, is there anything you\u2019d add there?\nWilliam Grogan: No, I think some of the items may be a little bit less in the second that would ramp up, but it\u2019s close.\nScott Graham: Okay, okay. That\u2019s\u2026\nAndrew Silvernail: Does that answer your question, Scott?\nScott Graham: Yes. For all intents and purposes, the $30 million quarterly is kind of the exit rate right now?\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes. It\u2019s \u2013 I mean, we\u2019ve clamped down so hard here that we\u2019re not spending money on things that don\u2019t have kind of a direct that aren\u2019t essential, right? That $120 million is really clamping that down.\nScott Graham: Okay, gotcha. Two other questions. What would be the trigger for the $40 million? What level of sales? Is it this 35% to 40% decline in sales, that\u2019s the trigger for the structural?\nAndrew Silvernail: There is, to some degree, Scott, it is an amount. But more than anything else, it\u2019s what we think the duration is going to look like, right? So if we\u2019re going to reset the business, let\u2019s just say, down 20%, let\u2019s just use that number, just as an example. And you\u2019re no longer a $2.5 billion company, you\u2019re now a $2 billion company. You have to have a different cost structure, right, if you think that\u2019s going to be sustained for a period of time. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re really trying to evaluate is, what we think the duration and the depth is likely to be and it\u2019s a combination of those two that would trigger us to look at the $40 million. We didn\u2019t feel like we had to do that today. We felt like we should buy ourselves some time, and we have with the $120 million. And so we\u2019ll continue to evaluate that, as you know, we took out a big chunk here. In the fall, we took out $15 million and we had another $5 million, which obviously we\u2019ve gone and got. So we were \u2013 although, we hadn\u2019t predicted this, we did predict a tough year. And so we went and proactively got that $20 million out. And so we\u2019ll decide on depth and duration here as we go through this quarter to figure out whether or not we want to take out the other $40 million.\nScott Graham: Gotcha. That\u2019s very clear. And then I think you actually in that answer, just answered my third question, which was sort of the way that Slide 14 was structured to do 30%, 35% and 40% and higher revenue declines, that is both depth and duration in these numbers, right?\nAndrew Silvernail: It is, yes.\nScott Graham: Right, because your organic \u2013 you\u2019re thinking for the second quarter if it\u2019s minus 15% to 25%, even if it ends up at 25%, what you\u2019re talking about here is, on an annualized basis, there would be a duration here that would get us to these numbers?\nAndrew Silvernail: That\u2019s right, Scott. And I want to be very clear Bill said that in his remarks, but just so everyone hears this correctly. We are not \u2013 do not use these as guidance for where we think the world is going. This is really, for example, only, and we\u2019re trying to get a couple of messages across here and I think probably they\u2019ve landed, but just in case. Message one was, there\u2019s a lot that can happen in this world before we become \u2013 before we have a cash flow issue. And therefore, we don\u2019t have a liquidity issue. We have tons of liquidity, but we\u2019re not going to \u2013 I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to have to utilize that liquidity to stay afloat. I want to utilize that liquidity to play really aggressive offense. And so, hopefully, that came across the number one, we\u2019re a great position from a cash flow standpoint; and number two, our liquidity is really being pointed towards playing offense from the moment is correct aggressively.\nScott Graham: Yep. Page 14 is much clearer to me now. Thank you, guys.\nAndrew Silvernail: Great. Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please state your question.\nNathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.\nAndrew Silvernail: Hey, Nathan.\nNathan Jones: I guess, I\u2019ll go a little further on the cash flow side. Slide 14, here, we\u2019re looking at revenue changes and expense changes. Maybe we could look at the working capital side of this.\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes.\nNathan Jones: I guess, you should clearly have some source of cash out of inventory.\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes.\nNathan Jones: Maybe you can talk about, what you\u2019re expecting there? If you\u2019re seeing any slowdown in DSOs, or changes in receivable collections or any changes in customer behaviors, maybe they\u2019re getting stressed out? Any more color you can give us on that side of the equation?\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes. I\u2019ll comment on this and then Bill, I\u2019ll let you comment on it also. From \u2013 in terms of how we\u2019re managing this, I think this in a couple of ways. The first one is inventory. We got to make sure it comes out naturally, as volume gets affected, right? And that is \u2013 that has been a winning move in any slowdown for us. And historically, we have taken out inventory, and that\u2019s obviously had a very positive cash effect in any kind of slowdown. So you should expect us to continue to do that and take cash off the balance sheet, or cash out an inventory rather in \u2013 on the balance sheet. In terms of payables and receivables, my philosophy here is don\u2019t be the bank, meaning, we can\u2019t get caught between customers and suppliers. At the same time, I want to be very careful about not damaging customers and suppliers in here. So if we can end up neutral in that regard and really play that strategically, I think, that\u2019s important. Obviously, we\u2019ve got suppliers that we want to make sure they are healthy, they\u2019re our partners, this is not a time to beat on them when they\u2019re struggling, at the same time, we can\u2019t finance them. And so, as our customers are coming to us and asking for a relief, we\u2019re really weighing that against what we can do across the working capital spectrum. And so, we\u2019re being pretty firm. We\u2019ve got excellent service levels, we\u2019ve got great lead times competitively. We\u2019re not going to become the bank.\nNathan Jones: Okay. So the target, payables and receivables, net cash neutral and inventories at source?\nAndrew Silvernail: Yep.\nNathan Jones: Okay. My second question is on pricing. You guys have reported positive net pricing every year for as long as I can remember, including 2009.\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes.\nNathan Jones: This is clearly a little different thing, maybe a little steeper in the short-term here. Do you guys think you can still be net price positive or at least net price neutral in this kind of environment?\nAndrew Silvernail: I\u2019m pretty hopeful that we can stay positive. The price that we put out in the beginning of the year is \u2013 was already out and going. And so I don\u2019t see why that won\u2019t stick. I think there will be some challenges next year as we think about pricing about whether or not we can \u2013 how aggressive we can be there. Bill, on those two topics, do you want to \u2013 you want to give your your view?\nWilliam Grogan: Yes. I would say, our price capture in the first quarter was in line with what we experienced for most of last year. And I guess, my only comment on the working capital piece is, there are some selective businesses that took some actions to target to build some buffer stock relative to supply chains in certain countries that were shutting down. So first quarter inventory performance was good, impacted slightly based upon some of those builds. And to Andy\u2019s point, we fully anticipate to bleed that off here in the second quarter. But price capture is still strong across the portfolio.\nNathan Jones: Bill, what\u2019s your view of price here as we think about the \u2013 this year unfolds?\nWilliam Grogan: I mean, obviously, we\u2019ll hear more challenging as we go through the balance of the year, as customers are more impacted. But I think our core pricing initiatives that we have across the portfolio will remain positive. Does it come down slightly potentially, but overall, price costs still positive for us.\nNathan Jones: Yes. Okay, thanks a lot. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nAndrew Silvernail: Thanks, Nathan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.\nAllison Poliniak-Cusic: Hi, guys, good morning.\nAndrew Silvernail: Hey, good morning, Allison.\nAllison Poliniak-Cusic: So, Andy, I just want to talk maybe higher level. IDEX, you build a really solid foundation here, you\u2019ve talked about that.\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes.\nAllison Poliniak-Cusic: And then you mentioned through these phases, but particularly as we go to that normal \u2013 the new normal, is there anything that\u2019s really coming to light here in terms of portfolio growth? It sounds like you\u2019re starting to pivot some of that near-term organic investment to some of these new applications. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense if that\u2019s temporary or if it\u2019s sort of potentially a new direction here for IDEX?\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes. So I think \u2013 we\u2019ve had a lot of things come out of us, Allison, in terms of opportunities that \u2013 where people have come to us on trying to help with very specific things relative to the COVID-19 crisis. And as we have evaluated those, we\u2019ve been pretty careful. And what I mean by that is, what we don\u2019t want to do is take a bunch of people and resources and shift them to something where the lead time is so long, that effectively when you bring your solution to bear, it doesn\u2019t matter anymore. And so there are going be a bunch of boom and bust cycles in this \u2013 of different things that are coming to market, both because they\u2019re very effective and then they\u2019re just no longer needed, or they weren\u2019t particularly effective and they wash away. And so we\u2019re trying to avoid those kinds of things. And we\u2019re trying to move the portfolio to things that are really about helping a fight, where we have capabilities and we can ramp really quickly. And I use the the mobile medical tents out of our Vetter unit in Germany. We sold more in the month of March and we sold as much in the month of March, as we sold all of last year. And so we\u2019ve ramped that up. They\u2019ve literally quadrupled their overall capacity here as we go through the \u2013 with the rest of this year. And so that, that makes a ton of sense. It doesn\u2019t take any major investment or capability that we don\u2019t have. So we\u2019re moving to those sorts of things very aggressively. As we think longer-term, I think there are some trends here that are very natural for us. So obviously, around global testing that was already a trend that was growing and it was what we had positioned ourselves behind an IDEX Health & Science, and that is going to accelerate, I think, that\u2019s indefinite. And what I mean by testing is testing to kind of anything and everything that analytical equipment is used for and biodiagnostic testing is used for. That stuff is just going to continue to grow very aggressively and we\u2019re going to continue to position ourselves against that. And then things like, I think the pharma reshoring is the real deal. And so our material process business, as an example, will absolutely play in that. And I think that\u2019s going to be a long-term trend. It\u2019s going to take a long time for that to happen. But I believe that sort of thing is going to develop. And then you have kind of all those other trends that I think are going to get accelerated, because people frankly, have had to change their lives so much, that it\u2019s going to be easier to move into some of these trends. I\u2019m thinking trends like digitization, mobile communications, and how that impacts even, say, a viking pump, where the customer is going to become a lot more comfortable utilizing and expecting digital results and information-based results, and I think that will move some of those things forward faster.\nAllison Poliniak-Cusic: Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then you mentioned China, it sounds like it\u2019s coming out of \u2013 it\u2019s coming through this and going into the recovery phase\u2026\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes.\nAllison Poliniak-Cusic: As this rolls through globally, any lesson learned or your approach has evolved differently as you hit each region based on what\u2019s been going on in China? Any color there?\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes, that\u2019s a great question, Allison. And I think kind of moving from East to West in terms of how this has \u2013 this crisis has unfolded, we\u2019ve been learning along the way and we\u2019ve done a few things. So our Chinese businesses, they really lead the way here in creating protocols for safe working. And we have every single one of our plants is up right now. Not everything\u2019s at full capacity, but even our places in Northern Italy are up and working. And I\u2019ll give a lot of credit to that, because we learned very early on how to ramp down, how to ramp back up and how to work in an environment, where the virus is with you. And we\u2019ve created a protocol and a playbook out of that. We then changed that and augmented that for different parts of the world. And we actually very soon, we actually shared that with the Mapi Group, the Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity & Innovation, we shared with them that and they shared it with all of their members. And our team just did a great job putting that together. And so that that\u2019s the basis of that and we\u2019re continuing to learn. We also here, I guess, it was last week, we did a general managers call, a global general managers and site managers call and we had four of our general managers from Italy on that call, taking people through their experience. And I mean, the physical experience of what they\u2019ve gone through the emotional side of it, how to keep people safe, we did a kind of a virtual lunch and learn for everybody around those learnings. And so one of the things that we\u2019re trying to leverage here is the network effect of having so many sites around the world, where we can learn and share and get the best practices out in people\u2019s hands. So we\u2019ve been trying to do that really intently, Allison.\nAllison Poliniak-Cusic: It sounds great. Stay safe, everybody. Thanks.\nAndrew Silvernail: Thank you, Allison.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Please state your question.\nJoseph Giordano: Hey, guys, good morning.\nAndrew Silvernail: Good morning, Joe.\nJoseph Giordano: So you guys just closed an energy deal. I know it\u2019s a kind of a specific niche technology. Can you just talk about your overall exposure there? What you\u2019re seeing in the way you guys play in the energy markets?\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes. So, Joe, I think as you know, we are principally a midstream player. And so we\u2019re not really anywhere near the wellhead, for the most part, we have some things here and there, but not a ton. Look, across the energy business, which today is sub-10% of our total portfolio, we have an expectation that that\u2019s really going to get hammered here. So far we haven\u2019t had that \u2013 it hasn\u2019t been as severe as we expected to be, but we are certainly seeing all of those indicators now on the order front. And so we\u2019ll have to get our cost structure right and our overall footprint right to make sure that we can sustain there. We \u2013 I think everybody learned the lesson in 2015, 2016 that the overall impact of capital spending and how the energy economy impacts the global economy can\u2019t be overestimated, right? It\u2019s \u2013 that that\u2019s going to be \u2013 obviously, it\u2019s going to exacerbate this whole situation. And we\u2019re going to have to make sure that our businesses are positioned correctly as we go forward. But thankfully, we\u2019re not in the \u2013 on the wellhead and seeing some of these just ridiculous declines. And we will see declines, but it won\u2019t be like we\u2019re seeing upstream.\nJoseph Giordano: When you think about, I mean, it\u2019s hard now to think about like new investments you have to make when you\u2019re trying to rip out costs at the same time. But\u2026\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes.\nJoseph Giordano: \u2026as you think about your global footprint, does something like this make you have to step back and like rethink the way you even have your facility set up? Like does the workflow have to look different in the future? Do we have to\u2026\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes.\nJoseph Giordano: \u2026the headcount has to be totally different and it has to be more automated? Like what kind of \u2013 how do you just think about how your global plants look coming out of this?\nAndrew Silvernail: Joe, I think, that question as we move now through that, what I call Phase 3, is going to be one of the most important questions that we\u2019re wrestling with, because when you think about a manufacturing facility, especially one that is principally assembly and test, I mean, obviously, we do have businesses that are more than that. But we tend to be like machining, assembly and test and we have a couple of businesses that have the foundries and that\u2019s pretty unusual, though. In a world like that, obviously, we\u2019ve all embraced lean manufacturing here for many decades. And the natural output of lean manufacturing is cellular manufacturing, which does not work with social distancing the way it\u2019s constructed today, people are not six-feet apart. And so we\u2019re already in the process of doing that is how do you see the elements, how do you keep the elements of lean manufacturing, which is the elimination of waste and bringing down lead times? How do you keep those while having the principles of social distancing in place, and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re working on. I know a lot of people are. And we\u2019re not going to move to batch manufacturing. We\u2019re not going to do that sort of thing and destroy three decades of great work. But it does change how people work and not just in the manufacturing environment, it\u2019s going to change in the office environment, it\u2019s going to change it how we interact with customers. So many things like that are going to change and tell people have that comfort to be closer together again.\nJoseph Giordano: Thanks for the color.\nAndrew Silvernail: Thank you, Joe.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Please state your question.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Hey, guys.\nAndrew Silvernail: Hey, Andrew.\nAndrew Buscaglia: If you could talk \u2013 I\u2019m getting the sense directionally for the year, FMT gets hit probably the worst and then Fire & Safety maybe second worst and then Health & Science maybe third worst, because there are some partial offsetting factors. Would you agree with that?\nAndrew Silvernail: I would. Yes.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. In those other segments, are there \u2013 we\u2019re talking about some partially offsetting factors, maybe in Health & Science. Are there any in the other two segments? Is there anything else you\u2019re seeing that could go the other way as a positive?\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes, yes. So I think, as you look at, say, let\u2019s look at FMT first. I think that, obviously, the whole agricultural space has been really beaten up. But I do believe that the food supply chains are going to be continued to be really critical. And I think that\u2019s an overall a good trend as you talk about Ag in terms of where we play there. And that would be both for the material handling business, material process business and for Banjo. I put in both of those. Our ABS business, we are seeing some benefits of actually \u2013 there\u2019s some very interesting analytics that can be done for what\u2019s going on in sewer systems, believe it or not, I know that sounds incredibly strange. But there\u2019s a whole bunch of modeling that \u2013 and analytics that are allowed to or can happen because of our ability to monitor those systems. So our ABS business, we think will probably hold up pretty well in there. And then I think that the more industrial facing, kind of general industrial is going to have a bunch of things that are pretty negative, offset by small things that are positive. So, example, if you\u2019re selling into the chemical industry, obviously, there are some chemicals around disinfectants and things like that, that are absolutely booming. And then you have other things that are going into large CapEx that are likely to really struggle. So there are a few trends there over and diversified. On the Fire side, the \u2013 interestingly enough, there are a number of applications, where you can use some of that technology for disinfectant. So you\u2019ll see some of that. You\u2019ve got a really long \u2013 very, very long pipeline of \u2013 for \u2013 in the fire business for trucks in the U.S., particularly you\u2019ve got over a year of backlog. What we don\u2019t know yet is, whether or not we\u2019ll see cancellations. We have not seen that yet, but we\u2019ll have to monitor that pretty closely. The \u2013 we\u2019ve seen in China the rescue business pick back up aggressively has slowed down as tenders slowed down and then has picked back up aggressively. And so I think those hold up. BAND-IT and dispensing both, I think, take it on the chin here in the short-term because of their exposure one, around the retail space and for dispensing and then for BAND-IT, you\u2019ve got some exposure to transportation and oil and gas that will get hit, but other parts will do quite well.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay, yes, that\u2019s good \u2013 that\u2019s some good color.\nAndrew Silvernail: Thanks.\nAndrew Buscaglia: If you could \u2013 maybe just one last question on \u2013 same question, but related to margins. I would think FMT would get hit hardest, because it seems like in Fire & Safety, you\u2019ve got some \u2013 you\u2019ve made some changes there that structurally, and maybe those are okay or not okay, but fair better than FMT. Is that safe to say in terms of the decline we\u2019ll see?\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes, I think FMT will fair \u2013 will be the most challenged and then diversified and then Health & Science.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay, yes. Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes. Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Vertical Research Partners. Please state your question.\nBrett Linzey: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nAndrew Silvernail: Good morning, Brett.\nBrett Linzey: I wanted to come back to your comment on the past six to seven weeks, you mentioned you\u2019re running down mid-teens.\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes.\nBrett Linzey: What does the range look like there? And then just thinking about the complexion across the geographies, as we do reopen commerce, how are you thinking about the pace of return between the U.S. and Europe?\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes. Just to make sure I understand, Brett, the question you\u2019re asking, are you asking kind of the range of outcomes kind of business-by-business, like how bad to how good? Is that what you\u2019re asking?\nBrett Linzey: Well, I mean \u2013 yes, I mean, you\u2019re saying on average things around mid-teens.\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes.\nBrett Linzey: I mean, there\u2019s probably some growth in there, which does imply \u2013 there\u2019s some businesses down 30%, 40%, is that the right way?\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes. We\u2019ve got a couple of businesses that we think are going to be down in that 40% range. Very few are \u2013 is that severe, but they \u2013 you do have a couple. And again, it\u2019s energy, transportation exposure, we don\u2019t have really hospitality exposure, so to speak, so we don\u2019t have that. But we do have some businesses that are down there that much. And we expect we\u2019ll probably in the next quarter or two, we\u2019ll have that kind of impact. We don\u2019t think that will stay long. And I think that to your your question, our experience in China has been a very, very aggressive snapback and \u2013 but it\u2019s actually bifurcated. You have businesses that are kind of COVID facing, so to speak, that are helping with the fight, that are growing like crazy. And then you\u2019ve got a few businesses that are kind of really in the dumpsters, but it\u2019s actually come back pretty quickly. I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s the model for the rest of the world and for a number of reasons. Obviously, China has some very unique circumstances in how they are able to manage people and businesses and democracies just don\u2019t have those tools. And that\u2019s the cost of democracy, which is, I think, a good cost. And so I think it\u2019s going to look a lot more like we\u2019re seeing in Europe, which is, you\u2019re going to see people starting to figure out how to live with this virus and figure out how can you still have social distancing, but get back to work, get back to friends and family. And so that means, it just takes longer, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing certainly in Italy and that\u2019s what I expect here. And just to be clear, our expectation here is that this is going to be fits and starts. I\u2019m not someone who has bought into a super aggressive, everything gets fine in the fall sort of thing. I think that\u2019s crazy talk. And I think we have to face the reality that\u2019s in front of us. And what if we get lucky and for some reason, this goes away with whether or something else or a vaccine is found more quickly than we think, or you have very, very effective treatments. Great news. I don\u2019t think anybody should bank on that, and I certainly wouldn\u2019t manage the company expecting that.\nBrett Linzey: Okay, great. No, I appreciate that.\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes.\nBrett Linzey: And then just one last one. I was hoping you could spend just a moment. On the evolution of the portfolio, not so much from a product standpoint, you gave a lot of good examples earlier. But just in terms of service or the recurring elements of the portfolio. what\u2019s that mix look like today? I mean, obviously, service is going to be impacted here near-term. But kind of in a new normal, what is the recurring alumni that looks like?\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes, we\u2019ve never been a company that has the classic sort of high recurring revenue, so to speak. And the reason I say that is that, we don\u2019t have a big parks business, but we tend to sell into like-for-like in a very, very high percentage of our applications. And so, Bill, I don\u2019t know, what\u2019s your estimate of total sort of recurring? How would you characterize that?\nWilliam Grogan: Yes, it\u2019s greater than 50%.\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes, I agree with that. And so, look, when you had the financial crisis, our total business was down 14%. during that year right after that over the entire year. Our Health & Science business was down 5%, and I think our industrial businesses were down, say, 20% in those environments, which set itself off. We have a better portfolio positioning than we did then, meaning, it\u2019s less cyclical and there\u2019s more Health & Science in the mix. And so I feel good about that. So overall, I think, our portfolio and our positioning is pretty good. Albeit, there will be a couple of places that will get hit really hard.\nBrett Linzey: Okay, great. I really appreciate all the detail. I hope everybody stay safe.\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Walter Liptak with Seaport Global. Please state your question.\nWalter Liptak: All right. Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nAndrew Silvernail: Good morning. Wal.\nWalter Liptak: I wanted to ask a question about the municipal businesses. Your comments so far that Fire okay, China picked up pretty quick. They wonder how the municipal businesses you think will do this time? There\u2019s anything different, more challenging either financially or maybe benefits? I think you mentioned the sewer business could have some benefits. I wonder if we could just talk about muni?\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes. I think historically, the municipal businesses have had 18 months to two-year lag time compared to other businesses. And that\u2019s really driven by receipt, right, especially in the Western world. The \u2013 as you \u2013 as the receipts come in, that really sets the overall operating capital budgets. And so I expect there to be a little bit quicker reaction than you saw in the financial crisis. That \u2013 in the financial crisis, that took time, I remember that well, where the municipal businesses held up really well that we \u2013 as we went into that crisis. And then they started to really struggle as you got into 2008 \u2013 excuse me, 2010, 2011. It \u2013 that took some time for that to make its way through and then had \u2013 obviously had \u2013 has had a pretty strong overall run. I expect that will generally follow a similar path, although, I think it\u2019ll be more. I think people act faster just because it\u2019s been such a shock to the global system and everybody\u2019s top of mind that municipalities are going to probably clamp down a little more quickly on their spending. I expect to see that, but I do think it will still lag the overall industrial economy.\nWalter Liptak: Okay, great. Thanks. And then last one for me just about the share buyback. I wonder if you can just remind us how much is left\u2026\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes.\nWalter Liptak: \u2026on the share repurchase authorization? And how you\u2019re thinking about it in the second quarter and in the second-half?\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes, you bet. So we did buy just over $100 million of shares. We had a 10b5-1 in place going into this, and so we did buy just over $100 million. We did shut that 10b5-1 down, as we looked at the value of liquidity and the uncertainty that we were in. We valued this certainty more than we did the incremental share buyback. So we did pause that. Look, I know there\u2019s going to be a lot of \u2013 people are going to be looking really hard at those who buy back shares and I know in some ways it\u2019s turned into a political football. I don\u2019t think that we are in that category number one, obviously, we\u2019re kind of pretty low on the overall visibility food chain here, so I don\u2019t worry too much about that. Second, we\u2019re not going to be a company that takes cash from the government, I can\u2019t see where we\u2019re going to do that in a way that restricts us in any way to our behaviors. And then finally, look, we are going to utilize our liquidity the best way we can to help all of our stakeholders. And if what that means is to buy back shares, then we will do so appropriately. In terms of what we have in total, I can honestly say, we only have the $500 million that we got authorization for back a few weeks ago, plus you add that on, I think, Bill, to what about?\nWilliam Grogan: It\u2019s a little over $700 million.\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes\u2026\nWilliam Grogan: \u2026.yes, a little over $700 million.\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes.\nWalter Liptak: Okay, great. Okay. Thanks, guys.\nAndrew Silvernail: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Please state your question.\nMatt Summerville: Thanks. Just a quick one. Most of mine have been answered. But just with respect to life sciences and pharma, the strength you\u2019re seeing there\u2026\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes.\nMatt Summerville: \u2026is that COVID-19-related, or is that something else? And could you put that in the context of the $50 million improvement, I believe, you saw in overall backlog? How that component plays out looking forward?\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes. You\u2019ve got \u2013 there are two stories in there, Matt. So the first one is yes, there is absolutely a pickup from COVID-related activities. There\u2019s no doubt about that, that we\u2019re seeing in life sciences. But also, we have a number of very important customers that have programs that are ramping. And we have won some substantial business and we had some really nice orders here in the quarter relative to that. And so that\u2019s been strong. So it\u2019s both ongoing programs that are really important and then you\u2019ve got the impact of COVID-19 to get two things going at once. And, Bill, I don\u2019t know what \u2013 in total, what does that make up of the $50 million of backlog, Bill?\nWilliam Grogan: It was a little over $30 million from HST.\nAndrew Silvernail: Yes. So that will give you a sense, Matt.\nMatt Summervill: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn it back to management for closing remarks.\nAndrew Silvernail: Great. Thank you very much, and thank you all for being on the call. I know that we\u2019re sitting in a time that has shaken us in many ways. And I think I\u2019d like to close with a couple of comments. My first one is that, as I said in my prepared remarks, I could not be more proud of how the team here at IDEX has handled this. I have seen a level of collaboration and teamwork and positivity that \u2013 it really warms the heart. It\u2019s just incredible. And when you see that, sometimes the news cycles have a tendency to get you down. And \u2013 but when you see how people are coming together in the real world and tackling this, it is awesome, and it\u2019s why I\u2019m in business. I believe that the purpose of business is to make life better, and I could not be more proud of the team at IDEX for what they\u2019ve done. It\u2019s just remarkable. Second, I\u2019d like to say thank you to, everybody, who is on this call and your interest in IDEX. We \u2013 while the IDEX brand is not well-known in the consumer world, we play a very important role in a lot of places that really do matter. And that mission that I talked about trusted solutions and improving lives, we live that here at IDEX. And we\u2019re seeing in this crisis in this fight with COVID-19 how important that is. And I want to thank the people who are investors in the company and prospective investors for your support, your partnership as we move through this, and we will move through this and we will get to the other side and we will have a very strong company that\u2019s positioned extremely well. So thank you, everybody. I appreciate it and look forward to discussions as we go forward. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "name": "William Grogan",
            "content": "Thanks, Andy. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 12. Q1 orders of $645 million were down 2% overall and organically. The slowdown in our industrial end markets that we discussed during our previous call was compounded by the impact of the pandemic in most of our geographies and end markets. However, there was positive momentum in our life sciences and pharma businesses. The backlog we've built will help fill the decrease in orders we expect in Q2. First quarter sales of $594 million were 4% \u2013 were down 4% overall and 5% organically. Results early in the quarter were better-than-expected in most areas of the business outside of China. But as the impact of COVID-19 ramped, most of our businesses, with the exception of life sciences and pharma, took a negative turn and drove us to the low-end of our guide. Q1 gross margins expanded 10 basis points to 45.7% and were up in all three segments, primarily driven by strong price capture, continued productivity initiatives and discretionary cost control. These actions more than offset the negative margin impact of lower volume leverage. Operating margin was 23.5%, down 30 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by the dilutive impact of the Velcora acquisition, which had op margin of 8%, but EBITDA margin of 25% and lower volume leverage. This was offset by our gross margin expansion and SG&A cost actions we took in the fourth quarter of last year. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 20%, which was higher than the 19.5% in the prior year due to a reduction in excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation. First quarter net income was $102 million, resulting in an EPS of $1.33, down $0.11, or 8% compared to the prior year EPS. Finally, free cash flow was $72 million, down 5% compared to the prior year, but was 71% of net income, compared to 69% last year. Turning to Slide 13, our liquidity. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months ending March 31 was $473 million, or 113% of net income. We continue to be well-positioned to weather the current environment. IDEX has consistently generated positive free cash flow in excess of net income through margin expansion, ongoing working capital initiatives and an effective capital allocation philosophy. LTM adjusted leverage was 1.5 times, providing sufficient capacity to fund all of our business needs and allowing us to quickly pivot to offense as the economic environment improves. Leverage increased slightly in the quarter as we drew $150 million on our revolver in late March in response to temporary challenges in the short-term funding markets. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $569 million at the end of the quarter. We also have $642 million of availability under our $800 million revolving credit facility. With cash on hand, available financing and conservative leverage, we are confident in our ability to continue to meet our obligations, fund operations and make critical investments in the business. In relation to $300 million of notes due at the end of the year, we are currently exploring potential options, including availing ourselves to the capital markets. As Andy mentioned, we have put in place additional processes to enhance our focus on liquidity, and we are actively monitoring conditions with our customers and suppliers to ensure that we're able to maintain positive cash flow and mitigate the impact of a challenging environment on cash and working capital. We're taking all necessary actions to make sure we're appropriately positioned to operate effectively during this period. Moving on to Slide 14. While we believe that we are well suited to operate in this environment, we're continually monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on our operations and are modeling a number of possible scenarios. These examples are meant to give our investors a picture of our durability, not a reflection of what we expect for full-year sales. Under our current cost structure, which reflects the structural actions we took in the fourth quarter of 2019, we believe that our annualized break-even revenue, the point at which we continue to generate positive cash flow, is approximately $1.8 billion, or 30% decrease to our 2019 sales results. To be proactive in this uncertain environment, we have developed a playbook with actions to reduce that break-even point. We've identified approximately $120 million worth of additional cost reductions, which will drive our break-even revenue closer to down 35%. This would include bonus actions, eliminating travel, marketing and supplies and many other discretionary cost items. If the conditions warrant it, we're prepared to take structural cost actions and generate an additional $40 million of reductions, resulting in a break-even revenue point of down 40%. Lastly, although we intend to fund our dividend, if we were to suspend it, our break-even point would be as low as 50% down on an annualized basis. We're taking all prudent actions to manage discretionary spending, as we continue to gauge the impact of this volatile environment. At this point, we do not believe that further structural actions are necessary, but we're staying closely tuned into our end markets and supply chains and are prepared to take additional steps if necessary. With that, I'll turn it back over to Andy to review our current view on the second quarter. Good morning, Mike. Yes. No, I think some of the items may be a little bit less in the second that would ramp up, but it's close. Yes. I would say, our price capture in the first quarter was in line with what we experienced for most of last year. And I guess, my only comment on the working capital piece is, there are some selective businesses that took some actions to target to build some buffer stock relative to supply chains in certain countries that were shutting down. So first quarter inventory performance was good, impacted slightly based upon some of those builds. And to Andy's point, we fully anticipate to bleed that off here in the second quarter. But price capture is still strong across the portfolio. I mean, obviously, we'll hear more challenging as we go through the balance of the year, as customers are more impacted. But I think our core pricing initiatives that we have across the portfolio will remain positive. Does it come down slightly potentially, but overall, price costs still positive for us. Yes, it's greater than 50%. It's a little over $700 million. ....yes, a little over $700 million. It was a little over $30 million from HST."

            "content": "Thank you, Mike. I appreciate everyone joining the IDEX Q1 earnings call today. I'm starting off on Slide 6. The world is spinning with great uncertainty. But as you leave this call today, I want you to feel certain about one thing, IDEX is well-positioned to survive and thrive through this COVID-19 crisis. We have the quality of businesses, we have the people, and we have the financial wherewithal. We've invested our company aggressively over the years to build a very special organization. Most important, we've built the culture. We built a culture with incredibly talented teams who run great businesses that matter to the world. Our culture has helped us react very early to this crisis. We've made swift and smart decisions to keep our people safe, to keep our businesses moving and ensure liquidity, making sure that we do everything we can to help win this COVID-19 fight. IDEX has an important mission that we capture in four words, :trusted solutions, improving lives.\u201d Our mission has never been more important. In a world consumed with physical, emotional, and the financial impact of COVID-19, IDEX plays a critical role in keeping people safe and healthy, while helping directly with the fight to defeat it. I'm going to move now to Slide 7. There are so many ways that IDEX is in this fight. In our Fluid & Metering segment, we enable food, energy, and industrial supply chains. In Fire & Safety/Diversified, we've acted swiftly to quadruple the production of our mobile medical tents used by hospitals as they struggle to handle the surge in COVID-19 cases. And in Health & Science Technologies, we're making compressors used in ventilators, mobile carts that produce hospital grade air where it's not available, and compressors for mobile disinfecting sprayers. And, of course, we're also a critical supplier enabling the genetic sequencing that decoded the RNA of the coronavirus, enabling the development of tests for COVID-19 and its antibodies, as well as finding therapies and hopefully, an eventual vaccine. There are dozens more examples across the company where we bring essential products to a market in need. I'm turning now to Slide 8. I want to pause here for a moment and thank all of our people across IDEX, especially those in manufacturing, shipping, and other roles that require a presence in our facilities. We have robust safety protocols at our sites worldwide to protect our people performing essential jobs. The safety of our people will always be the most important consideration as we continue in this new environment. In a crisis, especially one as devastating as this, your true values are exposed. I've never been prouder of the people of IDEX. From the first sign of the COVID-19 crisis in China, our teams have been collaborating, problem-solving, and acting. While great strategy is a product of this crisis, we're also seeing the best in who we are. I'm now moving on to Slide 9. On March 20, I held a conference call with investors, where I laid out our operating context and our priorities to steer IDEX successfully through this crisis. Much has changed in five weeks, but our point of view and our priorities remain the same. We've built our strategy and our operating plans based on four phases of this evolving crisis. I believe we're now moving out of Phase 1, the acute phase; and into Phase 2, which will be a period of ongoing uncertainty and significant challenge for the next three to six months. There'll be a little visibility as quarantines are lifted, and we all work to gradually restart the economy safely. During this phase, we expect to see a significant drop in demand and production capability as customers, suppliers, and our own teams are regularly impacted by shutdowns and shortages. The third phase will be learning to live and work with COVID-19. This will require significant changes to much of what we do, and this period will extend until there is a solution that gives people confidence to engage socially and professionally without fear. While this phase will not be easy, we've seen from our businesses in China, which have rebounded quickly that we can successfully pivot our approach. The final phase will be the post virus world. I know we all look forward to this day when normal returns. I'm convinced, however, that normal will be redefined just as it has been another severe crisis. Like the Great Depression, the Second World War, 9/11, and The Financial Crisis, there will be significant and permanent societal and economic changes. The coronavirus will shape our lives and our economy in countless ways, some easily predictable and others yet unknown. Over the next 12 to 18 months, as we move through these phases, it is our job as leaders to successfully transverse phases one through three and enter Phase 4 with a company that's financially strong and an organization that is positioned to thrive. I'm now turning to Slide 10. We've outlined four strategies that guide our way to a better future. Our top priority is safety, protecting our teams as we try to remain open to serve customers that are essential to our society. While we are normally highly decentralized, this is a time when we have carefully weighed safety protocols and mandated certain standards worldwide. These have included temperature checks at the beginning of all shifts, guidelines for face coverings, cleaning and sanitizing practices, and processes for addressing a variety of scenarios from COVID-19 cases to possible exposures. Our COVID-19 issues and response team has led the way and regularly provides guidance to our local sites as issues arise. And because of the strong procedures we have in place and the handful of incidences where employees have contracted the virus, few if any coworkers have been quarantined. Not only is this good for business, but it's great for the health, well-being, and morale of our employees. I'm glad to report that every IDEX employee who has contracted COVID-19 has so far recovered. To ensure business continuity, which is our second priority, we have developed plans for each site to use in the event of a ramp down of operations. We want to ensure these are handled smoothly and in a way that prepares the business to return quickly to operations. We are also regularly addressing supply chain concerns. While our supply chains are generally shorter than many of our other global manufacturers, we have quickly addressed issues from lockdowns and travel restrictions. So far, our business continuity planning, like our security plans, have helped us avoid more significant business disruptions. In the months ahead, we expect we'll be choppier. This extensive planning and support structure we've built should serve our businesses well. Our third area of focus is liquidity. IDEX entered this time with a strong cash position and we have remained cash flow positive since the beginning of the crisis. Our goal is to remain so throughout, protecting our liquidity and our balance sheet. We're working with our businesses and finance leaders to help them manage through a period unlike anything they've seen in their careers. Bill Grogan, our CFO, has instituted daily cash management practices that he is working with all of our leaders across the globe. Finally, we're playing offense. That means different things in different areas of our business. In some instances, it means pivoting to focus on the needs of customers who are now booming as they're selling essential products. In other instances, it's meant helping businesses in need, like we did in Novotema that's just outside Bergamo in Italy that was closed. Our sister company, PPE in England, stepped in and produce seals for a medical ventilator manufacturer as the Novotema was struggling. Playing offense also means being prepared to accelerate acquisitions when the market unfreezes and a thoughtful approach to share repurchases. With that, I'm going to pause here. I'm going to turn things over to Bill, and he is going to walk you through an overview of our financials and liquidity. Thanks, Bill. Hey, everybody, I'm on slide 15. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we believe the next three to six months are going to be extremely challenging. Everyone will face the same uncertainty as we reopen the economy safely and execute environment, where COVID-19 exists and impacts operations potentially in waves. While we believe strongly in the IDEX business model and we're very well-positioned, we acknowledge the challenges that we face across our business units. We expect revenue in the second quarter could be down as much as 15% to 25%. We know that some of our end markets will be significantly challenged, but those headwinds will be somewhat offset as we continue to deliver mission-critical components to essential customers worldwide. We've taken prudent actions to significantly reduce our discretionary cost across our businesses and the steps we took in the fourth quarter of 2019 have positioned us to react to a market that is significantly more challenging than we expected when we started the year. We are closely monitoring our markets and our businesses and we will react quickly to changes. To conclude, I'm extremely proud of how our employees have responded to this crisis. And even though the next 12 to 18 months will be challenging for all of us, I know that we will meet this challenge and come out stronger on the other side. With that, let me pause here and turn it over to questions from the audience. Thank you. Good morning, Deane. Hey, it's great to hear the IDEX team, and I'm wishing everyone the best. I appreciate the \u2013 all the details in terms of the potential scenarios this morning. And the first question really picks up where Bill left off on Page 14 on those scenarios... Yes. Yes. Even do we, Deane. Yes. Yes, you bet. So, first of all, that first look at the $120 million, that stuff that we are very actively putting our arms around and taking the cost out of. And obviously, you can see that it even impacted in a positive way to some degree in the first quarter, because we started those actions really as we are coming into February and early part of March, and so there's some benefits there. So, we're grabbing that lever already, and we're grabbing it very aggressively, Deane. So that's the first thing. One of the main priorities that I have going through this crisis is to maintain as much of the structure and the talent that we can in IDEX appropriately. And so, I'm willing for a short period of time to eat some of the incremental costing to maintain that talent base and to position the company well. That being said, as you know, we're a very diversified and decentralized business. And so, you have companies that \u2013 some companies are absolutely growing in this environment and some are really taking it on the chin. And so, we'll have to get the appropriate footprint in the appropriate places depending upon how much deeper and how much longer this goes. And \u2013 but our first priority is to certainly keep the integrity of IDEX intact as much as possible. So, I look at that that secondary group of actions, that the incremental $40 million as steps that we will take if we have to, but would prefer not to, Deane. In terms of decrementals, if you look at it on a sequential basis versus year-over-year, I think, that's probably a good way to look at it. Obviously, we're a very high contribution margin company. So, we're \u2013 we have contribution margins in the low-60s. And so, if we can offset a good chunk of that and end up in the 40s or 50s without having to make massive structural changes to the company, we would do so within the short term. But obviously, in the longer-term, you've got to have the appropriate cost structure. Yes. Well, some of that is in our control and some is not. In terms of overall playing offense, we're doing some of it right now, Deane. We are \u2013 if you look across our businesses, those places where essential products are booming, so disinfection, many of our Health & Science markets, pharma reshoring, which we think is going to be a major trend. We're playing offense now. We have redirected our people and investment and are making sure that we can first and foremost help with this fight but also make sure that we're doing the right things for our shareholders, our owners. And so, some of that's happening now. As it regards to M&A, there are really two challenges with M&A. First \u2013 the first one is having enough confidence in your own situation to deploy that liquidity in that balance sheet, and the second is that you have willing sellers. We are doing an awful lot of work right now on both sides of that equation. So let me talk about the liquidity side. So, there's liquidity that is to survive that a lot of people are having to utilize. And at the end of this, they will have a stretched balance sheet in the very difficult circumstances. That is not our situation, and I don't want it to be our situation. Our drive and why we have so much focus on this breakeven level of cash flow is because I want a balance sheet that is deployable \u2013 aggressively deployable as the world starts to settle itself. And so, if we can maintain this north of $1 billion of liquidity, as cash flows become more certain and the markets stabilizes, we will get aggressive, no doubt about that. Now the other side of that equation is who are the sellers. And so, as you can imagine right now, and you guys are talking to a lot of folks, that's frozen \u2013 it's just a frozen marketplace. I think it will take through a quarter or so for that to start to unfreeze when Boards of Directors and families are going to look at this situation and recognize that it's going to take a while and that an attractive price in this marketplace might make sense. But I think it will take a little bit of time, Deane. Thanks, Deane. Good morning, Mike. Yes. So I'd \u2013 what I'd first say is that the 15% is our experience as March unfolded and what we're seeing here in early April. And being a short cycle business, we certainly saw the reaction pretty quickly, both on the ups and the downs, by the way, in terms of the things that are struggling. The industrial businesses are certainly taking it on the chin, more so than other businesses. So if you look at FMT, that's just going to be more painful there. You've got the combination of the coronavirus impact and then, of course, what's happening in the energy world that that's unfolding. So that 15% is what we've been experienced here for, call it, six, seven weeks, Mike. My view is, it's likely to get worse than the 15%, and we see kind of slippage happening in a number of places that especially have more impact if you've got, say, if you're in energy, you're in transportation, those places, in particular, are really getting pounded and others are holding up. So I feel pretty comfortable with that range, Mike. Yes. Yes. I think one of the things that really works in our favor in this environment is our structure. It could be an impediment. We put that rapid response team in place very early on, because we knew that, that our decentralization and in terms of kind of how we're structured worldwide, we knew that we could end up with kind of 45 different answers. And so there were certain things that you just couldn't have 45 different answers on, and we've been able to move very quickly. In this case, in terms of playing offense, Mike, our structure helps us a ton, because the places that are really struggling with massive demand falloffs, you can isolate them specifically and you can start redirecting resources to things that are exciting. I'll give you an example. So in the world of Health & Science, we have a significant demand for engineering right now because of all the new things that are developing, whether it's from testing, which you're seeing PCR tests take off that we're helping with, we needed engineering and we actually redirected engineering from our business in rescue to help our business in Health & Science. And so we're doing a bunch of things like that, Mike. So we're definitely moving to those opportunities and moving people and resources. In terms of the big structural changes that they're \u2013 I think they're going to happen around a lot of things touching our Health & Science world. I think if I think about, say, the food, supply chain, that's going to be an area that I think will be impacted. There's a lot of talk of reshoring in terms of moving things out of more difficult or more risky environments. I think that will happen, that was already happening, but it's not like a big boom, I think, it's a relatively slow phase. But overall, I feel like we're positioned well and our structure really helps us move to the areas where opportunity and demand are likely to be and move away from places they're likely to be hit harder. Yes. After. Correct, Bill? Bill, that's right, isn't it? Yes. Yes. Thanks. Yes. Thanks, Scott. Yes. Yes, plus or minus. Yes. Yes, that's close enough. Yes. Oh, I gotcha. Yes. Okay. I think I understand your question, Scott. But if I don't get it, right, just reiterate or help me out here. So the $120 million is an annual number, right? And because we're not that seasonal and our fixed cost structure doesn't \u2013 isn't that variable, you could basically take the $30 million a quarter. And that that's going to come out of there. And that's pretty much coming out now. It might be a little bit more as time goes on, but that \u2013 that's coming up pretty darn rapidly. And that's what enables you to go from instead of having to be a 62% or 63% negative flow through, that's what helps you kind of ratchet or ratchet that down over time. So, Bill, is there anything you'd add there? Does that answer your question, Scott? Yes. It's \u2013 I mean, we've clamped down so hard here that we're not spending money on things that don't have kind of a direct that aren't essential, right? That $120 million is really clamping that down. There is, to some degree, Scott, it is an amount. But more than anything else, it's what we think the duration is going to look like, right? So if we're going to reset the business, let's just say, down 20%, let's just use that number, just as an example. And you're no longer a $2.5 billion company, you're now a $2 billion company. You have to have a different cost structure, right, if you think that's going to be sustained for a period of time. And so that's what we're really trying to evaluate is, what we think the duration and the depth is likely to be and it's a combination of those two that would trigger us to look at the $40 million. We didn't feel like we had to do that today. We felt like we should buy ourselves some time, and we have with the $120 million. And so we'll continue to evaluate that, as you know, we took out a big chunk here. In the fall, we took out $15 million and we had another $5 million, which obviously we've gone and got. So we were \u2013 although, we hadn't predicted this, we did predict a tough year. And so we went and proactively got that $20 million out. And so we'll decide on depth and duration here as we go through this quarter to figure out whether or not we want to take out the other $40 million. It is, yes. That's right, Scott. And I want to be very clear Bill said that in his remarks, but just so everyone hears this correctly. We are not \u2013 do not use these as guidance for where we think the world is going. This is really, for example, only, and we're trying to get a couple of messages across here and I think probably they've landed, but just in case. Message one was, there's a lot that can happen in this world before we become \u2013 before we have a cash flow issue. And therefore, we don't have a liquidity issue. We have tons of liquidity, but we're not going to \u2013 I don't believe we're going to have to utilize that liquidity to stay afloat. I want to utilize that liquidity to play really aggressive offense. And so, hopefully, that came across the number one, we're a great position from a cash flow standpoint; and number two, our liquidity is really being pointed towards playing offense from the moment is correct aggressively. Great. Thanks, Scott. Hey, Nathan. Yes. Yes. Yes. I'll comment on this and then Bill, I'll let you comment on it also. From \u2013 in terms of how we're managing this, I think this in a couple of ways. The first one is inventory. We got to make sure it comes out naturally, as volume gets affected, right? And that is \u2013 that has been a winning move in any slowdown for us. And historically, we have taken out inventory, and that's obviously had a very positive cash effect in any kind of slowdown. So you should expect us to continue to do that and take cash off the balance sheet, or cash out an inventory rather in \u2013 on the balance sheet. In terms of payables and receivables, my philosophy here is don't be the bank, meaning, we can't get caught between customers and suppliers. At the same time, I want to be very careful about not damaging customers and suppliers in here. So if we can end up neutral in that regard and really play that strategically, I think, that's important. Obviously, we've got suppliers that we want to make sure they are healthy, they're our partners, this is not a time to beat on them when they're struggling, at the same time, we can't finance them. And so, as our customers are coming to us and asking for a relief, we're really weighing that against what we can do across the working capital spectrum. And so, we're being pretty firm. We've got excellent service levels, we've got great lead times competitively. We're not going to become the bank. Yep. Yes. I'm pretty hopeful that we can stay positive. The price that we put out in the beginning of the year is \u2013 was already out and going. And so I don't see why that won't stick. I think there will be some challenges next year as we think about pricing about whether or not we can \u2013 how aggressive we can be there. Bill, on those two topics, do you want to \u2013 you want to give your your view? Thanks, Nathan. Hey, good morning, Allison. Yes. Yes. So I think \u2013 we've had a lot of things come out of us, Allison, in terms of opportunities that \u2013 where people have come to us on trying to help with very specific things relative to the COVID-19 crisis. And as we have evaluated those, we've been pretty careful. And what I mean by that is, what we don't want to do is take a bunch of people and resources and shift them to something where the lead time is so long, that effectively when you bring your solution to bear, it doesn't matter anymore. And so there are going be a bunch of boom and bust cycles in this \u2013 of different things that are coming to market, both because they're very effective and then they're just no longer needed, or they weren't particularly effective and they wash away. And so we're trying to avoid those kinds of things. And we're trying to move the portfolio to things that are really about helping a fight, where we have capabilities and we can ramp really quickly. And I use the the mobile medical tents out of our Vetter unit in Germany. We sold more in the month of March and we sold as much in the month of March, as we sold all of last year. And so we've ramped that up. They've literally quadrupled their overall capacity here as we go through the \u2013 with the rest of this year. And so that, that makes a ton of sense. It doesn't take any major investment or capability that we don't have. So we're moving to those sorts of things very aggressively. As we think longer-term, I think there are some trends here that are very natural for us. So obviously, around global testing that was already a trend that was growing and it was what we had positioned ourselves behind an IDEX Health & Science, and that is going to accelerate, I think, that's indefinite. And what I mean by testing is testing to kind of anything and everything that analytical equipment is used for and biodiagnostic testing is used for. That stuff is just going to continue to grow very aggressively and we're going to continue to position ourselves against that. And then things like, I think the pharma reshoring is the real deal. And so our material process business, as an example, will absolutely play in that. And I think that's going to be a long-term trend. It's going to take a long time for that to happen. But I believe that sort of thing is going to develop. And then you have kind of all those other trends that I think are going to get accelerated, because people frankly, have had to change their lives so much, that it's going to be easier to move into some of these trends. I'm thinking trends like digitization, mobile communications, and how that impacts even, say, a viking pump, where the customer is going to become a lot more comfortable utilizing and expecting digital results and information-based results, and I think that will move some of those things forward faster. Yes. Yes, that's a great question, Allison. And I think kind of moving from East to West in terms of how this has \u2013 this crisis has unfolded, we've been learning along the way and we've done a few things. So our Chinese businesses, they really lead the way here in creating protocols for safe working. And we have every single one of our plants is up right now. Not everything's at full capacity, but even our places in Northern Italy are up and working. And I'll give a lot of credit to that, because we learned very early on how to ramp down, how to ramp back up and how to work in an environment, where the virus is with you. And we've created a protocol and a playbook out of that. We then changed that and augmented that for different parts of the world. And we actually very soon, we actually shared that with the Mapi Group, the Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity & Innovation, we shared with them that and they shared it with all of their members. And our team just did a great job putting that together. And so that that's the basis of that and we're continuing to learn. We also here, I guess, it was last week, we did a general managers call, a global general managers and site managers call and we had four of our general managers from Italy on that call, taking people through their experience. And I mean, the physical experience of what they've gone through the emotional side of it, how to keep people safe, we did a kind of a virtual lunch and learn for everybody around those learnings. And so one of the things that we're trying to leverage here is the network effect of having so many sites around the world, where we can learn and share and get the best practices out in people's hands. So we've been trying to do that really intently, Allison. Thank you, Allison. Good morning, Joe. Yes. So, Joe, I think as you know, we are principally a midstream player. And so we're not really anywhere near the wellhead, for the most part, we have some things here and there, but not a ton. Look, across the energy business, which today is sub-10% of our total portfolio, we have an expectation that that's really going to get hammered here. So far we haven't had that \u2013 it hasn't been as severe as we expected to be, but we are certainly seeing all of those indicators now on the order front. And so we'll have to get our cost structure right and our overall footprint right to make sure that we can sustain there. We \u2013 I think everybody learned the lesson in 2015, 2016 that the overall impact of capital spending and how the energy economy impacts the global economy can't be overestimated, right? It's \u2013 that that's going to be \u2013 obviously, it's going to exacerbate this whole situation. And we're going to have to make sure that our businesses are positioned correctly as we go forward. But thankfully, we're not in the \u2013 on the wellhead and seeing some of these just ridiculous declines. And we will see declines, but it won't be like we're seeing upstream. Yes. Yes. Joe, I think, that question as we move now through that, what I call Phase 3, is going to be one of the most important questions that we're wrestling with, because when you think about a manufacturing facility, especially one that is principally assembly and test, I mean, obviously, we do have businesses that are more than that. But we tend to be like machining, assembly and test and we have a couple of businesses that have the foundries and that's pretty unusual, though. In a world like that, obviously, we've all embraced lean manufacturing here for many decades. And the natural output of lean manufacturing is cellular manufacturing, which does not work with social distancing the way it's constructed today, people are not six-feet apart. And so we're already in the process of doing that is how do you see the elements, how do you keep the elements of lean manufacturing, which is the elimination of waste and bringing down lead times? How do you keep those while having the principles of social distancing in place, and that's something that we're working on. I know a lot of people are. And we're not going to move to batch manufacturing. We're not going to do that sort of thing and destroy three decades of great work. But it does change how people work and not just in the manufacturing environment, it's going to change in the office environment, it's going to change it how we interact with customers. So many things like that are going to change and tell people have that comfort to be closer together again. Thank you, Joe. Hey, Andrew. I would. Yes. Yes, yes. So I think, as you look at, say, let's look at FMT first. I think that, obviously, the whole agricultural space has been really beaten up. But I do believe that the food supply chains are going to be continued to be really critical. And I think that's an overall a good trend as you talk about Ag in terms of where we play there. And that would be both for the material handling business, material process business and for Banjo. I put in both of those. Our ABS business, we are seeing some benefits of actually \u2013 there's some very interesting analytics that can be done for what's going on in sewer systems, believe it or not, I know that sounds incredibly strange. But there's a whole bunch of modeling that \u2013 and analytics that are allowed to or can happen because of our ability to monitor those systems. So our ABS business, we think will probably hold up pretty well in there. And then I think that the more industrial facing, kind of general industrial is going to have a bunch of things that are pretty negative, offset by small things that are positive. So, example, if you're selling into the chemical industry, obviously, there are some chemicals around disinfectants and things like that, that are absolutely booming. And then you have other things that are going into large CapEx that are likely to really struggle. So there are a few trends there over and diversified. On the Fire side, the \u2013 interestingly enough, there are a number of applications, where you can use some of that technology for disinfectant. So you'll see some of that. You've got a really long \u2013 very, very long pipeline of \u2013 for \u2013 in the fire business for trucks in the U.S., particularly you've got over a year of backlog. What we don't know yet is, whether or not we'll see cancellations. We have not seen that yet, but we'll have to monitor that pretty closely. The \u2013 we've seen in China the rescue business pick back up aggressively has slowed down as tenders slowed down and then has picked back up aggressively. And so I think those hold up. BAND-IT and dispensing both, I think, take it on the chin here in the short-term because of their exposure one, around the retail space and for dispensing and then for BAND-IT, you've got some exposure to transportation and oil and gas that will get hit, but other parts will do quite well. Thanks. Yes, I think FMT will fair \u2013 will be the most challenged and then diversified and then Health & Science. Yes. Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, Brett. Yes. Yes. Just to make sure I understand, Brett, the question you're asking, are you asking kind of the range of outcomes kind of business-by-business, like how bad to how good? Is that what you're asking? Yes. Yes. We've got a couple of businesses that we think are going to be down in that 40% range. Very few are \u2013 is that severe, but they \u2013 you do have a couple. And again, it's energy, transportation exposure, we don't have really hospitality exposure, so to speak, so we don't have that. But we do have some businesses that are down there that much. And we expect we'll probably in the next quarter or two, we'll have that kind of impact. We don't think that will stay long. And I think that to your your question, our experience in China has been a very, very aggressive snapback and \u2013 but it's actually bifurcated. You have businesses that are kind of COVID facing, so to speak, that are helping with the fight, that are growing like crazy. And then you've got a few businesses that are kind of really in the dumpsters, but it's actually come back pretty quickly. I don't think that that's the model for the rest of the world and for a number of reasons. Obviously, China has some very unique circumstances in how they are able to manage people and businesses and democracies just don't have those tools. And that's the cost of democracy, which is, I think, a good cost. And so I think it's going to look a lot more like we're seeing in Europe, which is, you're going to see people starting to figure out how to live with this virus and figure out how can you still have social distancing, but get back to work, get back to friends and family. And so that means, it just takes longer, and that's what we're seeing certainly in Italy and that's what I expect here. And just to be clear, our expectation here is that this is going to be fits and starts. I'm not someone who has bought into a super aggressive, everything gets fine in the fall sort of thing. I think that's crazy talk. And I think we have to face the reality that's in front of us. And what if we get lucky and for some reason, this goes away with whether or something else or a vaccine is found more quickly than we think, or you have very, very effective treatments. Great news. I don't think anybody should bank on that, and I certainly wouldn't manage the company expecting that. Yes. Yes, we've never been a company that has the classic sort of high recurring revenue, so to speak. And the reason I say that is that, we don't have a big parks business, but we tend to sell into like-for-like in a very, very high percentage of our applications. And so, Bill, I don't know, what's your estimate of total sort of recurring? How would you characterize that? Yes, I agree with that. And so, look, when you had the financial crisis, our total business was down 14%. during that year right after that over the entire year. Our Health & Science business was down 5%, and I think our industrial businesses were down, say, 20% in those environments, which set itself off. We have a better portfolio positioning than we did then, meaning, it's less cyclical and there's more Health & Science in the mix. And so I feel good about that. So overall, I think, our portfolio and our positioning is pretty good. Albeit, there will be a couple of places that will get hit really hard. Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Wal. Yes. I think historically, the municipal businesses have had 18 months to two-year lag time compared to other businesses. And that's really driven by receipt, right, especially in the Western world. The \u2013 as you \u2013 as the receipts come in, that really sets the overall operating capital budgets. And so I expect there to be a little bit quicker reaction than you saw in the financial crisis. That \u2013 in the financial crisis, that took time, I remember that well, where the municipal businesses held up really well that we \u2013 as we went into that crisis. And then they started to really struggle as you got into 2008 \u2013 excuse me, 2010, 2011. It \u2013 that took some time for that to make its way through and then had \u2013 obviously had \u2013 has had a pretty strong overall run. I expect that will generally follow a similar path, although, I think it'll be more. I think people act faster just because it's been such a shock to the global system and everybody's top of mind that municipalities are going to probably clamp down a little more quickly on their spending. I expect to see that, but I do think it will still lag the overall industrial economy. Yes. Yes, you bet. So we did buy just over $100 million of shares. We had a 10b5-1 in place going into this, and so we did buy just over $100 million. We did shut that 10b5-1 down, as we looked at the value of liquidity and the uncertainty that we were in. We valued this certainty more than we did the incremental share buyback. So we did pause that. Look, I know there's going to be a lot of \u2013 people are going to be looking really hard at those who buy back shares and I know in some ways it's turned into a political football. I don't think that we are in that category number one, obviously, we're kind of pretty low on the overall visibility food chain here, so I don't worry too much about that. Second, we're not going to be a company that takes cash from the government, I can't see where we're going to do that in a way that restricts us in any way to our behaviors. And then finally, look, we are going to utilize our liquidity the best way we can to help all of our stakeholders. And if what that means is to buy back shares, then we will do so appropriately. In terms of what we have in total, I can honestly say, we only have the $500 million that we got authorization for back a few weeks ago, plus you add that on, I think, Bill, to what about? Yes... Yes. Thank you. Yes. Yes. You've got \u2013 there are two stories in there, Matt. So the first one is yes, there is absolutely a pickup from COVID-related activities. There's no doubt about that, that we're seeing in life sciences. But also, we have a number of very important customers that have programs that are ramping. And we have won some substantial business and we had some really nice orders here in the quarter relative to that. And so that's been strong. So it's both ongoing programs that are really important and then you've got the impact of COVID-19 to get two things going at once. And, Bill, I don't know what \u2013 in total, what does that make up of the $50 million of backlog, Bill? Yes. So that will give you a sense, Matt. Great. Thank you very much, and thank you all for being on the call. I know that we're sitting in a time that has shaken us in many ways. And I think I'd like to close with a couple of comments. My first one is that, as I said in my prepared remarks, I could not be more proud of how the team here at IDEX has handled this. I have seen a level of collaboration and teamwork and positivity that \u2013 it really warms the heart. It's just incredible. And when you see that, sometimes the news cycles have a tendency to get you down. And \u2013 but when you see how people are coming together in the real world and tackling this, it is awesome, and it's why I'm in business. I believe that the purpose of business is to make life better, and I could not be more proud of the team at IDEX for what they've done. It's just remarkable. Second, I'd like to say thank you to, everybody, who is on this call and your interest in IDEX. We \u2013 while the IDEX brand is not well-known in the consumer world, we play a very important role in a lot of places that really do matter. And that mission that I talked about trusted solutions and improving lives, we live that here at IDEX. And we're seeing in this crisis in this fight with COVID-19 how important that is. And I want to thank the people who are investors in the company and prospective investors for your support, your partnership as we move through this, and we will move through this and we will get to the other side and we will have a very strong company that's positioned extremely well. So thank you, everybody. I appreciate it and look forward to discussions as we go forward. Take care."

This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor language in last night's press release and in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I'll now turn this call over to our CEO, Eric Ashleman.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you, Allison. I'm on Slide 6. 2021 year was another record year for IDEX. We hit all-time highs on most of our key metrics. Demand for our differentiated technology remains strong. This underlying momentum combined with our targeted growth initiatives and ability to capture price drove a strong rebound from 2020. Across most of our portfolio, we saw an expansion beyond pre -pandemic revenue levels. In the fourth quarter, we achieved a record for orders and sales and our backlog position is very strong as we enter 2022. We expanded our margins in a highly inflationary environment. We levered well in the previous investments we made to optimize our cost position and executed on our productivity funnel. We maintained positive price cost, albeit at a compressed level versus historic performance. We remained diligent in controlling our discretionary spend and used our 80/20 principles to allocate resources to our most promising opportunities. Our strategic focus, purposeful resourcing, and strong operating cash flow enabled us to deploy record capital.  We acquired ABEL Pumps and Airtech and made a collaborative investment in a technology company driving advancements in connected products. We also invested across the portfolio to support growth and productivity. We optimized our cost position within our Fluid & Metering technology segment through a consolidation of our Italy facilities and our energy businesses and delivered on operational productivity projects across the segment. All of this drove a record year in orders, sales margins, earnings, and capital deployment. We said in the past that we built IDEX to outperform through a cycle, and we continue to find ourselves in a very challenging one, characterized by supply chain disruptions and labor scarcity exacerbated throughout the year by the emergence of new COVID-19 variants. Our view continues to be that we don't see gradients of bad, rather the supply chain environment is very tough and numerous challenges persist. As pockets of issues improve, they tend to be replaced by new obstacles. Our teams have done an excellent job navigating these day-to-day operational issues.  And I'd like to take a moment to thank our IDEX employees around the globe for their dedication and perseverance throughout this prolonged period of disruption. The agility of our teams, adjusting to new issues almost every day has been and continues to be outstanding. As we look forward to 2022, we did not see any near-term signs of diminishing supply chain related headwinds, and the impact of COVID-19 remains highly variable. In the short term, these conditions have and will impact our ability to efficiently ramp production and have created significant pockets of disruption for our customers and suppliers as well. We expect that these challenges will remain at a high level, at least through the first half of 2022. Regardless of the near-term challenges, our overall IDEX strategy remains focused on the horizon. The core of what makes IDEX strong, highly engineered, specialized products used in mission-critical applications, remains a solid driver for long-term success will continue to deploy capital and invest in the resources necessary to drive organic growth in order to capitalize on a robust demand environment.  Our balance sheet has ample capacity and we will leverage that strength to continue to play offense in M&A. To that end, we expect to close on the acquisition of Next Site later this quarter. The technologies and capabilities within their business segments will nicely complement our water platform within FMT. With that, I'll turn to our outlook for our segments on page seven. In our Fluid & Metering Technology segment, we anticipate growth in our industrial day rate businesses in 2022 with a return of larger projects towards the latter half of the year. And the short term, large projects continue to lag as our customers have limited capacity to execute larger upgrades or expansions. Agriculture is expected to perform well due to high crop prices, strong farmer sentiment, and limited availability of new equipment driving aftermarket demand. Our municipal water business is stable. We see improved optimism in the market and project planning activities increasing. We are expecting an uptick in the energy and chemical markets. The North American mobile truck market is improving due to a strong construction market in home heating oil prices, and North American pipelines are reporting modest, increase capital budgets for 2022. We see international oil and gas quote activity outpacing domestic demand, an opportunity we are well-positioned to capitalize on. FMT continues to be in a strong position to realize price and we expect this to drive improved margins in 2022. Likewise, the projects we completed last year to optimize our cost position as well as new operational productivity projects will yield strong flow-through in 2022, tempered by a discretionary spending rebound and continued resource investment in the segment.  Moving to the Health & Science Technology segment. We expect the strongest growth in HST of all our three segments, and we plan to make the largest resource investments in HST to support that growth. We anticipate margin improvement driven by volume leverage, parts -- partly offset by these resource additions. HST continues to have robust demand across all their major end markets; Semiconductor, Food and Pharma, Analytical Instrument -- Instrumentation, and Life Sciences are all expected to perform well. Next-gen sequencing instrument demand is growing with research and clinical applications outpacing COVID detection and surveillance. Our ability to execute in the current environment continues to distinguish us from our competition and improve our share position. On the Semiconductor side, we continue to capitalize on tailwinds generated from global broadband and satellite communication trends. In auto, supply chain issues at our customers, especially around semiconductors mute our growth. Underlying market demand remains favorable and we expect our results to imp rove a supply chain issues ease. The industrial businesses within the segment faced similar trends to FMT. Finally, we expect that our Fire & Safety Diversified Products segment will be our most challenge next year.  In Fire and Safety, North American OEMS are experiencing significant supply chain constraints around chassis and component availability, which limits their production. On the rescue side, we anticipate that larger tenders will lag compounded by China localization policies that are driving delays. We do not anticipate near-term easing of these conditions and see the potential for recovery towards the latter part of 2022. In our banded business, like in HST, we see auto supply chain issues dampening current demand. Despite this pressure, our business continues to outperform the broader market due to our content on key vehicle models. Lastly, in the near term, we expect continued momentum within our dispensing business as customer capital investments are deployed in early 2022. However, for the year, we will see a non-repeat of North America projects as we reach the end of the replenishment cycle this year, as composed to last year. We anticipate that the unfavorable price cost position we experienced last year will rebound this year as annual contracts are renewed at current pricing.  We see this improvement tempered a bit by some mix pressure as dispensing volumes reduced, and we make some targeted investments. To summarize, we see favorable conditions across the majority of our end markets. However, the degree to which our customers and our facilities will be impacted by rolling supply chain and COVID related disruptions remains highly variable. We'll continue to monitor conditions and be as prepared as we can be for potential interruptions. Despite the short-term headwinds, we are optimistic about our growth potential and the trajectory of our end markets. With that, I'd like to turn over to Bill to discuss our financial results.\nBill Grogan: Thanks, Eric. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 9. Fourth quarter orders of $795 million were up 17% overall, and up 13% organically. Organic orders increased across each of our segments. For the year, orders were up 26% overall, and up 21% organically. We experienced a strong rebound in demand for our products across all our segments, and steadily built our backlog in each quarter of 2021 totaling $266 million for the year. Relative to full year 2019, organic orders were up 15%. Q4 sales of $715 million were up 16% overall, and up 11% organically. We experienced a strong demand rebound from 2020, but our results were tempered by supply chain and COVID production limitations. Full year sales of $2.8 billion were up 18% overall, and up 12% organically. We saw favorable results across all our segments and again, strong performance relative to full year 2019 with organic sales up 4%. Fourth-quarter gross margins expanded 20 basis points to 44%. For the full year, gross margins expanded 60 basis points and adjusted gross margins expanded 80 basis points to 44.7%, primarily driven by strong volume leverage. Q4 operating margin was 22.7%, up 10 basis points compared to prior year.  Adjusted operating margin declined 60 basis points driven by a rebound in discretionary spending, targeted resource investments, and the dilutive impact of acquisition-related intangible amortization, partially offset by volume leverage. Full-year operating margin was 23%, up 90 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 23.9%, up 110 basis points compared to prior year. I'll discuss the drivers of adjusted operating income on the next slide. Our fourth-quarter effective tax rate was 22.5% relatively flat compared to the prior year ETR of 22.2%. Our full-year effective tax rate was 22.5% compared to 19.7% in the prior year due to lower tax benefits associated with executive compensation and the non-repeat benefits associated with the finalization of the global intangible low-income tax regulations in 2020. Q4 net income was $119 million, which resulted in EPS of a $1.55. Adjusted net income was also a $119 million with adjusted EPS of a $1.55, which was up $0.18 or 13% over prior year adjusted EPS. Full-year net income was $449 million, which resulted in EPS of $5.88. Adjusted net income was $482 million, resulting in an adjusted EPS of $6.30 up $1.11 or 21 over prior year adjusted EPS.  The tax rate movement I mentioned drives a $0.23 differential in EPS as compared to the prior year. Said differently, our EPS would have expanded by a $1.34 or 26% had 2021 been taxed at the 2020 rate. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $136 million, 115% of adjusted net income. For the year free cash flow was $493 million, down 5% versus last year, and was 102% of adjusted net income. This result was impacted by a volume-driven working capital build and higher CapEx, partially offset by our higher earnings. We spent over $70 million on capital projects this year, an increase of over $20 million versus 2020. Moving on to Slide 10, which details the drivers of our adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income increased $125 million for the year compared to 2020. Our 12% organic growth contributed approximately $106 million flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. We levered well in this volume increase in our team's drove operational productivity to help mitigate the profit headwinds we experienced from increased supply chain costs and the associated inefficiencies.  Although we have maintained positive price cost for the year, inflation continues to ramp and we saw compressed price cost spread versus historic levels, which pressured our up-margin rate and flow-through percentages. The positive mix is primarily result of the portfolio and business mix normalizing to pre -pandemic levels that had a negative impact on our results last year. We reinvested $35 million back into the businesses, taking the form of a partial rebound in discretionary spending to pre -pandemic levels, higher variable compensation expenses, and targeted reinvestment in resources to drive growth. Despite this incremental spend and a challenging supply chain environment, we achieved a solid 38% organic flow-through for the year. Flow-through is then negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions in FX, getting us to our reported flow-through of 30%. With that, I'd like to provide an update on our outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2022.  I'm on Slide 11. As a reminder, going forward, we will be adjusting EPS for acquisition-related intangible amortization in both our guidance and results. Our fourth-quarter adjusted EPS under this definition would have been $1.71 per share, while our full-year 2021 adjusted EPS would have been $6.87 per share. Under this new definition for the first quarter of 2022, we are projecting GAAP EPS of $1.57 to $1.60 and adjusted EPS to range from $1.73 to $1.76. We expect organic revenue growth of 67% for the first quarter and operating margin of approximately 23%. Q1 expected results in cooperate headwinds arising from COVID driven absenteeism and supply chain production constraints. The first quarter effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 22.5%. We expect FX to be unfavorable to our top line by 1% and acquisitions to provide a 4% benefit. Corporate costs in the first quarter expected to be around $19 million. Turning to the full year 2022, we project GAAP EPS of $6.70 to $7 and adjusted EPS to range from $7.33 to $7.63. We expect full-year organic revenue growth of 5% to 8% and operating margins to be around 24%.  We expect FX to be unfavorable to our topline by 1% and acquisitions to provide a 2% benefit. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 22.5%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $90 million, an increase over 2021 as we continue to identify opportunities to reinvest in our core businesses. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately 105% of adjusted net income and corporate costs are expected to be approximately $80 million for the year. Our earnings guidance excludes impacts from future acquisitions and any future restructuring charges. Nextsite is excluded from the figures above, as the transaction has yet to close. Next, I will provide some additional details regarding our 2022 guidance for the full year. I'm on Slide 12. On an operational basis, we expect supply chain constraints to mitigate our output for the first half of the year, muting an otherwise strong demand environment. Therefore, we are projecting organic revenue for the year to be up 5% to 8%, which translates to an EPS impact of $0.60 to $0.95 depending on the topline results. This range also assumes improving price cost. We continue to drive operational productivity across the portfolio and expect to see benefits from our 2021 restructuring actions.  This will drive $0.20 to $0.25 of favorability next year. We also continue to invest in the resources required to grow in the current year-end and beyond. These investments will reduce EPS by $0.20 to $0.25 and are funded by the productivity gains I mentioned previously. Our discretionary spend partially recovered to pre-pandemic levels in 2021 and we expect this spending to be fully recovered by the end of 2022. The unfavorability impacts EPS by 20 - $0.25. I will note that we're ramping spend to pre -pandemic levels, but with 20% higher revenues. ABEL has 1 partial quarter and Airtech has 2 quarters inorganic results included in our guidance.  We expect acquisitions to contribute $54 million of revenue and $0.08 of EPS. The incremental amortization that we see in 2022 versus 2021 is largely related to these acquisitions and will provide an additional $0.05 of EPS. Now let's take a look at a couple of non-operational items. First, our guide assumes no impact from taxes are guided rate is flat year-over-year. Second, we expect a 1% headwind from FX, providing $0.07 of EPS pressure. So in summary, we are projecting organic revenue growth of 5% to 8% for the year. Adjusted EPS expectations on the range of $7.33 to $7.63, a 7% to 11% growth over 2021 implied in our guidance is mid to high 20s year-over-year flow-through on the low-end and 30% on the high end. With that, I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Bill. I'm on the final slide, Slide 13. Before we open the call up for questions, I'd like to wrap up with a summary of our most critical 2022 focus areas. In an environment characterized by uncertainty and disruption, it's important not to lose sight of who we are as a company. First and foremost, we are a portfolio of great businesses that leverage 8020 with an obsessive focus to serve our customers. We refer to that simple model as the IDEX difference. We're committed to navigating the challenges of the short-term landscape, but remain focused on the longer term. We must continue to utilize our 8020 toolkits to create efficient, innovative, value-creating businesses. In a world with this level of variability, the simpler you are, the more successful you will be. We remain committed to investing in the resources needed so our businesses are poised to take advantage of the growth potential in front of us. We are a company committed to its core values and we'll continue to develop top-performing teams as part of an inspiring company culture. Diversity, equity, and inclusion continues to be an area of focus, creating environments where people feel they belong and are comfortable bringing their true selves to work every day.  Our strong operating cash flow and balance sheet put us in a great position to continue to put capital to work, and we've already identified several high return organic investment opportunities across the company that will push us past our 2021 CapEx record levels. We have invested in new industrial automation that will improve efficiency and expand capacity for growth. We're supporting focus digitalization efforts are across our installed base to solidify our superior positions and expand share of wallet. Our facility expansions in China and India are well underway, effectively doubling future capacities to support growth across the. Lastly, our M&A opportunity pipeline continues to be strong, and we look forward to deploying additional capital in 2022, welcoming new businesses to the IDEX family. With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will begin docking a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Poliniak: Hey, good morning. Eric, you had talked about projects lagging in the first half in FMT. Could you maybe give us the color in terms of your customer conversations? Are they -- the risks that this sort of gets delayed indefinitely at this point, just the urgency around getting some of these projects going? Just any thoughts around that?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah, yeah. Good to talk Allison. So I mean, it's a bit of a continuation of the theme that we've seen now for a while as, there's plenty of confidence out there that there's lots of demand support to get things done. It is really difficult to do -- to just frankly bring together all the resources that you need to take a really complex project and take it from beginning to end. Lining up material, lining up resources, things like that. So what we are starting to see, frankly, are smaller to medium-sized versions of that. Slight expansions, things you can kind of do on the fly. And then continued staging for projects that are of those slightly larger incremental scale aspects, as people talk about that. I mean, quite honestly, it's the same thing that we're going through in our own business and we've got a couple of critical big projects that we've deployed they were really hard to put together. And then all over the place we're, while we're running doing those things that give you that little bit of 3% to 5% output let as we go. So I think that's really the nature of it. And of course, it varies depending on certain markets are further out ahead of that a little bit more positive some are lagging even further because they're just inherently involve larger chunks of infrastructure. But I was going to summarize it, I'd put it -- I'd describe it that way.\nAllison Poliniak: That's helpful. And then just -- the free cash flow guidance. You talked about CapEx and the increased spend there, which makes sense. I know working capital you showed some increases in '21. Should we expect a similar level at '22, just given the ongoing challenges that you guys are facing? Just trying to get some color on --\nBill Grogan: Allison, it's Bill. I think it tapered down a little bit, obviously, here and as we progressed through the year, a little bit of inventory build to support the higher revenue load, but I don't think it'll be as big of a build as we experienced last year. Our efficiency metrics are down a little bit, but some of that's just related to increased inventory to buffer extended lead times that we have across our vendor base.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it and I guess along with that, you guys are still on the message, but it's probably not a fair question. But are you guys kind of revisiting some of your processes in such to deal with some of these shocks that we have to go through at time-to-time. Just any thoughts on that.\nEric Ashleman: Allison, you're asking about the supply chain shocks in general?\nAllison Poliniak: The supply chain shock, I mean, are you guys trying to think if things differently going forward just to kind of avert some of this stuff at the [Indiscernible].\nEric Ashleman: I mean, it's a great question, something we've revisited continuously as we go on through this. I mean, we are -- I think we're -- from a high level, we're positioned really, really well. I mean, we do a lot of local supply, close proximity with people that we've known for a long time. Deep relationships, a lot of trust there, very collaborative. So I like that topology. I don't think we would try to change it or move it farther away. And any, frankly, any change right now is difficult because everybody's bandwidth constricted. So, a couple of places we're looking at that, it's kind of at the sharpest reason why. We just -- we have to do something different and we've got resources allocated there. I will say the one thing we're spending a lot of time working on. And I mentioned in the opening comments is simplification. You can generally see are businesses that have done the most there, are frankly having the easiest time of it. We have a highly customized model at the company. And so that's always an inherent challenge for us. So I think one of the things we've learned here, and we've gotten better at as we've gone along, just trying to find a way to say, is there a simpler way to do it more modular, simpler design that's easier to reproduce against a given supply base that will probably stay pretty similar for us as we go forward.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. Thanks so much. I will pass it along.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Halloran: Good morning everyone. Kind of related to Allison 's first question early to tack onto it. When you think about some of the [Indiscernible] seeing on some of these CapEx decisions just because of bandwidth or you also put into the context of the supply chain challenges in everything seeming to linger a little bit longer than people were thinking. How do you think about the risk of demand degradation or at least pipeline degradation that could materialize related to all of those moving pieces?\nEric Ashleman: Well, I mean, there's inherently always a little bit more risk as you extend things out than any other externality could jump into the mix and start to inflect decisions along the way. So I think that's there. I mean, as we've thought of the projects that we're working with -- when you consider a project across a long-term cycle, ones that feel the most assured about or where you can just see there's not enough capacity or there's a lot of labor challenges, these things aren't going to go away in the long-term. And when you see that condition, let's say if that's in a food market, that's somebody recognizing there's a lot of demand here, we're struggling to meet it, we know it's going to be there in the long run, while the projects themselves can be delayed and they keep extending, honestly, the conversations stay pretty active. The transfer documents and data and things is still going on, so you put those into a different category. The things that you can just tell are a little bit more susceptible to shocks, new technology, it's a launch, it's dependent upon certain conditions to be there, we probably put that in a slightly more variable category. But I honestly think over the long-term there's a lot more in the first that ultimately everybody would love to do if they could. And we've now seen, and certainly we've talked about before on this call, I think we're seeing the impact of not having it deployed as we tried to recover. From now, it just essentially at above levels that were sort of were here originally before the pandemic.\nMike Halloran: That's super helpful. And then sticking with the concept of moving pieces and how you're thinking about guidance for the year. Obviously, you have these first-quarter challenges with absenteeism and everything else, and then the price cost curve and how that works itself out through the year in the context and everything. So when you think about the guidance specifically, both on the margin side as well as on the revenue side, how would you think about profitability versus call it a normal sequential curve through the year? Is it a little bit or sloped to normal? And best guess for when you think you can start getting to something more normalized and not necessarily saying back to '19 levels of smoothness, but at least more repeatable or a better understanding of what the process can look like?\nBill Grogan: Hey Mike, it's [Indiscernible] some of that's to be determined how the year plays out but are -- what's implied in our guidance is, you will from a ramp as we progress through the year. It is obviously more weighted towards latter in the year but if you look at the second quarter, it's kind of a couple of percent ramp and output versus the first quarter and it has to hold there for the balance of the year. So relative to where we're at here and the challenges we have in the first quarter, there is an assumption that those were resolved. We do have some of the discretionary costs that have just built through 2021 that are in our current run rate for the second quarter. And as we ramp volume will lever on those incremental costs; I think you'll see our margin profile continue to expand sequentially as we progress through the year.\nMike Halloran: So the point, Bill, is that, there's not a massive assumption that there's normalization through the year. There's a step-up on [Indiscernible] 2Q because there's some identifiable things that normalize out. But beyond that, it's a little bit more wait-and-see and pretty normal sequentials from [Indiscernible] 2Q [Indiscernible], right?\nBill Grogan: Yes, as I said there's not some huge switch that needs to be flipped. I think we're comfortable with the ramp that we see here in the short-term. The second quarter seasonally always goes up for us, so we've got that on top of some of just the output relief, I think we'll get, and then it's, unless something created some headwind to decelerate, we should be in a reasonable position.\nMike Halloran: Appreciate it, Bill. Thanks Eric.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC, please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Hi, Dean.\nDeane Dray: I'd like to put the spotlight on these pockets of discretionary spending reinvestment, growth investment, if we could. So just so we're trued up. What was -- how much of that went into the fourth-quarter? So on slide ten, that $35 million did you kind of front-load any of that spending into the fourth-quarter or was that level throughout the year?\nBill Grogan: No. Deane, it ramped throughout the year, I think Q3 and Q4. There's marginal increase in the fourth-quarter. We talked about that in Q3 call that some things had moved from Q3 to Q4. That's one of the issues we have with the first quarter, is just last year, we were still extremely diligent and then spend a whole heck of a lot and then ramped 2, 3, and 4. So there's a little bit of ramp here as we progress from Q4 to Q1, but it's not overly material.\nDeane Dray: Got it. And then on Slide 12 for year '22 bridge, you've got the two buckets growth investments, and discretionary spend rebound. I mean, collectively that $0.40 to $0.50 in your guide, they both feel a little bit discretionary by definition, right? Where and how is that being targeted? Is that level throughout the year? Is it contingency in any way? And what would be the expected returns that you would get on some of these growth investments? Thanks.\nEric Ashleman: Sure. So a couple of things there. One, in general, the nature of this kind of spend, let's say today versus where it was three years ago, there are some differences. There's actually some productivity that we're all going to enjoy as we've learned how to work in different ways. Travel won't be as high as it ever was. Certainly, marketing and digital, ways to get messages out to customers, much more efficient than we've seen before. And so that's one of the reasons, even with the slight increases here in the ramp up, we're basically at a level we were three years ago with 400 million more dollars of sales in the Company.  What it's targeted towards is a lot of our investments, frankly, it's people, and it's people on the front-end of business and the technology side of the business tied to the parts of the Company that we think have the most favorable wind at their backs in terms of our positioning in the end markets that they are sitting in. So we talked before about kind of the top 25 bets across IDEX, that list ebbs and flows from year-to-year, but about 2/3 of it holds constant. In many of the resources that are here, some ways they're identified a year, year-and-a-half ago. We let the last year play out. We're really careful with things, but at some point, you start to see that, hey, we've got some real momentum here. And the nature of people driving the investments, they've got to get in, they've got to learn the company, they've got to learn the markets and then start to add some value.  So I think the return, as it often is in anything we do when we're supporting organic growth, is really strong. On investments of that type because it's people dependent. It also makes it pretty easy to be careful with as you go forward. So as Bill said, if we start to see things all of a sudden take a turn or there's something that it comes into the mix that none of us expected. By nature, we can hold off, we can do more with less, we can ask people that we deployed towards other areas across IDEX. So I think what you're seeing here a little bit is probably we would have liked to have more of that onboard and a more of an even ramp through the year last year. Again, because a lot of its people, as everybody knows, it's hard to find. When you find them, I think you want to be careful and make sure you bring them on board when you can. That's part of the mix too.\nDeane Dray: That's real helpful. And then just in context of the building backlog, and I might have missed this, I apologize, did you -- can you calibrate how many in the way of revenues could not be shipped, either you didn't have the products on hand or customers weren't ready, so you got finished goods, but have you calibrated what that would have been?\nBill Grogan: Yeah, we haven't. But in the fourth-quarter it's probably 3% to 5% organic that we could have had incrementally to what we delivered if we had full availability of parts and labor.\nDeane Dray: Got it. That's really helpful. And have you given the quick overview of Nextsite? It sounds like a really interesting addition to your water business.\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. I mean, it's a business we've known for a long, long time, and we've partnered with them with our sewer robots franchise there. They've been kind of closer to the customer and a partner for us. Frankly, there are predominant partner over the years. So essentially they're going to market here in North America predominantly. They do a lot of things around sewer inspection, have a few other answered products that go with that. There's some tremendous software capability embedded within that business that's used in that space and we think has appropriation abilities elsewhere in the water technology area. And a couple of other interesting nascent extensions that they've launched that we also are interested in potentially opening a door for us. So it's a really nice fit for a partner that we've known for a long time. And it was just the time is right to bring them into the IDEX family.\nDeane Dray: Great. We're hearing lots and lots of focus on storm water from municipalities and there's just such a need right now and there's loss regulatory pressures as well fines that will be imposed on municipalities that they don't address it, so hot area and nice to see that investment. Thank you.\nEric Ashleman: Compliance is a driver for our businesses in that space. Yes.\nDeane Dray: Thank you.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks Deane.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Wertheimer: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So my question is a pretty simple one. You had positive price cost in two segments, negative in Fire Safety, and maybe some of the distinctions are obvious there, but could you just kind of walk through the pace of how things flow through on pricing changes. If it's all due to that, if there's any inherent pricing power differentials, that'd be helpful too, but maybe just talk through the dynamics and what you do there. Thank you.\nBill Grogan: Sure. So the dynamics of price cost is obviously, it varies across the portfolio between the segments and the businesses. Holistically, FMT's are strongest price cost relative to a lot of their business goes through channel our ability to move price through there is favorable. Obviously, they've got more exposure to heavy casting metal, motor inflation but they have the power to offset at HSPs which were OEM focused. So there's opportunities but more on an annual basis on that side of it, and the stuff that looks like the FMT, the industrial parts of it, similar dynamics. FSD has been the challenge, primarily in our Fire and Rescue businesses. We talked about the flare OEM challenges and the large backlogs that they're sitting on in excess of 12 months to 18 months. And what we've priced that on, we haven't been able to re-price it. So we continue to work through the lower-margin profile on that through the back half of the year and most likely through the first half of this year. They've gone out with significant price increases here recently on any of the annual contracts that they have.  So they are poised for a large recovery and margin improvement as we progress through the year, but still challenged in the first half. Dispensing this fairly strong [Indiscernible] relative to their steel exposure and their automotive and aerospace customer base, they were challenged as well. So they were significantly under on the price cost, weighing down the overall organization, but a lot of good effort from the teams to manage through it. And I think are much better positioned as we stand here today to progress through the rest of the year.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay that's helpful. And is there anything, sort of structural changing on how you think about those long lead times backlogs and how you price? And then just one more quick one on Macron, you mentioned sick outs, which is universal expos on 1Q. Is that all requested in savings so that you're until the next wave you see the risk continued to 1Q or maybe January, February, and I'll stop there. Thank you.\nEric Ashleman: Yes, Rob. So the nature of pricing, I mean, I will say I think we and everybody else are looking at the historical ways that long-term pricing has been done and are finding ways to make sure that we've got more opportunities for investment along the way. As you suspect that given that the pressure and volume and it's just the nature of that space that's probably going to take a while, but that is in the mix in terms of innovation in different ways to handle it. On the virus, I'd say we're plateaued slight decrease, but we're such a -- we've got such a global topography that is, it decreases in one area and comes up and another one, so I'd say it's level right now not increasing anywhere but still at a higher rate than we've seen in any of the other episodes that have come across.\nRob Wertheimer: Thank you\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nNathan Jones: Good morning everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Hi, Nathan.\nNathan Jones: Wanted to start with a couple of questions following up on Deane's line on the growth in discretionary spend rebound. Those are really the two large buckets in 2022 that are dragging the incremental down from the level that we would normally expect from IDEX. Specifically, you guys said that your back to 2019 investment levels, on $400 million more revenue, IDEX has always been a big investor in growth, does that mean that we should expect potentially more incremental growth investments in 2023 or are you able to leverage those growth investments better? And do you think it's a one-year ramp up? And I assume the discretionary spend rebounded is probably anticipated to be back to normal levels by the end of 2022?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. I mean, again, because of the nature kind of our model and what those investments usually are in terms of people. I mean, to be honest, there's a bandwidth limit on the upper side that also governed some of this. These are not the kind of businesses where you can just endlessly pull people in there and it all works better. These are super, super targeted around and aligned highly to the best that we're talking about. And then sort of everything else, we leverage a lot of that productivity to actually support those investments and run the company that way. It's a pretty consistent level, so I really do think of this more along the lines of rebuilding a basic base to fuel growth of the company in the highly targeted way that we do it more than let's say a next chapter of spend profiling for the company. We don't need to do that.\nNathan Jones: So long-term I think you guys have always talked about when you were at low single-digit, you get 35% incremental margins, maybe getting to 40% if you got mid-to-high single-digit organic growth nothing has changed structurally in that outlook over the long-term wages in a period of bringing investments back up there a period of under investment boast on new by COVID.\nBill Grogan: Exactly. Nathan, I think you're pointing to discretionary. Is that being somewhat of a catch-up here as we progress through the last two years that will fall off, there will be nominal increases on that going forward. And then as Eric said, it's our normal investment profile. So if you normalize for the discretionary ramp, we're at our traditional mid-30s type of flow-through.\nNathan Jones: Okay, just wanted on capital deployment record level of acquisition spending in 2021, but you still have reached paper problems over there in -- under-levered balance sheet. And it would take several years of spending that record level of capital on acquisitions. to get you into a more optimal balance sheet structure. Is the pipeline robust enough and are there enough opportunities at the right prices out there for you to look to deploy similar amount of capital in '21 as we go for whatever the next few years\nEric Ashleman: Yeah, Nathan. I mean, that's exactly the target and the expectation here. I mean, we talked, I know for the last several quarters, about the intentionality we've put on this. Some of the investments in resources are focused in this particular area because they have to be. The achievements that we made in '21 I think was a direct result as they're all high-quality. I can assure you we looked at a lot more than those companies to get the ones that we brought in on the board, and that's the way we're thinking of it going forward. We'll consider evaluations will be high, competition will be fierce, and we have to make sure we get plenty of that vast as we go at it and hold our discipline at the same time. But we talked our ideal spot here would begin to lever load at this high, and the minimum is higher level of deployment that actually helps you build a more uniform resource basis to do the work. We're always looking for the potential to expand it. If in fact we can do that efficiently, manage the change across the company. So it is definitely an intentional travel to a higher level? Yes.\nNathan Jones: Thanks very much for taking my questions.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Nathan.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson, please proceed with your question\nMatt Summerville: Thanks. Given some of the pluses and minuses you talked about with respect to the margins as we progress through the year across the segments, how should we be thinking about the incremental margin at the segment level relative to the full-year guidance range you talked about, Bill, at the high-end, low-end. Can you give a little more color there?\nBill Grogan: Obviously, our first quarter is going to look fairly similar to the fourth-quarter. With ramp, I think you're going to see margin profile improve on a basis point perspective, more in FMT, as probably our highest margin improvement as -- well, obviously, we had the challenges within the FMD business this year with the CapEx reduction and then being significantly lower from a volume perspective. We had several site consolidations and the incremental costs associated with that. And then just that business levers extremely well as they progress, so I would say, FMT margins building throughout the year, HST still extremely strong but moderated relative to a lot of the investments we're making are on that side of the house. And then FSD recovering on the price cost side being a primary driver of their margin improvement for the full year with pressure here in the first half like I mentioned earlier with Rob's question.\nMatt Summerville: And then just as a follow-up, just to be clear. How much price you anticipate achieving in '22 versus maybe what you achieved in '21? Thank you.\nBill Grogan: So more, I mean last year we were about 200 basis points and we will be in excess of that here in 2022.\nMatt Summerville: Got it. Thank you.\nBill Grogan: Sure\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Birenberg, please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Good morning, guys. More into -- little bit more into your HSD segment. In that your guidance does imply some pretty decent growth despite really tough comps this year. So I'm wondering what exactly in there I mean, we really lapping, I think tough comps in semis in life sciences and it sounds like [Indiscernible] could be source of upside, but are there other areas that just haven't recovered that are really where there's a lot of juice left.\nEric Ashleman: I don't know that the story is really that one where it's folks coming off the pandemic map or something like that. I mean, these are just inherently strong sectors that we think are going to continue, which we've seen good -- good ramping in '21 and it's honestly it's market dynamics that are going to drive it in '22. So the Pharma space which you didn't mention, that is a really good space. Now we participate there, we make vaccines more effective. As you can imagine, that's going really well. That's where we're seeing some of the medium-term capital projects. It's focus, sometimes not the biggest ones, but these smaller to medium projects to get expansion out there. That's an area where we're seeing a lot of that. Our optical technologies businesses are really well-positioned for some great applications and broadband access and coming down from space and things that are really out there. And then I would say just stuff right down the middle of the fairway is really good for us.  Next-gen sequencing, of course, there's all of the growth aspects, they were always there as part of that space but, let's be honest, all this COVID surveillance and variant identification, that's the year that's doing it across the world. So this is just -- this is a story of strong markets who are well-positioned and they continue to be needed more than ever, more than it is in any way a recovery aspect. I mean, again, I always remind people there's some industrial businesses in there that might have more FMT -like aspects, but for what -- I think the spirit of the question is, the heart of it, it's a continuation in the theme that we think is going to continue.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. And a similar question though, I think FMT and probably IDEX seem that kind of have -- it seemed to be somewhat influenced by energy in that EBITDA, even though it may not be a direct exposure, it's this indirect impact, which now it seems to be kind of more topical. Very coming back we think. So what about you sent in maybe in FMT within energy recovery helping that business maybe exceed your expectations. What are your thoughts there?\nEric Ashleman: Well, I mean so a couple of things. Energy in general, I mean, it's our single-digit exposure there is localized largely in FMT. That is a story of recovering off of pandemic loss. No doubt because of commodity pricing and some other things and just delayed investments. It's a little different than it was 2, 3 years ago, but it's positive and that'll help. And you're also right, it's always hard to identify, but no doubt there are derivative impacts of that sector in terms of just the up and down the street industrial businesses that are throughout FMT. So we do think we have that factored in the mix, but to the extent any of that over achieved. That's the area that we'd see upside.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley, please proceed with your question.\nConnor Lynagh: Yeah, thank you. I was wondering if we could return to the capital allocation question and particularly the step-up in M&A allocation that you're targeting over the next couple of years. I'm wondering if you can frame -- are there any specific end markets that you see as you look at the pipeline right now, where you're overweight, underweight? How do you overlay a view on end markets and cycles to that framework?\nEric Ashleman: It probably doesn't map as cleanly as you might imagine, because I mean, when we think about the markets that we're going after, they are often defined by niche applications sets. And so you can see those in any one of our three segments, and in some ways they might even strike you as counter intuitive. In general, we're obviously looking in areas that we think have more fundamental growth tailwinds behind them, and so a lot of it just would be exactly where you think it would. Lots of focus in the HST world, lots of focus, as we've just seen here, in water technology and spaces like that. But there are some great industrial franchises that have done a great job of targeting into certain application spaces that make a lot of sense too, that are sitting in places you might not otherwise think. The two other examples in '21 are actually great examples of that. Apple Pumps, for example, tied to mining as one of its core markets. That's actually really attractive now, because of all the mining that's going on to support alternative energy applications.  Then you look at Airtech, which from far away looks like kind of just an industrial compression business or blower business, and yet they've tuned very nicely to some alternative energy applications as well. So it really does, it plays out at that kind of specific work to be done. And then how well that lines up often to a high-level macro trend, but we very quickly kind of bring that down into the niche kind of environments that we're comfortable with and we could see that across any one of our overall segments.\nConnor Lynagh: Got it. Maybe switching gears a little bit here, you mentioned labor being a constraint. I am just curious, is some of the increase in costs you're targeting related to outright increases in wages, or you are just saying availability is more the issue? How are you thinking about that as we move through 2022 here?\nEric Ashleman: So a couple of things there I mean, I always remind people we have a pretty light intensity in terms of labor. It's important, but it's not a huge driver in our P&L that being said, I think everybody expects a little bit more wage inflation we have is well here this year. To be honest, we probably see more of it tangibly in terms of premium costs and things that we're doing with the existing basis. We're scrambling to try to make things on Saturdays or Fridays in a disruptive manner, here today. So it so it matters for us but it's not a massive driver on the P&L. It is a driver, of course as it comes in and supply components where that same dimension is applying to businesses outside. So it's certainly were not immune to it. We kind of acted with pricing, price capture on the top and manage it that way.\nConnor Lynagh: Understood. Thanks for the color.\nEric Ashleman: You bet.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research, please proceed with your question.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Morning.\nJeff Sprague: Couple from me if I could. Just first on FMT. The segment color you provided in the appendix at the annual headwind from Flow MD, was it also headwind in Q4 or is that business now stabilized?\nBill Grogan: Yes. It's fairly neutral in Q4, I think their current run rate now bottomed out in the third quarter and we see progression as we progress -- as we go over the next couple of quarters.\nJeff Sprague: And then on Nextsite, could you just provide a little bit of color on the expected accretion, and also just a little modeling guidance on what we should expect on the amortization that comes into the adjusted EPS equation as a result.\nBill Grogan: Jeff, once we close we'll add that to the guide. We have said it's a $50 million business with about 20% EBITDA margins, to frame it out a little bit for you, and then we'll nail it down once we close later this quarter and include it in our revised guidance in April.\nJeff Sprague: Great. And then just finally, just back to labor. Appreciate that additional color. Could you just size it though, roughly as a percent of COGS? The cost of labor.\nBill Grogan: And Eric prefers our direct labor, so things directly associated with the product builds about 7% or 8%.\nJeff Sprague: Right, thanks for the caller. I appreciate it.\nBill Grogan: You bet.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vlad Bystricky with Citigroup, please proceed with your question.\nVlad Bystricky: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my call. So just -- I just wanted to go back to your comments on capacity constraints and lead times. I think during 3Q you talked about some extended lead times, but also said that you felt you were pretty well-positioned competitively versus others in the industry. Can you just give us an update or comment on how you think you're performing versus key competitors across the portfolio, and whether there's any specific businesses where you think you're more challenged versus peers?\nEric Ashleman: I appreciate the question. I mean, this is something you have to kind of gauge every single business one-by-one. So we do that when we're talking with them and when we go out there. I mean, our model is generally is always designed to be more reactive and quicker than almost any competitor we have. That's why we have local supply and all the things that we've talked about here. I would say from a performance perspective, probably just like everybody else where we're most challenged just inherently are those places that are more electronics specific where we're dependent on that probably most constraining single commodity that everybody is customized, it's very hard to scramble and get something different. Things like spun boards and those things. Now, the people we're competing against, they've got the same electronic content that we do. So I don't see that as a net competitive disadvantage.  There is a great example there frankly in that space where I know we outperformed our dispensing business had really, really strong back half push. It's some of the most electronic intensive products that we have in the entire company they did a phenomenal job largely because their suppliers are very local and it's done a great job simplifying the architecture over time. So they go down the list, don't see too many places where folks are pointing to conversion and suppliers that are beating us. For a couple of dimensions, I do think we performed very, very well. It's frustrating right now, but I think we're still in a good spot. We're super well-positioned and a lot of what goes into an IDEX solution, it's customized nature, the long history of it. There's kind of a natural defense that's part of it.\nVlad Bystricky: Okay. That's really helpful color. And then just maybe one more from me. Just going back to the CapEx ramp that you're expecting again here in '22. Can you talk about where you're seeing the best opportunities to deploy this capital, is it not mainly in areas like automation for productivity and then how should we think about this ramp? Is it reflective of some chunkier onetime things, or is this a more sustainable level of time?\nEric Ashleman: Well, there's definitely a piece of it in there that's a little chunky in our nature because it's related to facility expansion that we have talked about here for the emerging markets. I mean, we're simultaneously effectively doubling capacity over there to support growth at costs all of Asia, that we wouldn't do all the time. I will say though that it is stepped up a bit as things like industrial automation becomes more important for companies like us and others. There are not too many places you can go automate away from people standing on a production for in our environment, but where there are, it's quite cost-effective to deploy that technology, and we're doing it more than we have before. There's some great CapEx related to supporting growth in some interesting ways, digitalization as a chapter is something that wouldn't have been in there 10 years ago or 20 years ago, it is a chapter now. So I think it's a fairly typical profile, certainly reasonable capacity expansion, you'd expect given the growth that we had last year and we project to have in the future, but there are a couple of these extra chapters in there. One sort of onetime-related to facility, but I think the other ones will become part of the mix as we go forward.\nVlad Bystricky: Great, that's really helpful thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Mizuho America. Please proceed with your question.\nBrett Linzey: Thanks. And good morning, everyone. I wanted to come back to the wins you called out in Life Sciences and Semiconductor. Are the Life Science wins COVID -related or something outside that spectrum? And I was hoping you could put a finer point on how IDEX might be positioned with some of this forthcoming capacity build-out within Semiconductor. Any quantification be great too.\nEric Ashleman: Okay, well, a few things there. So from a life science perspective, certainly the lingering nature of COVID, it's in the mix, but I wouldn't say it's the predominant driver anywhere. We talked about Next-Gen Sequencing and variance surveillance that's a part of it, but it's not the majority by any means. It still comes back to quick cancer detection, point-of-care medicine. I mean, broader trends that have long been important and are even more important as we get more focused on healthcare. So I really don't see the current pandemic as being a significant driver. This is really broad-based and we think has a lot room to run for us in that space. On the Semi side, that's interesting. I mean, we actually participate in two places there in the classic infrastructure build-out. So we're -- we do that and attack it from the ceiling perspective. So actually, manufacturing things, we're part of that process. And then on the optical side, we do more of it on the metrology and after-production quality side of it. So we see it from two angles. And in terms of its run out, as you might suspect here, we've got a long way to go until capacity comes to where it needs to be for that particular sector. There's things still just being announced now that we're all seeing that are exciting for all of us. So we think that's going to continue for quite a while and most of it is located in our HST segment, our exposure.\nBrett Linzey: Thanks for that and other question on orders and other strong year and really finish to 21. Just curious, as your teams drill down on the order book, are there any signs of double ordering in any of the businesses are pull-forward as customers try to secure a spot in line. Any color would be great.\nEric Ashleman: Yeah, I think it's a small percentage mainly because of the kind of highly customized nature of what we make. That's kind of a risky bet in your -- everybody is [Indiscernible] on capacity that may or may not come around again just because of the way that we attack it with the products and the kind of product structure that we have. So it's typically not a high level, it's barely anything most days. I think we've pointed to it could be a percentage point at the current levels. I think that's pretty consistent. There's for high-volume things that people going depend on. There's probably a little bit of that, but it's not the majority of what we do here. It never has been.\nBrett Linzey: Okay. Great. Appreciate it.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Loop Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Graham: Good morning, Eric, Bill, Allison.\nEric Ashleman: Hi, Scott.\nScott Graham: So let me just ask the harder one first then line that up for Bill. So I'm looking at the FMT margin in the quarter we were down essentially 180 basis points, whereas in the third quarter, we were up over 100 basis points, and the contribution this quarter from ABEL, revenue-wise with less. And it looks like FMT -- FMD had a less negative impact on sales in the fourth-quarter than the third, so why was the FMT margin down that much?\nBill Grogan: Sequentially Q3 -- or Q4 to Q3?\nScott Graham: No, year-over-year. Well both of course right, but --\nBill Grogan: I would say two things if you normalized -- so just year-over-year, if you normalize FMT and take out FMD and ABEL, you're roughly flat on that margin perspective. I think from a quarter three to quarter four, there is a couple of things. One, FMT less working days in some of the vertically integrated businesses, so they have less absorption, which is seasonal, happens in most years. We had the final costs associated with the facility consolidations that weighed a little bit on their margins in the third quarter, and then just some premium over time and freight at the end of the year to get some stuff out for customers was dilutive, so. Those three things on the sequential piece and year-over-year, it's really the ex - FMD and ABEL that's pressuring the margins.\nScott Graham: And this is not an acceleration in supply chain issues there?\nBill Grogan: No.\nScott Graham: Okay. Great. Thanks. The second question is more for you, Eric and I -- Bill was kind enough to share with us the -- what the supply chain held you back on organically to 5%, and it doesn't look like you're expecting much difference in your second half organic than your first. Just wondering how you're thinking about that 3% to 5% in the fourth quarter and how it affects your first half versus second half thinking. Doesn't that lessen in the second half of the year and, therefore, maybe you're being conservative on implied second half guide?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. I mean, well, so a couple of things. I mean, I think we are definitely having a frame in a view that Q4 was tougher in a lot of regards because of the things that Bill talked about in terms of if you put some boundaries around it. Clearly, we have we have more absenteeism here than we've seen in any other point in the year, and we know the same thing was happening in suppliers, in logistic networks and those things. And to the extent that we see that same trend lagging over to the first quarter we've extended it there. We're making certain assumptions here as we go forward. One, we always get a seasonal uptick in our business. There's certain businesses that just this is the quiet as time for them because they can't do their work outside. We know those come online. Not all of those are labor dependent anyways or supplier-driven. There's things like that are out there. And then look, we're already seeing some signs that this current wave is going to subside come down. We are seeing more evidenced that people are wanting to get back into the workforce. So those pieces as well, and it's always easier to run the place when it's warmer out. So the few things in there and I don't think the ramp is so significant that it sort of stands in the way of those expectations.\nScott Graham: Good color. Thank you both.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen & Company, please proceed with your question.\nMichael Kendal: Good morning. This is Michael and us to see in for Joe.\nEric Ashleman: Hi, Michael.\nMichael Kendal: Thanks for the color on Nextsite. You mentioned sales would be roughly $50 million annually. What percentage is from the software component? Is there a portion that is recurring in nature?\nEric Ashleman: Well, I mean, it's an interesting thing because it's embedded in a lot of the products. So it wouldn't be as identifiable as that, like it's for purpose definable piece. It's an extension of capabilities that's then realized in the products that we go-to-market with, but we love that capability.\nMichael Kendal: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.\nEric Ashleman: Okay. Well, thank you all for joining the call today appreciate the questions as we went through in the interest in IDEX. Just a couple of things to frame it all out. No doubt, tough environment out there for everyone, as we've seen in talked about, I mean the IDEX model in some ways doesn't make that any easier. We've got a lot of iterative in innovation and customization short lead times as a standard expectation. High reliance on value-added suppliers. I put a but in here that's important. That also strengthened us for the short and the long term. I mean, we're an agile company. We're creative, we solve problems very quickly on the fly, and that supply chain that we're dependent upon. As I said a few times here today, it's very close to home. We've known those folks for a long time and there are deep relationships and trust there, a mutual trust. So that's a huge asset for us all that comes together.  So we're going to attack the current situation and deliver our performance and continue to do our best year in the months ahead but we also want to do that and not lose sight of what we're building ultimately for the future and I'm glad we had a chance to talk about that as well. We're going to strengthen the growth prospects that we have in our most advantaged verticals through organic and inorganic efforts going to use the balance sheet to go do that and support it. We're going to continue to optimize the footprint of the company we've done some great work over the last few years to build these more simple, scalable outposts out there that for IDEX, we've stripped out a lot of complexity that's going to lever really, really well for us, in terms of supporting growth and driving financials. And then lastly, we're going to inspire supported all with, I think a very inspiring culture that strides to expand the impact of our mission, which is trusted solutions, improving lives. So thanks for your time today, I wish you all a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Bill Grogan",
            "content": "Thanks, Eric. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 9. Fourth quarter orders of $795 million were up 17% overall, and up 13% organically. Organic orders increased across each of our segments. For the year, orders were up 26% overall, and up 21% organically. We experienced a strong rebound in demand for our products across all our segments, and steadily built our backlog in each quarter of 2021 totaling $266 million for the year. Relative to full year 2019, organic orders were up 15%. Q4 sales of $715 million were up 16% overall, and up 11% organically. We experienced a strong demand rebound from 2020, but our results were tempered by supply chain and COVID production limitations. Full year sales of $2.8 billion were up 18% overall, and up 12% organically. We saw favorable results across all our segments and again, strong performance relative to full year 2019 with organic sales up 4%. Fourth-quarter gross margins expanded 20 basis points to 44%. For the full year, gross margins expanded 60 basis points and adjusted gross margins expanded 80 basis points to 44.7%, primarily driven by strong volume leverage. Q4 operating margin was 22.7%, up 10 basis points compared to prior year.  Adjusted operating margin declined 60 basis points driven by a rebound in discretionary spending, targeted resource investments, and the dilutive impact of acquisition-related intangible amortization, partially offset by volume leverage. Full-year operating margin was 23%, up 90 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 23.9%, up 110 basis points compared to prior year. I'll discuss the drivers of adjusted operating income on the next slide. Our fourth-quarter effective tax rate was 22.5% relatively flat compared to the prior year ETR of 22.2%. Our full-year effective tax rate was 22.5% compared to 19.7% in the prior year due to lower tax benefits associated with executive compensation and the non-repeat benefits associated with the finalization of the global intangible low-income tax regulations in 2020. Q4 net income was $119 million, which resulted in EPS of a $1.55. Adjusted net income was also a $119 million with adjusted EPS of a $1.55, which was up $0.18 or 13% over prior year adjusted EPS. Full-year net income was $449 million, which resulted in EPS of $5.88. Adjusted net income was $482 million, resulting in an adjusted EPS of $6.30 up $1.11 or 21 over prior year adjusted EPS.  The tax rate movement I mentioned drives a $0.23 differential in EPS as compared to the prior year. Said differently, our EPS would have expanded by a $1.34 or 26% had 2021 been taxed at the 2020 rate. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $136 million, 115% of adjusted net income. For the year free cash flow was $493 million, down 5% versus last year, and was 102% of adjusted net income. This result was impacted by a volume-driven working capital build and higher CapEx, partially offset by our higher earnings. We spent over $70 million on capital projects this year, an increase of over $20 million versus 2020. Moving on to Slide 10, which details the drivers of our adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income increased $125 million for the year compared to 2020. Our 12% organic growth contributed approximately $106 million flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. We levered well in this volume increase in our team's drove operational productivity to help mitigate the profit headwinds we experienced from increased supply chain costs and the associated inefficiencies.  Although we have maintained positive price cost for the year, inflation continues to ramp and we saw compressed price cost spread versus historic levels, which pressured our up-margin rate and flow-through percentages. The positive mix is primarily result of the portfolio and business mix normalizing to pre -pandemic levels that had a negative impact on our results last year. We reinvested $35 million back into the businesses, taking the form of a partial rebound in discretionary spending to pre -pandemic levels, higher variable compensation expenses, and targeted reinvestment in resources to drive growth. Despite this incremental spend and a challenging supply chain environment, we achieved a solid 38% organic flow-through for the year. Flow-through is then negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions in FX, getting us to our reported flow-through of 30%. With that, I'd like to provide an update on our outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2022.  I'm on Slide 11. As a reminder, going forward, we will be adjusting EPS for acquisition-related intangible amortization in both our guidance and results. Our fourth-quarter adjusted EPS under this definition would have been $1.71 per share, while our full-year 2021 adjusted EPS would have been $6.87 per share. Under this new definition for the first quarter of 2022, we are projecting GAAP EPS of $1.57 to $1.60 and adjusted EPS to range from $1.73 to $1.76. We expect organic revenue growth of 67% for the first quarter and operating margin of approximately 23%. Q1 expected results in cooperate headwinds arising from COVID driven absenteeism and supply chain production constraints. The first quarter effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 22.5%. We expect FX to be unfavorable to our top line by 1% and acquisitions to provide a 4% benefit. Corporate costs in the first quarter expected to be around $19 million. Turning to the full year 2022, we project GAAP EPS of $6.70 to $7 and adjusted EPS to range from $7.33 to $7.63. We expect full-year organic revenue growth of 5% to 8% and operating margins to be around 24%.  We expect FX to be unfavorable to our topline by 1% and acquisitions to provide a 2% benefit. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 22.5%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $90 million, an increase over 2021 as we continue to identify opportunities to reinvest in our core businesses. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately 105% of adjusted net income and corporate costs are expected to be approximately $80 million for the year. Our earnings guidance excludes impacts from future acquisitions and any future restructuring charges. Nextsite is excluded from the figures above, as the transaction has yet to close. Next, I will provide some additional details regarding our 2022 guidance for the full year. I'm on Slide 12. On an operational basis, we expect supply chain constraints to mitigate our output for the first half of the year, muting an otherwise strong demand environment. Therefore, we are projecting organic revenue for the year to be up 5% to 8%, which translates to an EPS impact of $0.60 to $0.95 depending on the topline results. This range also assumes improving price cost. We continue to drive operational productivity across the portfolio and expect to see benefits from our 2021 restructuring actions.  This will drive $0.20 to $0.25 of favorability next year. We also continue to invest in the resources required to grow in the current year-end and beyond. These investments will reduce EPS by $0.20 to $0.25 and are funded by the productivity gains I mentioned previously. Our discretionary spend partially recovered to pre-pandemic levels in 2021 and we expect this spending to be fully recovered by the end of 2022. The unfavorability impacts EPS by 20 - $0.25. I will note that we're ramping spend to pre -pandemic levels, but with 20% higher revenues. ABEL has 1 partial quarter and Airtech has 2 quarters inorganic results included in our guidance.  We expect acquisitions to contribute $54 million of revenue and $0.08 of EPS. The incremental amortization that we see in 2022 versus 2021 is largely related to these acquisitions and will provide an additional $0.05 of EPS. Now let's take a look at a couple of non-operational items. First, our guide assumes no impact from taxes are guided rate is flat year-over-year. Second, we expect a 1% headwind from FX, providing $0.07 of EPS pressure. So in summary, we are projecting organic revenue growth of 5% to 8% for the year. Adjusted EPS expectations on the range of $7.33 to $7.63, a 7% to 11% growth over 2021 implied in our guidance is mid to high 20s year-over-year flow-through on the low-end and 30% on the high end. With that, I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts. Allison, it's Bill. I think it tapered down a little bit, obviously, here and as we progressed through the year, a little bit of inventory build to support the higher revenue load, but I don't think it'll be as big of a build as we experienced last year. Our efficiency metrics are down a little bit, but some of that's just related to increased inventory to buffer extended lead times that we have across our vendor base. Hey Mike, it's [Indiscernible] some of that's to be determined how the year plays out but are -- what's implied in our guidance is, you will from a ramp as we progress through the year. It is obviously more weighted towards latter in the year but if you look at the second quarter, it's kind of a couple of percent ramp and output versus the first quarter and it has to hold there for the balance of the year. So relative to where we're at here and the challenges we have in the first quarter, there is an assumption that those were resolved. We do have some of the discretionary costs that have just built through 2021 that are in our current run rate for the second quarter. And as we ramp volume will lever on those incremental costs; I think you'll see our margin profile continue to expand sequentially as we progress through the year. Yes, as I said there's not some huge switch that needs to be flipped. I think we're comfortable with the ramp that we see here in the short-term. The second quarter seasonally always goes up for us, so we've got that on top of some of just the output relief, I think we'll get, and then it's, unless something created some headwind to decelerate, we should be in a reasonable position. No. Deane, it ramped throughout the year, I think Q3 and Q4. There's marginal increase in the fourth-quarter. We talked about that in Q3 call that some things had moved from Q3 to Q4. That's one of the issues we have with the first quarter, is just last year, we were still extremely diligent and then spend a whole heck of a lot and then ramped 2, 3, and 4. So there's a little bit of ramp here as we progress from Q4 to Q1, but it's not overly material. Yeah, we haven't. But in the fourth-quarter it's probably 3% to 5% organic that we could have had incrementally to what we delivered if we had full availability of parts and labor. Sure. So the dynamics of price cost is obviously, it varies across the portfolio between the segments and the businesses. Holistically, FMT's are strongest price cost relative to a lot of their business goes through channel our ability to move price through there is favorable. Obviously, they've got more exposure to heavy casting metal, motor inflation but they have the power to offset at HSPs which were OEM focused. So there's opportunities but more on an annual basis on that side of it, and the stuff that looks like the FMT, the industrial parts of it, similar dynamics. FSD has been the challenge, primarily in our Fire and Rescue businesses. We talked about the flare OEM challenges and the large backlogs that they're sitting on in excess of 12 months to 18 months. And what we've priced that on, we haven't been able to re-price it. So we continue to work through the lower-margin profile on that through the back half of the year and most likely through the first half of this year. They've gone out with significant price increases here recently on any of the annual contracts that they have.  So they are poised for a large recovery and margin improvement as we progress through the year, but still challenged in the first half. Dispensing this fairly strong [Indiscernible] relative to their steel exposure and their automotive and aerospace customer base, they were challenged as well. So they were significantly under on the price cost, weighing down the overall organization, but a lot of good effort from the teams to manage through it. And I think are much better positioned as we stand here today to progress through the rest of the year. Exactly. Nathan, I think you're pointing to discretionary. Is that being somewhat of a catch-up here as we progress through the last two years that will fall off, there will be nominal increases on that going forward. And then as Eric said, it's our normal investment profile. So if you normalize for the discretionary ramp, we're at our traditional mid-30s type of flow-through. Obviously, our first quarter is going to look fairly similar to the fourth-quarter. With ramp, I think you're going to see margin profile improve on a basis point perspective, more in FMT, as probably our highest margin improvement as -- well, obviously, we had the challenges within the FMD business this year with the CapEx reduction and then being significantly lower from a volume perspective. We had several site consolidations and the incremental costs associated with that. And then just that business levers extremely well as they progress, so I would say, FMT margins building throughout the year, HST still extremely strong but moderated relative to a lot of the investments we're making are on that side of the house. And then FSD recovering on the price cost side being a primary driver of their margin improvement for the full year with pressure here in the first half like I mentioned earlier with Rob's question. So more, I mean last year we were about 200 basis points and we will be in excess of that here in 2022. Sure Yes. It's fairly neutral in Q4, I think their current run rate now bottomed out in the third quarter and we see progression as we progress -- as we go over the next couple of quarters. Jeff, once we close we'll add that to the guide. We have said it's a $50 million business with about 20% EBITDA margins, to frame it out a little bit for you, and then we'll nail it down once we close later this quarter and include it in our revised guidance in April. And Eric prefers our direct labor, so things directly associated with the product builds about 7% or 8%. You bet. Sequentially Q3 -- or Q4 to Q3? I would say two things if you normalized -- so just year-over-year, if you normalize FMT and take out FMD and ABEL, you're roughly flat on that margin perspective. I think from a quarter three to quarter four, there is a couple of things. One, FMT less working days in some of the vertically integrated businesses, so they have less absorption, which is seasonal, happens in most years. We had the final costs associated with the facility consolidations that weighed a little bit on their margins in the third quarter, and then just some premium over time and freight at the end of the year to get some stuff out for customers was dilutive, so. Those three things on the sequential piece and year-over-year, it's really the ex - FMD and ABEL that's pressuring the margins. No."

            "content": "Thank you, Allison. I'm on Slide 6. 2021 year was another record year for IDEX. We hit all-time highs on most of our key metrics. Demand for our differentiated technology remains strong. This underlying momentum combined with our targeted growth initiatives and ability to capture price drove a strong rebound from 2020. Across most of our portfolio, we saw an expansion beyond pre -pandemic revenue levels. In the fourth quarter, we achieved a record for orders and sales and our backlog position is very strong as we enter 2022. We expanded our margins in a highly inflationary environment. We levered well in the previous investments we made to optimize our cost position and executed on our productivity funnel. We maintained positive price cost, albeit at a compressed level versus historic performance. We remained diligent in controlling our discretionary spend and used our 80/20 principles to allocate resources to our most promising opportunities. Our strategic focus, purposeful resourcing, and strong operating cash flow enabled us to deploy record capital.  We acquired ABEL Pumps and Airtech and made a collaborative investment in a technology company driving advancements in connected products. We also invested across the portfolio to support growth and productivity. We optimized our cost position within our Fluid & Metering technology segment through a consolidation of our Italy facilities and our energy businesses and delivered on operational productivity projects across the segment. All of this drove a record year in orders, sales margins, earnings, and capital deployment. We said in the past that we built IDEX to outperform through a cycle, and we continue to find ourselves in a very challenging one, characterized by supply chain disruptions and labor scarcity exacerbated throughout the year by the emergence of new COVID-19 variants. Our view continues to be that we don't see gradients of bad, rather the supply chain environment is very tough and numerous challenges persist. As pockets of issues improve, they tend to be replaced by new obstacles. Our teams have done an excellent job navigating these day-to-day operational issues.  And I'd like to take a moment to thank our IDEX employees around the globe for their dedication and perseverance throughout this prolonged period of disruption. The agility of our teams, adjusting to new issues almost every day has been and continues to be outstanding. As we look forward to 2022, we did not see any near-term signs of diminishing supply chain related headwinds, and the impact of COVID-19 remains highly variable. In the short term, these conditions have and will impact our ability to efficiently ramp production and have created significant pockets of disruption for our customers and suppliers as well. We expect that these challenges will remain at a high level, at least through the first half of 2022. Regardless of the near-term challenges, our overall IDEX strategy remains focused on the horizon. The core of what makes IDEX strong, highly engineered, specialized products used in mission-critical applications, remains a solid driver for long-term success will continue to deploy capital and invest in the resources necessary to drive organic growth in order to capitalize on a robust demand environment.  Our balance sheet has ample capacity and we will leverage that strength to continue to play offense in M&A. To that end, we expect to close on the acquisition of Next Site later this quarter. The technologies and capabilities within their business segments will nicely complement our water platform within FMT. With that, I'll turn to our outlook for our segments on page seven. In our Fluid & Metering Technology segment, we anticipate growth in our industrial day rate businesses in 2022 with a return of larger projects towards the latter half of the year. And the short term, large projects continue to lag as our customers have limited capacity to execute larger upgrades or expansions. Agriculture is expected to perform well due to high crop prices, strong farmer sentiment, and limited availability of new equipment driving aftermarket demand. Our municipal water business is stable. We see improved optimism in the market and project planning activities increasing. We are expecting an uptick in the energy and chemical markets. The North American mobile truck market is improving due to a strong construction market in home heating oil prices, and North American pipelines are reporting modest, increase capital budgets for 2022. We see international oil and gas quote activity outpacing domestic demand, an opportunity we are well-positioned to capitalize on. FMT continues to be in a strong position to realize price and we expect this to drive improved margins in 2022. Likewise, the projects we completed last year to optimize our cost position as well as new operational productivity projects will yield strong flow-through in 2022, tempered by a discretionary spending rebound and continued resource investment in the segment.  Moving to the Health & Science Technology segment. We expect the strongest growth in HST of all our three segments, and we plan to make the largest resource investments in HST to support that growth. We anticipate margin improvement driven by volume leverage, parts -- partly offset by these resource additions. HST continues to have robust demand across all their major end markets; Semiconductor, Food and Pharma, Analytical Instrument -- Instrumentation, and Life Sciences are all expected to perform well. Next-gen sequencing instrument demand is growing with research and clinical applications outpacing COVID detection and surveillance. Our ability to execute in the current environment continues to distinguish us from our competition and improve our share position. On the Semiconductor side, we continue to capitalize on tailwinds generated from global broadband and satellite communication trends. In auto, supply chain issues at our customers, especially around semiconductors mute our growth. Underlying market demand remains favorable and we expect our results to imp rove a supply chain issues ease. The industrial businesses within the segment faced similar trends to FMT. Finally, we expect that our Fire & Safety Diversified Products segment will be our most challenge next year.  In Fire and Safety, North American OEMS are experiencing significant supply chain constraints around chassis and component availability, which limits their production. On the rescue side, we anticipate that larger tenders will lag compounded by China localization policies that are driving delays. We do not anticipate near-term easing of these conditions and see the potential for recovery towards the latter part of 2022. In our banded business, like in HST, we see auto supply chain issues dampening current demand. Despite this pressure, our business continues to outperform the broader market due to our content on key vehicle models. Lastly, in the near term, we expect continued momentum within our dispensing business as customer capital investments are deployed in early 2022. However, for the year, we will see a non-repeat of North America projects as we reach the end of the replenishment cycle this year, as composed to last year. We anticipate that the unfavorable price cost position we experienced last year will rebound this year as annual contracts are renewed at current pricing.  We see this improvement tempered a bit by some mix pressure as dispensing volumes reduced, and we make some targeted investments. To summarize, we see favorable conditions across the majority of our end markets. However, the degree to which our customers and our facilities will be impacted by rolling supply chain and COVID related disruptions remains highly variable. We'll continue to monitor conditions and be as prepared as we can be for potential interruptions. Despite the short-term headwinds, we are optimistic about our growth potential and the trajectory of our end markets. With that, I'd like to turn over to Bill to discuss our financial results. Thanks, Bill. I'm on the final slide, Slide 13. Before we open the call up for questions, I'd like to wrap up with a summary of our most critical 2022 focus areas. In an environment characterized by uncertainty and disruption, it's important not to lose sight of who we are as a company. First and foremost, we are a portfolio of great businesses that leverage 8020 with an obsessive focus to serve our customers. We refer to that simple model as the IDEX difference. We're committed to navigating the challenges of the short-term landscape, but remain focused on the longer term. We must continue to utilize our 8020 toolkits to create efficient, innovative, value-creating businesses. In a world with this level of variability, the simpler you are, the more successful you will be. We remain committed to investing in the resources needed so our businesses are poised to take advantage of the growth potential in front of us. We are a company committed to its core values and we'll continue to develop top-performing teams as part of an inspiring company culture. Diversity, equity, and inclusion continues to be an area of focus, creating environments where people feel they belong and are comfortable bringing their true selves to work every day.  Our strong operating cash flow and balance sheet put us in a great position to continue to put capital to work, and we've already identified several high return organic investment opportunities across the company that will push us past our 2021 CapEx record levels. We have invested in new industrial automation that will improve efficiency and expand capacity for growth. We're supporting focus digitalization efforts are across our installed base to solidify our superior positions and expand share of wallet. Our facility expansions in China and India are well underway, effectively doubling future capacities to support growth across the. Lastly, our M&A opportunity pipeline continues to be strong, and we look forward to deploying additional capital in 2022, welcoming new businesses to the IDEX family. With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions. Yeah, yeah. Good to talk Allison. So I mean, it's a bit of a continuation of the theme that we've seen now for a while as, there's plenty of confidence out there that there's lots of demand support to get things done. It is really difficult to do -- to just frankly bring together all the resources that you need to take a really complex project and take it from beginning to end. Lining up material, lining up resources, things like that. So what we are starting to see, frankly, are smaller to medium-sized versions of that. Slight expansions, things you can kind of do on the fly. And then continued staging for projects that are of those slightly larger incremental scale aspects, as people talk about that. I mean, quite honestly, it's the same thing that we're going through in our own business and we've got a couple of critical big projects that we've deployed they were really hard to put together. And then all over the place we're, while we're running doing those things that give you that little bit of 3% to 5% output let as we go. So I think that's really the nature of it. And of course, it varies depending on certain markets are further out ahead of that a little bit more positive some are lagging even further because they're just inherently involve larger chunks of infrastructure. But I was going to summarize it, I'd put it -- I'd describe it that way. Allison, you're asking about the supply chain shocks in general? I mean, it's a great question, something we've revisited continuously as we go on through this. I mean, we are -- I think we're -- from a high level, we're positioned really, really well. I mean, we do a lot of local supply, close proximity with people that we've known for a long time. Deep relationships, a lot of trust there, very collaborative. So I like that topology. I don't think we would try to change it or move it farther away. And any, frankly, any change right now is difficult because everybody's bandwidth constricted. So, a couple of places we're looking at that, it's kind of at the sharpest reason why. We just -- we have to do something different and we've got resources allocated there. I will say the one thing we're spending a lot of time working on. And I mentioned in the opening comments is simplification. You can generally see are businesses that have done the most there, are frankly having the easiest time of it. We have a highly customized model at the company. And so that's always an inherent challenge for us. So I think one of the things we've learned here, and we've gotten better at as we've gone along, just trying to find a way to say, is there a simpler way to do it more modular, simpler design that's easier to reproduce against a given supply base that will probably stay pretty similar for us as we go forward. Well, I mean, there's inherently always a little bit more risk as you extend things out than any other externality could jump into the mix and start to inflect decisions along the way. So I think that's there. I mean, as we've thought of the projects that we're working with -- when you consider a project across a long-term cycle, ones that feel the most assured about or where you can just see there's not enough capacity or there's a lot of labor challenges, these things aren't going to go away in the long-term. And when you see that condition, let's say if that's in a food market, that's somebody recognizing there's a lot of demand here, we're struggling to meet it, we know it's going to be there in the long run, while the projects themselves can be delayed and they keep extending, honestly, the conversations stay pretty active. The transfer documents and data and things is still going on, so you put those into a different category. The things that you can just tell are a little bit more susceptible to shocks, new technology, it's a launch, it's dependent upon certain conditions to be there, we probably put that in a slightly more variable category. But I honestly think over the long-term there's a lot more in the first that ultimately everybody would love to do if they could. And we've now seen, and certainly we've talked about before on this call, I think we're seeing the impact of not having it deployed as we tried to recover. From now, it just essentially at above levels that were sort of were here originally before the pandemic. Thanks Mike. Hi, Dean. Sure. So a couple of things there. One, in general, the nature of this kind of spend, let's say today versus where it was three years ago, there are some differences. There's actually some productivity that we're all going to enjoy as we've learned how to work in different ways. Travel won't be as high as it ever was. Certainly, marketing and digital, ways to get messages out to customers, much more efficient than we've seen before. And so that's one of the reasons, even with the slight increases here in the ramp up, we're basically at a level we were three years ago with 400 million more dollars of sales in the Company.  What it's targeted towards is a lot of our investments, frankly, it's people, and it's people on the front-end of business and the technology side of the business tied to the parts of the Company that we think have the most favorable wind at their backs in terms of our positioning in the end markets that they are sitting in. So we talked before about kind of the top 25 bets across IDEX, that list ebbs and flows from year-to-year, but about 2/3 of it holds constant. In many of the resources that are here, some ways they're identified a year, year-and-a-half ago. We let the last year play out. We're really careful with things, but at some point, you start to see that, hey, we've got some real momentum here. And the nature of people driving the investments, they've got to get in, they've got to learn the company, they've got to learn the markets and then start to add some value.  So I think the return, as it often is in anything we do when we're supporting organic growth, is really strong. On investments of that type because it's people dependent. It also makes it pretty easy to be careful with as you go forward. So as Bill said, if we start to see things all of a sudden take a turn or there's something that it comes into the mix that none of us expected. By nature, we can hold off, we can do more with less, we can ask people that we deployed towards other areas across IDEX. So I think what you're seeing here a little bit is probably we would have liked to have more of that onboard and a more of an even ramp through the year last year. Again, because a lot of its people, as everybody knows, it's hard to find. When you find them, I think you want to be careful and make sure you bring them on board when you can. That's part of the mix too. Yeah. I mean, it's a business we've known for a long, long time, and we've partnered with them with our sewer robots franchise there. They've been kind of closer to the customer and a partner for us. Frankly, there are predominant partner over the years. So essentially they're going to market here in North America predominantly. They do a lot of things around sewer inspection, have a few other answered products that go with that. There's some tremendous software capability embedded within that business that's used in that space and we think has appropriation abilities elsewhere in the water technology area. And a couple of other interesting nascent extensions that they've launched that we also are interested in potentially opening a door for us. So it's a really nice fit for a partner that we've known for a long time. And it was just the time is right to bring them into the IDEX family. Compliance is a driver for our businesses in that space. Yes. Thanks Deane. Yes, Rob. So the nature of pricing, I mean, I will say I think we and everybody else are looking at the historical ways that long-term pricing has been done and are finding ways to make sure that we've got more opportunities for investment along the way. As you suspect that given that the pressure and volume and it's just the nature of that space that's probably going to take a while, but that is in the mix in terms of innovation in different ways to handle it. On the virus, I'd say we're plateaued slight decrease, but we're such a -- we've got such a global topography that is, it decreases in one area and comes up and another one, so I'd say it's level right now not increasing anywhere but still at a higher rate than we've seen in any of the other episodes that have come across. Thanks, Rob. Hi, Nathan. Yeah. I mean, again, because of the nature kind of our model and what those investments usually are in terms of people. I mean, to be honest, there's a bandwidth limit on the upper side that also governed some of this. These are not the kind of businesses where you can just endlessly pull people in there and it all works better. These are super, super targeted around and aligned highly to the best that we're talking about. And then sort of everything else, we leverage a lot of that productivity to actually support those investments and run the company that way. It's a pretty consistent level, so I really do think of this more along the lines of rebuilding a basic base to fuel growth of the company in the highly targeted way that we do it more than let's say a next chapter of spend profiling for the company. We don't need to do that. Yeah, Nathan. I mean, that's exactly the target and the expectation here. I mean, we talked, I know for the last several quarters, about the intentionality we've put on this. Some of the investments in resources are focused in this particular area because they have to be. The achievements that we made in '21 I think was a direct result as they're all high-quality. I can assure you we looked at a lot more than those companies to get the ones that we brought in on the board, and that's the way we're thinking of it going forward. We'll consider evaluations will be high, competition will be fierce, and we have to make sure we get plenty of that vast as we go at it and hold our discipline at the same time. But we talked our ideal spot here would begin to lever load at this high, and the minimum is higher level of deployment that actually helps you build a more uniform resource basis to do the work. We're always looking for the potential to expand it. If in fact we can do that efficiently, manage the change across the company. So it is definitely an intentional travel to a higher level? Yes. Thanks, Nathan. I don't know that the story is really that one where it's folks coming off the pandemic map or something like that. I mean, these are just inherently strong sectors that we think are going to continue, which we've seen good -- good ramping in '21 and it's honestly it's market dynamics that are going to drive it in '22. So the Pharma space which you didn't mention, that is a really good space. Now we participate there, we make vaccines more effective. As you can imagine, that's going really well. That's where we're seeing some of the medium-term capital projects. It's focus, sometimes not the biggest ones, but these smaller to medium projects to get expansion out there. That's an area where we're seeing a lot of that. Our optical technologies businesses are really well-positioned for some great applications and broadband access and coming down from space and things that are really out there. And then I would say just stuff right down the middle of the fairway is really good for us.  Next-gen sequencing, of course, there's all of the growth aspects, they were always there as part of that space but, let's be honest, all this COVID surveillance and variant identification, that's the year that's doing it across the world. So this is just -- this is a story of strong markets who are well-positioned and they continue to be needed more than ever, more than it is in any way a recovery aspect. I mean, again, I always remind people there's some industrial businesses in there that might have more FMT -like aspects, but for what -- I think the spirit of the question is, the heart of it, it's a continuation in the theme that we think is going to continue. Well, I mean so a couple of things. Energy in general, I mean, it's our single-digit exposure there is localized largely in FMT. That is a story of recovering off of pandemic loss. No doubt because of commodity pricing and some other things and just delayed investments. It's a little different than it was 2, 3 years ago, but it's positive and that'll help. And you're also right, it's always hard to identify, but no doubt there are derivative impacts of that sector in terms of just the up and down the street industrial businesses that are throughout FMT. So we do think we have that factored in the mix, but to the extent any of that over achieved. That's the area that we'd see upside. It probably doesn't map as cleanly as you might imagine, because I mean, when we think about the markets that we're going after, they are often defined by niche applications sets. And so you can see those in any one of our three segments, and in some ways they might even strike you as counter intuitive. In general, we're obviously looking in areas that we think have more fundamental growth tailwinds behind them, and so a lot of it just would be exactly where you think it would. Lots of focus in the HST world, lots of focus, as we've just seen here, in water technology and spaces like that. But there are some great industrial franchises that have done a great job of targeting into certain application spaces that make a lot of sense too, that are sitting in places you might not otherwise think. The two other examples in '21 are actually great examples of that. Apple Pumps, for example, tied to mining as one of its core markets. That's actually really attractive now, because of all the mining that's going on to support alternative energy applications.  Then you look at Airtech, which from far away looks like kind of just an industrial compression business or blower business, and yet they've tuned very nicely to some alternative energy applications as well. So it really does, it plays out at that kind of specific work to be done. And then how well that lines up often to a high-level macro trend, but we very quickly kind of bring that down into the niche kind of environments that we're comfortable with and we could see that across any one of our overall segments. So a couple of things there I mean, I always remind people we have a pretty light intensity in terms of labor. It's important, but it's not a huge driver in our P&L that being said, I think everybody expects a little bit more wage inflation we have is well here this year. To be honest, we probably see more of it tangibly in terms of premium costs and things that we're doing with the existing basis. We're scrambling to try to make things on Saturdays or Fridays in a disruptive manner, here today. So it so it matters for us but it's not a massive driver on the P&L. It is a driver, of course as it comes in and supply components where that same dimension is applying to businesses outside. So it's certainly were not immune to it. We kind of acted with pricing, price capture on the top and manage it that way. You bet. Morning. I appreciate the question. I mean, this is something you have to kind of gauge every single business one-by-one. So we do that when we're talking with them and when we go out there. I mean, our model is generally is always designed to be more reactive and quicker than almost any competitor we have. That's why we have local supply and all the things that we've talked about here. I would say from a performance perspective, probably just like everybody else where we're most challenged just inherently are those places that are more electronics specific where we're dependent on that probably most constraining single commodity that everybody is customized, it's very hard to scramble and get something different. Things like spun boards and those things. Now, the people we're competing against, they've got the same electronic content that we do. So I don't see that as a net competitive disadvantage.  There is a great example there frankly in that space where I know we outperformed our dispensing business had really, really strong back half push. It's some of the most electronic intensive products that we have in the entire company they did a phenomenal job largely because their suppliers are very local and it's done a great job simplifying the architecture over time. So they go down the list, don't see too many places where folks are pointing to conversion and suppliers that are beating us. For a couple of dimensions, I do think we performed very, very well. It's frustrating right now, but I think we're still in a good spot. We're super well-positioned and a lot of what goes into an IDEX solution, it's customized nature, the long history of it. There's kind of a natural defense that's part of it. Well, there's definitely a piece of it in there that's a little chunky in our nature because it's related to facility expansion that we have talked about here for the emerging markets. I mean, we're simultaneously effectively doubling capacity over there to support growth at costs all of Asia, that we wouldn't do all the time. I will say though that it is stepped up a bit as things like industrial automation becomes more important for companies like us and others. There are not too many places you can go automate away from people standing on a production for in our environment, but where there are, it's quite cost-effective to deploy that technology, and we're doing it more than we have before. There's some great CapEx related to supporting growth in some interesting ways, digitalization as a chapter is something that wouldn't have been in there 10 years ago or 20 years ago, it is a chapter now. So I think it's a fairly typical profile, certainly reasonable capacity expansion, you'd expect given the growth that we had last year and we project to have in the future, but there are a couple of these extra chapters in there. One sort of onetime-related to facility, but I think the other ones will become part of the mix as we go forward. Okay, well, a few things there. So from a life science perspective, certainly the lingering nature of COVID, it's in the mix, but I wouldn't say it's the predominant driver anywhere. We talked about Next-Gen Sequencing and variance surveillance that's a part of it, but it's not the majority by any means. It still comes back to quick cancer detection, point-of-care medicine. I mean, broader trends that have long been important and are even more important as we get more focused on healthcare. So I really don't see the current pandemic as being a significant driver. This is really broad-based and we think has a lot room to run for us in that space. On the Semi side, that's interesting. I mean, we actually participate in two places there in the classic infrastructure build-out. So we're -- we do that and attack it from the ceiling perspective. So actually, manufacturing things, we're part of that process. And then on the optical side, we do more of it on the metrology and after-production quality side of it. So we see it from two angles. And in terms of its run out, as you might suspect here, we've got a long way to go until capacity comes to where it needs to be for that particular sector. There's things still just being announced now that we're all seeing that are exciting for all of us. So we think that's going to continue for quite a while and most of it is located in our HST segment, our exposure. Yeah, I think it's a small percentage mainly because of the kind of highly customized nature of what we make. That's kind of a risky bet in your -- everybody is [Indiscernible] on capacity that may or may not come around again just because of the way that we attack it with the products and the kind of product structure that we have. So it's typically not a high level, it's barely anything most days. I think we've pointed to it could be a percentage point at the current levels. I think that's pretty consistent. There's for high-volume things that people going depend on. There's probably a little bit of that, but it's not the majority of what we do here. It never has been. Thanks. Hi, Scott. Yes. I mean, well, so a couple of things. I mean, I think we are definitely having a frame in a view that Q4 was tougher in a lot of regards because of the things that Bill talked about in terms of if you put some boundaries around it. Clearly, we have we have more absenteeism here than we've seen in any other point in the year, and we know the same thing was happening in suppliers, in logistic networks and those things. And to the extent that we see that same trend lagging over to the first quarter we've extended it there. We're making certain assumptions here as we go forward. One, we always get a seasonal uptick in our business. There's certain businesses that just this is the quiet as time for them because they can't do their work outside. We know those come online. Not all of those are labor dependent anyways or supplier-driven. There's things like that are out there. And then look, we're already seeing some signs that this current wave is going to subside come down. We are seeing more evidenced that people are wanting to get back into the workforce. So those pieces as well, and it's always easier to run the place when it's warmer out. So the few things in there and I don't think the ramp is so significant that it sort of stands in the way of those expectations. Hi, Michael. Well, I mean, it's an interesting thing because it's embedded in a lot of the products. So it wouldn't be as identifiable as that, like it's for purpose definable piece. It's an extension of capabilities that's then realized in the products that we go-to-market with, but we love that capability. Okay. Well, thank you all for joining the call today appreciate the questions as we went through in the interest in IDEX. Just a couple of things to frame it all out. No doubt, tough environment out there for everyone, as we've seen in talked about, I mean the IDEX model in some ways doesn't make that any easier. We've got a lot of iterative in innovation and customization short lead times as a standard expectation. High reliance on value-added suppliers. I put a but in here that's important. That also strengthened us for the short and the long term. I mean, we're an agile company. We're creative, we solve problems very quickly on the fly, and that supply chain that we're dependent upon. As I said a few times here today, it's very close to home. We've known those folks for a long time and there are deep relationships and trust there, a mutual trust. So that's a huge asset for us all that comes together.  So we're going to attack the current situation and deliver our performance and continue to do our best year in the months ahead but we also want to do that and not lose sight of what we're building ultimately for the future and I'm glad we had a chance to talk about that as well. We're going to strengthen the growth prospects that we have in our most advantaged verticals through organic and inorganic efforts going to use the balance sheet to go do that and support it. We're going to continue to optimize the footprint of the company we've done some great work over the last few years to build these more simple, scalable outposts out there that for IDEX, we've stripped out a lot of complexity that's going to lever really, really well for us, in terms of supporting growth and driving financials. And then lastly, we're going to inspire supported all with, I think a very inspiring culture that strides to expand the impact of our mission, which is trusted solutions, improving lives. So thanks for your time today, I wish you all a great day."

Before we begin, a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor language in last night's press release and in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I'll now turn this call over to our CEO, Eric Ashleman.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you, Allison. Welcome to IDEX. It's a pleasure to have you on the team. I'd like to start by thanking Mike Yates, our former Chief Accounting Officer, for his 16 years of service to IDEX. Mike help lead an evolution of our finance and accounting organization and his work has had a long lasting impact on the business. On behalf of the entire IDEX team, I wish Mike the best in his future endeavors. Now let's turn to our IDEX overview on slide six. We continue to see supply chain challenges throughout the third quarter. Our localized sourcing, production and selling model helps us a bit relative to others, but this prolonged environment of poor material, labor and logistics availability challenges us just like any other business. Despite these obstacles, our IDEX teams around the globe have risen to the occasion. They exhibited both resiliency and stamina as they overcame yet another quarter filled with day-to-day disruptions, all while providing a high level of support to our customers. I want to thank all the IDEX team members across the globe for your hard work, not just in Q3 but over the last 18 months of business within a pandemic. At this stage, we don't see any near-term signs of diminishing macroeconomic headwinds. Rather, we expect they'll remain at a high level and persist into 2022. We'll continue to leverage our 80/20 principles as we align around our best customers, our best prospects for growth and our critical business priorities. I spoke last quarter about our ability to capture price due to the differentiated mission-critical nature of our products. Overall, the price actions that we took over the past six months were increasingly realized in the third quarter, and we saw our price, cost spread increase sequentially. We will push price aggressively and appropriately as conditions continue to support our arguments. Despite the many challenges out there, our organic performance remains strong. We set another record in the third quarter for orders, sales and backlog. Our backlog is now $186 million higher than it was at the end of last year. Signals around the return of industrial projects have intensified and current energy prices, if sustained, have the potential to drive investments within IDEX application areas. Our Health Science and Technologies segment performed exceptionally well. Over the past 5 or so years, we have stepped up organic investments with our focus on the longer term. Within our sealing business, we built a new facility with the goal of capturing share in the expanding semiconductor market. We brought three optics facilities together, and our new Optics Center of Excellence to enable future wins in life sciences by integrating multiple IDEX components to create value for our customers. We optimized the footprint and core technology of our material processing technology platform to enable long-term repeatable growth across a series of technologies. These investments have generated tremendous returns, and we are well positioned to capture share and capitalize on market growth going forward. On the inorganic side, our recent acquisitions are doing extremely well. Abel Pumps is fully integrated and performing ahead of expectations. The Airtech integration is ahead of schedule, and the team is making strong progress on their growth strategy. Both are executing well in the challenging operating environment as they come up to speed on our 80/20 playbook. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample capital available to support future acquisitions and investments in the business. Our M&A funnel is healthy. Our expanded team has identified a number of interesting opportunities as we look to deploy additional capital in the near and long term. In the end, we are focused on delivering and growing within a very difficult near term operating environment while spending a significant part of each day thinking about the best investments in teams, technologies and business opportunities to thrive in the years to come. I'm very confident in our team's ability to outperform in both areas. With that, I'll turn to our market outlook on page seven. In our Fluid & Metering technology segment, industrial day rates were favorable versus the second quarter. Larger industrial projects still lag, but quote activity and funnel strength have both improved. Agriculture remains robust, delivering on record volumes. Our water businesses continue to perform well. Municipal spending is steady, and there is general optimism around future increased government funding. The chemical and energy markets continue to lag primarily due to limited capital investment. However, on the chemical side, smaller, fast starting projects performed well. We are cautiously optimistic on energy as increased fuel prices and concerns over energy shortages have the potential to trigger investment. As we noted last quarter, our Flow MD business has experienced a significant pullback in customers' capital investments. It impacted FMT's organic sales by 8%. In other words, excluding the impact of Flow MD, FMT organic sales would have grown 15% instead of 7% as reported. Moving to the Health & Science Technologies segment. We continue to see strong demand across all our end markets. Semiconductor, food and pharma, analytical instrumentation and life sciences all performed well. We continue to win share through our targeted growth initiatives, and our intentionality around identifying opportunities that grow faster than the broader market is paying off. The automotive market remains affected by supply chain-driven challenges, but we continue to see growth due to our concentration in higher end European vehicles. The industrial businesses within the segment saw a trend similar to FMT. Finally, our Fire & Safety Diversified Products segment is our most challenged segment right now. Price capture and volume offsets faced stronger headwinds within the segment due to higher direct OEM exposure and higher levels of material intensity due to vertical integration. In Fire & Safety, North America Fire OEM production continues to struggle due to supply chain challenges. Larger tender activity is slowly increasing within the global Fire Rescue markets, but we feel these market challenges will persist into 2022. US automotive production pullbacks due to microprocessor shortages have tempered the performance of our banded business. We continue to achieve new platform wins and believe we're well positioned to supply chain constraints eventually ease. But in the third quarter, the impact of automotive shutdowns increased versus last quarter and moderated our performance. Finally, dispensing performed well as key customers deploy capital on strong DIY market demand, and our global product offerings capture share. We continue to closely monitor market conditions and expect rolling supply chain disruptions to continue throughout the balance of the year and into 2022. That said, our third quarter organic orders were flat sequentially versus second quarter, and our backlog remains at a record level. Overall, the demand environment for IDEX products is not weighed [ph] despite supply chain challenges, and we remain optimistic about the trajectory of our end markets. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results.\nBill Grogan: Thanks, Eric. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on slide nine. Q3 orders of $774 million were up 36% overall and up 28% organically. We built $62 million of backlog in the quarter, and all three segments had strong organic performance versus last year as well as versus the third quarter of 2019. Third quarter sales of $712 million were up 23% overall and up 15% organically. We continue to experience a strong rebound from the pandemic across our portfolio, tempered by supply chain constraints. The Flow MD pressure and Fluid & Metering Eric discussed, also had an impact on overall organic sales. Excluding Flow MD, organic sales would have been up 18% overall. Q3 gross margin expanded 50 basis points to 43.8%. The increase over the prior year quarter was primarily driven by increased volume and price capture, partly offset by inflation and supply chain impacts. Excluding the impact of a $9.1 million pretax fair value inventory step-up charge related to the Airtech acquisition, adjusted gross margin was 45%, and improved sequentially. Third quarter operating margin was 22.6%, flat compared to prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 24.3%, up 120 basis points compared to prior year, largely driven by our gross margin expansion and fixed cost leverage, offset with some pressure from targeted reinvestments and the dilutive impact of Airtech and ABEL acquisitions due to their intangible amortization costs. I will discuss the drivers of operating income in more detail on the next slide. Our Q3 effective tax rate was 23.4%, which was higher than the prior year ETR of 14.4% due to the finalization of tax regulations enacted in the third quarter of 2020 as well as a decrease in the excess tax benefit related to share-based compensation in the current period. Third quarter net income was $116 million, which resulted in an EPS of $1.51. Adjusted net income was $125 million, resulting in an adjusted EPS of $1.63, up $0.23 or 16% over prior year adjusted EPS. The tax rate movement I mentioned drives a $0.27 differential in EPS as compared to the prior year quarter. Said differently, our EPS would have expanded by $0.50 or 35% had 2021 been taxed at the 2020 rate. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $142 million, up 5% compared to prior year, and was 113% of adjusted net income. The result was impacted by higher earnings, partly offset by volume-driven working capital build. Our working capital efficiency metrics remain strong, and the teams continue to do a good job managing significant year-over-year volume and supply chain challenges. Moving on to slide 10, which details the drivers of our adjusted operating profit. Adjusted operating income increased $39 million for the quarter compared to the prior year. Our 15% organic growth contributed approximately $29 million, flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. We achieved positive price cost within the quarter, and saw our price, cost spread improved sequentially. Our teams continue to drive operational productivity as another lever to help mitigate the profit headwinds we experienced from supply chain costs and associated inefficiencies. The positive mix is a primary result of the portfolio and business mix normalizing to pre-pandemic levels that had a negative impact on our results last year. As Eric mentioned, we are actively investing in the resources we need to execute on future growth and productivity. This reinvestment back into the business, higher variable compensation and targeted increases in discretionary spending drive the year-over-year pressure of $15 million. Despite the incremental spend, inflation and supply chain-driven operational efficiencies, we still achieved a solid 37% organic flow-through. Flow-through is then negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX, getting us to a reported flow-through of 30%. With a significant amount of focus dedicated to navigating supply chain disruptions, we did not fully execute on the level of spend we expected in the quarter. We intend to make these investments in the fourth quarter, and they will mitigate our flow-through a bit as we close out the year. With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. I'm on slide 11. For the fourth quarter, we are projecting adjusted EPS to range from $1.55 to $1.58. We expect organic revenue growth of 9% to 10% and adjusted operating margins between 23.5% and 24%. Q4 results are slightly lower than the third quarter, driven by organic and inorganic resource investments seasonality and the potential for year-end logistics challenges. The Q4 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. We expect about 0.5% of top line benefit from FX, and corporate costs in Q4 are expected to be around $19 million. Turning to the full year. We are narrowing our full year EPS guidance from a range of $6.26 to $6.36 to $6.30 to $6.33. We are also maintaining our full year organic growth of 11% to 12%. We expect operating margins of approximately 24%. We expect FX to provide 1.5% benefit to top line results. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $65 million, in line with our previous guidance. Free cash flow is expected to be around 105% of net income, lower versus our last guide primarily due to working capital investments. And corporate costs are expected to be approximately $73 million for the year. Our earnings guidance excludes impacts from future acquisitions and any future restructuring charges. Finally, beginning in 2022, IDEX will provide EPS guidance and report actual results, excluding the impacts of after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization. We believe reporting adjusted EPS on this basis will provide more transparency to our core operating results as well as facilitate comparisons with our peer companies as we continue on our capital deployment journey. With that, I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Bill. I'm on the final slide, slide 12. Before we open the call up to questions, I'd like to share a few updates around our great teams. First off, I'd like to extend my public congratulations to our Non-Executive Chairman, Bill Cook, on being named Public Company Director of the Year by the National Association of Corporate Directors. Bill and I both joined IDEX around the same time in 2008, and I've learned a great deal from him over the years. His insightful perspective and critical thinking skills have been tremendously helpful for the company, and I know I speak for everyone at IDEX when I say congratulations, Bill, on this well deserved honor. Turning to the IDEX Foundation. Last month, the foundation entered a national partnership with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Various US-based business units have supported their local boys and girls clubs over the years, but this takes our joint work to the next level, offering a clear pathway for increased engagement. Every one of our U.S. business units is close to at least one boys and girls club location. This agreement aligns with the foundation's equity and opportunity charitable pillar added earlier this year, seeking to create opportunities for underserved disadvantaged people of color within our community. Finally, we attribute much of our success to our strong foundational culture. Our annual September engagement survey just came back. And even within this incredibly challenging environment, loaded with disruptions in unexpected turns, we held study and were scored in the top quartile of all manufacturing companies. Our teams around the world are beginning to develop tactical plans to address feedback provided by their local teams, part of the continuous improvement that supports everything we do at IDEX. With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Ashleman: I think we lost Nathan.\nNathan Jones: Can you hear me?\nEric Ashleman: Now we can.\nBill Grogan: Now we can.\nNathan Jones: Okay. All's Well That Ends Well. First question just on this discretionary reinvestment it wasn't called out on the walk in the first quarter, ramped up in second quarter and third quarter. And I think Bill said in his comments that you didn't actually spend as much in the third quarter as you intended. I think that margin guidance for the fourth quarter is down a little bit. Is that all just coming from the extra discretionary reinvestment in growth that you guys are looking at in the fourth quarter?\nBill Grogan: Yeah, I know exactly. I think the teams have done a good job managing and focusing on the critical things that we need to invest within the business. In the third quarter relative to - obviously, there's high demand for labor across a bunch of businesses, a bunch of different geographies and some head count and other items that we thought we would have landed in the third quarter just got pushed to the fourth quarter. So that will come back and put a little bit of mitigation on our overall flow-through, but still relatively strong.\nNathan Jones: Okay. And then one of the things I got from your press release was a quote where you said macro constraints that inhibit customer satisfaction. I assume that means that all of these constraints are leading to lower on-time delivery metrics for you guys. Can you talk about how much that slipped, if there's any anticipation, you'll be able to get them back up quickly, and if that impacts your ability to push pricing at all?\nEric Ashleman: Sure. Well, it's less a function, Nathan, of on-time delivery and actually a function of extending lead times and then hitting those commitments. So I mean, we've maintained a high say-do ratio relative to our customers. We use the 80/20 lens to provide differentiated services for different levels of customers, so all of that remains constant. But in this environment, the part that I think we're all struggling with is just inherently the lead times in the queue is lengthening. So it's really that - your question around when does it resolve. I think, as we indicated, it's further out on the horizon, quite honestly. I mean a bunch of the knobs have to turn together, material availability, labor availability across the spectrum and logistics. So as those start to move and start to move in, and all of us can depend on higher levels of throughput, we would be able to bring lead times back in. And ultimately, against all of that, still maintain that high [indiscernible] ratio. So it's, again, less on OTD rates and more on just lengthening lead times against expectations.\nNathan Jones: And does it impact your ability to push price at all? Or are customers just conditioned at this point that lead times are extending, and they just have to deal with it?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. It really hasn't interfered. I mean, one of the things we're always tracking is lead times relative to our typical traditional performance as well as then competitively. And because our model has generally been advantaged this way it remains so on a relative basis. So as long as that holds, that generally keeps all of the arguments and the equations where we like them.\nNathan Jones: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll pass it on.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Nat.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: First, welcome to Allison. Best of luck. Secondly, great to see you guys moving to cash EPS, it makes all kinds of sense for you, put you on that level-playing field with your growth by acquisition peers. So a great move no surprise there. So thank you. The question - so let's just roll the clock back to last quarter, and I think you guys are one of the few that thought that the whole supply chain inflation had plateaued, but it really has not. Maybe if you could just - you've kind of given the description that we've heard from everyone about inflation, supply chain, labor, et cetera. But where are you feeling the greatest pain? And is there - just to clarify on Nate's question, are there any -- have you missed out on revenues? And can you quantify that?\nEric Ashleman: Okay. So look, I mean supply chain has been a tough story for at least 6 months, and continue here into the fourth quarter. We did say at it plateaued, we said that relative to a pretty tough situation. So tough in the second quarter, tough in the third and continued tough in the fourth with, frankly, some year end dynamics that always make that quarter a little bit tougher. And so we're thinking of those as we project forward. Your question around what are we experiencing? Well, I mean there's a lot of variety in IDEX. But one thing that makes us all about the same is we tend to buy a lot of configured materials. We're not overly vertically integrated, so material availability is the #1 challenge. . And then it does vary. We've got some businesses - a few that are more semiconductor and ship-intensive. And then as you suspect, those tend to be the items for those businesses. Others, it's things like motors and castings. And typically, if they're coming from further away, that's a harder challenge. Labor availability for us, we don't have labor as a high percentage of our sales, but we do have pockets and it tracks pretty uniformly where labor is scarce either in the US or in other geographies. And I'd say as an overlay, I'd probably say all of IDEX to some degree, is continuing to try to track down scarce logistics resources, especially on smaller shipments or things that are going overseas. So I know that pretty much covers the spectrum of all possibilities. But if you want to just put a bow around it for us, it's material availability coming in through a supply chain of configured materials.\nBill Grogan: And then, Deane, maybe to your lost revenue comment, I think holistically, no. Obviously, we've got critical products across the portfolio that are spec-ed in, and high demand. This isn't a commodity application where folks can get it a week faster for dollar cheaper, they're going to go with that product. So relative to loss revenue or our ability to capture price the differentiation we have with our technology continues to support our incremental price increases across the different businesses.\nDeane Dray: All right. That's all really helpful. And just last one for me. You commented on record backlog, is there - and extended lead times, is there any chance that you'll need to go back and reprice any of that backlog? Just older it is, the more that material cost inflation weighs on it and so forth. What's your flexibility there?\nBill Grogan: Yeah, where we have the ability to do that, we're not contractually constrained. We have done that as we progress through the year.\nEric Ashleman: Yes.\nDeane Dray: Great. Thanks for all the help.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Deane.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Halloran: Good morning, everyone. So a couple of questions here. First, a lot of moving pieces in the environment as we sit here today. Certainly appreciate the color that you gave us, I guess, in this case, literally the green and red colors you gave us, and the various end markets and how those were performing. Maybe you can just start triangulating some thoughts on how you're thinking about those markets as we move into next year and maybe even through the next couple of years. Your concern level with all of the supply chain challenges, degrading demand, having some sort of circular challenge versus how you think about sustainability of the recovery curve as we sit here today and just how you balance all those moving pieces out internally?\nEric Ashleman: Sure. So there is a couple of things there. Yeah, relative to kind of the green and red chart that we provide folks. It hasn't changed a lot over the last couple of quarters in terms of the few areas that are lagging. So I'll just - I'll sort of leave those as those stories continue in energy and chemical, and we can go into those later if we like. But I'd say a few things that are new here would be - the automotive side did flip over to red for us. There's just no question but more disruption, more shutdowns even on the higher end stuff where our products tend to have good presence. . Again, a small piece of IDEX, but it is something that's changed and changed a little different. I think if you kind of come up to a segment level, I mean, as you can see from our prepared remarks, and just in our numbers, I mean, the Health Science Technology segment is doing really, really well, very, very strong got semiconductor. That's where our exposure is. That's a strong market. Anything in analytical instrumentation, life science, the food areas. We've got some pharma in there as well. Those are just kind of universally strong and we would expect those to continue strong going forward. I think we talk a lot, of course, and we turn over to FMT and our project business and the nature of those. And we have seen some movement there. This has been a slow march of progress through the year. But I would say in the areas of food and pharma, in particular, you are starting to see a shift towards some intentional capacity expansion, which lends itself into discussions with folks like us and others around project business. In places on a more classic FMT side of the spectrum: chemicals, energy. That's lagging on the other side, although even in chemicals, some of the faster turn projects we're seeing those come about. And then in that sort of right down the middle of the fairway industrial environment where a lot of our FMT businesses play. The discussions continue to move, and we are starting to see a bit of that hit-the-order board, at least indicate that it will in the first part of 2022. So I just -- I wouldn't say that the acceleration curve is different, but it continues to move more positively. Second part of your question was really around sort of the supply chain condition and it's run out. I think we were talking about this morning. I would be interesting is, overall, I think this is playing out indicating that there's still a lot of capacity that has to be put to work in the industrial space. You got too many places running 12 hours, 13 hours and running their equipment into the ground. Then some of the challenges with labor scarcity. I mean that lends itself towards automation and other things that are going to provide some support. So I do feel good about the longer-range winds at our backs and others in the industrial space. The near-term challenge, of course, is that we're sitting here, and a lot of other companies are sitting with a lot of backlog and in some ways, kind of a steady output that we wish was higher because of the supply chain challenges. Eventually, those 2 lines cross. We -- I would like to think that what would happen is the throughput would continue to increase its capacity is supplied as people come back to work and begins to catch that order rate and then it continues in a great direction. I think that's the open question for all of us is sort of how do these things resolve. Those 2 rates resolve over time in, let's say, the next 2 quarters coming into 2022. And so we're going to have to watch all of the inputs and the variables that are driving that, a pretty complex equation, of course. But I'd end with saying continued positivity, the rates of progression are -- we're seeing those feeling those, and feel good about them. It all kind of comes down to a few things that are variable in the near term.\nMike Halloran: Appreciate that. And then just usual kind of update, M&A outlook, how you think about funnel actionability? Any color around that?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. No. I mean very good. As we've talked about through most of the year here, we were intentional of putting some more resources on this job. We're looking at more projects, more interesting ideas out there traveling around. We're kicking the tires on a lot of things and have a strong funnel in a variety of areas, both things that apply to IDEX businesses and are in close universes as well as kind of an open line of things that are interesting and IDEX like that we might consider over time. So both in good shape, and we're excited about prospects there as we go forward. .\nMike Halloran: Thanks, everyone. Appreciate it.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Summerville: Thanks. Just with respect to the change in reporting as it relates to acquired intangibles amortization, what is that number build for IDEX expected to be in '21? And if you have something you can give us for '22, that might be helpful. And then I have a follow-up.\nBill Grogan: Yes. Matt, we'll give guidance on what that number was for '21, and our go-forward guide once we come out with our numbers in late January.\nMatt Summerville: Okay. And then with respect to Flow MD, the volatility you've seen in that business, Eric, seems a bit outside of what I tend to call on IDEX-like business. I was wondering if you could just give a little more thoughts on how we should be thinking about that going forward.\nEric Ashleman: Sure. Sure. Well, it has some attributes. I mean it's very IDEX-like in terms of the problems it solves, and sort of position on the bill of materials for the fossil fuels infrastructure in the country. So that is typical. But you're right, relative to the average IDEX business, the unit of measure of the sale price of the product is a lot larger. This is -- these are pretty large units. In fact, the nature of projects in terms of how those orders come to us are larger as well. It tends to be very much a capital-intensive kind of way of doing business. And so this is a business that, remember, if we just back up over the last year when we acquired it, had really, really high levels of backlog because they captured a lot of projects long ago prior to the acquisition. Then, of course, things change pretty dramatically in terms of how the major folks that are in charge of the pipelines in the U.S. We're talking about capital spend. We burned off that backlog and now find ourselves kind of in a steady state against replenishments and maintenance projects. We do a few things internationally. But the core of this business is still ultimately around the build-out or refurbishment around pipeline infrastructure in the US. It comes in larger project increments, and the sale price of the end product is larger. So the - for all of those reasons, the magnitude year-over-year is a larger swing than you would typically see in IDEX. That's why we've been careful to call it out and make sure people understand it within the FMT results.\nMatt Summerville: Got it. And then just one final one. Just in terms of pricing, you typically get somewhere in the range of 100, maybe 150 basis points in a good year. And I'm curious as to where your realization is on a year-over-year basis at the present time? And how much of that should be viewed as more -- as permanent in nature versus maybe some of that's more surcharge like? So any color you could provide there would be helpful.\nBill Grogan: Yes. No. So we're in excess of 200 basis points this year. It will be a record year for price capture for the organization. Majority of it is permanent price increases. Obviously, we looked at surcharges on the freight side as that's been much more variable to offset that. But most of it will continue into our base level pricing for 2022.\nMatt Summerville: Great. Thank you, guys.\nBill Grogan: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. And welcome, Allison. Eric, I want to go back to your comments and just kind of beat this up a little bit more. Supply chains tempering a little bit of the growth. I guess, one, is there a way to quantify sort of what that impact was in the quarter in terms of maybe lost one or two points of organic. Then I guess - and then along with that, Bill, you talked about working capital, some increases there, and I suspect part of that is a supply chain issue. Is there an opportunity here for you guys to attack, and maybe more fully in the first part of next year, some of those lead times and start to bring them in a little bit? Just any color there?\nEric Ashleman: Sure, Allison. In terms of output, we could have realized with a slightly more favorable backdrop in the supply chain, probably in the range of a couple of percentage points of the organic rates that we posted. Just simply had the order, could have made it and can point to something that prevented it in one of those 3 categories that I talked to. I'll let Bill talk about the inventory. I will say we, like many businesses, on critical material if we can get it even if it doesn't make up perfectly with some other things, we're going to -- we'll take the spot and take the material. So there's a little bit of investment in working capital there. I think the last part of your question around, can we attack it? I think like a lot of other businesses, we're scrambling to lift our capacity and help our supply chain in any way we can on all dimensions. So some businesses are attacking the labor scarcity issue in very unique ways and very innovative, quite honestly. Others and most of it comes down to, in some places, capital spend. We're doing some things and thinking through capital that we know we have to put into the business so we kind of watch that ramp throughout the year. And that makes sense, and wherever possible. IDEX is not an easy business to automate, but we're doing it more than we have been before because it also helps solve the labor issue. Sometimes this comes down to design, which is something that people don't think a lot about. Sometimes you can actually alter designs, whether it's in simple circuitry or even some of the other parts that we have, and assist with fabrication. This is where our local proximity really helps us. So we can get in a car and drive over to a supplier and kind of have a collaborative discussion of, is there a different way to solve this problem and bring material in. So it's pretty much every day, if you went to one of our daily management sessions, you'd probably see that 70% of the discussion is around solving problems of this nature, both in the short term, and then wherever possible, and longer term in terms of investments or problem-solving.\nBill Grogan: Yes. And I think there will be opportunities on the working capital side once things normalize, but time will tell when that is. We're assuming back half of next year, but we'll see.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. And then just in terms of HST, strong quarter there. And you had mentioned, obviously, investments have been starting -- certainly contribute to core. Is there a way to quantify sort of what that contribution to core was this quarter as well as any comments on sort of the mix impact that some of those investments are having in terms of those products being delivered today?\nBill Grogan: No. I'd say when you look across the portfolio, there's been robust margin expansion in almost -- well I shouldn't say almost, in every single reporting unit. Since we have -- we highlighted a couple, but there's been targeted investments in all entities within the HST segment that have -- you just look at the overall margin expansion that we've experienced there as we realize some of the incremental revenue associated with it. And because of the differentiated nature of that technology, the high margin associated with it. We did some folks highlight. Sequentially, the margin was down in HST, but that's really due to Airtech coming into the portfolio. On a like-for-like basis, margins are still at kind of those all-time highs we saw in the second quarter, and look for that in the core to continue here as we go forward.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. Thank you.\nBill Grogan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning. This is Robert in for Joe. Yeah, I just wanted to touch on orders again. Do you have any sense of how much your customers are trying to like build their inventory. And I guess also like how much of the order activity feels consistent with like actual demand trends.\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. No, it's a good question. I mean, so a couple of things. One is when we think about the nature of most IDEX products, it's highly configured, some ways customized for each application. And so typically, it's not a great product to over order lots up because you're never quite sure of how it's going to run out when the customer system. I would say what is a little different as we go through the year here in terms of typical patterns, it's just lengthening of sort of order horizon. So if somebody would have before given us, let's say, six months' worth of requirements, they might throw another quarter in there, recognizing, hey, this is a standard product. We know we're going to use it in this particular case, and we don't want to lose a place in line. That tracks actually with our own lead times as we extended those lead times, most equations would work and say then that's how you would change your order patterns to accommodate it. So I really - we've never seen a tremendous run-up of inventory IDEX material. Our distributors and channel within FMT doesn't really work that way. Most people still, as they think of planning for IDEX products, think of us as generally on the very agile, reactive end of the spectrum, and they haven't really changed their thinking around it as the entire world kind of goes through a relative change in shift outward.\nUnidentified Analyst: That's helpful. Thank you for that. And then I guess I have a quick one also, just a follow-up on the M&A pipeline. It sounds like you said is very healthy, and integration of Airtech, which is one of your largest acquisitions to date, is going well. And with all the focus that you have internally on those initiatives going forward. This might be a break from previous acquisition behavior, but would you all be considering anything more transformational in nature, like a really big acquisition that might be like a new segment or something like that?\nEric Ashleman: Well, I mean, I'd say 2 things there. One, we always consider kind of every chapter within possibilities, things that are very small, like little pieces of technology we want to tuck-ins, things like in Airtech or, frankly, ABEL pumps, which are more typical of IDEX transactions in the past. And then we do consider from time-to-time things at the other end of the spectrum that are larger. I think you always want to exercise that muscle, but we're always careful to say, for something in that category, it would have to have very IDEX-like characteristics to mitigate risk. And there's just not a giant universe of things that are in that particular bucket. And if there were, actionability is always somewhat of a question. And so we do consider it from time to time, we don't turn that switch off, but we recognize the probability is generally lower for the reasons that I suggested there. Just thinking about how it would mix and complement IDEX and where it would attach given the large size that you're describing. But every one of those chapters is something that we kind of walk it down as a book in our own follow-up calls.\nUnidentified Analyst: That\u2019s great. Thank you very much.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to hand the call back over to - no, we do have another question from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Wertheimer: Hi, everybody. Just a little bit curious if you can give more background around the targeted spending. You mentioned Fire & Safety, cost pressure mitigation and/or whatever. And then you've been talking about the discretionary investments for a couple of quarters. I know last year, there's obviously some discretionary cuts. But just generally speaking, are you seeing more opportunity? Are you trying to change anything in the way you attack opportunities with the investments? Thanks.\nEric Ashleman: Sure. I mean, generally, when we talk about growth investments in IDEX, they often walk on 2 legs. I mean they're people that we're going to bring into the business with specific skills for the charter to go focus in front-end areas, usually on the commercial side or strategic or thinking around putting the balance sheet to work. So there are other things that we'll do, sometimes third-party services, a couple of things in terms of nurturing and shaping technology, but a lot of times, it comes down to people-based investments. And just amping up the ability to go out and study things, spend time in the field, get the inputs that we need to then begin to modulate the technologies that we have in-house or the others we might bring in.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay. Perfect. That's a helpful response. And then just in Fire & Safety. And then just a path to -- I don't know, the path and mechanism on recapturing some of the cost pressures there. And I will stop. Thank you.\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. I mean it's just a little off the IDEX typical. We do, as we mentioned, have a little bit more OEM concentration there. this is where some of the larger project work tends to be as well. You put the two things together, and you're not as able as we are in FMT and other places to just sort of go out and make those discrete changes quickly. So it doesn't mean we don't get that capture. The margin performance over time would absolutely verify that we do. It's just -- it does tend to lag a little bit from the rest of the more typical IDEX location. So - but the arguments, the pricing argument around criticality of solution and leveraging our position, our number one share position within those niches and our long relationship with customers, that's basically the same equation. It's just you have to be a little bit more cognizant of the timing and the duration of projects and things that are just a little different there. So we wouldn't see this as something that's going to dramatically alter the margin performance of that company over time or those businesses, but it will take us a little longer to catch up here.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vlad Bystricky with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nVlad Bystricky: Good morning, team. Thanks for taking the call.\nEric Ashleman: Morning.\nVlad Bystricky: So just wanted to follow up on some of the reinvestment that you're doing, and particularly given supply chain and logistics issues you see out there now. Has your thinking about where you're targeting investment dollars evolved or changed over the course of the year as you've seen the supply chain and inflationary pressures continue to increase and not really get any better?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. I mean that's a great question. And the short answer is no. When you think about -- when you consider the cycles of our business, one of the things that's really, really important is that even as near-term things like supply chain challenges, all the stuff we talked about, disrupt the day-to-day, and maybe that even continues for a series of quarters, the best that you're going to make, you got to consider as you're making them today to sometimes flares 2, 3, 5 years in the future. And I was reflecting when we talked about all the positive aspects that are happening in HST, many of which were coming out of specific facilities that we bought for specific reasons to get it in different markets, actually went back and checked the dates. Those were commissioned in 2016, '17 and '18, basically, and they're now at full fruition here, and we're very glad we made those bets. So we just have to be very aware of sort of longer-term trends, longer-term positioning and make sure that we're both doing two things simultaneously. One, reacting appropriately to the disruptions in front of us, but also projecting and extending ourselves into '23, '24, '25 and making sure that those bets and those first discussions around growth are actually happening now.\nVlad Bystricky: Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks. And then maybe just shifting gears a bit. I know Asia is a smaller piece of the mix for you versus the U.S. and Europe. But can you talk about what you saw in terms of growth trends in the region over the course of 3Q and into 4Q, given the evolving COVID situation and policy responses in countries like China and Malaysia?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. And I preface both. I mean most of our areas where we play. We've got a campus in India, a campus in China, and then we've got some commercial things across broader Southeast Asia. And I would say, in general, those have performed very well for us, the last few years. They have performed well in 2021. I remind everybody it is a smaller portion of IDEX, and we attack it in a really surgical way. So we're picking specific niches, specific applications and then mating up technologies that we have available in IDEX to go after those. That -- I mean we're picking them because we think in many times, they're somewhat immune to some of the ebbs and flows that you would see more day-to-day or quarter-to-quarter because they've got growth dynamics at their back. So we're doing things in air ventilators and things for high altitude, or paint dispensing is a great market across all of that region for that specific reason. Now specifically, I would say we -- as a backdrop, I don't think we're seeing things that are different than others have talked about in terms of more moderate growth rates in China. And in a couple of instances, I'll talk to China specifically, we have some headwinds where there's -- and we mentioned this, there's a build for China belief out there around certain markets and things that they are very interested in investing in -- and that provides headwinds for us, but I would say that's where innovation kicks in. What we're able to offer is quite different than the local option. -- just means the sales cycle has extended a little longer, a little harder, but ultimately, we think our differentiation wins there. It's been a great performing region for us.\nVlad Bystricky: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.\nEric Ashleman: Okay. Well, thank you. Again, I'd like to welcome Allison to our team and our session here and thank everybody for your interest and your time today to hear what's going on at IDEX. As we said, it's a really interesting time, a lot of challenges out there. My closing comments would be for those IDEX associates that are on this call. Again, I really want to thank you. I know how hard this is in terms of the day-to-day challenges you have. I know you're doing the right things for the customers, for the business and for your colleagues and frankly, your communities as well. So thanks to everybody. And I wish you all safety and prosperity in the days and weeks ahead.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.+",

            "content": "Thanks, Eric. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on slide nine. Q3 orders of $774 million were up 36% overall and up 28% organically. We built $62 million of backlog in the quarter, and all three segments had strong organic performance versus last year as well as versus the third quarter of 2019. Third quarter sales of $712 million were up 23% overall and up 15% organically. We continue to experience a strong rebound from the pandemic across our portfolio, tempered by supply chain constraints. The Flow MD pressure and Fluid & Metering Eric discussed, also had an impact on overall organic sales. Excluding Flow MD, organic sales would have been up 18% overall. Q3 gross margin expanded 50 basis points to 43.8%. The increase over the prior year quarter was primarily driven by increased volume and price capture, partly offset by inflation and supply chain impacts. Excluding the impact of a $9.1 million pretax fair value inventory step-up charge related to the Airtech acquisition, adjusted gross margin was 45%, and improved sequentially. Third quarter operating margin was 22.6%, flat compared to prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 24.3%, up 120 basis points compared to prior year, largely driven by our gross margin expansion and fixed cost leverage, offset with some pressure from targeted reinvestments and the dilutive impact of Airtech and ABEL acquisitions due to their intangible amortization costs. I will discuss the drivers of operating income in more detail on the next slide. Our Q3 effective tax rate was 23.4%, which was higher than the prior year ETR of 14.4% due to the finalization of tax regulations enacted in the third quarter of 2020 as well as a decrease in the excess tax benefit related to share-based compensation in the current period. Third quarter net income was $116 million, which resulted in an EPS of $1.51. Adjusted net income was $125 million, resulting in an adjusted EPS of $1.63, up $0.23 or 16% over prior year adjusted EPS. The tax rate movement I mentioned drives a $0.27 differential in EPS as compared to the prior year quarter. Said differently, our EPS would have expanded by $0.50 or 35% had 2021 been taxed at the 2020 rate. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $142 million, up 5% compared to prior year, and was 113% of adjusted net income. The result was impacted by higher earnings, partly offset by volume-driven working capital build. Our working capital efficiency metrics remain strong, and the teams continue to do a good job managing significant year-over-year volume and supply chain challenges. Moving on to slide 10, which details the drivers of our adjusted operating profit. Adjusted operating income increased $39 million for the quarter compared to the prior year. Our 15% organic growth contributed approximately $29 million, flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. We achieved positive price cost within the quarter, and saw our price, cost spread improved sequentially. Our teams continue to drive operational productivity as another lever to help mitigate the profit headwinds we experienced from supply chain costs and associated inefficiencies. The positive mix is a primary result of the portfolio and business mix normalizing to pre-pandemic levels that had a negative impact on our results last year. As Eric mentioned, we are actively investing in the resources we need to execute on future growth and productivity. This reinvestment back into the business, higher variable compensation and targeted increases in discretionary spending drive the year-over-year pressure of $15 million. Despite the incremental spend, inflation and supply chain-driven operational efficiencies, we still achieved a solid 37% organic flow-through. Flow-through is then negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX, getting us to a reported flow-through of 30%. With a significant amount of focus dedicated to navigating supply chain disruptions, we did not fully execute on the level of spend we expected in the quarter. We intend to make these investments in the fourth quarter, and they will mitigate our flow-through a bit as we close out the year. With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. I'm on slide 11. For the fourth quarter, we are projecting adjusted EPS to range from $1.55 to $1.58. We expect organic revenue growth of 9% to 10% and adjusted operating margins between 23.5% and 24%. Q4 results are slightly lower than the third quarter, driven by organic and inorganic resource investments seasonality and the potential for year-end logistics challenges. The Q4 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. We expect about 0.5% of top line benefit from FX, and corporate costs in Q4 are expected to be around $19 million. Turning to the full year. We are narrowing our full year EPS guidance from a range of $6.26 to $6.36 to $6.30 to $6.33. We are also maintaining our full year organic growth of 11% to 12%. We expect operating margins of approximately 24%. We expect FX to provide 1.5% benefit to top line results. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $65 million, in line with our previous guidance. Free cash flow is expected to be around 105% of net income, lower versus our last guide primarily due to working capital investments. And corporate costs are expected to be approximately $73 million for the year. Our earnings guidance excludes impacts from future acquisitions and any future restructuring charges. Finally, beginning in 2022, IDEX will provide EPS guidance and report actual results, excluding the impacts of after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization. We believe reporting adjusted EPS on this basis will provide more transparency to our core operating results as well as facilitate comparisons with our peer companies as we continue on our capital deployment journey. With that, I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts. Now we can. Yeah, I know exactly. I think the teams have done a good job managing and focusing on the critical things that we need to invest within the business. In the third quarter relative to - obviously, there's high demand for labor across a bunch of businesses, a bunch of different geographies and some head count and other items that we thought we would have landed in the third quarter just got pushed to the fourth quarter. So that will come back and put a little bit of mitigation on our overall flow-through, but still relatively strong. And then, Deane, maybe to your lost revenue comment, I think holistically, no. Obviously, we've got critical products across the portfolio that are spec-ed in, and high demand. This isn't a commodity application where folks can get it a week faster for dollar cheaper, they're going to go with that product. So relative to loss revenue or our ability to capture price the differentiation we have with our technology continues to support our incremental price increases across the different businesses. Yeah, where we have the ability to do that, we're not contractually constrained. We have done that as we progress through the year. Yes. Matt, we'll give guidance on what that number was for '21, and our go-forward guide once we come out with our numbers in late January. Yes. No. So we're in excess of 200 basis points this year. It will be a record year for price capture for the organization. Majority of it is permanent price increases. Obviously, we looked at surcharges on the freight side as that's been much more variable to offset that. But most of it will continue into our base level pricing for 2022. Thank you. Yes. And I think there will be opportunities on the working capital side once things normalize, but time will tell when that is. We're assuming back half of next year, but we'll see. No. I'd say when you look across the portfolio, there's been robust margin expansion in almost -- well I shouldn't say almost, in every single reporting unit. Since we have -- we highlighted a couple, but there's been targeted investments in all entities within the HST segment that have -- you just look at the overall margin expansion that we've experienced there as we realize some of the incremental revenue associated with it. And because of the differentiated nature of that technology, the high margin associated with it. We did some folks highlight. Sequentially, the margin was down in HST, but that's really due to Airtech coming into the portfolio. On a like-for-like basis, margins are still at kind of those all-time highs we saw in the second quarter, and look for that in the core to continue here as we go forward. Thank you."

            "name": "Eric Ashleman",
            "content": "Thank you, Allison. Welcome to IDEX. It's a pleasure to have you on the team. I'd like to start by thanking Mike Yates, our former Chief Accounting Officer, for his 16 years of service to IDEX. Mike help lead an evolution of our finance and accounting organization and his work has had a long lasting impact on the business. On behalf of the entire IDEX team, I wish Mike the best in his future endeavors. Now let's turn to our IDEX overview on slide six. We continue to see supply chain challenges throughout the third quarter. Our localized sourcing, production and selling model helps us a bit relative to others, but this prolonged environment of poor material, labor and logistics availability challenges us just like any other business. Despite these obstacles, our IDEX teams around the globe have risen to the occasion. They exhibited both resiliency and stamina as they overcame yet another quarter filled with day-to-day disruptions, all while providing a high level of support to our customers. I want to thank all the IDEX team members across the globe for your hard work, not just in Q3 but over the last 18 months of business within a pandemic. At this stage, we don't see any near-term signs of diminishing macroeconomic headwinds. Rather, we expect they'll remain at a high level and persist into 2022. We'll continue to leverage our 80/20 principles as we align around our best customers, our best prospects for growth and our critical business priorities. I spoke last quarter about our ability to capture price due to the differentiated mission-critical nature of our products. Overall, the price actions that we took over the past six months were increasingly realized in the third quarter, and we saw our price, cost spread increase sequentially. We will push price aggressively and appropriately as conditions continue to support our arguments. Despite the many challenges out there, our organic performance remains strong. We set another record in the third quarter for orders, sales and backlog. Our backlog is now $186 million higher than it was at the end of last year. Signals around the return of industrial projects have intensified and current energy prices, if sustained, have the potential to drive investments within IDEX application areas. Our Health Science and Technologies segment performed exceptionally well. Over the past 5 or so years, we have stepped up organic investments with our focus on the longer term. Within our sealing business, we built a new facility with the goal of capturing share in the expanding semiconductor market. We brought three optics facilities together, and our new Optics Center of Excellence to enable future wins in life sciences by integrating multiple IDEX components to create value for our customers. We optimized the footprint and core technology of our material processing technology platform to enable long-term repeatable growth across a series of technologies. These investments have generated tremendous returns, and we are well positioned to capture share and capitalize on market growth going forward. On the inorganic side, our recent acquisitions are doing extremely well. Abel Pumps is fully integrated and performing ahead of expectations. The Airtech integration is ahead of schedule, and the team is making strong progress on their growth strategy. Both are executing well in the challenging operating environment as they come up to speed on our 80/20 playbook. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample capital available to support future acquisitions and investments in the business. Our M&A funnel is healthy. Our expanded team has identified a number of interesting opportunities as we look to deploy additional capital in the near and long term. In the end, we are focused on delivering and growing within a very difficult near term operating environment while spending a significant part of each day thinking about the best investments in teams, technologies and business opportunities to thrive in the years to come. I'm very confident in our team's ability to outperform in both areas. With that, I'll turn to our market outlook on page seven. In our Fluid & Metering technology segment, industrial day rates were favorable versus the second quarter. Larger industrial projects still lag, but quote activity and funnel strength have both improved. Agriculture remains robust, delivering on record volumes. Our water businesses continue to perform well. Municipal spending is steady, and there is general optimism around future increased government funding. The chemical and energy markets continue to lag primarily due to limited capital investment. However, on the chemical side, smaller, fast starting projects performed well. We are cautiously optimistic on energy as increased fuel prices and concerns over energy shortages have the potential to trigger investment. As we noted last quarter, our Flow MD business has experienced a significant pullback in customers' capital investments. It impacted FMT's organic sales by 8%. In other words, excluding the impact of Flow MD, FMT organic sales would have grown 15% instead of 7% as reported. Moving to the Health & Science Technologies segment. We continue to see strong demand across all our end markets. Semiconductor, food and pharma, analytical instrumentation and life sciences all performed well. We continue to win share through our targeted growth initiatives, and our intentionality around identifying opportunities that grow faster than the broader market is paying off. The automotive market remains affected by supply chain-driven challenges, but we continue to see growth due to our concentration in higher end European vehicles. The industrial businesses within the segment saw a trend similar to FMT. Finally, our Fire & Safety Diversified Products segment is our most challenged segment right now. Price capture and volume offsets faced stronger headwinds within the segment due to higher direct OEM exposure and higher levels of material intensity due to vertical integration. In Fire & Safety, North America Fire OEM production continues to struggle due to supply chain challenges. Larger tender activity is slowly increasing within the global Fire Rescue markets, but we feel these market challenges will persist into 2022. US automotive production pullbacks due to microprocessor shortages have tempered the performance of our banded business. We continue to achieve new platform wins and believe we're well positioned to supply chain constraints eventually ease. But in the third quarter, the impact of automotive shutdowns increased versus last quarter and moderated our performance. Finally, dispensing performed well as key customers deploy capital on strong DIY market demand, and our global product offerings capture share. We continue to closely monitor market conditions and expect rolling supply chain disruptions to continue throughout the balance of the year and into 2022. That said, our third quarter organic orders were flat sequentially versus second quarter, and our backlog remains at a record level. Overall, the demand environment for IDEX products is not weighed [ph] despite supply chain challenges, and we remain optimistic about the trajectory of our end markets. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results. Thanks, Bill. I'm on the final slide, slide 12. Before we open the call up to questions, I'd like to share a few updates around our great teams. First off, I'd like to extend my public congratulations to our Non-Executive Chairman, Bill Cook, on being named Public Company Director of the Year by the National Association of Corporate Directors. Bill and I both joined IDEX around the same time in 2008, and I've learned a great deal from him over the years. His insightful perspective and critical thinking skills have been tremendously helpful for the company, and I know I speak for everyone at IDEX when I say congratulations, Bill, on this well deserved honor. Turning to the IDEX Foundation. Last month, the foundation entered a national partnership with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Various US-based business units have supported their local boys and girls clubs over the years, but this takes our joint work to the next level, offering a clear pathway for increased engagement. Every one of our U.S. business units is close to at least one boys and girls club location. This agreement aligns with the foundation's equity and opportunity charitable pillar added earlier this year, seeking to create opportunities for underserved disadvantaged people of color within our community. Finally, we attribute much of our success to our strong foundational culture. Our annual September engagement survey just came back. And even within this incredibly challenging environment, loaded with disruptions in unexpected turns, we held study and were scored in the top quartile of all manufacturing companies. Our teams around the world are beginning to develop tactical plans to address feedback provided by their local teams, part of the continuous improvement that supports everything we do at IDEX. With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions. I think we lost Nathan. Now we can. Sure. Well, it's less a function, Nathan, of on-time delivery and actually a function of extending lead times and then hitting those commitments. So I mean, we've maintained a high say-do ratio relative to our customers. We use the 80/20 lens to provide differentiated services for different levels of customers, so all of that remains constant. But in this environment, the part that I think we're all struggling with is just inherently the lead times in the queue is lengthening. So it's really that - your question around when does it resolve. I think, as we indicated, it's further out on the horizon, quite honestly. I mean a bunch of the knobs have to turn together, material availability, labor availability across the spectrum and logistics. So as those start to move and start to move in, and all of us can depend on higher levels of throughput, we would be able to bring lead times back in. And ultimately, against all of that, still maintain that high [indiscernible] ratio. So it's, again, less on OTD rates and more on just lengthening lead times against expectations. Yeah. It really hasn't interfered. I mean, one of the things we're always tracking is lead times relative to our typical traditional performance as well as then competitively. And because our model has generally been advantaged this way it remains so on a relative basis. So as long as that holds, that generally keeps all of the arguments and the equations where we like them. Thanks, Nat. Morning, Deane. Okay. So look, I mean supply chain has been a tough story for at least 6 months, and continue here into the fourth quarter. We did say at it plateaued, we said that relative to a pretty tough situation. So tough in the second quarter, tough in the third and continued tough in the fourth with, frankly, some year end dynamics that always make that quarter a little bit tougher. And so we're thinking of those as we project forward. Your question around what are we experiencing? Well, I mean there's a lot of variety in IDEX. But one thing that makes us all about the same is we tend to buy a lot of configured materials. We're not overly vertically integrated, so material availability is the #1 challenge. . And then it does vary. We've got some businesses - a few that are more semiconductor and ship-intensive. And then as you suspect, those tend to be the items for those businesses. Others, it's things like motors and castings. And typically, if they're coming from further away, that's a harder challenge. Labor availability for us, we don't have labor as a high percentage of our sales, but we do have pockets and it tracks pretty uniformly where labor is scarce either in the US or in other geographies. And I'd say as an overlay, I'd probably say all of IDEX to some degree, is continuing to try to track down scarce logistics resources, especially on smaller shipments or things that are going overseas. So I know that pretty much covers the spectrum of all possibilities. But if you want to just put a bow around it for us, it's material availability coming in through a supply chain of configured materials. Yes. Thanks, Deane. Sure. So there is a couple of things there. Yeah, relative to kind of the green and red chart that we provide folks. It hasn't changed a lot over the last couple of quarters in terms of the few areas that are lagging. So I'll just - I'll sort of leave those as those stories continue in energy and chemical, and we can go into those later if we like. But I'd say a few things that are new here would be - the automotive side did flip over to red for us. There's just no question but more disruption, more shutdowns even on the higher end stuff where our products tend to have good presence. . Again, a small piece of IDEX, but it is something that's changed and changed a little different. I think if you kind of come up to a segment level, I mean, as you can see from our prepared remarks, and just in our numbers, I mean, the Health Science Technology segment is doing really, really well, very, very strong got semiconductor. That's where our exposure is. That's a strong market. Anything in analytical instrumentation, life science, the food areas. We've got some pharma in there as well. Those are just kind of universally strong and we would expect those to continue strong going forward. I think we talk a lot, of course, and we turn over to FMT and our project business and the nature of those. And we have seen some movement there. This has been a slow march of progress through the year. But I would say in the areas of food and pharma, in particular, you are starting to see a shift towards some intentional capacity expansion, which lends itself into discussions with folks like us and others around project business. In places on a more classic FMT side of the spectrum: chemicals, energy. That's lagging on the other side, although even in chemicals, some of the faster turn projects we're seeing those come about. And then in that sort of right down the middle of the fairway industrial environment where a lot of our FMT businesses play. The discussions continue to move, and we are starting to see a bit of that hit-the-order board, at least indicate that it will in the first part of 2022. So I just -- I wouldn't say that the acceleration curve is different, but it continues to move more positively. Second part of your question was really around sort of the supply chain condition and it's run out. I think we were talking about this morning. I would be interesting is, overall, I think this is playing out indicating that there's still a lot of capacity that has to be put to work in the industrial space. You got too many places running 12 hours, 13 hours and running their equipment into the ground. Then some of the challenges with labor scarcity. I mean that lends itself towards automation and other things that are going to provide some support. So I do feel good about the longer-range winds at our backs and others in the industrial space. The near-term challenge, of course, is that we're sitting here, and a lot of other companies are sitting with a lot of backlog and in some ways, kind of a steady output that we wish was higher because of the supply chain challenges. Eventually, those 2 lines cross. We -- I would like to think that what would happen is the throughput would continue to increase its capacity is supplied as people come back to work and begins to catch that order rate and then it continues in a great direction. I think that's the open question for all of us is sort of how do these things resolve. Those 2 rates resolve over time in, let's say, the next 2 quarters coming into 2022. And so we're going to have to watch all of the inputs and the variables that are driving that, a pretty complex equation, of course. But I'd end with saying continued positivity, the rates of progression are -- we're seeing those feeling those, and feel good about them. It all kind of comes down to a few things that are variable in the near term. Yeah. No. I mean very good. As we've talked about through most of the year here, we were intentional of putting some more resources on this job. We're looking at more projects, more interesting ideas out there traveling around. We're kicking the tires on a lot of things and have a strong funnel in a variety of areas, both things that apply to IDEX businesses and are in close universes as well as kind of an open line of things that are interesting and IDEX like that we might consider over time. So both in good shape, and we're excited about prospects there as we go forward. . Thanks, Mike. Sure. Sure. Well, it has some attributes. I mean it's very IDEX-like in terms of the problems it solves, and sort of position on the bill of materials for the fossil fuels infrastructure in the country. So that is typical. But you're right, relative to the average IDEX business, the unit of measure of the sale price of the product is a lot larger. This is -- these are pretty large units. In fact, the nature of projects in terms of how those orders come to us are larger as well. It tends to be very much a capital-intensive kind of way of doing business. And so this is a business that, remember, if we just back up over the last year when we acquired it, had really, really high levels of backlog because they captured a lot of projects long ago prior to the acquisition. Then, of course, things change pretty dramatically in terms of how the major folks that are in charge of the pipelines in the U.S. We're talking about capital spend. We burned off that backlog and now find ourselves kind of in a steady state against replenishments and maintenance projects. We do a few things internationally. But the core of this business is still ultimately around the build-out or refurbishment around pipeline infrastructure in the US. It comes in larger project increments, and the sale price of the end product is larger. So the - for all of those reasons, the magnitude year-over-year is a larger swing than you would typically see in IDEX. That's why we've been careful to call it out and make sure people understand it within the FMT results. Sure, Allison. In terms of output, we could have realized with a slightly more favorable backdrop in the supply chain, probably in the range of a couple of percentage points of the organic rates that we posted. Just simply had the order, could have made it and can point to something that prevented it in one of those 3 categories that I talked to. I'll let Bill talk about the inventory. I will say we, like many businesses, on critical material if we can get it even if it doesn't make up perfectly with some other things, we're going to -- we'll take the spot and take the material. So there's a little bit of investment in working capital there. I think the last part of your question around, can we attack it? I think like a lot of other businesses, we're scrambling to lift our capacity and help our supply chain in any way we can on all dimensions. So some businesses are attacking the labor scarcity issue in very unique ways and very innovative, quite honestly. Others and most of it comes down to, in some places, capital spend. We're doing some things and thinking through capital that we know we have to put into the business so we kind of watch that ramp throughout the year. And that makes sense, and wherever possible. IDEX is not an easy business to automate, but we're doing it more than we have been before because it also helps solve the labor issue. Sometimes this comes down to design, which is something that people don't think a lot about. Sometimes you can actually alter designs, whether it's in simple circuitry or even some of the other parts that we have, and assist with fabrication. This is where our local proximity really helps us. So we can get in a car and drive over to a supplier and kind of have a collaborative discussion of, is there a different way to solve this problem and bring material in. So it's pretty much every day, if you went to one of our daily management sessions, you'd probably see that 70% of the discussion is around solving problems of this nature, both in the short term, and then wherever possible, and longer term in terms of investments or problem-solving. Yeah. No, it's a good question. I mean, so a couple of things. One is when we think about the nature of most IDEX products, it's highly configured, some ways customized for each application. And so typically, it's not a great product to over order lots up because you're never quite sure of how it's going to run out when the customer system. I would say what is a little different as we go through the year here in terms of typical patterns, it's just lengthening of sort of order horizon. So if somebody would have before given us, let's say, six months' worth of requirements, they might throw another quarter in there, recognizing, hey, this is a standard product. We know we're going to use it in this particular case, and we don't want to lose a place in line. That tracks actually with our own lead times as we extended those lead times, most equations would work and say then that's how you would change your order patterns to accommodate it. So I really - we've never seen a tremendous run-up of inventory IDEX material. Our distributors and channel within FMT doesn't really work that way. Most people still, as they think of planning for IDEX products, think of us as generally on the very agile, reactive end of the spectrum, and they haven't really changed their thinking around it as the entire world kind of goes through a relative change in shift outward. Well, I mean, I'd say 2 things there. One, we always consider kind of every chapter within possibilities, things that are very small, like little pieces of technology we want to tuck-ins, things like in Airtech or, frankly, ABEL pumps, which are more typical of IDEX transactions in the past. And then we do consider from time-to-time things at the other end of the spectrum that are larger. I think you always want to exercise that muscle, but we're always careful to say, for something in that category, it would have to have very IDEX-like characteristics to mitigate risk. And there's just not a giant universe of things that are in that particular bucket. And if there were, actionability is always somewhat of a question. And so we do consider it from time to time, we don't turn that switch off, but we recognize the probability is generally lower for the reasons that I suggested there. Just thinking about how it would mix and complement IDEX and where it would attach given the large size that you're describing. But every one of those chapters is something that we kind of walk it down as a book in our own follow-up calls. Thank you. Sure. I mean, generally, when we talk about growth investments in IDEX, they often walk on 2 legs. I mean they're people that we're going to bring into the business with specific skills for the charter to go focus in front-end areas, usually on the commercial side or strategic or thinking around putting the balance sheet to work. So there are other things that we'll do, sometimes third-party services, a couple of things in terms of nurturing and shaping technology, but a lot of times, it comes down to people-based investments. And just amping up the ability to go out and study things, spend time in the field, get the inputs that we need to then begin to modulate the technologies that we have in-house or the others we might bring in. Yeah. I mean it's just a little off the IDEX typical. We do, as we mentioned, have a little bit more OEM concentration there. this is where some of the larger project work tends to be as well. You put the two things together, and you're not as able as we are in FMT and other places to just sort of go out and make those discrete changes quickly. So it doesn't mean we don't get that capture. The margin performance over time would absolutely verify that we do. It's just -- it does tend to lag a little bit from the rest of the more typical IDEX location. So - but the arguments, the pricing argument around criticality of solution and leveraging our position, our number one share position within those niches and our long relationship with customers, that's basically the same equation. It's just you have to be a little bit more cognizant of the timing and the duration of projects and things that are just a little different there. So we wouldn't see this as something that's going to dramatically alter the margin performance of that company over time or those businesses, but it will take us a little longer to catch up here. Morning. Yeah. I mean that's a great question. And the short answer is no. When you think about -- when you consider the cycles of our business, one of the things that's really, really important is that even as near-term things like supply chain challenges, all the stuff we talked about, disrupt the day-to-day, and maybe that even continues for a series of quarters, the best that you're going to make, you got to consider as you're making them today to sometimes flares 2, 3, 5 years in the future. And I was reflecting when we talked about all the positive aspects that are happening in HST, many of which were coming out of specific facilities that we bought for specific reasons to get it in different markets, actually went back and checked the dates. Those were commissioned in 2016, '17 and '18, basically, and they're now at full fruition here, and we're very glad we made those bets. So we just have to be very aware of sort of longer-term trends, longer-term positioning and make sure that we're both doing two things simultaneously. One, reacting appropriately to the disruptions in front of us, but also projecting and extending ourselves into '23, '24, '25 and making sure that those bets and those first discussions around growth are actually happening now. Yeah. And I preface both. I mean most of our areas where we play. We've got a campus in India, a campus in China, and then we've got some commercial things across broader Southeast Asia. And I would say, in general, those have performed very well for us, the last few years. They have performed well in 2021. I remind everybody it is a smaller portion of IDEX, and we attack it in a really surgical way. So we're picking specific niches, specific applications and then mating up technologies that we have available in IDEX to go after those. That -- I mean we're picking them because we think in many times, they're somewhat immune to some of the ebbs and flows that you would see more day-to-day or quarter-to-quarter because they've got growth dynamics at their back. So we're doing things in air ventilators and things for high altitude, or paint dispensing is a great market across all of that region for that specific reason. Now specifically, I would say we -- as a backdrop, I don't think we're seeing things that are different than others have talked about in terms of more moderate growth rates in China. And in a couple of instances, I'll talk to China specifically, we have some headwinds where there's -- and we mentioned this, there's a build for China belief out there around certain markets and things that they are very interested in investing in -- and that provides headwinds for us, but I would say that's where innovation kicks in. What we're able to offer is quite different than the local option. -- just means the sales cycle has extended a little longer, a little harder, but ultimately, we think our differentiation wins there. It's been a great performing region for us. Thanks. Okay. Well, thank you. Again, I'd like to welcome Allison to our team and our session here and thank everybody for your interest and your time today to hear what's going on at IDEX. As we said, it's a really interesting time, a lot of challenges out there. My closing comments would be for those IDEX associates that are on this call. Again, I really want to thank you. I know how hard this is in terms of the day-to-day challenges you have. I know you're doing the right things for the customers, for the business and for your colleagues and frankly, your communities as well. So thanks to everybody. And I wish you all safety and prosperity in the days and weeks ahead."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Michael Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. Thank you, you may begin.\nMichael Yates: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Let me start by saying thank you for joining us for a discussion of the IDEX second quarter 2021 financial highlights. Last night we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for three months ending June 30, 2021. The press release along with the presentation slides we use during today's webcast can be accessed on our company's website at www.idexcorp.com. Joining me today is Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer and Bill Grogan, our Chief Financial Officer. The format for our call today is as follows. We will begin with Eric providing an overview of the state of IDEX's business and update on our growth investments and an overview of our order performance and outlook for our end market. Bill will then discuss our second quarter 2021 financial results and provide an update on our outlook for third quarter and full year 2021. Finally, Eric will conclude with updates on our sustainability and diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your question. If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access to complete replay beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes by dialing the toll-free number 877-660-6853 and entering Conference ID number 13712090. Or you may simply log on to our company's homepage for a webcast replay. Before we begin, a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the Safe Harbor language in last night's press release and in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I'll now turn this call over to our CEO, Eric Ashleman.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you, Mike. Beginning with our overview on Slide 6. The past year and a half have been among the most dynamic and unpredictable ever experienced, but our IDEX team stepped up again in Q2 and delivered during an extremely challenging environment. Thank you to the IDEX employees around the world who are working so hard. Our Commercial performance is very strong as we record and record orders and backlog in the quarter. Order trends continue to improve sequentially in all three segments and materially above pre pandemic level. Our day rates are very strong and our OEM order patterns are robust. Only large industrial projects, many of them in FMT continue to lag a bit. We're beginning to see the move into planning funnels indicating support for continued phases of organic growth in the back half of 2021 and next year. Our number one operating challenge for the quarter was supply chain and logistics disruptions. IDEX is generally a short cycle business with quick lead times. We typically operate at the component level further down our customers' bill of materials. We're also now very vertically integrated. We depend on a tight network of supplier partners, often located close by our operating units to quick turn our solutions with a minimum of visibility. These reasons the challenging conditions of tight material supply and bottleneck logistics tend to lag other industrial companies. Our agile model does support a quick calibration to today's realities and it helps us exit quicker than many on the backside of a supply side constraint. Overall, we believe these disruptions have hit a plateau. We don't see things getting worse and the challenges will continue to be highly variable. At the same time, we don't anticipate these disruptions getting better soon, but most likely they will not subside until the end of this year or early next year. We anticipated rising inflation as the global economy recovered, and like many did not imagine the sharp rate of increase. This narrowed our spread between price capture in material costs, although we remain positive overall. Our team's leverage the systematic investments we made a few years ago in pricing management and aggressively deployed two, sometimes three pricing adjustments with precision. We are on track to expand our price cost spread to typical levels as we travel to the back half of the year. While we spent a lot of time talking about our business's ability to capture price, one area I don't want to miss is our continued focus on operational productivity. Our teams continue to drive margin improvement through 80:20 simplification, lean effort, and through sound CapEx deployment. Our robust project bundles continue to be another weapon to combat rising costs. One project that exactly exemplifies this spirit deserves mention as we discuss Q2. Our energy market, now starting to show some signs of recovery off the bottom are still lagging the overall group. Our teams are aggressively executing a facility rationalization project to consolidate our scale and focus our human resources in close working proximity. Ultimately, this is a long-term value driver for that group. But in the quarter, the project created headwinds for us as equipment was delayed, and inventory positions were less than ideal to support production transports. We expect the project to be back on track and completed by the end of the third quarter. Overall, I am confident in our path through these choppy recovery [ph] seats. We continue to apply relentless focus from outstanding teams to deliver solutions that matter from high quality businesses that are very well positioned within their application steps. Moving on to Slide 7. We deployed just over $575 million in the first half of the year with our acquisitions of ABEL Pumps, Airtech and a small investment in a digitalization technology startup within the Fire and Rescue space. We continue to build out processes and capabilities to explore additional strategic investments we want to make across IDEX. Our funnel for potential acquisitions stronger than it has been in the past. And we're more aggressive in pursuing opportunities that enhance our business solutions fit well with our style of competition and drive IDEX like returns. It's early days in our integration of ABEL and Airtech, but we're happy to see that each business is performing well with excellent growth prospects in the near and long term. While we've stepped up our M&A game, we're also investing in our existing businesses with a 45% increase in capital spending through the first half of the year. We're in the process of expanding IDEX facilities in China and India. We project significant ongoing growth opportunities across Asia. And these investments are critical to support our local-to-global approach as we move to the next level of competitive advantage. We're also focused on our digital strategy with our largest investments tied to our areas of higher integration and scale as we seek to drive higher impact for our customers. Lastly, as I mentioned previously, we're focused on operational productivity as market dynamics are changing, as well as investing in new technology to support growth. This is both the CapEx and OpEx side. Some of these investments are targeted at new applications in high growth areas, like components to enable new global broadband satellite networks, building batteries for electric vehicles, and providing key products to support the build out of incremental capacity in semiconductor manufacturing. These investments are combined with targeted spend in areas to support automation and efficiencies across the shop floor. This strategic approach to both inorganic and organic investment is already paying off and sets us up for ongoing success for years to come. Turning to our commercial results on Slide 8. As I mentioned, order strength continued in the second quarter, both compared to prior year and sequentially resulting in a backlog build of $65 million in the quarter as we look across our segments, all rebounded well from the pandemic and delivered strong organic order growth. Sequentially, Fluid and Metering Technologies and Fire and Safety Diversified Product saw increased orders compared to the first quarter. Our Health and Science Technologies segment also saw increased sequential orders if we exclude the impact of a COVID testing application debugging that occurred in Q2. Order intake across all segments was also above second quarter 2019 levels. FMT lags, HST and FSD, due to lower levels of investment in the oil and gas market, as well as its concentration in the industrial market, which saw a pre COVID pullback in the second half of 2019. These commercial results give us confidence in our ability to deliver double-digit growth in the second half of the year and continue to highlight the resilience of our businesses and the criticality of our solutions to customers. On Slide 9, we provide a deeper look into our primary end market. Our focus is shifting from recovery to growth as most of our businesses are now performing above pre pandemic level, even with pockets of concern around supply chain disruptions and COVID in certain geographies, we're optimistic about the outlook of our markets and our ability to execute within them. In our Fluid and Metering Technologies segment, industrial day rates were strong. Supply chain challenges remained, but overall, the market trajectory was at or above 2019 levels, with only large projects lagging as I mentioned earlier. Agriculture continued to drive strong growth driven by aging farm equipment and record crop prices. Our Water business was stable. We continue to monitor the impact of the Federal Infrastructure Package and U.S. municipal spending, energy and chemical markets continue to trail 2019 levels, primarily due to limited capital investment in the sector, as well as a longer project close cycle. One item to highlight for FMT is the impact of our FMD acquisition last year. It's now in our organic figures and with its backlog burn last year and significant pullback in customer's capital investments, it impacted FMT's organic sales by 11%. In other words, FMT's organic sales for the quarter would have been 19% instead of 8%. Moving to the Health and Science Technologies segment, we're seeing recovery activity growth across all our end markets. [Indiscernible] continue to perform well driven by strong market demand and winning share into our targeted growth initiatives. The overall automotive market continued to face supply chain driven challenges, but we outperform the market due to our product concentration and higher end European vehicles. Our AI and Life Science market continue to perform well as the pandemic impact ease and investments have increased. The industrial business within the segment saw a similar result to FMT. Finally, in our Fire and Safety Diversified Products segment, dispensing rebounded as large retailers freed up capital and work through pent up demand for equipment. Abandoned business was adversely affected by U.S. automotive production pullbacks due to microprocessor shortages in the second quarter. However, we continue to achieve new platform wins and believe we're well positioned to outperform the market as supply chain constraints ease. In Fire and Rescue, we have yet to see larger tenders come back and emerging markets remained slow. We continue to closely monitor market conditions and expect some choppiness in the second half of the year. That said, we're confident in the future trajectory of our end markets as well as our ability to execute on our strong backlog, and have raised our organic growth expectation for the year. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results.\nBill Grogan: Thanks, Eric. I will start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 11. Q2 orders of $751 million were up 44% overall, and 39% organically, as we build $65 million of backlog in the quarter. Organic orders grew sequentially and year-over-year in each of our segments, as highlighted by Eric on the prior slide. Second quarter sales of $686 million were up 22% overall, and 17% organically. While we experienced a strong rebound from the pandemic across our portfolio, we were impacted by supply chain constraints and our energy side consolidation which tempered our results. The FMT pressure in Fluid and Metering Eric discussed also had an impact on overall organic sales. Excluding FMT, organic sales would have been up 22%. Q2 gross margin expanded by 280 basis points to 44.6%. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by increased volume and price capture, partly offset by inflation and supply chain impacts. Excluding the impact of $1.8 million pretax fair value inventory step up charges related to the ABEL acquisition adjusted gross margin was 44.9% and was approximately flat sequentially. Second quarter operating margin was 23.1% up 340 basis points compared to prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 24.4% up 330 basis points compared to prior year, largely driven by gross margin expansion and fixed costs leverage offset by a rebound in discretionary spending and investment. I will discuss the drivers of operating income in more detail on the next slide. Our Q2 effective tax rate was 21.3%, which was lower than the prior year ETR of 22.7% due to benefits from foreign sourced income in the second quarter of 2021. This benefit also drove favorability to our guided rate for the quarter. Q2 adjusted net income was $123 million resulting in adjusted EPS of $1.61 up $0.51 or 46% over prior year adjusted ETR. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $120 million down 25% compared to prior year and was 98% of adjusted net income. This result was impacted by a volume driven working capital build higher CapEx and timing of tax payment partially offset by higher earnings. Our working capital efficiency metrics remain strong and the teams continue to do a good job managing the significant volume changes year-over-year. Moving on to Slide 12, which details the drivers of our adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income increased $49 million for the quarter compared to prior year. Our 17% organic growth contributed approximately $41 million flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. We maintained positive price material cost within the quarter and leveraged well on the volume increase. Our high contribution margins helped mitigate the profit headwinds we experienced from the supply chain disruptions. In the second quarter of 2020, discretionary spending and investment were minimal, driven by a strict cost control environment during the pandemic. As we returned to a spend level in line with our growth and continued strategic investments, we see year-over-year pressure of about $11 million in line with the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. Even with the incremental spend, supply chain and operational issues that tempered our performance, we still achieved a robust 45% organic flow through. Flow throughs then negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX getting us to our reported flow through of 39%. As we highlighted, we expect to reinvest aggressively in the business to drive both organic and inorganic opportunities. We expect that our level of discretionary spending, as well as associated costs from growth initiatives will similarly reduce organic flow through in subsequent quarters. With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the third quarter and full year. Moving on to Slide 13. For the third quarter, we're projecting EPS to range from $1.57 to $1.61. We expect organic revenue growth of 14% to 16% and operating margins of approximately 24.5%. The third quarter effective tax rate is expected to be 23%. And we expect a 1% top line benefit from the impact of FX. And corporate costs in the third quarter are expected to be around $21 million. Turning to the full year. We are increasing our full year EPS guidance from our previous range of $6.05 to $6.20 up to $6.26 to $6.36. This range includes Airtech, which will contribute $0.06 in the second half of 2021, roughly $0.03 a quarter. We are also increasing our full year organic revenue growth from 9% to 10% up to 11% to 12%. We expect operating margins of approximately 24.5%. We expect FX to provide a 2% benefit to top line results. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $65 million, an increase of around $10 million versus our last call as we increase our investments in growth opportunities. Free cash flow is expected to be 110% to 115% of net income lower versus our last guide primarily due to the additional capital spending and higher working capital support our increased volume. And corporate costs are expected to be approximately $77 million for the year. Finally, our earnings guidance excludes any costs, earnings associated with future acquisitions or restructuring charges. With that, I'll throw back to Eric for some final thoughts.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Bill. I'm on the final slide, Slide 14. Before we open the call up to questions, I'd like to share an update on our [ph] ESD journey and the evolution of our company culture. I pledged earlier this year that we would hire a new Chief Diversity Equity and Inclusion Officer. I'm pleased to announce that I now have Troy McIntosh on my senior leadership team. He joined us just last week from U.S. Cellular, the fourth largest cellular communications carrier in the United States, where he led significant improvements in their culture and levels of diversity in the workforce. At IDEX, Troy will help build the global roadmap and success measures for DE&I. He will help embed DE&I deeper in our culture and build inclusive leadership competence and capabilities in all our people through training, education and coaching. He will help us make sure our systems mitigate bias and create opportunities for everyone, no matter their background to reach their full potential at IDEX. I look forward to great things happening with his leadership. I'd also like to share a nice step we're taking to improve our energy efficiency. Work recently began on a solar array on the roof of our LUKAS manufacturing facility in Germany. Once completed next month, this collection of solar panels will be about one-third the size of the European soccer field and provide 30% of the electricity needs for the facility. Not only will it help reduce our carbon footprint there, we estimate it will save the business more than \u20ac67,000 in just the first year alone. We anticipate this project will serve as a pilot leading the way for other solar installations on IDEX facilities around the world. Lastly, I want to share the catastrophic flooding the devastated portions of Western Europe earlier this month has impacted many IDEX employees. About a quarter of the employees that are German Fire and Safety business Vetter have either had their home severely damaged or destroyed. All of our employees are safe living with friends and family as recovery efforts are ongoing and operation continued at our Vetter facility, which is not directly impacted by the flood. Amid all this destruction and loss, once again we saw the spirit of IDEX come through. Colleagues from other IDEX businesses in Germany came to the area to assist with pumping equipment from our businesses. Our people work tirelessly to help draw water from flooded homes to the long road to recovery by then. The IDEX Foundation also gave 100,000 to the German Red Cross, which is thousands of people in the region assisting those impacted. While I shared this internally, I want to again express with our employees at Vetter that we stand by you through this terrible tragedy. And thank you to all the dedicated and selfless IDEX colleagues who dropped everything and volunteered during this time in need. Your outstanding examples what makes this company so special. With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Morning Deane.\nBill Grogan: Hi, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Already, maybe we can start with Eric early comment in the prepared remarks. And I know you touched so many end markets and within the diverse product line. But what are the indicators you're looking at that suggests that the supply chain disruptions have peaked to kind of your degree of confidence? And the reason I'm also asking is like we heard yesterday from GE and 3M. And neither of them sounded as confident that the worst had passed. But you're sounding a bit or noticeably more optimistic, Eric. So maybe we're going to start there thing. Thanks.\nEric Ashleman: Sure, Deane. I guess all of this is somewhat relative at this point. I mean, this - make no mistake, this is really, really tough right now. And so, staying at steady state of tough is what it is. I don't want to mischaracterize it there. For us, a couple of things to remember, we're a little less exposed to a lot of the electronics, microprocessor things that other businesses are. Our building material is generally a little bit more streamlined and simplified. So, we don't have as many aggregations or complex systems, we do a lot of great critical components. And we still, we have a lot of suppliers that are pretty close by that, honestly, we drive by on the way to work. That being said, still very difficult for us. The indicators we're looking at, things like lead time, what are the quarter's lead times and then what is the performance against them and like they have lengthened and extended, but they're generally kind of holding at this point. And the delivery rates against them, while not great are at least in our world, pretty stable at this point. So, I just want to emphasize the relative nature of the comments and say, for us, it's very, very tough environment, but we see it, the one we can now begin to plan around, given what we do.\nDeane Dray: That's real helpful. And if we can stay, like more of a real time analysis here, if we could, commentary about your day rates would be helpful. And the mix still not seeing kind of larger projects yet, but maybe there's some front log discussions that you could share and any commentary about how July has started. Thanks.\nEric Ashleman: Sure. So, if we kind of go back to the end of 2020, we saw - most of the acceleration that we're seeing was in that restoration of industrial day rates in our businesses. And as we look at the second quarter and even into the first days in July, pretty stable at this point. I mean, it's kind of at a healthy clip, we'll see it move on in terms of price and some things that come up and it's not accelerating at the same rate. More is it in our world, decelerating, think of it as stable. And then there's two other components that we think a lot about for a ton of IDEX businesses. And they're in the project category, but they're different degrees in terms of size and scope. So, what we are seeing and what's contributing to growth, and I know will continue into Q3 and Q4, we would call lots of small projects. These are discrete things where people are optimizing the system. Instead of asking for one or two, it's something at 10 to 20. And they're running their factory or their production lines, but they're trying to optimize it, enhance throughput, get productivity, those are the kind of things you can do on the run. And so, we're seeing that those have been strong contributors. And we think they'll continue. Right past it, are the classic larger projects that we and others play with. A lot of them in kind of the chemical, oil and gas, infrastructure spaces. And there's just a general story there are still where those things are delayed. They were frozen in 2020. They were pushed out into 2021, not canceled. I will say what we're starting to hear now, and mainly from distributors that are a little closer to the frontlines are that those are now starting to turn into quote, activity, inspect transfer and the kind of things you start to see ahead of an order and a replenishment cycle on our side. When does that happen? Maybe there's some of it in the back half of the year. Certainly, at a minimum, we start talking about it more in planning, and I think it bodes well for the early part of 2022.\nDeane Dray: Great. That was exactly the color we were looking for. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Halloran: Hey, good morning, everyone. Just an update in how you're thinking about the M&A environment, your pipeline and how you're thinking about actionability of that pipeline today. I know you've got a fair amount of capacity still sitting in front of you. And just curious how actionable you think that is in the short to medium term here?\nBill Grogan: Sure, sure. Well, I mean, I kind of do it upside down, maybe the availability side is really, really good. I mean, we could go through the specific numbers, but we got plenty of availability and firepower to spend. On the inside, we've been talking now for a couple of quarters about the intentionality of the resource bill. And the time and effort we're taking to consider all of the areas where we'd like to do more business, some of it through inorganic efforts, think of this as a series of concentric circles, radiating around places where we participate today and participate. And a few things, we're actually thinking of some zones where we're not part, not currently part of IDEX. That could be interesting to have IDEX like attribute. So, we've got the firepower, we're doing more work, and then the funnel of things that we're looking at is very active, aggressive. And I think in the end, actionable. Now, we still are going to take the same discipline that we've had to any of the things that we're looking at, it's got to meet certain requirements, got to fit into IDEX, got to leverage what we do best. But I'll tell you that we're looking at more things than we have before and probably more areas than we have previously with more people involved and lots of firepower to get the work done.\nMike Halloran: So, on that point there more areas and maybe you previously looked. I'm guessing it's not really a change in the strategy nor maybe just more iterative in broadening, maybe some high level thoughts on what that changes and areas that you might be thinking of loosely?\nBill Grogan: Yeah, I like this analogy, and I used it a second ago. I really think about it is radiating concentric circles. So, there's an anchor position generally in work that we're doing today, whether it's in the fluidic space, some of the stuff in life sciences. But I think we're willing to extend outward a little bit in terms of what's the solution that we will bring to our customer set. And so, that's maybe the area of difference or slight tweaks to the model. We've always, I mean, we've mentioned an open aperture for at least a couple of years now, at least, an open mind to some things that might be very interesting as we long considered for IDEX. I don't know that that's different. That's always been on the page. But these have been the two areas that there's a separate resource base thinking about little further out from what we've done before, but still anchored to how we do it. And a couple of zones that have always been interesting to us, because they have IDEX like attribute.\nMike Halloran: Makes sense. And it's probably a question with Deane, he talked about some of these businesses feeling better about those as they track towards '22. Maybe just high level, how are you thinking broadly about all the puts and takes you're seeing in the portfolio now, and what that means once you hit a more normalized run rate, orders, record levels? You're seeing some normalization margin, or at least with the pressures from a price cost perspective can look like as you move through the year. The timing of some of these later cycle things starts getting a little bit better as you move through this year, maybe late and early next year, you can start seeing a little bit more CapEx. Just how does that all kind of come together when you're thinking about that one-to-two-year outlook from your seat? And what do you think the constraints are on top of that?\nBill Grogan: Yeah, sure. So, I think it's a great question. And I like the way you phrased it. If you start from the highest level and think about the next couple of years, I think you start with a very positive perspective. You recognize that, like we're now coming through a pretty acute recovery cycle that isn't completely played out. Then there's a replenishment cycle that not only I think is reflective of the time that we sort of were all locked away. But I think even ahead of that, there was a decent amount of industrial capacity that needs to be put back into the system. The real question, I think, as we go is, if you think of this as a series of graph lines with very sharp peaks and troughs, and this is super dynamic, in terms of the elements we're dealing with today, is they smooth out and look a little bit more like the Appalachians. I think that that becomes a little bit more of a standard operating environment with positive momentum. And so, many of the dynamics that we're talking about now in terms of when they come back or when they reoccurred, I think they would be in place and they would be things that we'd be typically used for looking at. And it would feel a little bit normalized, in terms of the way that we would operate with favorable winds that are backed in all of the places that we play. So, I think we view it that way, we're planning for it that way. But it's a positive outlook and positive framework, you just sort of have to navigate some of the puts and takes and there's a lot of dynamic variables here, none of which I think really get in the way of that positive outlook.\nEric Ashleman: And I think the economics associated with that growth would very much look like our traditional profile will leverage extremely well some of the facility consolidations that we're executing on this year will be foundational, some of that margin improvement. And then two, just as we've proven here, as we progress through the year, the team's ability to go out and capture incremental price to deal with some of the supply chain issues and rising inflation, there'll be bedrock as we go forward if that inflationary environment continues on for a couple more quarters.\nMike Halloran: Appreciate gentlemen, thank you.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to turn to the incremental. I know, Bill you had mentioned from a corporate perspective that discretionary and reinvestment, we're going to step up a bit here, which makes sense. But are there any notable changes as we kind of think across the segments? I know each segment has its own specific challenges that might be altered sort of in the near term, as we think about the back half?\nBill Grogan: No. I mean outside of FMT, and there's two things I think we highlighted within the quarter one, some of the challenges we had with our facility consolidation and energy, and then just the year-over-year comp for FMT and the pressure that's putting on FMTs margin, last year they were at record backlog levels and at some really large projects so the second and third quarter that'll weigh more on FMT's margins year-over-year. But outside of that, the other two segments should perform pretty consistently with how they've done in the first half of the year.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. And then just want to just confirm again the price cost spreads. You said it was a little bit compressed near term, which makes sense. Do we assume that we exit '21 with I would say what is a more normalized spread for you guys there?\nBill Grogan: Yeah exactly.\nEric Ashleman: Yep.\nAllison Poliniak: Perfect. Thank you.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Allison.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nNathan Jones: Morning everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Hi, Nathan.\nNathan Jones: I want to just follow up on flow MD, obviously had a pretty big impact in the quarter. Can you maybe just give us a little bit more color on recent order trends, recent backlog trends there, when you think that will switch from being a drag to being a tailwind as that business returns to some growth?\nEric Ashleman: Sure, I mean, that's, it's like, it's a tough story for that business. They had - they were burning backlog nicely, sort of right at the point of acquisition. Then, of course, COVID came along and devastated a lot of the core markets there. And it's a little bit more project intensive than the average IDEX business, just by the nature of what they do. These are large units that are going out there and custody transfer in large pipeline projects, and things like that. So, and then if you think of that environment, I mean, there's been a couple of very public shocks in that particular area as well. We're just, right now this spend is very intentional towards some other things, simple maintenance, and those kinds of items. So, I think it's going to be a little while before that breaks. That said, the international markets are a little different than what we're seeing here in North America, they're generally more favorable. That business has been pointed towards those strategically, long before we bought them. And we continue that way. So, we think that that's a nice extension for it. But I think as we saw, even with the events that happened here a little bit recently, it didn't take too many days for things to be offline before our economy felt it. And this business makes them incredibly great and nice pieces of technology that are very useful in that continuum. So, we like it for the long term and what it does. We think the prospects long term are positive in nature. But I think it's going to take a while for the spend here because of the nature of it, and where it's happening to break free.\nNathan Jones: So, on a sequential basis, that we at least kind of hit the bottom or is there still more down here in your opinion?\nEric Ashleman: No, I think the bottom is a fair characterization.\nNathan Jones: Okay. And then I just want to follow up on the digital investment that you made in Fire and Rescue. Any color you can give us around what that is? What the future digital investments look like for IDEX and how you expect that to impact a variety of your businesses?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah, so I mean, like it's really small, but from time to time, I think that's the nature with some of these things will be. I will tell you to the extent, some of the things we've been working on anyway. I'm talking about I think, for a while now, we've talked about some great work that we're doing to automate how that job happened. So, replacing a sea of levers, engages employees with a touchscreen, and we've got some outstanding products that we sell to automate that. Now, this small extension allows you to take some of that data off the truck, essentially, make it more affordable and available to be used in other areas for firefighters. So, I think it's a good example of the kind of things we'll probably see from time to time from IDEX, where there are some jobs that we're doing, and there's a way to enhance it and make it a lot more valuable. And sometimes it actually comes in very small, little transactions like this one. And so, it's an indicator of things to come and levers nice scale that we have in Fire and Rescue and a lot of things we've been working on for a number of years.\nNathan Jones: Is this kind of technology transferable to other parts of the portfolio? Or is this really great kind of thing?\nEric Ashleman: It could be. We select it for that reason. You know, you never say never. There's things here that you can imagine what happened in other places, we'd be careful given the small size of it. And just kind of an 80:20 organization anyway, so focus on the job we need to do at hand. But I wouldn't rule it out entirely.\nNathan Jones: Great, thanks for taking my questions.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Nathan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Graham: Hey, good morning, Eric, Bill, Mike.\nEric Ashleman: Good morning Scott.\nScott Graham: A couple questions maybe around price cost. I know, I've heard all the commentary, would you be able to tell us what price cost actually was in the quarter? What that gap was?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah, I mean, we said our historical price cost spread is somewhere around 20 - or excuse me 30 to 40 basis points. And we compressed a little bit under 20 within the quarter. And again, the pricing actions that we've taken, we look to be back at that normal level here as we progress through the back half of the year.\nScott Graham: Got it, thank you. Now, the other thing I was going to ask you it is certainly around the projects, because some of these things can - or obviously can be very lucrative to you, because they are - the customer chooses you to do something exquisite so, swirl of pricing power in there. I was just wondering, kind of like, do you think that based on what you're seeing out there, some of this quoting activity that you're hearing about through distribution, is this a conversion into the, let's say, the early part of next year? You guys have a lot of experience on this stuff. So, when can this sort of funky cycle that we're in, - when would you normally start to see that? Is that early next year, you'll potential?\nEric Ashleman: I mean, it's like it varies to some degree, but I would say the median of that distribution was, if you're talking about it now as a distributor level, there's things that we would have to do to be involved in terms of specifications and then their standard lead times. We're usually not the longest one anyways. It's easy other parts that would go into a project. So, if I just say, where's the medium zone, it's probably the beginning of 2022, where a lot of it would actually be put in place, things of that nature. So yeah, but some could be sooner. Some could be later. It again, depends. This is a wide spectrum, given the nature of IDEX, but probably the sweet spot would say, you talk about it now through the back half. You plan it, maybe get it booked. And you'll see some of it run out into the beginning part of next year.\nScott Graham: Got it. Got it. And last question same for you, Eric. So, you talked to around why the organic was maybe a little bit below the guide. Is essentially, what you're saying here is that those delays move from 2Q to 3Q, which is maybe why 3Q is sort of like an outsized organic?\nEric Ashleman: Well, I mean, it's like anything that was constrained on our side of courses, people still want it, it's going to move into the next place looking forward. What we're ultimately thinking about, not just us, but everybody is how you go to that next level of output and throughput and capacity? And of course, as you know, we're kind of low on the food chain in a lot of places, so it's only as good as everybody being able to make a move up at this point. So, I think right now, where we are, as a lot of things just kind of stabilize around this reality. Everybody's working on it, us included. We're coming up in the fall, maybe labor availability for people that are more labor intensive, that gets better. I think that's the kind of ramp that you would start to see. It's less a complex math problem and more just ultimately, people working like crazy to figure out a way to get to a place where you can process more of a backlog that many of us have.\nScott Graham: Understood. And I promise this is my last question. This is the time of the year where your predecessor started to talk about a sort of a construct around 2022 sales. That was kind of what my earlier question was starting to get to. Anything you could offer on 2022 at this point, Eric?\nEric Ashleman: I would not want to do that. Maybe this would normally be the time. But I mean, there's a lot of variables still out there, including one we haven't talked about yet here today, which was the nature of our virus go and things of that sort. So, I just, it would be too speculative and wouldn't really, I think, imply a lot. I think what we generally feel, as I said before, that we think that the strong ones that are back are going to continue. We know that we and others are working to elevate capacity and throughput, which is going to be beneficial to all of us. And there's just a function out there that eventually variables have a tendency to move over time, and they become expectation. And we see all of those things leading up for more positive data.\nScott Graham: Thanks a lot.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line up Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Summerville: Thanks. A couple questions. The pricing has come up a couple times here in the Q&A and I was just wondering, Bill, if you could provide an absolute term what your price realization was through the first six months of the year? And how much incremental price capture you're looking forward to get back into that 30:40 basis point spread you typically aim to be in?\nBill Grogan: No, I mean, yeah, we were opposed to a little over points in the first half, we're going to accelerate from that in the back half would be kind of the framework I gave you.\nMatt Summerville: And then, given your answer to an earlier question Eric, a steady state of tough or bad or whatever sort of word you use I'm talking about supply chain. Is that resulting I would imagine in similar anxiety among your customer base with you being a supplier to them? In that sense, do you get the sense that they're pulling forward demand, they're over ordering? Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of sell in and sell through into your distribution channel splits?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah, so I would say like, we've had this question now for a couple of quarters, and generally, as you know we do a lot of customized products, a lot of things that are very, very hyper specific, don't have a lot of like just, high volume stocking orders and things like are part. So, we're not a great company to stock a lot of material. That being said, I probably would point to you, this quarter is a higher number of that. We're just because of I mean, our only times are expanding, and that's an unusual occurrence. We're aggressively doing some things on price, us and everybody else. So, there's I don't think it's a giant number for this, it's just kind of campaign. But it's in there more than we've seen before in terms of people trying to get a place in line or potentially say, hey, can I - I'll take a risk here. So, I can avoid part of the price increase, but it's going to since this is a pointer to the company, it's not a giant part only applies into. Distribution, or you go to a lot of our distributors, you're not going to see a lot of products on the shelf, mainly because of just the model, it's often needs to be customized at the last minute is done in this regard. We have quickly times anyway, that doesn't add a lot of value to sit on a shelf somewhere and make that gap. So, I guess long story short. We have probably a higher incidence of this than we typically do, but because of the nature of IDEX facility, really, really low number for us.\nMatt Summerville: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Wertheimer: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Hi Rob.\nRob Wertheimer: I was listening the comments you made in the prepared remarks on CapEx, spending opportunities, advanced manufacturing, and I wondered if you could expand on really in whatever direction you like. But I was curious about ROI versus inorganic investment right now, maybe specific margin improvement on projects that you're doing related to that. Maybe how far down the road you are going for a long time, or if there's a real shift here, and what it could mean for margin central over time, just love to hear more about it.\nEric Ashleman: Alright, so like, we don't have a lot of CapEx intensity at IDEX anyway, but it is a ramp up from where we've typically been. A lot of it is attributed to the story around emerging markets grew up. So we're taking very deliberate actions in both our areas of concentration in China and India to make long term infrastructure depth over there to support a really, really, really good local for local capabilities that that we have. So, there's the big driver there that of course doesn't reoccur all that often. Outside of that, it's a next level down in the category of doing it more than we used to, would be things like factory floor automation. The technology is available, is pretty phenomenal today, and the cost points have come down to the point where even in our world, it makes sense from time to time to put a robot where somebody was standing for. Particularly, when we've got some labor availability issues, and a lot of its high technology base. So, those are projects that I think there's a graphic on the slide deck that I used, it's something that we're actually using in that area. That's, it's a great lever of operational productivity. It doesn't necessarily inflect the curve too tremendously. But it really helps us from a business perspective, concentrate our efforts on very talented people, and putting them in the areas where we're growing the company, and drawing from within as opposed to having to go out on the outside. So, anything\u2026\nBill Grogan: And I would say that the returns on those investments are highest return investments we can make. I mean, generally 2X or 3X what we do on the inorganic side, because the return profile, the market impact, these are kind of 12, 18 months return profiles for things on both the productivity and the growth side.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Giordano with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning, guys. This is Francesco on for Joe. Could you talk a little bit about just give us some detail on what you're seeing on municipal budgets and any sort of expectations there around the infrastructure bill as well?\nEric Ashleman: Sure. Well, I mean, there's always an interesting dynamic there. I mean, I would say, number one, the financial positions of most municipalities, certainly here in the United States are probably thought to be better than they were, let's say a year ago. There's a lot of the stimulus money and things like that comes in and tax receipts generally been higher. So, I think just overall financial condition is good. Requested on the infrastructure spend thing is interesting. I mean, there's always a question of how long did you go from a concept to an actual project-based reality and how long that takes? Ultimately, there's different parts of IDEX where that would actually help us in a good way. I'd point to our Water business is one of them. There's a lot of talk in that bill about water infrastructure and the criticality there. I mean, one of our businesses does an awful lot of great work on sort of flow monitoring studies, which ultimately support CapEx projects, like you have to do one to then determine what it is you're going to buy in terms of CapEx. So, I think we're well positioned there. And there's some other pockets as well. But like always, it probably will take longer to play out and run through the system than we might imagine. But I would put it in the category just like in, they're seeing I think, for receipts in economics that is positive and certainly in a position that's better than I might have imagined it would be as we went into a pandemic.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks, that's very helpful. And if you could maybe talk a little bit about your expectations for Fire and Rescue. I know you guys have it down for the market outlook, but maybe a little bit more longer term, what drives the recovery there?\nEric Ashleman: Sure, I mean, our Fire and Rescue business is I mean, they're phenomenal businesses. We've added to them over the years, we've got a nice, scalable concentration, and it's one of our most geographically dispersed businesses. You start with the premise that we've got incredible assets in that space. We've always said it was kind of a mature steady market for us as a backdrop overall. A couple of things going on there that at least in the near term, probably put it into the to the red zone most for us. One is that industry is even before the pandemic was struggling with output execution around chassis and trucks and things, and a couple of different geographies. Obviously, what's going on now is making that better. And so, just backlogs on fire trucks continues to be as long as it was a year ago, if not longer. So yeah, a little bit of a moderation effect there. And then in the emerging markets side, specifically China. And we've definitely seen - we've seen a couple of ways now of push for localization versus in our case, we actually do a fair amount of imported products into that zone to complement our local brand there as well. And I don't think long term that hasn't necessarily impacted us, but it doesn't impact it from a timing perspective, tends to keep tenders captive until we sort of see how it runs out. And so, that's maybe the new element on top of the existing element in it, and basically, it's pretty steady market anyways. I always encourage people when they think about it, this is where like, what we're doing in terms of our application sets on a critical job matters. So, like the discussion we had earlier about automation and the things that we're doing to change the nature of the job is the exciting element with great well positioned global assets. On a, you can still think of it as a mission critical job, very steady state, generally is going to be something that supported them long term with funding and things. But it does go through certain ebbs and flows. And right now, it's on one of the more red not green zones. But we think long term is going to be fine.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks a lot.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nBryan Blair: Nice. Good morning, everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Hi Bryan.\nBryan Blair: I wanted to quickly follow up on Nathan's question regarding your digital investment in Fire and Rescue. Any color you can provide on how we should think about that technology an extension of Sam capabilities?\nEric Ashleman: Well, I think without spending too much time on lots of details here, you can think of it what the SAM unit and for the others on a call, this is essentially the brand name of the trade name for the automation that we do within a mobile application. You know that, that brings together a lot of important data points, some of which are related to our hardware, some are related to others that are in that mobile platform. And you can think of it in the simplest way as this technology allows us to come off the truck, it's a way to make that happen to make it more mobile and less truck based.\nBryan Blair: Okay, sounds like a very natural extension. And you offered, understandably nuance answer with regard to actionability of the M&A pipeline. In simple terms, can you share the size of this funnel relative to pre pandemic levels?\nEric Ashleman: Certainly, in terms of ours, if we just listed up the things that are on there and added up potential transaction prices, it's larger. It's larger, I think, largely because of the work that we're putting in as we consider things and where we could go and how we could resource if the people internal in the company and consider the firepower that we had to deploy? So, yeah, I think it's safe to say there's a larger funnel by potential transaction size.\nBryan Blair: Appreciate the color. Thanks, again.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you, Bryan.\nOperator: There are no other questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.\nEric Ashleman: Okay, well, I'd like to thank you all for joining and spending some time with us here today. As we said in the prepared remarks in the beginning, I mean, really, really dynamic time with a lot of variables kind of swirling around. What we talked about in our businesses, we get all of that, and we deal with that on a day-to-day basis. But at the end, we ask people to take a deep breath, kind of come back and recognize that when a world kind of goes through, it's going through. It has a lot of problems that need to be solved and the IDEX Technologies that we have and the people that we have that drive them, they made up well with these kinds of demands. So, we've got well positioned businesses. We got incredible teams and talent. We're really, really focused, we're now to a phase of 80:20, where it's very, very intuitive. And we're putting that to work and what's no doubt the dynamic and variable environment. At the end, I think the trade winds here are very favorable. We believe very strongly in our near term and our medium term and ultimately, the long term prospects of the company. But recognize we kind of have to live moment to moment as we're going through this with an eye on the horizon. And I assure you, that's the one that we're thinking about the most. Thanks again for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Grogan",
            "content": "Thanks, Eric. I will start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 11. Q2 orders of $751 million were up 44% overall, and 39% organically, as we build $65 million of backlog in the quarter. Organic orders grew sequentially and year-over-year in each of our segments, as highlighted by Eric on the prior slide. Second quarter sales of $686 million were up 22% overall, and 17% organically. While we experienced a strong rebound from the pandemic across our portfolio, we were impacted by supply chain constraints and our energy side consolidation which tempered our results. The FMT pressure in Fluid and Metering Eric discussed also had an impact on overall organic sales. Excluding FMT, organic sales would have been up 22%. Q2 gross margin expanded by 280 basis points to 44.6%. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by increased volume and price capture, partly offset by inflation and supply chain impacts. Excluding the impact of $1.8 million pretax fair value inventory step up charges related to the ABEL acquisition adjusted gross margin was 44.9% and was approximately flat sequentially. Second quarter operating margin was 23.1% up 340 basis points compared to prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 24.4% up 330 basis points compared to prior year, largely driven by gross margin expansion and fixed costs leverage offset by a rebound in discretionary spending and investment. I will discuss the drivers of operating income in more detail on the next slide. Our Q2 effective tax rate was 21.3%, which was lower than the prior year ETR of 22.7% due to benefits from foreign sourced income in the second quarter of 2021. This benefit also drove favorability to our guided rate for the quarter. Q2 adjusted net income was $123 million resulting in adjusted EPS of $1.61 up $0.51 or 46% over prior year adjusted ETR. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $120 million down 25% compared to prior year and was 98% of adjusted net income. This result was impacted by a volume driven working capital build higher CapEx and timing of tax payment partially offset by higher earnings. Our working capital efficiency metrics remain strong and the teams continue to do a good job managing the significant volume changes year-over-year. Moving on to Slide 12, which details the drivers of our adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income increased $49 million for the quarter compared to prior year. Our 17% organic growth contributed approximately $41 million flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. We maintained positive price material cost within the quarter and leveraged well on the volume increase. Our high contribution margins helped mitigate the profit headwinds we experienced from the supply chain disruptions. In the second quarter of 2020, discretionary spending and investment were minimal, driven by a strict cost control environment during the pandemic. As we returned to a spend level in line with our growth and continued strategic investments, we see year-over-year pressure of about $11 million in line with the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. Even with the incremental spend, supply chain and operational issues that tempered our performance, we still achieved a robust 45% organic flow through. Flow throughs then negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX getting us to our reported flow through of 39%. As we highlighted, we expect to reinvest aggressively in the business to drive both organic and inorganic opportunities. We expect that our level of discretionary spending, as well as associated costs from growth initiatives will similarly reduce organic flow through in subsequent quarters. With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the third quarter and full year. Moving on to Slide 13. For the third quarter, we're projecting EPS to range from $1.57 to $1.61. We expect organic revenue growth of 14% to 16% and operating margins of approximately 24.5%. The third quarter effective tax rate is expected to be 23%. And we expect a 1% top line benefit from the impact of FX. And corporate costs in the third quarter are expected to be around $21 million. Turning to the full year. We are increasing our full year EPS guidance from our previous range of $6.05 to $6.20 up to $6.26 to $6.36. This range includes Airtech, which will contribute $0.06 in the second half of 2021, roughly $0.03 a quarter. We are also increasing our full year organic revenue growth from 9% to 10% up to 11% to 12%. We expect operating margins of approximately 24.5%. We expect FX to provide a 2% benefit to top line results. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $65 million, an increase of around $10 million versus our last call as we increase our investments in growth opportunities. Free cash flow is expected to be 110% to 115% of net income lower versus our last guide primarily due to the additional capital spending and higher working capital support our increased volume. And corporate costs are expected to be approximately $77 million for the year. Finally, our earnings guidance excludes any costs, earnings associated with future acquisitions or restructuring charges. With that, I'll throw back to Eric for some final thoughts. Hi, Deane. Sure, sure. Well, I mean, I kind of do it upside down, maybe the availability side is really, really good. I mean, we could go through the specific numbers, but we got plenty of availability and firepower to spend. On the inside, we've been talking now for a couple of quarters about the intentionality of the resource bill. And the time and effort we're taking to consider all of the areas where we'd like to do more business, some of it through inorganic efforts, think of this as a series of concentric circles, radiating around places where we participate today and participate. And a few things, we're actually thinking of some zones where we're not part, not currently part of IDEX. That could be interesting to have IDEX like attribute. So, we've got the firepower, we're doing more work, and then the funnel of things that we're looking at is very active, aggressive. And I think in the end, actionable. Now, we still are going to take the same discipline that we've had to any of the things that we're looking at, it's got to meet certain requirements, got to fit into IDEX, got to leverage what we do best. But I'll tell you that we're looking at more things than we have before and probably more areas than we have previously with more people involved and lots of firepower to get the work done. Yeah, I like this analogy, and I used it a second ago. I really think about it is radiating concentric circles. So, there's an anchor position generally in work that we're doing today, whether it's in the fluidic space, some of the stuff in life sciences. But I think we're willing to extend outward a little bit in terms of what's the solution that we will bring to our customer set. And so, that's maybe the area of difference or slight tweaks to the model. We've always, I mean, we've mentioned an open aperture for at least a couple of years now, at least, an open mind to some things that might be very interesting as we long considered for IDEX. I don't know that that's different. That's always been on the page. But these have been the two areas that there's a separate resource base thinking about little further out from what we've done before, but still anchored to how we do it. And a couple of zones that have always been interesting to us, because they have IDEX like attribute. Yeah, sure. So, I think it's a great question. And I like the way you phrased it. If you start from the highest level and think about the next couple of years, I think you start with a very positive perspective. You recognize that, like we're now coming through a pretty acute recovery cycle that isn't completely played out. Then there's a replenishment cycle that not only I think is reflective of the time that we sort of were all locked away. But I think even ahead of that, there was a decent amount of industrial capacity that needs to be put back into the system. The real question, I think, as we go is, if you think of this as a series of graph lines with very sharp peaks and troughs, and this is super dynamic, in terms of the elements we're dealing with today, is they smooth out and look a little bit more like the Appalachians. I think that that becomes a little bit more of a standard operating environment with positive momentum. And so, many of the dynamics that we're talking about now in terms of when they come back or when they reoccurred, I think they would be in place and they would be things that we'd be typically used for looking at. And it would feel a little bit normalized, in terms of the way that we would operate with favorable winds that are backed in all of the places that we play. So, I think we view it that way, we're planning for it that way. But it's a positive outlook and positive framework, you just sort of have to navigate some of the puts and takes and there's a lot of dynamic variables here, none of which I think really get in the way of that positive outlook. No. I mean outside of FMT, and there's two things I think we highlighted within the quarter one, some of the challenges we had with our facility consolidation and energy, and then just the year-over-year comp for FMT and the pressure that's putting on FMTs margin, last year they were at record backlog levels and at some really large projects so the second and third quarter that'll weigh more on FMT's margins year-over-year. But outside of that, the other two segments should perform pretty consistently with how they've done in the first half of the year. Yeah exactly. No, I mean, yeah, we were opposed to a little over points in the first half, we're going to accelerate from that in the back half would be kind of the framework I gave you. And I would say that the returns on those investments are highest return investments we can make. I mean, generally 2X or 3X what we do on the inorganic side, because the return profile, the market impact, these are kind of 12, 18 months return profiles for things on both the productivity and the growth side."

            "name": "Eric Ashleman",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Beginning with our overview on Slide 6. The past year and a half have been among the most dynamic and unpredictable ever experienced, but our IDEX team stepped up again in Q2 and delivered during an extremely challenging environment. Thank you to the IDEX employees around the world who are working so hard. Our Commercial performance is very strong as we record and record orders and backlog in the quarter. Order trends continue to improve sequentially in all three segments and materially above pre pandemic level. Our day rates are very strong and our OEM order patterns are robust. Only large industrial projects, many of them in FMT continue to lag a bit. We're beginning to see the move into planning funnels indicating support for continued phases of organic growth in the back half of 2021 and next year. Our number one operating challenge for the quarter was supply chain and logistics disruptions. IDEX is generally a short cycle business with quick lead times. We typically operate at the component level further down our customers' bill of materials. We're also now very vertically integrated. We depend on a tight network of supplier partners, often located close by our operating units to quick turn our solutions with a minimum of visibility. These reasons the challenging conditions of tight material supply and bottleneck logistics tend to lag other industrial companies. Our agile model does support a quick calibration to today's realities and it helps us exit quicker than many on the backside of a supply side constraint. Overall, we believe these disruptions have hit a plateau. We don't see things getting worse and the challenges will continue to be highly variable. At the same time, we don't anticipate these disruptions getting better soon, but most likely they will not subside until the end of this year or early next year. We anticipated rising inflation as the global economy recovered, and like many did not imagine the sharp rate of increase. This narrowed our spread between price capture in material costs, although we remain positive overall. Our team's leverage the systematic investments we made a few years ago in pricing management and aggressively deployed two, sometimes three pricing adjustments with precision. We are on track to expand our price cost spread to typical levels as we travel to the back half of the year. While we spent a lot of time talking about our business's ability to capture price, one area I don't want to miss is our continued focus on operational productivity. Our teams continue to drive margin improvement through 80:20 simplification, lean effort, and through sound CapEx deployment. Our robust project bundles continue to be another weapon to combat rising costs. One project that exactly exemplifies this spirit deserves mention as we discuss Q2. Our energy market, now starting to show some signs of recovery off the bottom are still lagging the overall group. Our teams are aggressively executing a facility rationalization project to consolidate our scale and focus our human resources in close working proximity. Ultimately, this is a long-term value driver for that group. But in the quarter, the project created headwinds for us as equipment was delayed, and inventory positions were less than ideal to support production transports. We expect the project to be back on track and completed by the end of the third quarter. Overall, I am confident in our path through these choppy recovery [ph] seats. We continue to apply relentless focus from outstanding teams to deliver solutions that matter from high quality businesses that are very well positioned within their application steps. Moving on to Slide 7. We deployed just over $575 million in the first half of the year with our acquisitions of ABEL Pumps, Airtech and a small investment in a digitalization technology startup within the Fire and Rescue space. We continue to build out processes and capabilities to explore additional strategic investments we want to make across IDEX. Our funnel for potential acquisitions stronger than it has been in the past. And we're more aggressive in pursuing opportunities that enhance our business solutions fit well with our style of competition and drive IDEX like returns. It's early days in our integration of ABEL and Airtech, but we're happy to see that each business is performing well with excellent growth prospects in the near and long term. While we've stepped up our M&A game, we're also investing in our existing businesses with a 45% increase in capital spending through the first half of the year. We're in the process of expanding IDEX facilities in China and India. We project significant ongoing growth opportunities across Asia. And these investments are critical to support our local-to-global approach as we move to the next level of competitive advantage. We're also focused on our digital strategy with our largest investments tied to our areas of higher integration and scale as we seek to drive higher impact for our customers. Lastly, as I mentioned previously, we're focused on operational productivity as market dynamics are changing, as well as investing in new technology to support growth. This is both the CapEx and OpEx side. Some of these investments are targeted at new applications in high growth areas, like components to enable new global broadband satellite networks, building batteries for electric vehicles, and providing key products to support the build out of incremental capacity in semiconductor manufacturing. These investments are combined with targeted spend in areas to support automation and efficiencies across the shop floor. This strategic approach to both inorganic and organic investment is already paying off and sets us up for ongoing success for years to come. Turning to our commercial results on Slide 8. As I mentioned, order strength continued in the second quarter, both compared to prior year and sequentially resulting in a backlog build of $65 million in the quarter as we look across our segments, all rebounded well from the pandemic and delivered strong organic order growth. Sequentially, Fluid and Metering Technologies and Fire and Safety Diversified Product saw increased orders compared to the first quarter. Our Health and Science Technologies segment also saw increased sequential orders if we exclude the impact of a COVID testing application debugging that occurred in Q2. Order intake across all segments was also above second quarter 2019 levels. FMT lags, HST and FSD, due to lower levels of investment in the oil and gas market, as well as its concentration in the industrial market, which saw a pre COVID pullback in the second half of 2019. These commercial results give us confidence in our ability to deliver double-digit growth in the second half of the year and continue to highlight the resilience of our businesses and the criticality of our solutions to customers. On Slide 9, we provide a deeper look into our primary end market. Our focus is shifting from recovery to growth as most of our businesses are now performing above pre pandemic level, even with pockets of concern around supply chain disruptions and COVID in certain geographies, we're optimistic about the outlook of our markets and our ability to execute within them. In our Fluid and Metering Technologies segment, industrial day rates were strong. Supply chain challenges remained, but overall, the market trajectory was at or above 2019 levels, with only large projects lagging as I mentioned earlier. Agriculture continued to drive strong growth driven by aging farm equipment and record crop prices. Our Water business was stable. We continue to monitor the impact of the Federal Infrastructure Package and U.S. municipal spending, energy and chemical markets continue to trail 2019 levels, primarily due to limited capital investment in the sector, as well as a longer project close cycle. One item to highlight for FMT is the impact of our FMD acquisition last year. It's now in our organic figures and with its backlog burn last year and significant pullback in customer's capital investments, it impacted FMT's organic sales by 11%. In other words, FMT's organic sales for the quarter would have been 19% instead of 8%. Moving to the Health and Science Technologies segment, we're seeing recovery activity growth across all our end markets. [Indiscernible] continue to perform well driven by strong market demand and winning share into our targeted growth initiatives. The overall automotive market continued to face supply chain driven challenges, but we outperform the market due to our product concentration and higher end European vehicles. Our AI and Life Science market continue to perform well as the pandemic impact ease and investments have increased. The industrial business within the segment saw a similar result to FMT. Finally, in our Fire and Safety Diversified Products segment, dispensing rebounded as large retailers freed up capital and work through pent up demand for equipment. Abandoned business was adversely affected by U.S. automotive production pullbacks due to microprocessor shortages in the second quarter. However, we continue to achieve new platform wins and believe we're well positioned to outperform the market as supply chain constraints ease. In Fire and Rescue, we have yet to see larger tenders come back and emerging markets remained slow. We continue to closely monitor market conditions and expect some choppiness in the second half of the year. That said, we're confident in the future trajectory of our end markets as well as our ability to execute on our strong backlog, and have raised our organic growth expectation for the year. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results. Thanks, Bill. I'm on the final slide, Slide 14. Before we open the call up to questions, I'd like to share an update on our [ph] ESD journey and the evolution of our company culture. I pledged earlier this year that we would hire a new Chief Diversity Equity and Inclusion Officer. I'm pleased to announce that I now have Troy McIntosh on my senior leadership team. He joined us just last week from U.S. Cellular, the fourth largest cellular communications carrier in the United States, where he led significant improvements in their culture and levels of diversity in the workforce. At IDEX, Troy will help build the global roadmap and success measures for DE&I. He will help embed DE&I deeper in our culture and build inclusive leadership competence and capabilities in all our people through training, education and coaching. He will help us make sure our systems mitigate bias and create opportunities for everyone, no matter their background to reach their full potential at IDEX. I look forward to great things happening with his leadership. I'd also like to share a nice step we're taking to improve our energy efficiency. Work recently began on a solar array on the roof of our LUKAS manufacturing facility in Germany. Once completed next month, this collection of solar panels will be about one-third the size of the European soccer field and provide 30% of the electricity needs for the facility. Not only will it help reduce our carbon footprint there, we estimate it will save the business more than \u20ac67,000 in just the first year alone. We anticipate this project will serve as a pilot leading the way for other solar installations on IDEX facilities around the world. Lastly, I want to share the catastrophic flooding the devastated portions of Western Europe earlier this month has impacted many IDEX employees. About a quarter of the employees that are German Fire and Safety business Vetter have either had their home severely damaged or destroyed. All of our employees are safe living with friends and family as recovery efforts are ongoing and operation continued at our Vetter facility, which is not directly impacted by the flood. Amid all this destruction and loss, once again we saw the spirit of IDEX come through. Colleagues from other IDEX businesses in Germany came to the area to assist with pumping equipment from our businesses. Our people work tirelessly to help draw water from flooded homes to the long road to recovery by then. The IDEX Foundation also gave 100,000 to the German Red Cross, which is thousands of people in the region assisting those impacted. While I shared this internally, I want to again express with our employees at Vetter that we stand by you through this terrible tragedy. And thank you to all the dedicated and selfless IDEX colleagues who dropped everything and volunteered during this time in need. Your outstanding examples what makes this company so special. With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions. Morning Deane. Sure, Deane. I guess all of this is somewhat relative at this point. I mean, this - make no mistake, this is really, really tough right now. And so, staying at steady state of tough is what it is. I don't want to mischaracterize it there. For us, a couple of things to remember, we're a little less exposed to a lot of the electronics, microprocessor things that other businesses are. Our building material is generally a little bit more streamlined and simplified. So, we don't have as many aggregations or complex systems, we do a lot of great critical components. And we still, we have a lot of suppliers that are pretty close by that, honestly, we drive by on the way to work. That being said, still very difficult for us. The indicators we're looking at, things like lead time, what are the quarter's lead times and then what is the performance against them and like they have lengthened and extended, but they're generally kind of holding at this point. And the delivery rates against them, while not great are at least in our world, pretty stable at this point. So, I just want to emphasize the relative nature of the comments and say, for us, it's very, very tough environment, but we see it, the one we can now begin to plan around, given what we do. Sure. So, if we kind of go back to the end of 2020, we saw - most of the acceleration that we're seeing was in that restoration of industrial day rates in our businesses. And as we look at the second quarter and even into the first days in July, pretty stable at this point. I mean, it's kind of at a healthy clip, we'll see it move on in terms of price and some things that come up and it's not accelerating at the same rate. More is it in our world, decelerating, think of it as stable. And then there's two other components that we think a lot about for a ton of IDEX businesses. And they're in the project category, but they're different degrees in terms of size and scope. So, what we are seeing and what's contributing to growth, and I know will continue into Q3 and Q4, we would call lots of small projects. These are discrete things where people are optimizing the system. Instead of asking for one or two, it's something at 10 to 20. And they're running their factory or their production lines, but they're trying to optimize it, enhance throughput, get productivity, those are the kind of things you can do on the run. And so, we're seeing that those have been strong contributors. And we think they'll continue. Right past it, are the classic larger projects that we and others play with. A lot of them in kind of the chemical, oil and gas, infrastructure spaces. And there's just a general story there are still where those things are delayed. They were frozen in 2020. They were pushed out into 2021, not canceled. I will say what we're starting to hear now, and mainly from distributors that are a little closer to the frontlines are that those are now starting to turn into quote, activity, inspect transfer and the kind of things you start to see ahead of an order and a replenishment cycle on our side. When does that happen? Maybe there's some of it in the back half of the year. Certainly, at a minimum, we start talking about it more in planning, and I think it bodes well for the early part of 2022. And I think the economics associated with that growth would very much look like our traditional profile will leverage extremely well some of the facility consolidations that we're executing on this year will be foundational, some of that margin improvement. And then two, just as we've proven here, as we progress through the year, the team's ability to go out and capture incremental price to deal with some of the supply chain issues and rising inflation, there'll be bedrock as we go forward if that inflationary environment continues on for a couple more quarters. Thanks, Mike. Yep. Thanks, Allison. Hi, Nathan. Sure, I mean, that's, it's like, it's a tough story for that business. They had - they were burning backlog nicely, sort of right at the point of acquisition. Then, of course, COVID came along and devastated a lot of the core markets there. And it's a little bit more project intensive than the average IDEX business, just by the nature of what they do. These are large units that are going out there and custody transfer in large pipeline projects, and things like that. So, and then if you think of that environment, I mean, there's been a couple of very public shocks in that particular area as well. We're just, right now this spend is very intentional towards some other things, simple maintenance, and those kinds of items. So, I think it's going to be a little while before that breaks. That said, the international markets are a little different than what we're seeing here in North America, they're generally more favorable. That business has been pointed towards those strategically, long before we bought them. And we continue that way. So, we think that that's a nice extension for it. But I think as we saw, even with the events that happened here a little bit recently, it didn't take too many days for things to be offline before our economy felt it. And this business makes them incredibly great and nice pieces of technology that are very useful in that continuum. So, we like it for the long term and what it does. We think the prospects long term are positive in nature. But I think it's going to take a while for the spend here because of the nature of it, and where it's happening to break free. No, I think the bottom is a fair characterization. Yeah, so I mean, like it's really small, but from time to time, I think that's the nature with some of these things will be. I will tell you to the extent, some of the things we've been working on anyway. I'm talking about I think, for a while now, we've talked about some great work that we're doing to automate how that job happened. So, replacing a sea of levers, engages employees with a touchscreen, and we've got some outstanding products that we sell to automate that. Now, this small extension allows you to take some of that data off the truck, essentially, make it more affordable and available to be used in other areas for firefighters. So, I think it's a good example of the kind of things we'll probably see from time to time from IDEX, where there are some jobs that we're doing, and there's a way to enhance it and make it a lot more valuable. And sometimes it actually comes in very small, little transactions like this one. And so, it's an indicator of things to come and levers nice scale that we have in Fire and Rescue and a lot of things we've been working on for a number of years. It could be. We select it for that reason. You know, you never say never. There's things here that you can imagine what happened in other places, we'd be careful given the small size of it. And just kind of an 80:20 organization anyway, so focus on the job we need to do at hand. But I wouldn't rule it out entirely. Thanks, Nathan. Good morning Scott. Yeah, I mean, we said our historical price cost spread is somewhere around 20 - or excuse me 30 to 40 basis points. And we compressed a little bit under 20 within the quarter. And again, the pricing actions that we've taken, we look to be back at that normal level here as we progress through the back half of the year. I mean, it's like it varies to some degree, but I would say the median of that distribution was, if you're talking about it now as a distributor level, there's things that we would have to do to be involved in terms of specifications and then their standard lead times. We're usually not the longest one anyways. It's easy other parts that would go into a project. So, if I just say, where's the medium zone, it's probably the beginning of 2022, where a lot of it would actually be put in place, things of that nature. So yeah, but some could be sooner. Some could be later. It again, depends. This is a wide spectrum, given the nature of IDEX, but probably the sweet spot would say, you talk about it now through the back half. You plan it, maybe get it booked. And you'll see some of it run out into the beginning part of next year. Well, I mean, it's like anything that was constrained on our side of courses, people still want it, it's going to move into the next place looking forward. What we're ultimately thinking about, not just us, but everybody is how you go to that next level of output and throughput and capacity? And of course, as you know, we're kind of low on the food chain in a lot of places, so it's only as good as everybody being able to make a move up at this point. So, I think right now, where we are, as a lot of things just kind of stabilize around this reality. Everybody's working on it, us included. We're coming up in the fall, maybe labor availability for people that are more labor intensive, that gets better. I think that's the kind of ramp that you would start to see. It's less a complex math problem and more just ultimately, people working like crazy to figure out a way to get to a place where you can process more of a backlog that many of us have. I would not want to do that. Maybe this would normally be the time. But I mean, there's a lot of variables still out there, including one we haven't talked about yet here today, which was the nature of our virus go and things of that sort. So, I just, it would be too speculative and wouldn't really, I think, imply a lot. I think what we generally feel, as I said before, that we think that the strong ones that are back are going to continue. We know that we and others are working to elevate capacity and throughput, which is going to be beneficial to all of us. And there's just a function out there that eventually variables have a tendency to move over time, and they become expectation. And we see all of those things leading up for more positive data. Thanks, Scott. Yeah, so I would say like, we've had this question now for a couple of quarters, and generally, as you know we do a lot of customized products, a lot of things that are very, very hyper specific, don't have a lot of like just, high volume stocking orders and things like are part. So, we're not a great company to stock a lot of material. That being said, I probably would point to you, this quarter is a higher number of that. We're just because of I mean, our only times are expanding, and that's an unusual occurrence. We're aggressively doing some things on price, us and everybody else. So, there's I don't think it's a giant number for this, it's just kind of campaign. But it's in there more than we've seen before in terms of people trying to get a place in line or potentially say, hey, can I - I'll take a risk here. So, I can avoid part of the price increase, but it's going to since this is a pointer to the company, it's not a giant part only applies into. Distribution, or you go to a lot of our distributors, you're not going to see a lot of products on the shelf, mainly because of just the model, it's often needs to be customized at the last minute is done in this regard. We have quickly times anyway, that doesn't add a lot of value to sit on a shelf somewhere and make that gap. So, I guess long story short. We have probably a higher incidence of this than we typically do, but because of the nature of IDEX facility, really, really low number for us. Thanks. Hi Rob. Alright, so like, we don't have a lot of CapEx intensity at IDEX anyway, but it is a ramp up from where we've typically been. A lot of it is attributed to the story around emerging markets grew up. So we're taking very deliberate actions in both our areas of concentration in China and India to make long term infrastructure depth over there to support a really, really, really good local for local capabilities that that we have. So, there's the big driver there that of course doesn't reoccur all that often. Outside of that, it's a next level down in the category of doing it more than we used to, would be things like factory floor automation. The technology is available, is pretty phenomenal today, and the cost points have come down to the point where even in our world, it makes sense from time to time to put a robot where somebody was standing for. Particularly, when we've got some labor availability issues, and a lot of its high technology base. So, those are projects that I think there's a graphic on the slide deck that I used, it's something that we're actually using in that area. That's, it's a great lever of operational productivity. It doesn't necessarily inflect the curve too tremendously. But it really helps us from a business perspective, concentrate our efforts on very talented people, and putting them in the areas where we're growing the company, and drawing from within as opposed to having to go out on the outside. So, anything... Sure. Well, I mean, there's always an interesting dynamic there. I mean, I would say, number one, the financial positions of most municipalities, certainly here in the United States are probably thought to be better than they were, let's say a year ago. There's a lot of the stimulus money and things like that comes in and tax receipts generally been higher. So, I think just overall financial condition is good. Requested on the infrastructure spend thing is interesting. I mean, there's always a question of how long did you go from a concept to an actual project-based reality and how long that takes? Ultimately, there's different parts of IDEX where that would actually help us in a good way. I'd point to our Water business is one of them. There's a lot of talk in that bill about water infrastructure and the criticality there. I mean, one of our businesses does an awful lot of great work on sort of flow monitoring studies, which ultimately support CapEx projects, like you have to do one to then determine what it is you're going to buy in terms of CapEx. So, I think we're well positioned there. And there's some other pockets as well. But like always, it probably will take longer to play out and run through the system than we might imagine. But I would put it in the category just like in, they're seeing I think, for receipts in economics that is positive and certainly in a position that's better than I might have imagined it would be as we went into a pandemic. Sure, I mean, our Fire and Rescue business is I mean, they're phenomenal businesses. We've added to them over the years, we've got a nice, scalable concentration, and it's one of our most geographically dispersed businesses. You start with the premise that we've got incredible assets in that space. We've always said it was kind of a mature steady market for us as a backdrop overall. A couple of things going on there that at least in the near term, probably put it into the to the red zone most for us. One is that industry is even before the pandemic was struggling with output execution around chassis and trucks and things, and a couple of different geographies. Obviously, what's going on now is making that better. And so, just backlogs on fire trucks continues to be as long as it was a year ago, if not longer. So yeah, a little bit of a moderation effect there. And then in the emerging markets side, specifically China. And we've definitely seen - we've seen a couple of ways now of push for localization versus in our case, we actually do a fair amount of imported products into that zone to complement our local brand there as well. And I don't think long term that hasn't necessarily impacted us, but it doesn't impact it from a timing perspective, tends to keep tenders captive until we sort of see how it runs out. And so, that's maybe the new element on top of the existing element in it, and basically, it's pretty steady market anyways. I always encourage people when they think about it, this is where like, what we're doing in terms of our application sets on a critical job matters. So, like the discussion we had earlier about automation and the things that we're doing to change the nature of the job is the exciting element with great well positioned global assets. On a, you can still think of it as a mission critical job, very steady state, generally is going to be something that supported them long term with funding and things. But it does go through certain ebbs and flows. And right now, it's on one of the more red not green zones. But we think long term is going to be fine. Thank you. Hi Bryan. Well, I think without spending too much time on lots of details here, you can think of it what the SAM unit and for the others on a call, this is essentially the brand name of the trade name for the automation that we do within a mobile application. You know that, that brings together a lot of important data points, some of which are related to our hardware, some are related to others that are in that mobile platform. And you can think of it in the simplest way as this technology allows us to come off the truck, it's a way to make that happen to make it more mobile and less truck based. Certainly, in terms of ours, if we just listed up the things that are on there and added up potential transaction prices, it's larger. It's larger, I think, largely because of the work that we're putting in as we consider things and where we could go and how we could resource if the people internal in the company and consider the firepower that we had to deploy? So, yeah, I think it's safe to say there's a larger funnel by potential transaction size. Thank you, Bryan. Okay, well, I'd like to thank you all for joining and spending some time with us here today. As we said in the prepared remarks in the beginning, I mean, really, really dynamic time with a lot of variables kind of swirling around. What we talked about in our businesses, we get all of that, and we deal with that on a day-to-day basis. But at the end, we ask people to take a deep breath, kind of come back and recognize that when a world kind of goes through, it's going through. It has a lot of problems that need to be solved and the IDEX Technologies that we have and the people that we have that drive them, they made up well with these kinds of demands. So, we've got well positioned businesses. We got incredible teams and talent. We're really, really focused, we're now to a phase of 80:20, where it's very, very intuitive. And we're putting that to work and what's no doubt the dynamic and variable environment. At the end, I think the trade winds here are very favorable. We believe very strongly in our near term and our medium term and ultimately, the long term prospects of the company. But recognize we kind of have to live moment to moment as we're going through this with an eye on the horizon. And I assure you, that's the one that we're thinking about the most. Thanks again for joining us."

The format for our call today is as follows: we will begin with Eric providing an overview of the state of our business and update on our M&A activity and an overview of our order performance and outlook for our end market. Bill will then discuss our first quarter 2021 financial results and provide an update on our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2021. Finally, Eric will conclude with an update on our sustainability, diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Before we begin, a brief reminder, this call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the Safe Harbor language in last night\u2019s press release and in IDEX\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our CEO, Eric Ashleman.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you, Mike. Once again, our teams across the IDEX should be extremely proud of the results we\u2019ve achieved together. I don\u2019t think any of us would have imagined being at this point when viewing the state of the world a year ago. Our diverse array of high-performing businesses continues to serve as well. We\u2019re seeing most of our end markets either largely recovered or steadily improving at this point. We continue to build on the momentum we experienced in the fourth quarter and expect 2021 to be stronger than our expectations 90 days ago. Although, tremendous progress has been made in our recovery, there are still some areas we\u2019re keeping a close eye on. Our day rates have accelerated, but we have yet to see larger projects in our industrial sector moving forward. Customers are more confident in their outlook, but are now trying to balance the surge in demand with capacity to make larger investments. As for COVID the conditions vary widely around the world. In the UK and the United States, the vaccination rate has been remarkable of late. In China, much of life has been continuing as normal for many months now. The situation in Europe and India, where lockdowns and virus variants are still a serious issue, reminds us that we are not fully past the societal and economic impact that the pandemic has had on our businesses. The quarter was not without challenges from safety protocols and lockdowns to sporadic shortages of parts and materials to rapidly changing logistics hurdles and a variety of staffing challenges. This was far from smooth sailing. Recognizing all of that, I want to thank every IDEX employee on this call for their efforts in the past quarter. I\u2019m proud that our team successfully navigated many tough hurdles to achieve these results. The operational excellence of our teams continues to pay off. Pivoting a moment to capital deployment. With the closure of the ABEL Pumps transaction this quarter and the announcement of the Airtech acquisition last night covered in more detail in a moment, we have started off 2021 on a strong note. And we\u2019ll build on this momentum as we further invest in M&A capabilities. We recently allocated some of our most talented resources towards focused strategy and business development roles. And we engaged external expertise to expand our ability to identify, assess, win and successfully integrate new companies into IDEX. Our deal funnel is expanding as we look for more opportunities to acquire organizations that fit the IDEX style of competition. We think they both widen and deepen the moats around our best businesses, as well as established positions within new market niches with the capabilities of our teams will drive the most value for customers and shareholders. We are fortunate to have significant financial resources to deploy towards these efforts. Moving on to Slide 7. Yesterday, we announced our intent to acquire Airtech Vacuum group from EagleTree Capital for $470 million. Airtech engineers and manufactures high performance regenerative blowers, pneumatic valves, air compressors and vacuum pumps. Airtech had revenue of $85 million with EBITDA margin in the mid 30s range in 2020. It is a 16x trailing deal and a 15x deal including acquired tax benefits. Within the IDEX family of businesses, they compliment and expand upon the solutions provided by gas manufacturing, which produces fractional horsepower air moving products and systems that include air compressors, vacuum pumps, air motors and tank systems. While there is some overlaps in the solutions they provide, much of their techs product lines will be complimentary. They will remain separate businesses within IDEX, but we anticipate collaboration and synergies from each company with shared expertise leading to further innovation. This deal, which we expect to close in the second quarter will then create a $200 million pneumatics platform within our Health and Science Technology segment. Turning to our commercial results on Slide 8. The positive momentum in order trends continued in the first quarter, both compared to prior year and sequentially allowing us to build $59 million of backlog in the quarter. Most of our business units are at or approaching pre-pandemic levels. I\u2019ll go into more details in a minute. Organic orders in the quarter exceeded the first quarter of 2020 and were an all time high for us. Q1 orders were also up 4% organically versus Q1 of 2019. As we look across our segments, health and science technologies and fire and safety diversified products delivered strong organic order growth with fluid and metering technology slightly lagging. As growth rates in HST and FSDP began to naturally level off we expect FMT will drive additional growth through the return of project-based businesses in the energy and industrial markets in the second half of the year. These commercial results and the strength of our rebound highlight the resilience of our businesses and the critical importance of the solutions we provide to our customers. On Slide 9, we provide a deeper outlook for our primary end markets. To level set, we entered the year cautiously bullish about the state of our underlying markets and the velocity of the pandemic recovery. Our day rate businesses began to accelerate coming into the year and we continued to leverage our diversified portfolio to aggressively pursue opportunities to drive organic growth coming out of the pandemic. We are now measuring our markets against their pre-pandemic levels. Many of our markets have fully recovered and the majority of our markets are on track to have fully recovered by the end of the year. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re not out of the woods yet, but even with pockets of concern around supply chain disruptions and COVID in certain geographies, we are optimistic about the outlook of our end markets. In our Fluid and Metering Technology segment, industrial day rates continue to increase throughout the quarter. As I\u2019ve mentioned, we will not be at full recovery until we see large CapEx projects resume, but the underlying industrial markets are in a state of recovery trending back towards 2019 levels. Agriculture continues to drive outsized growth as crop prices and customer sentiment remains strong. Our Water business is stable. We continue to assess any subsequent impact from the pandemic, municipal funding as well as tailwinds that might come out of an infrastructure bill. Energy markets continue to lag 2019 levels primarily due to limited capital investment in this sector. Moving to the Health and Science Technologies segment, we experienced solid growth across almost all of our markets. Semicon and food and pharma continued to outperform, driven by a strong market and winning share with our differentiated technology offerings. The overall automotive market faces many challenges, but we have won several new platforms driving our performance. Our AI and life science markets are on the rebound, as the impact of the pandemic of the United States has improved. The industrial businesses within the segment are seeing a similar result to FMT. Day rates are improving but projects are lacking. One last item for HST, we do see risk with the COVID opportunities we have been talking about in this segment specifically around testing. The end product application is yet to receive FDA approval, which will impact volumes for this year. We do believe that the strength in the rest of the segment will be able to offset most of that risk. Finally, in our Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment dispensing continues its rebound as large retailers free up capital and work through pent-up demand for equipment. Much like our automotive exposures in HST, the auto recovery in FSD at BAND-IT is driven by new platform wins coupled with an improved market. In Fire & Rescue, we continue to assess municipal budget headwinds, especially in Europe and India, as budgets have not been released delaying tenders. The U.S. market has been better, and we are optimistic about the impact of our businesses from increased infrastructure spending. The other lagging category in FSD is primarily BAND-IT\u2019s energy and aerospace exposure, along with some industrial applications in Fire & Rescue. We continue to closely monitor market conditions and are focused on ensuring the stability of our supply chain, as persistence in global supply chain issues threatened to create choppiness in the back half of the year. Despite these factors, we are confident enough in our outlook to raise our organic growth expectations for the year. With that, I would like to turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results for the quarter and full year.\nBill Grogan: Thanks, Eric. I\u2019ll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 11. Q1 orders of $711 million were up 10% overall and up 6% organically, as we built $59 million of backlog in the quarter. Organic orders grew sequentially and year-over-year in each of our segments as highlighted by Eric on the prior slide. First quarter sales of $652 million were up 10% overall and 6% organically. We experienced growth across all our segments with over 75% of our business units increasing year-over-year. Strength in Semicon, food and pharma and dispensing were the notable highlights in the quarter. Q1 gross margin contracted 80 basis points to 44.9%, but it was up 110 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by the dilutive impact of acquisitions, inventory step-up associated with ABEL, mix and one-time inventory reserves. The inventory reserves were associated with our pandemic related electrostatic sprayer businesses now materializing at the rate we expected. Excluding acquisitions in the inventory reserves, gross margin would have been flat to prior year. First quarter operating margin was 23.9%, up 40 basis points compared to prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 24.3%, up 80 basis points compared to last year, driven by the increased volume and the impact of cost actions taken last year offset by the gross margin pressure I just mentioned. I will discuss the drivers of operating income in more detail on the following slide. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 22.6%, which was higher than the prior year ETR of 20%, due to a decrease in the excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. This drove a $0.05 headwind on EPS for the quarter. First quarter adjusted net income was $115 million resulting in adjusted EPS of $1.51, up $0.18 or 14% over prior year. Excluding the $0.05 tax headwind, adjusted EPS would have been up $0.23 or 17%. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $95 million, up 32% compared to prior year and was 82% of adjusted net income. The strong performance was driven by higher earnings and the continued impact of our working capital initiatives. Moving on to Slide 12, as Eric mentioned, we entered the quarter cautiously optimistic about the pace of growth coming into 2021. We knew that we were structurally well positioned to take advantage of the improving market conditions from the cost actions and discretionary controls, we put in place last year. Adjusted operating income increased $18 million for the quarter compared to prior year. Our 6% organic growth contributed approximately $13 million flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. The impact of previous discretionary cost controls contributed $5 million and we were able to net $4 million from price, productivity, partially offset by inflation. After accounting for $2 million of negative mix, our organic flow-through is extremely strong at 58%. Flow-through was then negatively impacted by the $3 million charge related to the inventory reserve, I discussed on the last slide and the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX, getting to a reported flow-through of 32%. As we highlighted in prior calls, we expect to reinvest aggressively in the business to drive both organic and inorganic opportunities. We\u2019ve already started those investments and expect the associated costs when these initiatives will reduce our organic flow-through in subsequent quarters. With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2021. I\u2019m on Slide 13. For the second quarter, we are projecting EPS to range from $1.60 to $1.63 with organic revenue growth of 18% to 20%, and operating margins of approximately 24.5%. The second quarter effective tax rate is expected to be about 23% and we expect a 2% top line benefit from the impact of FX. Corporate costs in the second quarter expected to be around $21 million with the increase, primarily driven by the M&A investments we discussed earlier. Turning to the full year outlook, we are increasing our full-year EPS guidance from $5.65 to $5.95, up to $6.05 to $6.20. We are also increasing our full year organic revenue growth from 6% to 8% up to 9% to 10%. We expect operating margins of approximately 24.5%. We expect FX to provide a 1% benefit to top line results. Our full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $55 million. Free cash flow is now expected to be 115% to 120% of net income and corporate costs are expected to be approximately $74 million for the full year. Finally, our earnings guidance excludes any costs or earnings associated with future acquisitions or restructuring charges. ABEL Pumps is now included in these estimates with the deal closed in the first quarter. Airtech is not included in these estimates. We will update our guidance accordingly once a deal closes. With that, I\u2019ll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Bill. I\u2019m on the final slide, Slide 14. Before we open the call for questions, I\u2019d like to share an update on our ESG journey and the evolution of our company culture. We recently published our second corporate social responsibility report. This report is our first to adopt the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board sector standards also known SASB. We have increased our disclosures in key areas, including health and safety, diversity, and environmental impact. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Denise Cade, our General Counsel and her cross-functional team for their outstanding efforts to bring our hard work and commitments to light. Diversity equity inclusion continues to be a point of emphasis in our evolving company culture. Since we last met, an outside facilitator conducted anonymous focus groups with employees from around the world, from which we learned and we\u2019re able to begin developing more targeted goals for the company. We are currently planning training sessions for all leaders to help them understand and become comfortable, fostering dialogue on these important issues. We are addressing our talent management processes, including our assessment of existing talent and our consideration of new talent through recruiting to help ensure our processes are free from unconscious bias. And we are assessing our purchasing practice to expand our use of diverse suppliers. IDEX is a decentralized company with a diverse collection of businesses. Our superior economic model depends upon problem solving and decision making at the point of impact, closest to our customers. Our collective work within this important areas outlined in this report is an essential component of our next phase of business growth. With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Halloran: Good morning, everyone. So let\u2019s just talk about what\u2019s embedded in guidance here, obviously, really strong first quarter. Second quarter guide seems where the uptick and guidance comes from between the first and the second quarter, maybe a little less movement in the back half of the year relative to prior expectations. So just kind of want to understand, what the trajectory you\u2019re thinking about through the year is? How you\u2019re viewing the recovery? How much of \u2013 what I just mentioned is true and what are some of the puts and takes you\u2019re thinking about, because obviously, the tone that you\u2019re striking is cautiously optimistic as you move in the back half of the year. And just want to make sure I have all those things balanced.\nEric Ashleman: Yes. Well, thanks, Mike. I mean, look, it\u2019s \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s an interesting time, as I said, in the opening comments there. I mean, we\u2019ve got this broad-based momentum, which we feel really good about. And it\u2019s got these little chapters that lie over it, whether that\u2019s shutdowns, coming out of Christmas, terrible weather in Texas in February, supply chain stuff now and I think that\u2019s going to be the story as we go. And then that lays over the IDEX story, which always kind of had our second quarter as a high point for us. And so we see that momentum lining up nicely on our typically seasonally adjusted second quarter. And then the back half, I think that\u2019s going to be a story of \u2013 we\u2019ve got some projects and things that we know about on the inside that we feel good about. We think the momentum certainly will continue, but we would suspect we\u2019re still going to have a lot of these challenges out there that we\u2019ll have to navigate around. And of course, then I think the typical seasonal patterns that we see around summer shutdowns and things in Europe are embedded on top of that. So it\u2019s an interesting story with very broad-based support, early momentum, these kind of episodic challenges that we have to navigate around that we feel confident and we will.\nMike Halloran: So on those challenges, supply chain, inflation price cost dynamics, maybe talk about how those are impacting you, when you think there\u2019s call it peak pain from your perspective on all these things hitting, with that, I mean, first quarter margins were obviously excellent. Second quarter implied still very good. So just talk about how you\u2019re managing effectively and you did a ton of work coming into this to prepare for a lot of these challenges. But I\u2019d certainly like to understand how it\u2019s impacting you and how it phases through the year?\nEric Ashleman: Yes, sure. Well, like, this is where our model and our talent really helps us. I mean, we\u2019ve got a lot of local sourcing very close to where we produce, very close to where we sell. So we have a kind of an inherent advantage there. And we\u2019ve got really, really talented teams that used, frankly, a lot of the lessons of the year\u2019s worth of the severe acute phase of the pandemic to make some smart moves around supply chain to prepare us for this. That being said, I would say, on the inflationary front, it\u2019s kind of spotty for us. I mean, remember we\u2019re a little further down the food chain. We don\u2019t buy a lot of giant quantities of base material. We buy things that have been converted. So it does have a little bit of a lag for us. And so we see the same things others are seeing where we buy lots of metals. There\u2019s some inflationary pressure, electronics, few other places. But we\u2019re navigating around those. On the freight side, that\u2019s certainly a challenge both on the price, frankly, more on the availability side. We\u2019re no different than anybody else trying to find sea containers, trucking, trains, port facilities that have to unclog all of those things. Our model helps us. Our folks help us. I think, as we go further out, the inflationary pressure I actually think that\u2019s going to ramp up a bit for everybody. One of the things that you can still appreciate, I see it in our own businesses is today we still have a little bit of the benefit of our people are good scavengers. They\u2019ll go around and they\u2019ll find some things over here. Find some places over there. Take advantage of some inventory sell stock. Eventually, you kind of get back where you\u2019re right at the end of the factory. And then you\u2019re kind of dealing with what everybody else is. So we\u2019re planning for that. We\u2019re making all the moves that we need to. And certainly, of course, all of this for us, you can never tell this story without talking about price capture. And so we\u2019ve got these things aligned and as you suspect, we\u2019re always trying to manage that spread and taking advantage of the price capture side as we sell and then executing the heck out of a difficult environment on the backend to maintain that spread as we go. And doing it all with our customers at top of mind and considering, and remembering the lead time requirements that we have kind of where we fit the criticality of what we do. That\u2019s what drives all of it.\nBill Grogan: Yes, Mike. So we were pretty comfortable relative to where we\u2019re sitting right now that we\u2019ve maintained our historical price cost spread. When we have seen some businesses, the inflation has ramped up here more quickly. They\u2019ve gone out proactively with incremental prices or surcharges to our customer. So our commercial teams are actively working with our supply chain teams to make sure that we have the ability to continue that spread as we progressed through the year.\nMike Halloran: Thanks for the answers, guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. There were a couple products cited in the prepared remarks COVID related, that were looking like they were lagging in terms of initial expectations. I know last year that was part of an IDEX initiative. There were $25 million to $100 million potential revenue new COVID products. It sounds like this - two of these were in that bucket, the HST the COVID tester and the FMT, the electrostatic sprayer. So just give us an update those COVID related initiatives, how many not all are going to come through, I get that, but just where does that stand in terms of expectations?\nEric Ashleman: Sure. So I\u2019ll kind of start back in the beginning and just walk this from high to low. I mean, we originally talked about that range pretty quickly that moved to about $60 million. That was split pretty evenly between 2020 and 2021. So now we\u2019re kind of talking about a $30 million bucket for this year and the two biggest components in there were the electrostatic sprayer application, which we talked about and you saw in the margin walk, I\u2019ll come back to that in a second. And then the COVID testing, the diagnostic application, which was always a little bit more backend loaded. And as you noted, and we noted in our remarks, we\u2019ve got some pressure points around both of those related frankly to the improving situation that we see across the globe in terms of vaccination rates and some other things. On the sprayer front, that literally is binary as some change in thought, a change in thought, that was part of the CDC guidelines around the need for standardization, not being as high as previously thought. At a time, pretty coincident with some of our launch planning. So as you\u2019d suspect, we\u2019ve taken a slightly different view of that business. I think it\u2019s a good product line. There are still plenty of places, a lot of it involved in transportation where that\u2019s still going to be an essential piece of it. But it\u2019s no doubt going to run out slower. I do want to pause just for a second though and point out the positive aspect of that. That was \u2013 it was one of our hardest hit businesses in terms of their core markets that rallied massively quickly put together a business and put together all this product and got it ready to frankly live our mission and try to make the world a better place. So we celebrate that one. And we\u2019re going to leverage that capability going forward. On the other side, on the testing front, it\u2019s a little bit more complex. We\u2019ve got some issues on FDA approvals with our partners and we have this backdrop of vaccinations and things rolling out across the world, but I must tell you. So I think, we\u2019re viewing that a little less favorably as we go forward again with an eye towards what happens in the back half. Now the world is still is not at the recommended level of surveillance testing, we\u2019re underneath it by more than half. And we still think this has a role to play, but we want to at least point out that, there\u2019s an impact of an improving world to a couple of these applications. But overall, couldn\u2019t be happier with how our teams responded and put together the solutions here.\nDeane Dray: All right. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks for the update there. And look, we\u2019d much rather see you take these shots on goal because that\u2019s good initiative. And there\u2019s always some positives that will come out of it in terms of product development and other market opportunities. So appreciate all that. Second question, just \u2013 it\u2019s more for Bill, just in terms of expectations on incrementals for the balance of the year. And I really appreciate how you highlight the organic drop through to separate out. It was like the inventory reserve taken. So just the expectation here, both on reported incrementals and organic incrementals and what is baked in on guidance here?\nBill Grogan: Yes. So maybe I\u2019ll speak to the organic. Obviously, really healthy, we look at core organic flow-through of 58%. I think relatively increasing guide, where we\u2019re at with our reinvestments discretionary cost add backs, that\u2019s probably going to moderate around the low 40%s as we progress through the second, third and fourth quarters, if we do the math, that\u2019s really, what\u2019s implied with the revised EPS guidance.\nDeane Dray: That\u2019s real helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi guys. Good morning. Just want to go back to your comments on the industrials more on that big project focus. I just want to make sure I understand it. It sounds like it\u2019s \u2013 the first half still really slow, second half, you\u2019re getting some expectation that that could improve. Any color there. Is it sort of confidence from customers increasing, quality of inquiries, any color you can provide on that side?\nEric Ashleman: Yes, absolutely. I mean, it\u2019s an important piece of the business, especially as we think about the rest of the year. I think actually the situation is changed there. The daily order rates, of course, we pointed to that momentum and that\u2019s a great sign. That\u2019s a great sign that the system\u2019s working and that the momentum is there. The project side, I think has shifted from one of confidence in a lack of belief in let\u2019s say, an improving outlook in the world and all of those things, that\u2019s actually quite favorable now. I think now it\u2019s actually caught up in a space -a zone of people just trying to execute it. And I look at my own businesses and see some of that same thing where some things larger projects, we\u2019ve been thinking about a lot of people that would have been moving those along are trying really, really hard to ship product, get things going, understanding that\u2019s on inventory, all of that. So as we engage with customers, particularly that right down that fairway of industrials with an FMT, this is the difference in tone. You see a lot of optimism, but you also see a lot of very, very busy people. And that\u2019s especially true of the nature of the kind of projects we have. These are kind of those medium term expansions of facilities and things like that. So we\u2019re pretty confident, very confident that those are going to come back. In some ways, we just need to get a little bit more space to work on them, continue to see the momentum that\u2019s already out there. And then the lines cross, and we think that\u2019s an important part of our story going forward.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then just next, M&A, it sounds like a pretty active pipeline, two deals so far. I guess, two things, one \u2013 how are you balancing that managerial capacity to handle some of these incoming properties with activity increasing. And then second is really around leverage, any change to sort of that comfort level. And if there\u2019s some, I would say more interesting opportunities that come along here. Just any thoughts there?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. Great questions. Well, so a couple of things and \u2013 just capacity in general, as you\u2019ve seen in the comments for a couple of quarters here, we\u2019ve been building that all along. A lot of the optimization we\u2019ve done with IDEX over the last five years gave us the muscle that we\u2019re now leaning on as we think about looking for acquiring and integrating companies. So that\u2019s something just at the foundational level rather than just do the two transactions that we have here. They\u2019re both very good standalone businesses that while they\u2019re going to require some integrative activity these are well positioned, in good shape and let\u2019s say, a lighter touch in terms of demand from some IDEX talent across the board. And so bottom line is, I feel confident that we could continue to work the funnel that we have with the intent that we\u2019re driving. If we were to kind of lap this experience again in the back half, I wouldn\u2019t see that as a problem, in terms of \u2013 our teams being able to go out and work on acquisitions. I will tell you, it\u2019s a spec. We always filter these, there are some properties that if we said yes, and we were successful to take a lot more work than others. And we would factor that in. And we\u2019re always pretty aware of that. But right now in very good shape with an intentional build on the bottom side and on the top. Two transactions that are very fortunately are in kind of great shape out of the gate.\nBill Grogan: And then relative to your second part of your question, I would say, yes, we still think our balance sheet is most efficient at about 2.5x. So relative to the capital availability we have on hand plus additional leverage for us to go deploy another $2 billion post the Airtech closure is extremely reasonable. So we have more than enough capacity to go after the things that Eric just mentioned.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thanks so much for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nConnor Lynagh: Yes, thank you. I wanted to talk about the Airtech acquisition. Just wondering, if you could sort of provide an overview of why you found this to be an attractive asset, how we should think about the market structure and the competitive positioning of the firm?\nEric Ashleman: Sure. Well, this is an exciting transaction. This is a really, really phenomenal company. And it sits very nicely next to the gas business that we illustrated there on the opening deck. In the nature that they\u2019re both involved with very, very specialized air handling applications, but they\u2019re highly complementary. So the strengths of gas in different areas of compression are then balanced very nicely with the regenerative blower side and the specialty in the valve piece of Airtech. So they fit together seamlessly. What I really, really like about these businesses is they\u2019re both filled with incredible domain experts who have just got phenomenal abilities to innovate. Airtech has got a great growth track record. As I said in my opening comments, it\u2019s very profitable, very close to end markets that we\u2019re extremely interested in. On the gas side, we\u2019ve got some of that as well. And frankly we\u2019ve got a lot of channels strength in markets that I think are going to compliment that business. And then we\u2019ve got a toolkit. We\u2019ve got a talent base, a cultural base, and an 80-20 toolkit that we know when you apply to IDEX like businesses, particularly ones of high quality, can drive the whole thing further. Last piece of it is, there\u2019s other things out there in this world that could be interesting that the two businesses together may unlock for us that are part of our \u2013 the funnel and things that we\u2019re thinking about as we consider capital deployment in the future. So the suite of options, but around a - all of its centered around a super attractive business that we could not be happier with.\nConnor Lynagh: Yes. Understood. Maybe just to dive a little deeper on that. Could you help us understand sort of the big end markets that the business serves and just how you\u2019d think about longer term ex-COVID normalization type growth within the business?\nEric Ashleman: Sure. I mean, the business has got it\u2019s \u2013 similar to gas in some respects, it\u2019s got kind of an industrial core that serves as a foundation piece both financially and in terms of scale. And then in the markets that they\u2019ve picked, they\u2019ve done some nice things in alternative energy. They\u2019ve done some great work within some specialty medical applications, some very interesting things around some technologies that are going to be important for the world going forward, industrial tech. They just, again, it\u2019s a lot like IDEX. Many of them are industrial like applications, but they really leverage being up at the tightest end of a tolerance and duty spectrum. And this business has a great filter in terms of how they bring those about. So, a lot of it\u2019s going to sum up to general industrial, but when you pick at it, that next level has always been the most important for us. And you just see incredible little niche applications that line up really well with their capabilities and the financials of the business.\nConnor Lynagh: Appreciate it.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Summerville: Thanks. A couple of questions. First, with respect to HST, it looked like that business delivered a pretty nice breakout performance from an operating margin standpoint. Can you talk about what\u2019s sort of driving that and how you feel about the sustainability in that profit performance that you delivered here in Q1?\nBill Grogan: Yes, sure. I\u2019ll take the first stab at it and then Eric could add. No, I think relative to the actions that we took last year to restructure some of these assets and then the mix of the businesses within the portfolio that have performed extremely well here over the last couple of quarters. So that combination of a much better foundation to build off of, they did have significant growth and then the mix of sales within the different businesses were the primary drivers. So I\u2019d say, we would look for them to be at this level of profitability here going forward.\nMatt Summerville: Got it. And then just as a follow-up to the price cost sort of question that came up earlier. How much price were you guys able to realize in Q1? And how much incremental price realization will you need in the balance of the year to keep that price cost right where you want it? Thank you.\nEric Ashleman: Well, we were just north of a point in Q1. That was fully in line with what we saw on the inbound side. I honestly think it will \u2013 we\u2019re going to aggressively target to ratchet that up a bit, but we always do that with the indicators that we see and thinking a lot about the ultimate spread that we realized. So I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve got a number of pegs, but we have a method that we peg that sort of is very active, follows along, takes advantage of the short lead times that we have in the way that we are able to execute price. So I guess, the shortest answer would be probably north of where we are here. A lot of it dependent on where we see some of the underlying commodities and some things heading for us, but always mindful of where that spread is. But ultimately we want to keep that as a net positive item for the company.\nMatt Summerville: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Giordano with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nFrancisco Amador: Hey guys. Good morning. This is Francisco on for Joe.\nEric Ashleman: Hi.\nFrancisco Amador: Are you guys seeing any impact specific to the semi-shortage, whether it\u2019s specifically on that end market or any other markets that are sort of feeling the pain like automotive?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. We see them both fronts, so there are those occasions where end customers certainly got some issues, automotive is the easiest one to point to. That\u2019s the more recent coming into our world in the first quarter. We think about our exposure there is very much program by program. So it literally comes down to kind of, are they making trucks versus cars? And so we\u2019ve seen some of that enter the mix in Q1 and we talked about that. From our side, we don\u2019t have a ton of computerized elements of the products we make. We see it in sensors and some displays and some other places, so it\u2019s out there. And we\u2019re navigating just like everybody else, but it\u2019s been \u2013 frankly, we\u2019ve been able to move around it, work around it and bring it all together here.\nFrancisco Amador: Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then can you expand a little bit more on the dispensing side? Are you seeing replenishment there and like just expanding on the demand in general?\nEric Ashleman: Well, I think, yes, I think on the dispensing side, you see a couple of things coming together. I mean, one of the big drivers there has always been sort of life of the fleet and we were coming up at a point where that we knew that that was going to be refreshed. On top of that, of course, we had a pandemic where \u2013 frankly, even while we were locked down and shut down, there was a lot of painting going on and you saw a reluctance to say, well, let\u2019s go interrupt that stream with capital deployment. So now that we\u2019ve kind of passed through that, you\u2019ve got kind of those two things that coming together, and you\u2019ve got economies that are opening up on a global basis. Remember this is a really global business for us. We\u2019re doing business all over the world here. And so we\u2019re seeing kind of a bunch of positive forces come together all in one place on a business that has this potential over time. It does tend to hit some cycles and some valleys. And right now it\u2019s hitting many positive cycles.\nFrancisco Amador: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question.\nWalter Liptak: Hi. Thanks. Good morning and congratulations on the good quarter. I wanted to see if we can get some insight on the M&A pipeline with the Airtech deal. Was this a deal that you\u2019ve been working on for awhile? Clearly, there\u2019s a nice fit with gas and maybe a sector to go after. But was this a brokered deal? Was this something that was kind of went through a process or have you been working with Airtech for a while to try and get something going?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. I mean, like a lot of the companies that are out here we\u2019ve known about Airtech for a long time. Honestly kind of watch them as they\u2019ve grown very, very well over the last half decade or so. So, they\u2019re under private ownership, a lot of things came together and I will tell you, it moved pretty quickly. In this particular case, this is \u2013 as you might imagine, one of the easier businesses for us to get our heads around. And then as we did that and saw the quality of it, it moves quite a bit faster than some other transactions, just because of a lot of those things lining up well for us.\nWalter Liptak: Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then, in the past, you guys have talked about the valuation multiples of M&A deals. I wonder, how\u2019d you feel about the multiple that you\u2019ll be paying for this one. And you mentioned 80-20 is like a value-add that you can bring to the business. Is it too early to start talking about where you think \u2013 what you think you could do with it?\nEric Ashleman: Well, look it\u2019s very strong business, valuations are high now. We\u2019re pleased with the transaction. That\u2019s why we did it. I\u2019d say, from an 80-20 perspective, it\u2019s interesting. This \u2013 in any ways I think it\u2019s going to \u2013 this is representative of the sweet spot of what 80-20 can do. You\u2019ve got a business here that\u2019s a lot like ours in terms of its filled with these incredible problem solvers full of passion. What 80-20 helps you do is just understand what are the things you\u2019re going to go after? Why is that? And how can you get disproportionately more of your resources over on the things that are the best? It\u2019s a very simple framework and a thinking process that becomes intuitive over time. And we\u2019re excited to introduce it and work with Airtech team on how it might help them improve an otherwise already good business. You can use it for other things and different businesses that are in different states, but this one is very much around continuing to help a really strong business grow even better in the future. And think about \u2013 and use it as a lens to think about the combinations and synergistic elements between the two companies together.\nBill Grogan: Relative to the multiple, obviously, we focus on the returns and this is a high quality business that we think is going to be drive returns well in excess of our cost of capital here as we proceed over the next couple of years. So, although it\u2019s a little bit on the higher side on the print number, long-term this is a phenomenal transaction for us.\nWalter Liptak: Okay. Yes, looks great. Thank you.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Graham: Good morning and nice quarter for you guys. Thanks for taking my question. I apologize, I was sort of jumped on and off the call here. If I ask a question that\u2019s been asked, I apologize in advance. Did you mention Airtech\u2019s sales specifically?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. We did in the opening comments around $85 million.\nScott Graham: $85 million. Thank you. Additionally, Eric, I noticed that you put in your market sum up life sciences, is sort of recovering. And I know a couple of companies that are out there, be it Illumina, Danaher, which are proxies [Indiscernible] customer, but really had blowout first quarter results in some of their markets. And I know it\u2019s not perfectly like for like, particularly with Danaher, but I was just curious as to why you have that in recovering as opposed to not recovered.\nEric Ashleman: Well, a couple of things, like a lot of things with IDEX it comes down to where we play and the products that we have there. So, a lot of companies have a lot more consumable exposure than we do. And so that would be very clearly that\u2019s the piece that recovers first and a lot of the elements that are embedded in life sciences. Let\u2019s just take the kind of classic IBD space, as things open up and people go back in for testing you get a lot of action on the consumable stream, but it takes a while before you\u2019re going to do a large scale box replacement and that\u2019s what we supply. So, we\u2019ve got a mixed bag here. We\u2019ve got some places like that where we\u2019re going to have to wait. And we certainly have some exciting stuff, especially on the microfluidics side and some of the stuff around AI as it involves itself in vaccine development and therapeutics [get up] (ph) in a different place. But when you put it all together we sort of use this category to say, recovering, but not quite there yet. And we understand the elements that are going to have to find their way in there for us to move it into the next space.\nScott Graham: Right. I guess, by just a little bit different space of things then move around within the space, would you be surprised if on the next quarter call that if you didn\u2019t have life sciences up a notch into the recovered zone?\nEric Ashleman: I\u2019d certainly consider the arrow to be moving in that direction. A lot of it would come down to the IBD placement of machines, some of the CapEx that\u2019s in that product, whether that\u2019s a quarter from now or later, I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s hard to imagine that it wouldn\u2019t improve. All the dynamics would suggest that we would follow much of what you cited there and those other companies.\nScott Graham: Got you. Okay. Yes. Thank you. So another question again on that same page Fire and Rescue. This morning one of your customers reported a pretty robust fire number, which surprised me, might have even surprised you. I know that, sort of muni spending and related was a bit of an area that you were watching coming into the quarter. It sounds like you kind of still are. Could you update us a little bit on that market? Is there potentially may be a refresh that\u2019s needed there as well, given the number that customer reported this morning? Or is that maybe just sort of like \u2013 sort of like the final good quarter and maybe you think it slows down from here, just on Fire.\nEric Ashleman: Yes. Well, I certainly couldn\u2019t talk too much about what they said or what they might be seeing, but I will say it\u2019s an interesting space because you have a lot of things going on here. You\u2019ve got obviously the municipal spend profile side and a lot of that we\u2019re going to have to wait and see where that goes. There are so many elements that are moving around concurrently. There\u2019s federal efforts to backstop things and that side of it there\u2019s some regulatory pieces. So we\u2019ll see. And then you\u2019ve got this dynamic, certainly in this market where we\u2019ve seen even ahead of some of the more recent supply chain stuff that we\u2019re talking about globally, very unique to that industry, challenge around trucks and chassis and things that\u2019s sort of capped off some of the potential on the sales side for end customers. So, if that works itself out that\u2019s going to be ultimately good for us. We\u2019ll see how successful people are with that. And then we\u2019ll have to see where the market itself, the municipal market rides along underneath it. And then you always have to throw in for us, I hate to do add more and more variable, but this is a really massively global business. And so, they don\u2019t all move in step. Things going on in China and India and emerging markets are not necessarily the same as what we would see here in the Midwest. So there\u2019s a lot of things working together. I think it\u2019s safe to put it in the recovering. It is improved, not quite back where we would expect it to be and think it will be ultimately. And then we will like you monitor a lot of these things coming together here to paint a clear picture as we go.\nScott Graham: That\u2019s very clear, Eric. Thank you.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nNathaniel Pendleton: This is Nate on for Nathan Jones this morning. I wanted to ask about orders. Orders were up 6% organically and 10% in total. Can you talk about kind of the cadence of orders through the quarter? What segments and end markets drove the improvement in order rates? And then how daily order rates are trending so far in April.\nEric Ashleman: Yes. I mean, honestly you can kind of take the entire company and say in generally it improved as we moved through that first quarter. I will remind us again each month had its own chapter of externality. But I guess all of them were somewhat equal. So broad improvement kind of marching through the quarter and as we\u2019re looking at April, I mean, I don\u2019t see anything that would change the story here. Bill, anything you\u2019d add.\nBill Grogan: No. I guess, from what drove the orders, obviously all of the businesses within HST did extremely well. Within FMT, obviously we talked about that\u2019s probably the group that\u2019s still lagging a bit across the portfolio, outside of Banjo that had a phenomenal quarter and it continues to outperform relative to the dynamics in that market. And then within FSD, Band-IT and dispensing specifically did extremely well with Fire and Rescue improving relative to some of the things that Eric highlighted based on Scott\u2019s question, so a little bit slower than the balance of the portfolio.\nNathaniel Pendleton: Okay, great. And I wanted to ask a follow-up with muni. What are your assumptions on muni budgets and spending? And then what are your thoughts on the infrastructure spending Bill and potential impact to the muni market?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. So look, I think we\u2019ve got muni spending in generally in kind of a steady as she goes category until we know more and see it. The infrastructure stuff is interesting as you\u2019d expect probably like everybody else, you kind of go and peel it back headline by headline. Then you\u2019ve got to really work on a variable of timing. Like when do we think that that would find its way here? And as always, a lot of it\u2019s pretty unclear. So just that term in itself, if it means roads and bridges, it means one thing for IDEX, if it means underneath and sewers and wet pipe and things like that, that\u2019s different. And it\u2019s hard for me to see how clear it is until it starts to become more actionable, which then I think supports \u2013 I think it\u2019s going to take a while to run out. But I would say in general, the fact that it exists is a positive element that should help of many IDEX markets. So we view it that way. We\u2019ll continue to ping it as we get some insight into things and start to see driving trends within the business will surely call it out.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you for taking my questions.\nEric Ashleman: Sure.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I\u2019d like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.\nEric Ashleman: Okay. Thanks so much. For those external to IDEX, I always want to thank you for your support and interest in the company. We know there\u2019s a lot of IDEX employees on a call like this as well. And so frankly, I want to thank you again for your hard work. It\u2019s paying off clearly, as we\u2019ve talked about here. There\u2019s more hard work to come, but we\u2019ve got a resilient business. I think our positioning in these attractive niches continues to serve us well. We\u2019ve got a team of people that are second to none here. So I think you can hear, we\u2019re pretty optimistic about the path forward. We know there will be challenges, things that are unexpected that will come up along the way, but we\u2019re excited. We\u2019re excited about the momentum that we\u2019re seeing, where it will take us. And we\u2019re very excited about the story here with bringing Airtech into the IDEX family, alongside ABEL Pumps. We\u2019re working hard to continue that momentum as well on top of it as we go forward. And we\u2019ll look forward to talking to you all along the way as we make progress. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Bill Grogan",
            "content": "Thanks, Eric. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 11. Q1 orders of $711 million were up 10% overall and up 6% organically, as we built $59 million of backlog in the quarter. Organic orders grew sequentially and year-over-year in each of our segments as highlighted by Eric on the prior slide. First quarter sales of $652 million were up 10% overall and 6% organically. We experienced growth across all our segments with over 75% of our business units increasing year-over-year. Strength in Semicon, food and pharma and dispensing were the notable highlights in the quarter. Q1 gross margin contracted 80 basis points to 44.9%, but it was up 110 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by the dilutive impact of acquisitions, inventory step-up associated with ABEL, mix and one-time inventory reserves. The inventory reserves were associated with our pandemic related electrostatic sprayer businesses now materializing at the rate we expected. Excluding acquisitions in the inventory reserves, gross margin would have been flat to prior year. First quarter operating margin was 23.9%, up 40 basis points compared to prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 24.3%, up 80 basis points compared to last year, driven by the increased volume and the impact of cost actions taken last year offset by the gross margin pressure I just mentioned. I will discuss the drivers of operating income in more detail on the following slide. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 22.6%, which was higher than the prior year ETR of 20%, due to a decrease in the excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. This drove a $0.05 headwind on EPS for the quarter. First quarter adjusted net income was $115 million resulting in adjusted EPS of $1.51, up $0.18 or 14% over prior year. Excluding the $0.05 tax headwind, adjusted EPS would have been up $0.23 or 17%. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $95 million, up 32% compared to prior year and was 82% of adjusted net income. The strong performance was driven by higher earnings and the continued impact of our working capital initiatives. Moving on to Slide 12, as Eric mentioned, we entered the quarter cautiously optimistic about the pace of growth coming into 2021. We knew that we were structurally well positioned to take advantage of the improving market conditions from the cost actions and discretionary controls, we put in place last year. Adjusted operating income increased $18 million for the quarter compared to prior year. Our 6% organic growth contributed approximately $13 million flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. The impact of previous discretionary cost controls contributed $5 million and we were able to net $4 million from price, productivity, partially offset by inflation. After accounting for $2 million of negative mix, our organic flow-through is extremely strong at 58%. Flow-through was then negatively impacted by the $3 million charge related to the inventory reserve, I discussed on the last slide and the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX, getting to a reported flow-through of 32%. As we highlighted in prior calls, we expect to reinvest aggressively in the business to drive both organic and inorganic opportunities. We've already started those investments and expect the associated costs when these initiatives will reduce our organic flow-through in subsequent quarters. With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2021. I'm on Slide 13. For the second quarter, we are projecting EPS to range from $1.60 to $1.63 with organic revenue growth of 18% to 20%, and operating margins of approximately 24.5%. The second quarter effective tax rate is expected to be about 23% and we expect a 2% top line benefit from the impact of FX. Corporate costs in the second quarter expected to be around $21 million with the increase, primarily driven by the M&A investments we discussed earlier. Turning to the full year outlook, we are increasing our full-year EPS guidance from $5.65 to $5.95, up to $6.05 to $6.20. We are also increasing our full year organic revenue growth from 6% to 8% up to 9% to 10%. We expect operating margins of approximately 24.5%. We expect FX to provide a 1% benefit to top line results. Our full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $55 million. Free cash flow is now expected to be 115% to 120% of net income and corporate costs are expected to be approximately $74 million for the full year. Finally, our earnings guidance excludes any costs or earnings associated with future acquisitions or restructuring charges. ABEL Pumps is now included in these estimates with the deal closed in the first quarter. Airtech is not included in these estimates. We will update our guidance accordingly once a deal closes. With that, I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts. Yes, Mike. So we were pretty comfortable relative to where we're sitting right now that we've maintained our historical price cost spread. When we have seen some businesses, the inflation has ramped up here more quickly. They've gone out proactively with incremental prices or surcharges to our customer. So our commercial teams are actively working with our supply chain teams to make sure that we have the ability to continue that spread as we progressed through the year. Yes. So maybe I'll speak to the organic. Obviously, really healthy, we look at core organic flow-through of 58%. I think relatively increasing guide, where we're at with our reinvestments discretionary cost add backs, that's probably going to moderate around the low 40%s as we progress through the second, third and fourth quarters, if we do the math, that's really, what's implied with the revised EPS guidance. And then relative to your second part of your question, I would say, yes, we still think our balance sheet is most efficient at about 2.5x. So relative to the capital availability we have on hand plus additional leverage for us to go deploy another $2 billion post the Airtech closure is extremely reasonable. So we have more than enough capacity to go after the things that Eric just mentioned. Yes, sure. I'll take the first stab at it and then Eric could add. No, I think relative to the actions that we took last year to restructure some of these assets and then the mix of the businesses within the portfolio that have performed extremely well here over the last couple of quarters. So that combination of a much better foundation to build off of, they did have significant growth and then the mix of sales within the different businesses were the primary drivers. So I'd say, we would look for them to be at this level of profitability here going forward. Relative to the multiple, obviously, we focus on the returns and this is a high quality business that we think is going to be drive returns well in excess of our cost of capital here as we proceed over the next couple of years. So, although it's a little bit on the higher side on the print number, long-term this is a phenomenal transaction for us. No. I guess, from what drove the orders, obviously all of the businesses within HST did extremely well. Within FMT, obviously we talked about that's probably the group that's still lagging a bit across the portfolio, outside of Banjo that had a phenomenal quarter and it continues to outperform relative to the dynamics in that market. And then within FSD, Band-IT and dispensing specifically did extremely well with Fire and Rescue improving relative to some of the things that Eric highlighted based on Scott's question, so a little bit slower than the balance of the portfolio."

            "name": "Eric Ashleman",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Once again, our teams across the IDEX should be extremely proud of the results we've achieved together. I don't think any of us would have imagined being at this point when viewing the state of the world a year ago. Our diverse array of high-performing businesses continues to serve as well. We're seeing most of our end markets either largely recovered or steadily improving at this point. We continue to build on the momentum we experienced in the fourth quarter and expect 2021 to be stronger than our expectations 90 days ago. Although, tremendous progress has been made in our recovery, there are still some areas we're keeping a close eye on. Our day rates have accelerated, but we have yet to see larger projects in our industrial sector moving forward. Customers are more confident in their outlook, but are now trying to balance the surge in demand with capacity to make larger investments. As for COVID the conditions vary widely around the world. In the UK and the United States, the vaccination rate has been remarkable of late. In China, much of life has been continuing as normal for many months now. The situation in Europe and India, where lockdowns and virus variants are still a serious issue, reminds us that we are not fully past the societal and economic impact that the pandemic has had on our businesses. The quarter was not without challenges from safety protocols and lockdowns to sporadic shortages of parts and materials to rapidly changing logistics hurdles and a variety of staffing challenges. This was far from smooth sailing. Recognizing all of that, I want to thank every IDEX employee on this call for their efforts in the past quarter. I'm proud that our team successfully navigated many tough hurdles to achieve these results. The operational excellence of our teams continues to pay off. Pivoting a moment to capital deployment. With the closure of the ABEL Pumps transaction this quarter and the announcement of the Airtech acquisition last night covered in more detail in a moment, we have started off 2021 on a strong note. And we'll build on this momentum as we further invest in M&A capabilities. We recently allocated some of our most talented resources towards focused strategy and business development roles. And we engaged external expertise to expand our ability to identify, assess, win and successfully integrate new companies into IDEX. Our deal funnel is expanding as we look for more opportunities to acquire organizations that fit the IDEX style of competition. We think they both widen and deepen the moats around our best businesses, as well as established positions within new market niches with the capabilities of our teams will drive the most value for customers and shareholders. We are fortunate to have significant financial resources to deploy towards these efforts. Moving on to Slide 7. Yesterday, we announced our intent to acquire Airtech Vacuum group from EagleTree Capital for $470 million. Airtech engineers and manufactures high performance regenerative blowers, pneumatic valves, air compressors and vacuum pumps. Airtech had revenue of $85 million with EBITDA margin in the mid 30s range in 2020. It is a 16x trailing deal and a 15x deal including acquired tax benefits. Within the IDEX family of businesses, they compliment and expand upon the solutions provided by gas manufacturing, which produces fractional horsepower air moving products and systems that include air compressors, vacuum pumps, air motors and tank systems. While there is some overlaps in the solutions they provide, much of their techs product lines will be complimentary. They will remain separate businesses within IDEX, but we anticipate collaboration and synergies from each company with shared expertise leading to further innovation. This deal, which we expect to close in the second quarter will then create a $200 million pneumatics platform within our Health and Science Technology segment. Turning to our commercial results on Slide 8. The positive momentum in order trends continued in the first quarter, both compared to prior year and sequentially allowing us to build $59 million of backlog in the quarter. Most of our business units are at or approaching pre-pandemic levels. I'll go into more details in a minute. Organic orders in the quarter exceeded the first quarter of 2020 and were an all time high for us. Q1 orders were also up 4% organically versus Q1 of 2019. As we look across our segments, health and science technologies and fire and safety diversified products delivered strong organic order growth with fluid and metering technology slightly lagging. As growth rates in HST and FSDP began to naturally level off we expect FMT will drive additional growth through the return of project-based businesses in the energy and industrial markets in the second half of the year. These commercial results and the strength of our rebound highlight the resilience of our businesses and the critical importance of the solutions we provide to our customers. On Slide 9, we provide a deeper outlook for our primary end markets. To level set, we entered the year cautiously bullish about the state of our underlying markets and the velocity of the pandemic recovery. Our day rate businesses began to accelerate coming into the year and we continued to leverage our diversified portfolio to aggressively pursue opportunities to drive organic growth coming out of the pandemic. We are now measuring our markets against their pre-pandemic levels. Many of our markets have fully recovered and the majority of our markets are on track to have fully recovered by the end of the year. As I mentioned earlier, we're not out of the woods yet, but even with pockets of concern around supply chain disruptions and COVID in certain geographies, we are optimistic about the outlook of our end markets. In our Fluid and Metering Technology segment, industrial day rates continue to increase throughout the quarter. As I've mentioned, we will not be at full recovery until we see large CapEx projects resume, but the underlying industrial markets are in a state of recovery trending back towards 2019 levels. Agriculture continues to drive outsized growth as crop prices and customer sentiment remains strong. Our Water business is stable. We continue to assess any subsequent impact from the pandemic, municipal funding as well as tailwinds that might come out of an infrastructure bill. Energy markets continue to lag 2019 levels primarily due to limited capital investment in this sector. Moving to the Health and Science Technologies segment, we experienced solid growth across almost all of our markets. Semicon and food and pharma continued to outperform, driven by a strong market and winning share with our differentiated technology offerings. The overall automotive market faces many challenges, but we have won several new platforms driving our performance. Our AI and life science markets are on the rebound, as the impact of the pandemic of the United States has improved. The industrial businesses within the segment are seeing a similar result to FMT. Day rates are improving but projects are lacking. One last item for HST, we do see risk with the COVID opportunities we have been talking about in this segment specifically around testing. The end product application is yet to receive FDA approval, which will impact volumes for this year. We do believe that the strength in the rest of the segment will be able to offset most of that risk. Finally, in our Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment dispensing continues its rebound as large retailers free up capital and work through pent-up demand for equipment. Much like our automotive exposures in HST, the auto recovery in FSD at BAND-IT is driven by new platform wins coupled with an improved market. In Fire & Rescue, we continue to assess municipal budget headwinds, especially in Europe and India, as budgets have not been released delaying tenders. The U.S. market has been better, and we are optimistic about the impact of our businesses from increased infrastructure spending. The other lagging category in FSD is primarily BAND-IT's energy and aerospace exposure, along with some industrial applications in Fire & Rescue. We continue to closely monitor market conditions and are focused on ensuring the stability of our supply chain, as persistence in global supply chain issues threatened to create choppiness in the back half of the year. Despite these factors, we are confident enough in our outlook to raise our organic growth expectations for the year. With that, I would like to turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results for the quarter and full year. Thanks, Bill. I'm on the final slide, Slide 14. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to share an update on our ESG journey and the evolution of our company culture. We recently published our second corporate social responsibility report. This report is our first to adopt the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board sector standards also known SASB. We have increased our disclosures in key areas, including health and safety, diversity, and environmental impact. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Denise Cade, our General Counsel and her cross-functional team for their outstanding efforts to bring our hard work and commitments to light. Diversity equity inclusion continues to be a point of emphasis in our evolving company culture. Since we last met, an outside facilitator conducted anonymous focus groups with employees from around the world, from which we learned and we're able to begin developing more targeted goals for the company. We are currently planning training sessions for all leaders to help them understand and become comfortable, fostering dialogue on these important issues. We are addressing our talent management processes, including our assessment of existing talent and our consideration of new talent through recruiting to help ensure our processes are free from unconscious bias. And we are assessing our purchasing practice to expand our use of diverse suppliers. IDEX is a decentralized company with a diverse collection of businesses. Our superior economic model depends upon problem solving and decision making at the point of impact, closest to our customers. Our collective work within this important areas outlined in this report is an essential component of our next phase of business growth. With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions. Yes. Well, thanks, Mike. I mean, look, it's \u2013 I mean, it's an interesting time, as I said, in the opening comments there. I mean, we've got this broad-based momentum, which we feel really good about. And it's got these little chapters that lie over it, whether that's shutdowns, coming out of Christmas, terrible weather in Texas in February, supply chain stuff now and I think that's going to be the story as we go. And then that lays over the IDEX story, which always kind of had our second quarter as a high point for us. And so we see that momentum lining up nicely on our typically seasonally adjusted second quarter. And then the back half, I think that's going to be a story of \u2013 we've got some projects and things that we know about on the inside that we feel good about. We think the momentum certainly will continue, but we would suspect we're still going to have a lot of these challenges out there that we'll have to navigate around. And of course, then I think the typical seasonal patterns that we see around summer shutdowns and things in Europe are embedded on top of that. So it's an interesting story with very broad-based support, early momentum, these kind of episodic challenges that we have to navigate around that we feel confident and we will. Yes, sure. Well, like, this is where our model and our talent really helps us. I mean, we've got a lot of local sourcing very close to where we produce, very close to where we sell. So we have a kind of an inherent advantage there. And we've got really, really talented teams that used, frankly, a lot of the lessons of the year's worth of the severe acute phase of the pandemic to make some smart moves around supply chain to prepare us for this. That being said, I would say, on the inflationary front, it's kind of spotty for us. I mean, remember we're a little further down the food chain. We don't buy a lot of giant quantities of base material. We buy things that have been converted. So it does have a little bit of a lag for us. And so we see the same things others are seeing where we buy lots of metals. There's some inflationary pressure, electronics, few other places. But we're navigating around those. On the freight side, that's certainly a challenge both on the price, frankly, more on the availability side. We're no different than anybody else trying to find sea containers, trucking, trains, port facilities that have to unclog all of those things. Our model helps us. Our folks help us. I think, as we go further out, the inflationary pressure I actually think that's going to ramp up a bit for everybody. One of the things that you can still appreciate, I see it in our own businesses is today we still have a little bit of the benefit of our people are good scavengers. They'll go around and they'll find some things over here. Find some places over there. Take advantage of some inventory sell stock. Eventually, you kind of get back where you're right at the end of the factory. And then you're kind of dealing with what everybody else is. So we're planning for that. We're making all the moves that we need to. And certainly, of course, all of this for us, you can never tell this story without talking about price capture. And so we've got these things aligned and as you suspect, we're always trying to manage that spread and taking advantage of the price capture side as we sell and then executing the heck out of a difficult environment on the backend to maintain that spread as we go. And doing it all with our customers at top of mind and considering, and remembering the lead time requirements that we have kind of where we fit the criticality of what we do. That's what drives all of it. Sure. So I'll kind of start back in the beginning and just walk this from high to low. I mean, we originally talked about that range pretty quickly that moved to about $60 million. That was split pretty evenly between 2020 and 2021. So now we're kind of talking about a $30 million bucket for this year and the two biggest components in there were the electrostatic sprayer application, which we talked about and you saw in the margin walk, I'll come back to that in a second. And then the COVID testing, the diagnostic application, which was always a little bit more backend loaded. And as you noted, and we noted in our remarks, we've got some pressure points around both of those related frankly to the improving situation that we see across the globe in terms of vaccination rates and some other things. On the sprayer front, that literally is binary as some change in thought, a change in thought, that was part of the CDC guidelines around the need for standardization, not being as high as previously thought. At a time, pretty coincident with some of our launch planning. So as you'd suspect, we've taken a slightly different view of that business. I think it's a good product line. There are still plenty of places, a lot of it involved in transportation where that's still going to be an essential piece of it. But it's no doubt going to run out slower. I do want to pause just for a second though and point out the positive aspect of that. That was \u2013 it was one of our hardest hit businesses in terms of their core markets that rallied massively quickly put together a business and put together all this product and got it ready to frankly live our mission and try to make the world a better place. So we celebrate that one. And we're going to leverage that capability going forward. On the other side, on the testing front, it's a little bit more complex. We've got some issues on FDA approvals with our partners and we have this backdrop of vaccinations and things rolling out across the world, but I must tell you. So I think, we're viewing that a little less favorably as we go forward again with an eye towards what happens in the back half. Now the world is still is not at the recommended level of surveillance testing, we're underneath it by more than half. And we still think this has a role to play, but we want to at least point out that, there's an impact of an improving world to a couple of these applications. But overall, couldn't be happier with how our teams responded and put together the solutions here. Yes, absolutely. I mean, it's an important piece of the business, especially as we think about the rest of the year. I think actually the situation is changed there. The daily order rates, of course, we pointed to that momentum and that's a great sign. That's a great sign that the system's working and that the momentum is there. The project side, I think has shifted from one of confidence in a lack of belief in let's say, an improving outlook in the world and all of those things, that's actually quite favorable now. I think now it's actually caught up in a space -a zone of people just trying to execute it. And I look at my own businesses and see some of that same thing where some things larger projects, we've been thinking about a lot of people that would have been moving those along are trying really, really hard to ship product, get things going, understanding that's on inventory, all of that. So as we engage with customers, particularly that right down that fairway of industrials with an FMT, this is the difference in tone. You see a lot of optimism, but you also see a lot of very, very busy people. And that's especially true of the nature of the kind of projects we have. These are kind of those medium term expansions of facilities and things like that. So we're pretty confident, very confident that those are going to come back. In some ways, we just need to get a little bit more space to work on them, continue to see the momentum that's already out there. And then the lines cross, and we think that's an important part of our story going forward. Yes. Great questions. Well, so a couple of things and \u2013 just capacity in general, as you've seen in the comments for a couple of quarters here, we've been building that all along. A lot of the optimization we've done with IDEX over the last five years gave us the muscle that we're now leaning on as we think about looking for acquiring and integrating companies. So that's something just at the foundational level rather than just do the two transactions that we have here. They're both very good standalone businesses that while they're going to require some integrative activity these are well positioned, in good shape and let's say, a lighter touch in terms of demand from some IDEX talent across the board. And so bottom line is, I feel confident that we could continue to work the funnel that we have with the intent that we're driving. If we were to kind of lap this experience again in the back half, I wouldn't see that as a problem, in terms of \u2013 our teams being able to go out and work on acquisitions. I will tell you, it's a spec. We always filter these, there are some properties that if we said yes, and we were successful to take a lot more work than others. And we would factor that in. And we're always pretty aware of that. But right now in very good shape with an intentional build on the bottom side and on the top. Two transactions that are very fortunately are in kind of great shape out of the gate. Sure. Well, this is an exciting transaction. This is a really, really phenomenal company. And it sits very nicely next to the gas business that we illustrated there on the opening deck. In the nature that they're both involved with very, very specialized air handling applications, but they're highly complementary. So the strengths of gas in different areas of compression are then balanced very nicely with the regenerative blower side and the specialty in the valve piece of Airtech. So they fit together seamlessly. What I really, really like about these businesses is they're both filled with incredible domain experts who have just got phenomenal abilities to innovate. Airtech has got a great growth track record. As I said in my opening comments, it's very profitable, very close to end markets that we're extremely interested in. On the gas side, we've got some of that as well. And frankly we've got a lot of channels strength in markets that I think are going to compliment that business. And then we've got a toolkit. We've got a talent base, a cultural base, and an 80-20 toolkit that we know when you apply to IDEX like businesses, particularly ones of high quality, can drive the whole thing further. Last piece of it is, there's other things out there in this world that could be interesting that the two businesses together may unlock for us that are part of our \u2013 the funnel and things that we're thinking about as we consider capital deployment in the future. So the suite of options, but around a - all of its centered around a super attractive business that we could not be happier with. Sure. I mean, the business has got it's \u2013 similar to gas in some respects, it's got kind of an industrial core that serves as a foundation piece both financially and in terms of scale. And then in the markets that they've picked, they've done some nice things in alternative energy. They've done some great work within some specialty medical applications, some very interesting things around some technologies that are going to be important for the world going forward, industrial tech. They just, again, it's a lot like IDEX. Many of them are industrial like applications, but they really leverage being up at the tightest end of a tolerance and duty spectrum. And this business has a great filter in terms of how they bring those about. So, a lot of it's going to sum up to general industrial, but when you pick at it, that next level has always been the most important for us. And you just see incredible little niche applications that line up really well with their capabilities and the financials of the business. Thank you. Well, we were just north of a point in Q1. That was fully in line with what we saw on the inbound side. I honestly think it will \u2013 we're going to aggressively target to ratchet that up a bit, but we always do that with the indicators that we see and thinking a lot about the ultimate spread that we realized. So I don't know that we've got a number of pegs, but we have a method that we peg that sort of is very active, follows along, takes advantage of the short lead times that we have in the way that we are able to execute price. So I guess, the shortest answer would be probably north of where we are here. A lot of it dependent on where we see some of the underlying commodities and some things heading for us, but always mindful of where that spread is. But ultimately we want to keep that as a net positive item for the company. Thanks, Matt. Hi. Yes. We see them both fronts, so there are those occasions where end customers certainly got some issues, automotive is the easiest one to point to. That's the more recent coming into our world in the first quarter. We think about our exposure there is very much program by program. So it literally comes down to kind of, are they making trucks versus cars? And so we've seen some of that enter the mix in Q1 and we talked about that. From our side, we don't have a ton of computerized elements of the products we make. We see it in sensors and some displays and some other places, so it's out there. And we're navigating just like everybody else, but it's been \u2013 frankly, we've been able to move around it, work around it and bring it all together here. Well, I think, yes, I think on the dispensing side, you see a couple of things coming together. I mean, one of the big drivers there has always been sort of life of the fleet and we were coming up at a point where that we knew that that was going to be refreshed. On top of that, of course, we had a pandemic where \u2013 frankly, even while we were locked down and shut down, there was a lot of painting going on and you saw a reluctance to say, well, let's go interrupt that stream with capital deployment. So now that we've kind of passed through that, you've got kind of those two things that coming together, and you've got economies that are opening up on a global basis. Remember this is a really global business for us. We're doing business all over the world here. And so we're seeing kind of a bunch of positive forces come together all in one place on a business that has this potential over time. It does tend to hit some cycles and some valleys. And right now it's hitting many positive cycles. Thank you. Yes. I mean, like a lot of the companies that are out here we've known about Airtech for a long time. Honestly kind of watch them as they've grown very, very well over the last half decade or so. So, they're under private ownership, a lot of things came together and I will tell you, it moved pretty quickly. In this particular case, this is \u2013 as you might imagine, one of the easier businesses for us to get our heads around. And then as we did that and saw the quality of it, it moves quite a bit faster than some other transactions, just because of a lot of those things lining up well for us. Well, look it's very strong business, valuations are high now. We're pleased with the transaction. That's why we did it. I'd say, from an 80-20 perspective, it's interesting. This \u2013 in any ways I think it's going to \u2013 this is representative of the sweet spot of what 80-20 can do. You've got a business here that's a lot like ours in terms of its filled with these incredible problem solvers full of passion. What 80-20 helps you do is just understand what are the things you're going to go after? Why is that? And how can you get disproportionately more of your resources over on the things that are the best? It's a very simple framework and a thinking process that becomes intuitive over time. And we're excited to introduce it and work with Airtech team on how it might help them improve an otherwise already good business. You can use it for other things and different businesses that are in different states, but this one is very much around continuing to help a really strong business grow even better in the future. And think about \u2013 and use it as a lens to think about the combinations and synergistic elements between the two companies together. Thanks. Yes. We did in the opening comments around $85 million. Well, a couple of things, like a lot of things with IDEX it comes down to where we play and the products that we have there. So, a lot of companies have a lot more consumable exposure than we do. And so that would be very clearly that's the piece that recovers first and a lot of the elements that are embedded in life sciences. Let's just take the kind of classic IBD space, as things open up and people go back in for testing you get a lot of action on the consumable stream, but it takes a while before you're going to do a large scale box replacement and that's what we supply. So, we've got a mixed bag here. We've got some places like that where we're going to have to wait. And we certainly have some exciting stuff, especially on the microfluidics side and some of the stuff around AI as it involves itself in vaccine development and therapeutics [get up] (ph) in a different place. But when you put it all together we sort of use this category to say, recovering, but not quite there yet. And we understand the elements that are going to have to find their way in there for us to move it into the next space. I'd certainly consider the arrow to be moving in that direction. A lot of it would come down to the IBD placement of machines, some of the CapEx that's in that product, whether that's a quarter from now or later, I don't know. But it's hard to imagine that it wouldn't improve. All the dynamics would suggest that we would follow much of what you cited there and those other companies. Yes. Well, I certainly couldn't talk too much about what they said or what they might be seeing, but I will say it's an interesting space because you have a lot of things going on here. You've got obviously the municipal spend profile side and a lot of that we're going to have to wait and see where that goes. There are so many elements that are moving around concurrently. There's federal efforts to backstop things and that side of it there's some regulatory pieces. So we'll see. And then you've got this dynamic, certainly in this market where we've seen even ahead of some of the more recent supply chain stuff that we're talking about globally, very unique to that industry, challenge around trucks and chassis and things that's sort of capped off some of the potential on the sales side for end customers. So, if that works itself out that's going to be ultimately good for us. We'll see how successful people are with that. And then we'll have to see where the market itself, the municipal market rides along underneath it. And then you always have to throw in for us, I hate to do add more and more variable, but this is a really massively global business. And so, they don't all move in step. Things going on in China and India and emerging markets are not necessarily the same as what we would see here in the Midwest. So there's a lot of things working together. I think it's safe to put it in the recovering. It is improved, not quite back where we would expect it to be and think it will be ultimately. And then we will like you monitor a lot of these things coming together here to paint a clear picture as we go. Thanks. Yes. I mean, honestly you can kind of take the entire company and say in generally it improved as we moved through that first quarter. I will remind us again each month had its own chapter of externality. But I guess all of them were somewhat equal. So broad improvement kind of marching through the quarter and as we're looking at April, I mean, I don't see anything that would change the story here. Bill, anything you'd add. Yes. So look, I think we've got muni spending in generally in kind of a steady as she goes category until we know more and see it. The infrastructure stuff is interesting as you'd expect probably like everybody else, you kind of go and peel it back headline by headline. Then you've got to really work on a variable of timing. Like when do we think that that would find its way here? And as always, a lot of it's pretty unclear. So just that term in itself, if it means roads and bridges, it means one thing for IDEX, if it means underneath and sewers and wet pipe and things like that, that's different. And it's hard for me to see how clear it is until it starts to become more actionable, which then I think supports \u2013 I think it's going to take a while to run out. But I would say in general, the fact that it exists is a positive element that should help of many IDEX markets. So we view it that way. We'll continue to ping it as we get some insight into things and start to see driving trends within the business will surely call it out. Sure. Okay. Thanks so much. For those external to IDEX, I always want to thank you for your support and interest in the company. We know there's a lot of IDEX employees on a call like this as well. And so frankly, I want to thank you again for your hard work. It's paying off clearly, as we've talked about here. There's more hard work to come, but we've got a resilient business. I think our positioning in these attractive niches continues to serve us well. We've got a team of people that are second to none here. So I think you can hear, we're pretty optimistic about the path forward. We know there will be challenges, things that are unexpected that will come up along the way, but we're excited. We're excited about the momentum that we're seeing, where it will take us. And we're very excited about the story here with bringing Airtech into the IDEX family, alongside ABEL Pumps. We're working hard to continue that momentum as well on top of it as we go forward. And we'll look forward to talking to you all along the way as we make progress. Thanks so much."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Allison Lausas, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. Thank you. You may begin.\nAllison Lausas: Good morning, everyone. This is Allison Lausas, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the IDEX fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial highlights.  Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the 3 months and full year ending December 31, 2022. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today's webcast, can be accessed on our company website at idexcorp.com. Joining me today are Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer and President; and Bill Grogan, our Chief Financial Officer. We will begin with Eric providing an overview of the state of IDEX' business, including a recap of our recent performance. Bill will then provide a segment outlook for 2023 and discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results as well as our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2023. Eric will then close the call with our key priorities for 2023.  Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay beginning approximately 2 hours after the call concludes by dialing the toll-free number (877) 660-6853 and entering conference ID 13734461 or simply log on to our company homepage for the webcast replay. Before we begin, a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor language in last night's press release and in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  With that, I'll now turn this call over to our CEO and President, Eric Ashleman.\nEric Ashleman : Thank you, Allison, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6. 2022 was a record year for IDEX. We experienced double-digit organic growth every quarter, driving all 3 of our segments to record sales levels and achieved strong record profitability, driven by solid execution. This year was not without its challenges. We experienced unprecedented inflation as well as a difficult supply chain environment. Despite these obstacles, we achieved some of the strongest financial results we've ever posted. I'd like to thank our IDEX employees around the globe for their efforts and hard work. We also deployed more capital than ever before, investing in our businesses, acquiring new ones and returning capital to our shareholders. We deployed a record $950 million for the acquisitions of Nexsight, KZValve and most recently, the Muon Group. We reinvested back into our core business to increase capacity to support growth and drive productivity and made investments in the commercial engineering and M&A resources that enable us to execute on our best opportunities. We also repurchased 795,000 shares of IDEX stock for $148 million as we followed our opportunistic disciplined approach to buybacks. As we turn to 2023, we are prepared to build upon a very solid foundation. We have strong backlog positions overall, and we continue to leverage innovative technologies to drive targeted growth opportunities. We have healthy price carryover in addition to new price actions to capture the value our products bring to our customers. Finally, we have an opportunity to drive strong productivity as we bring process-driven normalcy back to our operations through the application of the IDEX operating model. However, we're a short-cycle business and with that comes limited visibility. The broad-based supply chain constraints experienced last year have created some new dynamics around order patterns and customer delivery timing. And we predict that 2023 will be an uncertain period of transition as we dynamically calibrate with our customers. Additionally, there are likely to be pockets of demand softness due to a variety of intersecting economic and geopolitical factors. Regardless of these challenges, we will execute and deliver growth above-market entitlements. The short cycle and decentralized nature of our business supports quick adaptation and alignment to shifting conditions. And we will course-correct quickly and effectively when needed. Our balance sheet has ample capacity to support our M&A strategy as well as organic reinvestment. Our extended M&A and strategy team continues to build conviction around our best opportunities, and our funnel is strong and of high quality. We've also identified areas where we will deploy capital organically to expand capacity, capture market share and drive operational productivity. IDEX had a strong finish to an outstanding year in 2022. Our agility, resiliency and our fundamental ability to execute has IDEX exceptionally well positioned to outperform as we move forward.  With that, I'll turn it over to Bill to discuss the outlook for our segments on Page 7.\nWilliam Grogan: Thanks, Eric. In our Fluid & Metering Technology segment, industrial day rates were steady in the fourth quarter, and we expect they remain at this level in the near term with strong price support. We've seen initial signs that customers are returning to a book-and-bill order pattern, consistent with pre-pandemic behavior. We continue to monitor day rates to evaluate longer-term expectations as this is our most short-cycle market exposure. We expect another strong year in agricultural business with strong farmer sentiment and high crop prices. We continue to see positive signals from both our OEMs and distributors and a trend towards investing in precision technologies as a means of mitigating higher input costs. We are on our next phase of process automation at Banjo and see continued improvement in delivery and efficiencies putting us in a good position to capture share. Our outlook for our municipal water business continues to be favorable. The healthy quoting activity we experienced over the past few quarters is expected to translate into 2023 growth. And we continue to identify opportunities to leverage our technology to capture new programs. The EPA just received record funding and the Infrastructure Bill could provide a tailwind in the back half of the year. The chemical markets overall are soft. We see opportunities for growth in U.S. green energies and strong project activity in the Middle East, but this is offset by softer European demand due to higher energy costs and cuts to production capacity. In our energy business, we see favorable demand for energy exports and natural gas production as well as continued oil price support. However, customers continue to delay larger investments as they focus on cost, inventory and supply chain issues. The strong price capture and productivity achieved in 2022 as well as new pricing actions in '23 will continue to drive improvements in FMT margins with some risk of offset from lost volume leverage, depending on the second half volumes. Moving on to the Health & Science Technology segment. We expect HST to remain our highest growth segment. Our life sciences and analytical instrumentation businesses will continue to grow in '23 due to strong next-gen sequencing applications and continued expansion of cell-based therapies in various chromatography and mass spec applications. In the short term, however, several of our OEM customers are holding excess inventory, driving volume out of the first quarter and into the balance of the year. We believe this is a short-term issue, and the overall market outlook remains extremely positive for this sector. Our targeted growth initiatives tied to a wide variety of applications from satellites and space, to energy-efficient fuel cells continue to perform well, and our industrial businesses are seeing market trends similar to FMTs. We are seeing some slowing in semiconductor market, driven by higher memory device inventory levels and declining customer chip spending. Fabrication spending and new fab construction are both expected to be down for the year. That said, we provide critical consumable components for a large installed base, which tends to be more stable despite end market and CapEx cycles. Where we play in the market and our recent share gains are expected to drive continued outperformance versus the broader market. We are seeing overall signs of slowing demand in pharma and biopharma, particularly around larger projects. Customers are hesitant to make larger investments given inflation and higher interest rates. India continues to accelerate and the easing of China restrictions could drive growth and recovery in the region to offset some. Lastly, our auto business is expected to perform well. Global auto production is stable, and our presence in premium vehicle segments in EV and hybrids is driving a faster recovery as compared to the overall market. HST margins will expand in '23 due to pricing, productivity and volume, partially offset by continued reinvestment in our highest growth businesses and some mix headwinds in the short term due to expected life science AI demand patterns. Finally, we expect our Fire Safety and Diversified Products segment will experience growth towards the lower end of our guided range. In fire safety, U.S. and European fire OEM volumes remain constrained by supply chain and throughput issues, but backlogs are strong and volumes are steady. We expect continued share gain with smaller builders that are coming online to capture surplus demand. Our rescue business remains positive with strong NPD, and we continue to leverage our integrated model to drive distribution growth. We expect our Banjo business to continue to outperform across industrial, automotive and energy markets as it leverages its inventory and differentiation to capture share. Finally, our dispensing business has achieved strong results for the last 2 years, but will be down in 2023, driven by lower North American project volume as customer equipment refresh cycles approach their final innings. We continue to see growth in India, offset by some moderating demand in Europe and Southeast Asia. For the segment, we expect price cost and operational productivity will drive margin expansion with some offset for mix as we see lower dispensing project volume in the segment. With that, I'll discuss our financial results. Moving on to our consolidated financial results on Slide 9. Q4 orders of $803 million, were up 1% overall and up 1% organically. We experienced continued orders growth in FMT, driven by strong water and energy results and an FSD due to strong fire and rescue orders as well as the receipt of a large project order for dispensing in the quarter. HST orders were down 8%, mainly due to the life science and AI OEM orders and softer semi demand I highlighted earlier. For the year, orders were up 8% overall and up 5% organically. We experienced positive orders growth across all 3 of our segments. Fourth quarter sales of $811 million, were up 13% overall and up 12% organically. We experienced nearly 20% organic growth in HST and strong growth across both FMT and FSD. Full year sales of $3.2 billion, were up 15% overall and up 13% organically. We saw strong double-digit growth across FMT and HST and 9% growth in FSD. Q4 margin contracted by 140 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 and adjusted gross margin of 43.6% contracted by 40 basis points. This was driven by unfavorable mix within HST and FSD, the dilutive impact of acquisitions, employee-related inflation and unfavorable productivity in HST, partially offset by volume leverage and strong price cost. For the full year, gross margins expanded by 50 basis points, and adjusted gross margins expanded by 10 basis points to 44.8%, primarily driven by strong volume leverage, positive price/cost and productivity, more than offsetting employee-related inflation and engineering resource investments. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27%, up 10 basis points versus 2021. A bridge of Q4 adjusted EBITDA as well as Q4 adjusted operating income can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Full year adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.9%, is up 20 basis points versus 2021's adjusted EBITDA of 27.7%. This represents record profitability for IDEX. I will discuss the drivers of full year adjusted EBITDA on the next slide. Our Q4 effective tax rate of 20.5%, decreased versus last year's effective tax rate of 22.5%, primarily due to tax benefits realized as we recognize certain foreign currency impacts for tax purposes with the funding of the Muon Group acquisition. Our full year effective tax rate of 21.7% also included tax benefits from the sale of our Knight business and was down from the 2021 effective tax rate of 22.5%. Fourth quarter net income was $130 million, which resulted in an EPS of $1.71 Adjusted net income was $153 million, with an adjusted EPS of $2.01, which was up $0.30 or 18% over prior year. Full year net income was $587 million, which resulted in an EPS of $7.71. Adjusted net income was $618 million, resulting in an EPS of $8.12, up $1.25 or 18% over prior year adjusted EPS. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $147 million, 96% of adjusted net income, mainly driven by improved working capital performance. For the year, free cash flow was $489 million, down 1% versus last year and coming in at 79% of adjusted net income. mainly driven by higher net working capital, partly offset by higher income. As we exit the year, we made progress in reducing core business inventories and have momentum behind us to continue to drive further reduction into next year. Moving on to Slide 10, which details the drivers of our total year adjusted EBITDA. Full year adjusted EBITDA increased $119 million compared to 2021 and Our 13% organic growth contributed approximately $91 million flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. We levered well on the volume increase and had record price capture to offset record inflation. Price/cost was accretive to margins and has returned to historic levels. As we exited the year, all 3 of our segments posted positive price/cost results. We drove operational productivity to offset supply chain-driven inefficiencies and realized the benefits of our energy and Italian site consolidations. Mix was a small positive for the year. We saw unfavorable mix pressure in the fourth quarter of about $3 million that were reversed a majority of the year-to-date favorability. We invested $20 million taking in the form of engineering and commercial resources in the business and M&A and diversity equity inclusion resources in corporate. Tracking to the lower end of the $0.20 to $0.25 of full year spend we highlighted at the beginning of the year. Discretionary spending increased by $25 million versus last year, closer to the high end of the $0.20 to $0.25 range on significantly higher sales than our original guide. We exited the year with a solid 30% organic flow-through. ABEL, Nexsight, KZValve and Muon acquisitions, net of the Knight divestiture and FX contributed an additional $14 million of adjusted EBITDA. Inclusive of acquisitions, divestitures and FX, we also delivered 30% flow-through. With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2023. I'm on Slide 11. We expect full year organic revenue growth to be in the range of 1% to 5%. This range reflects the uncertainty in the second half of the year given the short-cycle nature of our business. This organic growth rate equates to $0.12 to $0.60 depending on the top line results. This range includes price cost, which we anticipate will be positive for the year and some mix pressure stemming from HST and dispensing volume in FSD. We expect that our operational productivity will more than offset pressure from employee-related wage and benefits inflation. We operated in a challenging supply chain environment in 2022, and we expect the easing of these conditions as well as driving our own internal productivity funnel will deliver $0.06 to $0.08 of net productivity for the year. In 2022, we returned to a more sustainable level of discretionary spending post-pandemic and invested in the people needed to drive our strategy. Travel and external services did not fully rebound until the second quarter of 2022. And we hired an increasing rate as we move through the year. Although our spend is only moderately increased versus our 4Q exit rate, we'll see pressure of approximately $0.09 on a year-over-year basis. This impact is entirely felt in the first quarter of 2023. Although not to the same level as in 2022, we will continue to invest for the future. People, new products as well as applications for existing products, and these investments will provide up to $0.20 of pressure in 2023, depending on top line results. The range indicates how we will focus on resource allocation and an uncertain period and dial in our investments appropriately. Net of the divestiture of our Knight business last year, we expect acquisitions to contribute $168 million of revenue and $0.43 of EPS. Now let's look at a couple of non-operational items. Interest expense associated with the Muon acquisition represents a headwind of $0.12, and we expect FX to be a small impact, providing $0.02 of EPS pressure. So in summary, we are projecting organic revenue growth of 1% to 5% for the year, adjusted EPS expectations are in the range of $8.50 to $8.80, a 5% to 8% growth over 2022. The midpoint of our guidance implies a solid 30% adjusted EBITDA flow-through. Moving on to Slide 12. We I'll now provide some additional details regarding our 2023 guidance for both the first quarter and full year. In the first quarter, we are projecting GAAP EPS to range from $1.74 to $1.79 and adjusted EPS to range from $1.98 to $2.03, with organic revenue of 3% to 5% and adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 27%. Our guidance includes $0.07 of pressure from accelerated recognition of share-based compensation as well as a delay in HST OEM shipments to the latter part of the second quarter that is lowering our organic growth expectations for the quarter. These factors, plus the carryover item I mentioned on the previous slide, mutes our year-over-year flow-through for the quarter, but expect to deliver solid flow-through for the year. Turning to the full year 2023. We project GAAP EPS of $7.55 to $7.85 and adjusted EPS to range from $8.50 to $8.80. We expect full year organic revenue growth of 1% to 5% and adjusted EBITDA margins to be 28% or higher. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be about $70 million, in line with 2022 spending as we continue to identify opportunities to reinvest in our core businesses. And free cash flow is expected to be 100-plus percent of adjusted net income.  With that, I'll turn it back to Eric.\nEric Ashleman : Thanks, Bill. I'm on the final slide, Slide 13. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to wrap up with a summary of our 2023 focus areas. First, we are refocusing our efforts on a foundational set of practices and tools that link us together the IDEX operating model as we exit 2 intense years of double-digit organic growth within an environment of temporal barriers and obstacles. This is a year to double down on the core execution elements that make us an excellent company. The use of daily management, monthly business reviews, goal deployment and other tools have long been a source of efficiency, innovation and growth for IDEX as market conditions, particularly within supply chains, begin to return to historic norms, we must seize the opportunity to optimize our process-driven fundamental business practices to best support future growth and outperformance. Second, we are committed to growing our talent at an even faster rate to fuel future IDEX growth. Our excellent execution is led by incredible leaders around the world who are committed to our core values to developing top-performing talent and creating an inspiring company culture that attracts and retains the best people. Diversity, equity and inclusion continues to be an area of focus, creating environments where people feel they belong and are comfortable bringing their true selves to work each and every day. One talent note I want to address is the recent departure of Melissa Aquino. If you recall from our last session together, I introduced her as the new leader of the FMT and FSD segments. Melissa made a difficult decision to go back to a previous employer to take an opportunity she felt she could not pass up. We wish her well in her new endeavors and continue the search for her replacement. In the meantime, the gap has allowed me to step in, get closer to our businesses and spend time with an outstanding group of business leaders. Lastly, we've deployed $1.5 billion over the last 2 years on high-quality growth businesses, and we look forward to deploying additional capital in 2023. Our M&A teams have made tremendous progress identifying compelling portfolio extensions. Our funnel is in the best shape it's been over my tenure at IDEX and our strong operating cash flow and balance sheet put us in a great position to continue to capitalize on those opportunities. Although the short-term economic picture might be uncertain, I could not be more excited as I consider the next few years of our story. I believe we're headed into an extended period of growth and above-market performance fueled by a combination of technology-driven tailwinds and our own high-quality business potential. Our businesses are first rate, our teams are outstanding, our culture is special.  With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak : I just want to go back to your comment on optimizing processes and how we should think about that inventory is certainly a one that's been a target just because you've had to build it up to deal with some of the supply chain issues. But maybe a little bit more color about how you're thinking about that.\nEric Ashleman: Yes. And that's probably the area with the best example. We're coming off an environment where a lot of even the best intentional processes kind of turn into chasing things, looking for parts and waiting for the truck to come in at noon, all of that kind of stuff. So as that moderates and gets better, we just want to be intentional to make sure that we're going back and putting in those process-based fundamentals, the right people in the right room, having the right kind of conversations. That's actually how we're going to -- we frankly made a nice turn here in the fourth quarter on inventory. We got a long way to go, but we're really excited about that potential for us moving forward. But I think it's just -- I think everybody should be very thoughtful of recognizing that the way things have worked the last couple of years, if you're not intentional about reorienting it back to something that operates in a higher plane, it's going to lag. And so we're taking that opportunity.\nAllison Poliniak : Got it. And then just turning to free cash flow, still a little bit below historical performance for IDEX in terms of that conversion. Is it really just that inventory holding it back? I would say, what would be the lever to drive it higher at this point and sort of back to normal for you guys?\nWilliam Grogan: Yes. So in the fourth quarter, we talked to the third quarter inventory stabilized. It wasn't a detriment to cash flow. Here in the fourth quarter, it added about $20 million of free cash flow, the movement we made on our position, and we continue to see that momentum. I think we've got line of sight to a half a turn to a full turn of inventory improvements as we progress through the year. It will be a significant driver of our cash flow performance as we go from, obviously, less than historical averages on our free cash flow conversion to last year being 100-plus percent, which will yield somewhere between 30% and 40% increase in free cash flow year-over-year. So I think that's a huge win as we progress through the year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird.\nMichael Halloran : So a couple of questions here. First on the guidance. Obviously, the commentary on the first quarter and some pushouts, plus a lot of the commentary about basically expected volatility through the year. How have you cadence that guidance? Is it relative to normal seasonality? I mean how do you think about first half, back half versus a normal year? Not that we've had a lot of normal years lately, but any kind of context you give to how you're thinking about what that cadencing looks like and how much kind of caution maybe you've put in there given what that backdrop looks like?\nWilliam Grogan: Yes. I think we're generally first half, second half is fairly close, 49, 50, 51, 49, something like that. So this year, I think the implied guide is a stronger first half with volume starting to decline in the back half. We've got pretty strong price carryover and price capture that will put in place here in the first quarter that will carry at least the price side. And then just the implied volumes in the back half are down somewhere between 2% to 4%.\nMichael Halloran : Great. That's helpful. Makes sense. And then the comment on order volatility expected is the -- essentially the booking to shipment time period compresses or return to normal. Are you essentially suggesting that you're going to be seeing some pretty volatile order patterns in a year, but maybe a little bit more linear demand patterns as we work through the year relative to the kind of front half, back half comments you just made, Bill? Is that basically a warning sign for -- in your view for what those order rates might be, but don't over extrapolate relative to the underlying demand?\nWilliam Grogan: Yes. No, I think that's well said. I mean it's a recalibration year, just like we had dynamic recalibration on the way up and recovery from the pandemic and supply chain issues and things like that, stimulus. Now we -- I think we're going to be returning to more normal patterns. But given the nature of IDEX, that's liable to play out at differentiated rates. So we see some more of it, as you'd expect, in some of those OEM-centric markets within HST, where we're a lot closer to the customer. It's more high velocity anyways. And you can see a bit of a pause there to take a breath, take some inventory out of their system. And then those are healthy markets on the other side of them. Some of our industrial businesses that are a little further away from the end customer, lots of distribution between us and them, lots more fragmentation. I think you'll see some of those same things play out over time, but probably a little further down the road. And so what we're kind of expecting here is that from a high level, you'll see things return to more normal rates were off in the backlog or the order rates and the sales rates are pretty tightly linked for us, unless we're sort of beginning or ending the cycle. But I think that what's a little unusual here is just the way it will play out. The nature of it, given just the differentiated pockets of IDEX, and so we're prepared for all of that. What we're trying to do on one side is look at it, adjust to it, course correct, but then always looking on the other side so that we don't over interpret something in the short end. Think it means something that's sustainable for 2, 3 years when it doesn't, and we keep resources aligned in places that have the best growth prospects for us.\nMichael Halloran : Appreciate that. One quick one, just a clarification. Slide 7 with the arrows within the range. Are those arrows implying high end and lower of the range for the HST and FSD? Or are you suggesting a little bit above, a little bit below and then the green clarification?\nWilliam Grogan: Yes, exactly. HST on the high end of the range, FMT in the middle and then FSD at the lower end of the range.\nMichael Halloran : Got it. But still the range.\nOperator: Our next question is from Nathan Jones with Stifel.\nNathan Jones: I'm just going to -- I'm going to follow up on Mike's question -- last question there and follow up on this recalibration of orders and things like that. IDEX doesn't typically have a lot of inventory, a lot of channels. But I'm sure there are some pockets of the business where there are some inventory in new channels. How are you thinking about the potential for your customers to destock some of their inventory and for that to be a pause in demand for you guys? Is that something that you baked into that down 2% to 4% volume in the second half?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. I mean there's definitely some of that in there. I think, as you know, we're kind of low on the food chain. We do a lot of component work for people who then turn it into subsystems in terms of the final system. So at any point, along that food chain, there's the potential for accumulation and then frankly, the normalization of it along the way. I think what we're thinking about, though, is when you think of how order patterns are generated many of them are actually done in an automated way. There actually isn't a lot of human intervention. And the two factors that drive it, the most are, of course, lead times and whether or not they're pulling in, and we're seeing that. We're seeing that kind of across the supply base. We're experiencing as well. A factor a lot of people don't consider as much though is volatility or variability. And so even when lead times are pulling in, if you still have an inability to count on it, it will tend to keep driving higher demand requirements throughout the system. So we're kind of monitoring both of those. And as any one of them comes to something more normal, almost always, you're going to see an impact on that on the other side for a short cycle business like ourselves. I don't think it's a massive number because, as you say, most of the things we make are customized and they don't stock well anyways. But we're coming off a pretty robust time here. I do think this calibration matters. It will play out over time through much of IDEX. Again, I think the focus for us is to understand it make sure that our own inventory positions and resources are calibrated right, but then be very, very focused on end market demand, what's driving that, what's the actual consumption rate on the other side because that ultimately is what you want to dial in to.\nNathan Jones: I think maybe the question on supply chain. I think over the last couple of years, generally, all of these lead times have stretched out. But for IDEX's businesses, the delays have really been up your supply chain because you buy these highly value-added components. So there's a number of steps for them to go through. And as they compress, that's compressing the order to ship time. So can you talk about where your supply chain is relative to where it was in 2019 chain? How much better it's got, how much there is still to go? And what your general assumption is now for getting back to something like normal? Does it happen in '23? Does it happen in '24?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. Sure. I mean, I would say, in general, it's improved a lot and pretty close to where we were in 2019 with a few commodity exceptions. I'd put probably put electronics still at the top of that list. But frankly, we're not the most electronics intensive business. So it matters, but it's not widespread across the company. I think I would also remind everybody on the call, we have a lot of local supply. So we're typically dealing with people we've known a long time that are not far away all through the kind of the worst of it. In many cases, we were helping them. We were kind of sending people over to figure things out, help improve their flow. It's those kind of relationships. So -- and given that, that sort of topology, these are the kind of companies that can course correct a little better and generally have. I would say we're not yet normalized to 2019 levels all across IDEX. We're definitely past the halfway line. So depending on how the year plays out, you could see us basically articulating a normal condition, I think, closer to year-end, certainly as we begin the next year, absent any other force that we can't see.\nOperator: Our next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: I was hoping we could unpack the margins in HST. I know you gave some of the color in the prepared remarks. You certainly had the top line. And -- but you didn't get the margin read-through. It's unlike price/cost was positive. You gave some of the other data points. Was mix a factor? Just -- and how much of this was temporary versus how you expect it to play out the rest of this year?\nWilliam Grogan: Yes. I think there's 3 things there, Deane. One, we continue to face some of the inefficiencies. We talked about here as we progress through the back half of the year. Some of those businesses have grown 20% and still calibrating on some of the manufacturability of some of this cutting-edge technology that they have. Two was some mix within the portfolio. We talked about some of the short-term OEM pushouts. A lot of that has been kind of our book and ship components that are higher margin. And then the last one, just the addition of Muon, they were only in the portfolio for a month. They were shut down to do a full physical inventory that, that diluted margins a little bit. The Muon on will go away in the first quarter. I think we're making progress on the productivity piece, but the mix, I think, is still a component that we'll experience in the first quarter. Yes, so we've got the volume impact and then that mix carrying through at least through the next 3 months.\nDeane Dray: Got it. That's helpful. And just expectations on price cost into '23. Is there more pricing initiatives you need to put through? Or is this all-carryover benefit?\nWilliam Grogan: No. We've got carryover and the incremental pricing actions that we took to kick off the year. Obviously, that's part of our normal process and cadence to continue to capture the value for our products. So I think we're in a really good position from a price cost. We said in the fourth quarter, we're back to historic levels, and we think that will continue here as we progress through the year. If something were to change, obviously, we go back to the customers with an incremental increase, but we're well positioned here as we kick off the year.\nDeane Dray: Great. Just last question, I'm not sure how specific you can get, and I really appreciate the prepared remarks and some of the earlier questions about fleshing out the transition period year. Just right from the supply chain normalizing changes, order behavior, we get that. But we just saw the ISM taking another step down, orders another step down. With all your short-cycle businesses, this is a great canary in a coal mine company to like gauge lead time changes, and you've given fabulous color here. If we total up the collection of soft pockets of business, is this a demand deterioration you're seeing broadly? Could it be the early signs of it? Or do you feel like these are more temporary? Just kind of step back and say, okay, from seeing these trends, how does it look to you for the businesses that you touch play out for the course of the next couple of quarters?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. I'd say, Deane, it's still pretty early. I mean everything we're kind of talking about here near term that there was some exposure in Q4 and some carry into Q1. That's very much a temporal condition and otherwise very active and strong markets where you can see, hey, people are taking a pause for all the reasons that you just suggested. Those bellwethers that we have on the industrial side, most of which their order side is coming through the small order flow side, honestly, those are holding up. We're simply, in some cases, projecting that if you combine a couple of things, we kind of know where those inventory levels are, we know how they think about planning, we know where we are from a lead time perspective. We're saying at some point, we expect we'll have some of that moderation there, but it really isn't in front of us as we sit here today. And then back half of the year is more of a macro call than anything else as we think about kind of floor and top end of the range for all of IDEX. So I think your question is helpful because it helps us kind of parse that we'll at least put out there, hey, we're seeing some of these things from an early indication standpoint, but most of them are in a temporal spot. We can imagine some things that would be bigger pieces of IDEX, more industrial in nature that would kind of follow the same calibration. And then ultimately, like everyone else, we're kind of thinking about where does the future go back half of the year, it's more of a macro question.\nDeane Dray: Yes. That's exactly the color I was looking for. Very helpful.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.\nRobert Wertheimer : Your order commentary has been very clear and helpful. And I appreciate it. I'm sorry to sneak in one more on it. But just in general, HST, a vertical that had more excess inventory given some of the, the disruptions across the whole vertical. And then do you have a sense that supply chain has actually gotten a lot better or orders like coming in as people anticipated getting better? I'm just wondering if that's already happened, where people can feel more confidence in lead times, I guess, across the businesses, or whether it's an anticipation of that? And then I had an M&A question, if I could.\nEric Ashleman: Okay. Well, I think the first question, I wouldn't say that those businesses in the HST world, have more inventory. I would say that they have more sophisticated planning. I think that we've typically seen in any cycle, there's just -- they're bigger organizations, they're a little bit more formal, they're usually a little quicker to react to cycles. And when they do it, that's a more of a concentrated industry anyways. So it tends to be kind of amplified that way. So there's nothing that tells me that somehow that they're sitting on more than anywhere else. And it's in any way, frankly, unusual from some other patterns we've seen when things change. So I'd say that's number one. Remind me again on the second question, I want to make sure I get the exact essence. You talked about supply chain confidence.\nRobert Wertheimer: Exactly. Yes. So whether spy chain has already gotten better and that lets people have more confidence in lead times and thus destock a bit or whether that's not happened yet?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. No, again, I think, think of it as 2 variables. One is lead time compression, that's absolute. And I think people are seeing that. They're seeing that quoted to them when they call and ask about things. I would say the second component that I mentioned that is important, though, is the performance against those quotations. Neither one of them yet are kind of back to where they need to be. They're both improved, but they both work together. And frankly, that second piece, the one about sort of assurance and delivery against commitments, has a huge psychological impact. And I think it's one of the -- I think it's actually the more powerful of the two. So if people say, hey, it's still longer, but I know I'm going to get it exactly want to ask for it, they'll actually make that move in a more fundamental way. If they're still getting surprised from time to time, that tends to fuel a little bit of this. I'm going to keep some things, I'm going to protect some things. So both are moving. And as we continue to talk through the year, you'll hear us talk about both sides of that.\nRobert Wertheimer: That was very helpful. Just in general, we've had, I think, a reasonably solid level of deal activity you guys have done great over the last year. Your characterization of buyers market just among potential targets for acquisition and whether PE matters for you guys and whether there's less intense competition there. And I will stop.\nEric Ashleman: Yes. I mean -- so in general, our story is a good one here. I mean we've had some good performance over the last couple of years, some great businesses we brought in. I've talked from time to time about the intention of work we've done to sort of build strategic conviction in a really, really formal way that contributes to the basic business intelligence that we have from all the businesses across IDEX. So the things that we control are in a great spot. As we think of them engaging with the outside world, we've always been careful to help people understand that we're fishing in a very high-quality universe that I think, in some ways, holds up and it doesn't move around as much in terms of valuations and even timing of transactions, particularly to do this work well. So -- on the PE front, they're often competing with us for properties like this. They too are attracted to companies like this. And I will say it's probably a little less activity competitively there or people that have been able to raise funding and be in the game. But we've long aspired with this work that we're doing to sort of be ahead of that anyway with cultivation on a proprietary nature, talking to people that we meet at the trade shows, those kind of things so that we're not actually in kind of a classic bake-off with lots of people anyways. It's an efficient market, so it doesn't always happen when it does. I think the dynamic around PE activity is absolutely true. Valuations overall still pretty rich because, again, we're looking for high-quality companies like the last 3 that we've brought into the business.\nOperator: Our next question is from Scott Graham with Loop Capital Markets.\nScott Graham : And Eric, thank you for all that transparency that was great. So the question is -- maybe I missed it because I was writing away because you talk -- saying so many things. Did you tell us what pricing was in the quarter?\nWilliam Grogan: No, no one asked it. It was over 5%.\nScott Graham : And the gap was it that still about like 50-ish?\nWilliam Grogan: On price cost?\nScott Graham : Yes.\nWilliam Grogan: Yes. We said it was back to our historical level, so right around there.\nScott Graham : Okay. And then the carryover for next year, can you tell us what that would be?\nWilliam Grogan: Yes. I mean overall price next year is somewhere around 3% to 4%, about half of it is carryover.\nScott Graham : Got it. So I was just wondering also with the -- thank you, Bill. I was just wondering also with the step-down in the first quarter organic, is that mostly FMT and maybe secondarily, FSD in the organic?\nWilliam Grogan: No, it's mostly HST. We highlighted just some of the temporal moves from some of the OEMs as they recalibrate order patterns and inventory levels, that's the major driver.\nScott Graham : Okay. And then I guess my sort of last question here is also on the M&A environment, I mean, in the past, you guys have sort of talked about what's available and a little bit about the funnel. Is there anything more you can say than what you've already said on M&A? Is that still the spreads been kind of coming in a little bit? Or anything changed?\nEric Ashleman: No. I mean, as I said just a minute ago that we're still looking for high-quality properties. Those valuations tend to hold up over time. because of the long track record usually predating our conversation and the expectation you'll have a good trail on the other side. I just think from an availability front, we've got more than ample capacity, even though we've deployed a lot over the last 2 years. The great part of being IDEXX is we generate that capacity each and every day. And then I think our targets, we really have not changed. We kind of are comfortable with a band of about $0.5 billion to $1 billion. And if long considered that to be a good target for us here in the next couple of years, sort of regardless of the cycle and they're generating all the right work to go realize that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer & Company.\nBryan Blair: I was wondering if you could offer a little more of a profile on the lung group, maybe a rough breakout of key end market exposures across semi, med tech, food and beverage and others. -- where historical growth rates have been -- how the current market environment impacts '23 expectations and where there's the greatest opportunity to extend or accelerate growth within the IDEXX portfolio going forward?\nWilliam Grogan: Brian, we said about 2/3 of the business is in those major categories you started with on the medical, semi and food side, the balance in a variety of different applications. We've said it's grown at double digits here the last several years. It's got line of sight to continue to do that here as we progress even with some of the noise out there in the semicon market, where they play in this space is still healthy. They've got innovative technology that they continue to roll out. So we remain bullish on their growth profile both on core products and some of the NPD applications that we've gotten to know a little bit more as we progress through the last couple of months of our ownership.\nEric Ashleman: And then really past that, I mean, we did say there's some customer points that we have that they don't have that over time, we think, are interesting and we could exploit those. And that's very interesting things on the kind of codevelopment fronts, but the cycle of those are going to be further out in the future. So this always kind of was a game of capitalizing on the near-term strength and success of that business in those markets with sort of this additive element that we're going to work over time to enrich it with all the IDEXX assets.\nBryan Blair: Definitely makes sense. And given the composition of Man Group, the -- from what I can see at least 5 businesses, I'm not certain divisions or platforms they're in. Are there any unique aspects of integration that you would call out? And I guess just to level set, obviously, this is a growth opportunity. But are there cost synergies?\nEric Ashleman: I mean, not so much within the IDEXX topology and things like that. I mean some certain things we do to leverage back office and being part of the company. But it's not kind of a classic story of us kind of putting things together and moving plants around. The -- as you often see in businesses like this, I mean a lot of that technology is resident in people. I think the single biggest lever that we anticipate pulling here absent that 1 is 80-20. I mean it's just the implementation of that model. And I can absolutely assure you their profile is very IDEX-like out of the gate, which means there are opportunities there to streamline and simplify it.\nBryan Blair: Okay. Excellent. And 1 last one, if I can. You've called out an increase in project activity in municipal water. -- over recent quarters, there's obviously a lot of funding for domestic projects. Are you willing to offer some finer points on that front? How much the project funnel has expanded anticipated 2023 growth? Anything along those lines?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. I mean it's -- of course, it manifests itself across a series of franchises and very kind of different technologies that we have. So I would probably just roll back to very, very positive. The quote activity has been strong here at the end of last year continues into this year for all of the dynamics that you're citing, everything from EPA funding and enforcement possibilities, which has always been a catalyst for the businesses that we own now. as well as broader infrastructure support over time, which always takes a little longer to land but also has a potential to extend some of the growth time frames that we're thinking about into the future. So we're well positioned. We're continuing to kind of work those assets together. And then -- and this is an area of focus for us as we think about deploying some capital to.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brett Linzey with Mizuho Americas.\nBrett Linzey : Just wanted to come back to the excess OEM inventory comment. Any sense in terms of months or weeks of inventory on hand at those OEs that needs to get worked down? And then -- any color or specific product customer segments that you're referring to there?\nWilliam Grogan: No. I think from a segment, I think it's most of -- we described within some of the comments within our life sciences and total instrumentation, the folks in that group from a magnitude perspective on what they're holding in from inventory, I wouldn't speak to that other than just conversations with them, there is a calibration period that we're going through. As Eric highlighted earlier in the call, this isn't atypical to what we've seen historically we've gone through really robust cycles of growth. There is a quarter or 2 of recalibration to normalize and then back off. I think as you hear any of the external commentary for those large customers, they are still bullish on their equipment deliveries and the growth that they're going to see in 2023.\nBrett Linzey : All right. Makes sense. And then just shifting to the resource investment you contemplated for the guide. $0 to $0.20. I mean certainly a wide range given the macro and understand that. But historically, I'd say IDEX consistently invested regardless of the state of the environment. What type of situation really drives you to that lower end? And then maybe just a little color on some of the various projects that are being contemplated there.\nEric Ashleman: Absolutely. We always think of investing and investing for the future and investing to grow. One of the great things about a company like ours, though, is we can move things around sideways. -- a lot to help us kind of hit the lower end of that range and still make the right choices for the right businesses. And so whenever you see us talking about stuff like a 0, it's actually still very dynamic here. it's just to be candid, we would take businesses that are in softer parts of the universe, and we would quite intentionally like pull those down, lead them out a lot. And redistribute those costs elsewhere to parts of IDEXX that are stronger, sometimes literally taking the same people. and putting them over in stronger parts of IDEXX. So we actually have that nice optionality down at the lower end of the range, but keeps it all moving and allows us to kind of weather a storm if it happens.\nOperator: And our final question is from Joe Giordano with Cowen and Company.\nJoseph Giordano: Just a couple of follow-ups on orders here. So if I look at HST, obviously, the orders there on an organic basis, the weakest across the portfolio, but the growth for the year on revenue expected to be the best. Like -- so when -- at what point kind of as you get through the year, do you need to see orders start to stabilize or start accelerating again before like you get a little bit more concerned about the organic revenue profile going forward.\nWilliam Grogan: Yes. I think we have a while. HST is our biggest backlog. They've built the most backlog out of the 3 segments. So really comfortable with their position here as we go through the first half of the year. We said this calibration on the OEM inventory levels is generally a quarter maybe it spreads into the second. So we're confident that we're going to see that start to pick up and move as we progress into the back half of the year.\nJoseph Giordano: And then similar on FMT -- sorry, on diversified dispensing is a headwind this year on a revenue basis, but it looks like orders kind of picked back up to almost essentially peak levels that you saw like a year ago. So are you starting to see that? Like do you feel more comfortable about the visibility? Are those like 24 orders, I guess, essentially for dispensing that you're getting on.\nWilliam Grogan: No, the Q4 we got for dispensing will book in the second and third quarter of this year. Yes, Dispensing orders were up 25%, but their sales were down 20-plus percent in the fourth quarter. So this is -- that was the 1 last order to give us kind of the full set of visibility to still reasonable performance, but down, that's going to mask a little bit of the strong organic growth that we expect from Fire & Safety and Bandon next year.\nJoseph Giordano: You'd expect the dispensing orders to move back down --\nWilliam Grogan: I mean, sorry, verified orders to move back down from like fourth quarter levels.\nJoseph Giordano: Yes. Yes, definitely.\nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing comments.\nEric Ashleman : Okay. Well, thank you all for joining and listening to our story. And I know there were a lot of moving pieces there in an environment that's got some pluses and minuses and things that are playing out. So I'll keep this really, really simple. I want to, again, thank all the folks from IDEXX. 2022 was a great year. I mean really, really outstanding year, incredible growth, focused on the right things, getting capital to work, and we grew our people, we grew our culture. I think 2020, this is going to be an equally great year, and it really sets us up for the future to come. We talked a little bit in my last framing comments there about the power of execution. We're really excited about that. We think we've got a chance here to go establish even a little bit more competitive advantage as we jump on this and recalibrate to the world to come. So we're all over it. We're doing that actively. And then just as passionately, we've got a number of teams that are thinking about the future, what comes in 5 years, what comes in 10 years, and we're going to make the choices that we have to to capitalize on those too. So -- thanks for your support and interest, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "William Grogan",
            "content": "Thanks, Eric. In our Fluid & Metering Technology segment, industrial day rates were steady in the fourth quarter, and we expect they remain at this level in the near term with strong price support. We've seen initial signs that customers are returning to a book-and-bill order pattern, consistent with pre-pandemic behavior. We continue to monitor day rates to evaluate longer-term expectations as this is our most short-cycle market exposure. We expect another strong year in agricultural business with strong farmer sentiment and high crop prices. We continue to see positive signals from both our OEMs and distributors and a trend towards investing in precision technologies as a means of mitigating higher input costs. We are on our next phase of process automation at Banjo and see continued improvement in delivery and efficiencies putting us in a good position to capture share. Our outlook for our municipal water business continues to be favorable. The healthy quoting activity we experienced over the past few quarters is expected to translate into 2023 growth. And we continue to identify opportunities to leverage our technology to capture new programs. The EPA just received record funding and the Infrastructure Bill could provide a tailwind in the back half of the year. The chemical markets overall are soft. We see opportunities for growth in U.S. green energies and strong project activity in the Middle East, but this is offset by softer European demand due to higher energy costs and cuts to production capacity. In our energy business, we see favorable demand for energy exports and natural gas production as well as continued oil price support. However, customers continue to delay larger investments as they focus on cost, inventory and supply chain issues. The strong price capture and productivity achieved in 2022 as well as new pricing actions in '23 will continue to drive improvements in FMT margins with some risk of offset from lost volume leverage, depending on the second half volumes. Moving on to the Health & Science Technology segment. We expect HST to remain our highest growth segment. Our life sciences and analytical instrumentation businesses will continue to grow in '23 due to strong next-gen sequencing applications and continued expansion of cell-based therapies in various chromatography and mass spec applications. In the short term, however, several of our OEM customers are holding excess inventory, driving volume out of the first quarter and into the balance of the year. We believe this is a short-term issue, and the overall market outlook remains extremely positive for this sector. Our targeted growth initiatives tied to a wide variety of applications from satellites and space, to energy-efficient fuel cells continue to perform well, and our industrial businesses are seeing market trends similar to FMTs. We are seeing some slowing in semiconductor market, driven by higher memory device inventory levels and declining customer chip spending. Fabrication spending and new fab construction are both expected to be down for the year. That said, we provide critical consumable components for a large installed base, which tends to be more stable despite end market and CapEx cycles. Where we play in the market and our recent share gains are expected to drive continued outperformance versus the broader market. We are seeing overall signs of slowing demand in pharma and biopharma, particularly around larger projects. Customers are hesitant to make larger investments given inflation and higher interest rates. India continues to accelerate and the easing of China restrictions could drive growth and recovery in the region to offset some. Lastly, our auto business is expected to perform well. Global auto production is stable, and our presence in premium vehicle segments in EV and hybrids is driving a faster recovery as compared to the overall market. HST margins will expand in '23 due to pricing, productivity and volume, partially offset by continued reinvestment in our highest growth businesses and some mix headwinds in the short term due to expected life science AI demand patterns. Finally, we expect our Fire Safety and Diversified Products segment will experience growth towards the lower end of our guided range. In fire safety, U.S. and European fire OEM volumes remain constrained by supply chain and throughput issues, but backlogs are strong and volumes are steady. We expect continued share gain with smaller builders that are coming online to capture surplus demand. Our rescue business remains positive with strong NPD, and we continue to leverage our integrated model to drive distribution growth. We expect our Banjo business to continue to outperform across industrial, automotive and energy markets as it leverages its inventory and differentiation to capture share. Finally, our dispensing business has achieved strong results for the last 2 years, but will be down in 2023, driven by lower North American project volume as customer equipment refresh cycles approach their final innings. We continue to see growth in India, offset by some moderating demand in Europe and Southeast Asia. For the segment, we expect price cost and operational productivity will drive margin expansion with some offset for mix as we see lower dispensing project volume in the segment. With that, I'll discuss our financial results. Moving on to our consolidated financial results on Slide 9. Q4 orders of $803 million, were up 1% overall and up 1% organically. We experienced continued orders growth in FMT, driven by strong water and energy results and an FSD due to strong fire and rescue orders as well as the receipt of a large project order for dispensing in the quarter. HST orders were down 8%, mainly due to the life science and AI OEM orders and softer semi demand I highlighted earlier. For the year, orders were up 8% overall and up 5% organically. We experienced positive orders growth across all 3 of our segments. Fourth quarter sales of $811 million, were up 13% overall and up 12% organically. We experienced nearly 20% organic growth in HST and strong growth across both FMT and FSD. Full year sales of $3.2 billion, were up 15% overall and up 13% organically. We saw strong double-digit growth across FMT and HST and 9% growth in FSD. Q4 margin contracted by 140 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 and adjusted gross margin of 43.6% contracted by 40 basis points. This was driven by unfavorable mix within HST and FSD, the dilutive impact of acquisitions, employee-related inflation and unfavorable productivity in HST, partially offset by volume leverage and strong price cost. For the full year, gross margins expanded by 50 basis points, and adjusted gross margins expanded by 10 basis points to 44.8%, primarily driven by strong volume leverage, positive price/cost and productivity, more than offsetting employee-related inflation and engineering resource investments. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27%, up 10 basis points versus 2021. A bridge of Q4 adjusted EBITDA as well as Q4 adjusted operating income can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Full year adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.9%, is up 20 basis points versus 2021's adjusted EBITDA of 27.7%. This represents record profitability for IDEX. I will discuss the drivers of full year adjusted EBITDA on the next slide. Our Q4 effective tax rate of 20.5%, decreased versus last year's effective tax rate of 22.5%, primarily due to tax benefits realized as we recognize certain foreign currency impacts for tax purposes with the funding of the Muon Group acquisition. Our full year effective tax rate of 21.7% also included tax benefits from the sale of our Knight business and was down from the 2021 effective tax rate of 22.5%. Fourth quarter net income was $130 million, which resulted in an EPS of $1.71 Adjusted net income was $153 million, with an adjusted EPS of $2.01, which was up $0.30 or 18% over prior year. Full year net income was $587 million, which resulted in an EPS of $7.71. Adjusted net income was $618 million, resulting in an EPS of $8.12, up $1.25 or 18% over prior year adjusted EPS. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $147 million, 96% of adjusted net income, mainly driven by improved working capital performance. For the year, free cash flow was $489 million, down 1% versus last year and coming in at 79% of adjusted net income. mainly driven by higher net working capital, partly offset by higher income. As we exit the year, we made progress in reducing core business inventories and have momentum behind us to continue to drive further reduction into next year. Moving on to Slide 10, which details the drivers of our total year adjusted EBITDA. Full year adjusted EBITDA increased $119 million compared to 2021 and Our 13% organic growth contributed approximately $91 million flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. We levered well on the volume increase and had record price capture to offset record inflation. Price/cost was accretive to margins and has returned to historic levels. As we exited the year, all 3 of our segments posted positive price/cost results. We drove operational productivity to offset supply chain-driven inefficiencies and realized the benefits of our energy and Italian site consolidations. Mix was a small positive for the year. We saw unfavorable mix pressure in the fourth quarter of about $3 million that were reversed a majority of the year-to-date favorability. We invested $20 million taking in the form of engineering and commercial resources in the business and M&A and diversity equity inclusion resources in corporate. Tracking to the lower end of the $0.20 to $0.25 of full year spend we highlighted at the beginning of the year. Discretionary spending increased by $25 million versus last year, closer to the high end of the $0.20 to $0.25 range on significantly higher sales than our original guide. We exited the year with a solid 30% organic flow-through. ABEL, Nexsight, KZValve and Muon acquisitions, net of the Knight divestiture and FX contributed an additional $14 million of adjusted EBITDA. Inclusive of acquisitions, divestitures and FX, we also delivered 30% flow-through. With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2023. I'm on Slide 11. We expect full year organic revenue growth to be in the range of 1% to 5%. This range reflects the uncertainty in the second half of the year given the short-cycle nature of our business. This organic growth rate equates to $0.12 to $0.60 depending on the top line results. This range includes price cost, which we anticipate will be positive for the year and some mix pressure stemming from HST and dispensing volume in FSD. We expect that our operational productivity will more than offset pressure from employee-related wage and benefits inflation. We operated in a challenging supply chain environment in 2022, and we expect the easing of these conditions as well as driving our own internal productivity funnel will deliver $0.06 to $0.08 of net productivity for the year. In 2022, we returned to a more sustainable level of discretionary spending post-pandemic and invested in the people needed to drive our strategy. Travel and external services did not fully rebound until the second quarter of 2022. And we hired an increasing rate as we move through the year. Although our spend is only moderately increased versus our 4Q exit rate, we'll see pressure of approximately $0.09 on a year-over-year basis. This impact is entirely felt in the first quarter of 2023. Although not to the same level as in 2022, we will continue to invest for the future. People, new products as well as applications for existing products, and these investments will provide up to $0.20 of pressure in 2023, depending on top line results. The range indicates how we will focus on resource allocation and an uncertain period and dial in our investments appropriately. Net of the divestiture of our Knight business last year, we expect acquisitions to contribute $168 million of revenue and $0.43 of EPS. Now let's look at a couple of non-operational items. Interest expense associated with the Muon acquisition represents a headwind of $0.12, and we expect FX to be a small impact, providing $0.02 of EPS pressure. So in summary, we are projecting organic revenue growth of 1% to 5% for the year, adjusted EPS expectations are in the range of $8.50 to $8.80, a 5% to 8% growth over 2022. The midpoint of our guidance implies a solid 30% adjusted EBITDA flow-through. Moving on to Slide 12. We I'll now provide some additional details regarding our 2023 guidance for both the first quarter and full year. In the first quarter, we are projecting GAAP EPS to range from $1.74 to $1.79 and adjusted EPS to range from $1.98 to $2.03, with organic revenue of 3% to 5% and adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 27%. Our guidance includes $0.07 of pressure from accelerated recognition of share-based compensation as well as a delay in HST OEM shipments to the latter part of the second quarter that is lowering our organic growth expectations for the quarter. These factors, plus the carryover item I mentioned on the previous slide, mutes our year-over-year flow-through for the quarter, but expect to deliver solid flow-through for the year. Turning to the full year 2023. We project GAAP EPS of $7.55 to $7.85 and adjusted EPS to range from $8.50 to $8.80. We expect full year organic revenue growth of 1% to 5% and adjusted EBITDA margins to be 28% or higher. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be about $70 million, in line with 2022 spending as we continue to identify opportunities to reinvest in our core businesses. And free cash flow is expected to be 100-plus percent of adjusted net income.  With that, I'll turn it back to Eric. Yes. So in the fourth quarter, we talked to the third quarter inventory stabilized. It wasn't a detriment to cash flow. Here in the fourth quarter, it added about $20 million of free cash flow, the movement we made on our position, and we continue to see that momentum. I think we've got line of sight to a half a turn to a full turn of inventory improvements as we progress through the year. It will be a significant driver of our cash flow performance as we go from, obviously, less than historical averages on our free cash flow conversion to last year being 100-plus percent, which will yield somewhere between 30% and 40% increase in free cash flow year-over-year. So I think that's a huge win as we progress through the year. Yes. I think we're generally first half, second half is fairly close, 49, 50, 51, 49, something like that. So this year, I think the implied guide is a stronger first half with volume starting to decline in the back half. We've got pretty strong price carryover and price capture that will put in place here in the first quarter that will carry at least the price side. And then just the implied volumes in the back half are down somewhere between 2% to 4%. Yes. No, I think that's well said. I mean it's a recalibration year, just like we had dynamic recalibration on the way up and recovery from the pandemic and supply chain issues and things like that, stimulus. Now we -- I think we're going to be returning to more normal patterns. But given the nature of IDEX, that's liable to play out at differentiated rates. So we see some more of it, as you'd expect, in some of those OEM-centric markets within HST, where we're a lot closer to the customer. It's more high velocity anyways. And you can see a bit of a pause there to take a breath, take some inventory out of their system. And then those are healthy markets on the other side of them. Some of our industrial businesses that are a little further away from the end customer, lots of distribution between us and them, lots more fragmentation. I think you'll see some of those same things play out over time, but probably a little further down the road. And so what we're kind of expecting here is that from a high level, you'll see things return to more normal rates were off in the backlog or the order rates and the sales rates are pretty tightly linked for us, unless we're sort of beginning or ending the cycle. But I think that what's a little unusual here is just the way it will play out. The nature of it, given just the differentiated pockets of IDEX, and so we're prepared for all of that. What we're trying to do on one side is look at it, adjust to it, course correct, but then always looking on the other side so that we don't over interpret something in the short end. Think it means something that's sustainable for 2, 3 years when it doesn't, and we keep resources aligned in places that have the best growth prospects for us. Yes, exactly. HST on the high end of the range, FMT in the middle and then FSD at the lower end of the range. Yes. I think there's 3 things there, Deane. One, we continue to face some of the inefficiencies. We talked about here as we progress through the back half of the year. Some of those businesses have grown 20% and still calibrating on some of the manufacturability of some of this cutting-edge technology that they have. Two was some mix within the portfolio. We talked about some of the short-term OEM pushouts. A lot of that has been kind of our book and ship components that are higher margin. And then the last one, just the addition of Muon, they were only in the portfolio for a month. They were shut down to do a full physical inventory that, that diluted margins a little bit. The Muon on will go away in the first quarter. I think we're making progress on the productivity piece, but the mix, I think, is still a component that we'll experience in the first quarter. Yes, so we've got the volume impact and then that mix carrying through at least through the next 3 months. No. We've got carryover and the incremental pricing actions that we took to kick off the year. Obviously, that's part of our normal process and cadence to continue to capture the value for our products. So I think we're in a really good position from a price cost. We said in the fourth quarter, we're back to historic levels, and we think that will continue here as we progress through the year. If something were to change, obviously, we go back to the customers with an incremental increase, but we're well positioned here as we kick off the year. No, no one asked it. It was over 5%. On price cost? Yes. We said it was back to our historical level, so right around there. Yes. I mean overall price next year is somewhere around 3% to 4%, about half of it is carryover. No, it's mostly HST. We highlighted just some of the temporal moves from some of the OEMs as they recalibrate order patterns and inventory levels, that's the major driver. Brian, we said about 2/3 of the business is in those major categories you started with on the medical, semi and food side, the balance in a variety of different applications. We've said it's grown at double digits here the last several years. It's got line of sight to continue to do that here as we progress even with some of the noise out there in the semicon market, where they play in this space is still healthy. They've got innovative technology that they continue to roll out. So we remain bullish on their growth profile both on core products and some of the NPD applications that we've gotten to know a little bit more as we progress through the last couple of months of our ownership. No. I think from a segment, I think it's most of -- we described within some of the comments within our life sciences and total instrumentation, the folks in that group from a magnitude perspective on what they're holding in from inventory, I wouldn't speak to that other than just conversations with them, there is a calibration period that we're going through. As Eric highlighted earlier in the call, this isn't atypical to what we've seen historically we've gone through really robust cycles of growth. There is a quarter or 2 of recalibration to normalize and then back off. I think as you hear any of the external commentary for those large customers, they are still bullish on their equipment deliveries and the growth that they're going to see in 2023. Yes. I think we have a while. HST is our biggest backlog. They've built the most backlog out of the 3 segments. So really comfortable with their position here as we go through the first half of the year. We said this calibration on the OEM inventory levels is generally a quarter maybe it spreads into the second. So we're confident that we're going to see that start to pick up and move as we progress into the back half of the year. No, the Q4 we got for dispensing will book in the second and third quarter of this year. Yes, Dispensing orders were up 25%, but their sales were down 20-plus percent in the fourth quarter. So this is -- that was the 1 last order to give us kind of the full set of visibility to still reasonable performance, but down, that's going to mask a little bit of the strong organic growth that we expect from Fire & Safety and Bandon next year. I mean, sorry, verified orders to move back down from like fourth quarter levels."

            "content": "Thank you, Allison, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6. 2022 was a record year for IDEX. We experienced double-digit organic growth every quarter, driving all 3 of our segments to record sales levels and achieved strong record profitability, driven by solid execution. This year was not without its challenges. We experienced unprecedented inflation as well as a difficult supply chain environment. Despite these obstacles, we achieved some of the strongest financial results we've ever posted. I'd like to thank our IDEX employees around the globe for their efforts and hard work. We also deployed more capital than ever before, investing in our businesses, acquiring new ones and returning capital to our shareholders. We deployed a record $950 million for the acquisitions of Nexsight, KZValve and most recently, the Muon Group. We reinvested back into our core business to increase capacity to support growth and drive productivity and made investments in the commercial engineering and M&A resources that enable us to execute on our best opportunities. We also repurchased 795,000 shares of IDEX stock for $148 million as we followed our opportunistic disciplined approach to buybacks. As we turn to 2023, we are prepared to build upon a very solid foundation. We have strong backlog positions overall, and we continue to leverage innovative technologies to drive targeted growth opportunities. We have healthy price carryover in addition to new price actions to capture the value our products bring to our customers. Finally, we have an opportunity to drive strong productivity as we bring process-driven normalcy back to our operations through the application of the IDEX operating model. However, we're a short-cycle business and with that comes limited visibility. The broad-based supply chain constraints experienced last year have created some new dynamics around order patterns and customer delivery timing. And we predict that 2023 will be an uncertain period of transition as we dynamically calibrate with our customers. Additionally, there are likely to be pockets of demand softness due to a variety of intersecting economic and geopolitical factors. Regardless of these challenges, we will execute and deliver growth above-market entitlements. The short cycle and decentralized nature of our business supports quick adaptation and alignment to shifting conditions. And we will course-correct quickly and effectively when needed. Our balance sheet has ample capacity to support our M&A strategy as well as organic reinvestment. Our extended M&A and strategy team continues to build conviction around our best opportunities, and our funnel is strong and of high quality. We've also identified areas where we will deploy capital organically to expand capacity, capture market share and drive operational productivity. IDEX had a strong finish to an outstanding year in 2022. Our agility, resiliency and our fundamental ability to execute has IDEX exceptionally well positioned to outperform as we move forward.  With that, I'll turn it over to Bill to discuss the outlook for our segments on Page 7. Thanks, Bill. I'm on the final slide, Slide 13. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to wrap up with a summary of our 2023 focus areas. First, we are refocusing our efforts on a foundational set of practices and tools that link us together the IDEX operating model as we exit 2 intense years of double-digit organic growth within an environment of temporal barriers and obstacles. This is a year to double down on the core execution elements that make us an excellent company. The use of daily management, monthly business reviews, goal deployment and other tools have long been a source of efficiency, innovation and growth for IDEX as market conditions, particularly within supply chains, begin to return to historic norms, we must seize the opportunity to optimize our process-driven fundamental business practices to best support future growth and outperformance. Second, we are committed to growing our talent at an even faster rate to fuel future IDEX growth. Our excellent execution is led by incredible leaders around the world who are committed to our core values to developing top-performing talent and creating an inspiring company culture that attracts and retains the best people. Diversity, equity and inclusion continues to be an area of focus, creating environments where people feel they belong and are comfortable bringing their true selves to work each and every day. One talent note I want to address is the recent departure of Melissa Aquino. If you recall from our last session together, I introduced her as the new leader of the FMT and FSD segments. Melissa made a difficult decision to go back to a previous employer to take an opportunity she felt she could not pass up. We wish her well in her new endeavors and continue the search for her replacement. In the meantime, the gap has allowed me to step in, get closer to our businesses and spend time with an outstanding group of business leaders. Lastly, we've deployed $1.5 billion over the last 2 years on high-quality growth businesses, and we look forward to deploying additional capital in 2023. Our M&A teams have made tremendous progress identifying compelling portfolio extensions. Our funnel is in the best shape it's been over my tenure at IDEX and our strong operating cash flow and balance sheet put us in a great position to continue to capitalize on those opportunities. Although the short-term economic picture might be uncertain, I could not be more excited as I consider the next few years of our story. I believe we're headed into an extended period of growth and above-market performance fueled by a combination of technology-driven tailwinds and our own high-quality business potential. Our businesses are first rate, our teams are outstanding, our culture is special.  With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions. Yes. And that's probably the area with the best example. We're coming off an environment where a lot of even the best intentional processes kind of turn into chasing things, looking for parts and waiting for the truck to come in at noon, all of that kind of stuff. So as that moderates and gets better, we just want to be intentional to make sure that we're going back and putting in those process-based fundamentals, the right people in the right room, having the right kind of conversations. That's actually how we're going to -- we frankly made a nice turn here in the fourth quarter on inventory. We got a long way to go, but we're really excited about that potential for us moving forward. But I think it's just -- I think everybody should be very thoughtful of recognizing that the way things have worked the last couple of years, if you're not intentional about reorienting it back to something that operates in a higher plane, it's going to lag. And so we're taking that opportunity. Yes. I mean there's definitely some of that in there. I think, as you know, we're kind of low on the food chain. We do a lot of component work for people who then turn it into subsystems in terms of the final system. So at any point, along that food chain, there's the potential for accumulation and then frankly, the normalization of it along the way. I think what we're thinking about, though, is when you think of how order patterns are generated many of them are actually done in an automated way. There actually isn't a lot of human intervention. And the two factors that drive it, the most are, of course, lead times and whether or not they're pulling in, and we're seeing that. We're seeing that kind of across the supply base. We're experiencing as well. A factor a lot of people don't consider as much though is volatility or variability. And so even when lead times are pulling in, if you still have an inability to count on it, it will tend to keep driving higher demand requirements throughout the system. So we're kind of monitoring both of those. And as any one of them comes to something more normal, almost always, you're going to see an impact on that on the other side for a short cycle business like ourselves. I don't think it's a massive number because, as you say, most of the things we make are customized and they don't stock well anyways. But we're coming off a pretty robust time here. I do think this calibration matters. It will play out over time through much of IDEX. Again, I think the focus for us is to understand it make sure that our own inventory positions and resources are calibrated right, but then be very, very focused on end market demand, what's driving that, what's the actual consumption rate on the other side because that ultimately is what you want to dial in to. Yes. Sure. I mean, I would say, in general, it's improved a lot and pretty close to where we were in 2019 with a few commodity exceptions. I'd put probably put electronics still at the top of that list. But frankly, we're not the most electronics intensive business. So it matters, but it's not widespread across the company. I think I would also remind everybody on the call, we have a lot of local supply. So we're typically dealing with people we've known a long time that are not far away all through the kind of the worst of it. In many cases, we were helping them. We were kind of sending people over to figure things out, help improve their flow. It's those kind of relationships. So -- and given that, that sort of topology, these are the kind of companies that can course correct a little better and generally have. I would say we're not yet normalized to 2019 levels all across IDEX. We're definitely past the halfway line. So depending on how the year plays out, you could see us basically articulating a normal condition, I think, closer to year-end, certainly as we begin the next year, absent any other force that we can't see. Yes. I'd say, Deane, it's still pretty early. I mean everything we're kind of talking about here near term that there was some exposure in Q4 and some carry into Q1. That's very much a temporal condition and otherwise very active and strong markets where you can see, hey, people are taking a pause for all the reasons that you just suggested. Those bellwethers that we have on the industrial side, most of which their order side is coming through the small order flow side, honestly, those are holding up. We're simply, in some cases, projecting that if you combine a couple of things, we kind of know where those inventory levels are, we know how they think about planning, we know where we are from a lead time perspective. We're saying at some point, we expect we'll have some of that moderation there, but it really isn't in front of us as we sit here today. And then back half of the year is more of a macro call than anything else as we think about kind of floor and top end of the range for all of IDEX. So I think your question is helpful because it helps us kind of parse that we'll at least put out there, hey, we're seeing some of these things from an early indication standpoint, but most of them are in a temporal spot. We can imagine some things that would be bigger pieces of IDEX, more industrial in nature that would kind of follow the same calibration. And then ultimately, like everyone else, we're kind of thinking about where does the future go back half of the year, it's more of a macro question. Okay. Well, I think the first question, I wouldn't say that those businesses in the HST world, have more inventory. I would say that they have more sophisticated planning. I think that we've typically seen in any cycle, there's just -- they're bigger organizations, they're a little bit more formal, they're usually a little quicker to react to cycles. And when they do it, that's a more of a concentrated industry anyways. So it tends to be kind of amplified that way. So there's nothing that tells me that somehow that they're sitting on more than anywhere else. And it's in any way, frankly, unusual from some other patterns we've seen when things change. So I'd say that's number one. Remind me again on the second question, I want to make sure I get the exact essence. You talked about supply chain confidence. Yes. No, again, I think, think of it as 2 variables. One is lead time compression, that's absolute. And I think people are seeing that. They're seeing that quoted to them when they call and ask about things. I would say the second component that I mentioned that is important, though, is the performance against those quotations. Neither one of them yet are kind of back to where they need to be. They're both improved, but they both work together. And frankly, that second piece, the one about sort of assurance and delivery against commitments, has a huge psychological impact. And I think it's one of the -- I think it's actually the more powerful of the two. So if people say, hey, it's still longer, but I know I'm going to get it exactly want to ask for it, they'll actually make that move in a more fundamental way. If they're still getting surprised from time to time, that tends to fuel a little bit of this. I'm going to keep some things, I'm going to protect some things. So both are moving. And as we continue to talk through the year, you'll hear us talk about both sides of that. Yes. I mean -- so in general, our story is a good one here. I mean we've had some good performance over the last couple of years, some great businesses we brought in. I've talked from time to time about the intention of work we've done to sort of build strategic conviction in a really, really formal way that contributes to the basic business intelligence that we have from all the businesses across IDEX. So the things that we control are in a great spot. As we think of them engaging with the outside world, we've always been careful to help people understand that we're fishing in a very high-quality universe that I think, in some ways, holds up and it doesn't move around as much in terms of valuations and even timing of transactions, particularly to do this work well. So -- on the PE front, they're often competing with us for properties like this. They too are attracted to companies like this. And I will say it's probably a little less activity competitively there or people that have been able to raise funding and be in the game. But we've long aspired with this work that we're doing to sort of be ahead of that anyway with cultivation on a proprietary nature, talking to people that we meet at the trade shows, those kind of things so that we're not actually in kind of a classic bake-off with lots of people anyways. It's an efficient market, so it doesn't always happen when it does. I think the dynamic around PE activity is absolutely true. Valuations overall still pretty rich because, again, we're looking for high-quality companies like the last 3 that we've brought into the business. No. I mean, as I said just a minute ago that we're still looking for high-quality properties. Those valuations tend to hold up over time. because of the long track record usually predating our conversation and the expectation you'll have a good trail on the other side. I just think from an availability front, we've got more than ample capacity, even though we've deployed a lot over the last 2 years. The great part of being IDEXX is we generate that capacity each and every day. And then I think our targets, we really have not changed. We kind of are comfortable with a band of about $0.5 billion to $1 billion. And if long considered that to be a good target for us here in the next couple of years, sort of regardless of the cycle and they're generating all the right work to go realize that. And then really past that, I mean, we did say there's some customer points that we have that they don't have that over time, we think, are interesting and we could exploit those. And that's very interesting things on the kind of codevelopment fronts, but the cycle of those are going to be further out in the future. So this always kind of was a game of capitalizing on the near-term strength and success of that business in those markets with sort of this additive element that we're going to work over time to enrich it with all the IDEXX assets. I mean, not so much within the IDEXX topology and things like that. I mean some certain things we do to leverage back office and being part of the company. But it's not kind of a classic story of us kind of putting things together and moving plants around. The -- as you often see in businesses like this, I mean a lot of that technology is resident in people. I think the single biggest lever that we anticipate pulling here absent that 1 is 80-20. I mean it's just the implementation of that model. And I can absolutely assure you their profile is very IDEX-like out of the gate, which means there are opportunities there to streamline and simplify it. Yes. I mean it's -- of course, it manifests itself across a series of franchises and very kind of different technologies that we have. So I would probably just roll back to very, very positive. The quote activity has been strong here at the end of last year continues into this year for all of the dynamics that you're citing, everything from EPA funding and enforcement possibilities, which has always been a catalyst for the businesses that we own now. as well as broader infrastructure support over time, which always takes a little longer to land but also has a potential to extend some of the growth time frames that we're thinking about into the future. So we're well positioned. We're continuing to kind of work those assets together. And then -- and this is an area of focus for us as we think about deploying some capital to. Absolutely. We always think of investing and investing for the future and investing to grow. One of the great things about a company like ours, though, is we can move things around sideways. -- a lot to help us kind of hit the lower end of that range and still make the right choices for the right businesses. And so whenever you see us talking about stuff like a 0, it's actually still very dynamic here. it's just to be candid, we would take businesses that are in softer parts of the universe, and we would quite intentionally like pull those down, lead them out a lot. And redistribute those costs elsewhere to parts of IDEXX that are stronger, sometimes literally taking the same people. and putting them over in stronger parts of IDEXX. So we actually have that nice optionality down at the lower end of the range, but keeps it all moving and allows us to kind of weather a storm if it happens. Okay. Well, thank you all for joining and listening to our story. And I know there were a lot of moving pieces there in an environment that's got some pluses and minuses and things that are playing out. So I'll keep this really, really simple. I want to, again, thank all the folks from IDEXX. 2022 was a great year. I mean really, really outstanding year, incredible growth, focused on the right things, getting capital to work, and we grew our people, we grew our culture. I think 2020, this is going to be an equally great year, and it really sets us up for the future to come. We talked a little bit in my last framing comments there about the power of execution. We're really excited about that. We think we've got a chance here to go establish even a little bit more competitive advantage as we jump on this and recalibrate to the world to come. So we're all over it. We're doing that actively. And then just as passionately, we've got a number of teams that are thinking about the future, what comes in 5 years, what comes in 10 years, and we're going to make the choices that we have to to capitalize on those too. So -- thanks for your support and interest, and have a great day."

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Allison Lausas, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. Thank you. You may begin.\nAllison Lausas: Good morning, everyone. This is Allison Lausas, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the IDEX third quarter 2022 financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the three months ending September 30, 2022. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today's webcast, can be accessed on our company website at idexcorp.com. Joining me today are Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer and President; and Bill Grogan, our Chief Financial Officer. Today we\u2019ll begin with Eric providing an overview of the state of IDEX's business, then Bill will discuss IDEX third quarter financial results provide an update on segment performance in the markets we serve and discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes by dialing the toll-free number (877) 660-6853 and entering conference ID 13724804 or simply log on to our company home page for the webcast replay. Before we begin, a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to safe harbor language in last night's press release and in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I'll now turn this call over to our CEO and President, Eric Ashleman.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you, Allison, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6. Our global teams achieved excellent results in the third quarter. We delivered record sales, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. Organic sales grew 15% with double digit record growth across all three of our segments. Orders moderated a bit in the quarter, but backlog positions remain robust overall. It's been a strong record setting year so far for IDEX, not easy to achieve in this environment. I'd like to thank all our IDEX employees around the globe for their outstanding efforts. On the capital deployment side, last month we announced our intent to acquire the Muon Group for \u20ac700 million, marking our largest acquisition to date. Muon expands upon a growing core of market-leading precision components technologies, an area of the portfolio we continue to invest in both organically and inorganically. Muon\u2019s technical capabilities like many others within IDEX are well positioned, differentiated, and tunable towards high growth niche applications within broader mega-trends. Muon technology solve critical problems within the most demanding application sets of semi manufacturing, patient care within med tech, food production, and other high quality markets. This acquisition demonstrates the success of our expanded M&A strategy. We combine bottoms-up business intelligence with analysis and insights from a small, strategic community across IDEX to build conviction within a grid of high quality niche applications. Increasingly, as we build and optimize the portfolio, we find that we can drive growth within a target vertical from multiple points organically from within IDEX businesses and externally via M&A. We think this approach is unique and advantaged. It leverages 80-20 in segmentation, our operating model and the quality and strength of our diverse collection of businesses. We also completed the sale of our Knight LLC business in the third quarter. Knight supports cleaning and sanitization within hospitality and janitorial markets. As we've discussed in the past, we continually seek to optimize our portfolio. When we identify businesses or product lines that would grow and thrive for other owners we've divested those assets. I want to express my appreciation to the Knight team for all they have contributed in their 25 years with IDEX. Next, I want to share some exciting organizational news. I'm happy to announce that Melissa Aquino recently joined IDEX, as Senior Vice President, Group executive for FMT and FSD. Melissa has a broad understanding of what it takes to grow and succeed as a team in manufacturing, having served in a wide variety of commercial, operational and leadership roles. She has scale and depth of experience across multiple industries, including consumer, industrial, diagnostic and life sciences. Although we are aligning these segments under a single leader internally, they will continue to be separate reportable segments. I'd also like to take a moment to celebrate the tenure and accomplishments of our HST Group Executive Marc Uleman. We've seen outstanding results under his more than 10 years of leadership at IDEX, driving organic growth, operational excellence, and capital deployment in our fastest growing segment. Finally, we recognize there is considerable churn in the global economy right now, whether tied to geopolitical uncertainty, inflation interest rates, or the fear of a recession. There are several scenarios that could play out ranging from continued industrial growth to a shallow, short term pullback to a deeper recession. We have a plan of attack for each, and I'm confident we'll outperform as we have in the past. Our teams are smart and agile. They will quickly adjust and put their best resources on the best opportunities. That's at the core of our operating approach. We've made great progress in building a strong and sustainable growth engine. It sits on top of a solid foundation of execution within any environment. That's the \u2018and\u2019 not \u2018or\u2019 that we talk about all the time at IDEX. We are leaning in as a team towards the challenges and opportunities ahead. With that, let me turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results.\nBill Grogan : Thanks, Eric. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 8. Q3 orders of $781 million were up 1% overall and down 1% organically. We experienced orders growth in FMT, but some contraction in HST and FSD, primarily driven by timing of some larger orders. Core demand rates remain positive across the segments. Third quarter sales of $824 million were up 16% overall and up 15% organically. We experienced record sales with double digit organic increases across all three of our segments and strong performance across all geographies. Third quarter gross margin expanded by 250 basis points and adjusted gross margin expanded by 10 basis points compared to the prior year at 45.1%, driven by strong volume leverage and favorable price cost partially offset by higher employee-related costs. Third quarter operating margin was 24.5%, up 190 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 24.9%, up 60 basis points. Incremental amortization related to the Nexsight in KZValve acquisitions, unfavorably impacted adjusted operating margin by 30 basis points. I will discuss additional drivers of adjusted operating income on the next slide. Our Q3 effective tax rate was 21.8%. It decreased compared to the prior ETR of 23.4%, primarily driven due to the tax benefits associated with the sale of the Knight business. Third quarter net income was $179 million, which resulted in an EPS of $2.36. Adjusted net income was $162 million resulting in an EPS, and adjusted EPS of $2.14, up $0.35 or 20% over prior year. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $182 million, 112% of adjusted net income. This was a record free cash flow for us, mainly driven by higher earnings we are seeing inventory levels stabilize and expect further reductions as we exit the year. Moving on to Slide 9, which details the drivers of our adjusted operating income. Third quarter adjusted operating income increased $28 million compared to last year. Our 15% organic growth contributed approximately $26 million flowing through at our prior year adjusted gross margin rate. We levered well on the volume increase and we had strong price capture to offset inflation headwinds. Price cost was accretive to margins and has returned to historic levels driven by our FMT and HST segments with FSD making improvements sequentially versus the second quarter. We experienced slight positive mix of $2 million in various parts of the portfolio. We reinvested $6 million taking the form of engineering and commercial resources in the businesses and M&A and DE&I resources at corporate tracking to the $0.20 to $0.25 a full year spend we highlighted at the beginning of the year. Lastly, discretionary spending increased by $6 million versus last year, which is slightly below the second quarter of 2022. As we said last quarter we have reached a more normalized post COVID spend rate and significantly higher sales volume. This delivered a strong organic flow through of 31% in the quarter. Flow through is then negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions, divestitures and FX, getting us to our reported flow through of 30%. With that, I'll provide a deeper look at our segment performance. I'm on Page 10. In our Fluid & Metering Technologies segment, we experience excellent order in sales performance with organic growth of 2% and 17% respectively. FMT adjusted operating margin expanded by 250 basis points versus last year. The increase included 80 basis points of headwind due to the incremental amortization related to the next site in KZValve acquisitions. We experienced continued strong volume leverage in operational productivity as well as favorable price cost. Our industrial markets continued exhibit steady demand with tailwinds from energy, mining and infrastructure tempered a bit by some European softness. Our look for our municipal water businesses continues to be positive. We see healthy quoting activities in sync with underlying market trends of growing urbanization, further CCTV inspection adoption and infrastructure investments in the U.S. Agriculture remains strong. We are seeing positive signals from both our OEMs and distributors. Commodity prices remain high and increased fuel and fertilizer costs are incenting farmers to invest in precision technologies. Our investment in Banjo's process automation have improved our delivery putting us in a good position to capture share, and we continue to leverage KZValve's expertise and technology to enhance our product offerings. Our energy business is performing well with strong oil and LPG price support. We continue to see favorable results upstream with midstream investments lagging a bit due to supply chain constraints at our customers in larger project spend delays. Moving on to the Health & Technology segment. Orders contracted by 4%, but sales were strong at 13%. Our backlog position remains robust. The contraction and orders were driven by several large orders that the delayed out of the quarter. European capital good softness and tough comparables from the prior year where we grew orders organically by 44%. HST adjusted operating margin contracted by 70 basis points versus last year. The segment experienced strong volume leverage and positive price cost, which was more than offset by increased engineering and resource investments, higher discretionary spending and some inefficiencies incurred as we continue to onboard labor to meet demand and navigate supply chain challenges. We continue to experience strong demand for analytical instrumentation in chromatography and mass spectrometry as well as next gen sequencing technology for oncology testing and research. Our targeted growth initiatives tied to global broadband and energy efficient fuel cells are performing very well. Two great examples of how we are leveraging our tech in fast growing niche markets. The semiconductor market remains steady. We see customer related supply chain issues driving some slowing, but we are offsetting this headwind through share gains. We provide consumables and technology to drive fab efficiency buffering us for some of the CapEx slowdown on the new equipment side. Our material processing business remains strong on continued pharma and biopharma demand. We are seeing some order slowdown due to investment delays by our customers, but our funnel remains strong and of high quality. Our HST industrial market performance is very much like the experience in FMT. Finally, turning to our Fire, Safety & Diversified product segment. Orders were flat year-over-year as a difficult quarter-over-quarter comparables in our dispensing business was offset by strong growth by the balance of the portfolio. Sales were quite strong with an organic increase of 14%. FSD adjusted operating margin expanded by 70 basis points versus the third quarter of 2021 driven by strong volume leverage, partly offset by pressure on price cost and higher employee related costs. Although price cost is still diluted to margins, it did improve sequentially. Our dispensing business performed well with the delivery of North American project volume and continued strength in the global architectural paint market, but orders were down 30% year-over-year due to large North American replenishment orders that we received last year. Within our fire business, OEMs continue to struggle with supply chain constraints, but we did see positive organic growth from price realization, improved execution and favorable performance in loose equipment. On the rescue side we continue to win with our latest generation E3 tool, bringing enhanced tool features to the market. Finally, BAND-IT experienced strong results across industrial, automotive and energy markets. We continue to win share by having shorter lead times and material availability. On the auto side we are outperforming the market by capturing share on new platforms and winning content on priority, high volume vehicles. With that, I'd like to provide an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. I'm on Slide 11, which lays out our updated guidance. For the fourth quarter of 2022 we are projecting organic revenue growth of approximately 9% and operating margin of approximately 23.5%. We expect that the volume will decrease sequentially from the third to fourth quarter due to normal seasonality and scheduled maintenance shutdowns. Q4 forecasted op margin is down versus Q3 due to the loss leverage on lower revenues. We expect GAAP EPS to range from $1.75 to $1.80 and adjusted EPS to range from $1.92 to $1.97. Turning to the full year. Given our strong performance in the prior three quarters we are raising our full year guidance. We now expect full year organic revenue growth of approximately 12%. We expect GAAP EPS to range between $7.75 to $7.80 and expect EPS to range from $8.04 to $8.09. Our operating margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 24% and we expect free cash flow as a percent of adjusted net income to range from 75% to 80%. With that, I would like to turn it back to Eric for closing remarks.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks Bill. As we wrap-up I'd like to share with my thoughts are with our Pulsafeeder team and Punta Gorda, Florida. Who continue to cope with the aftermath of Hurricane Ian? All our employees are safe and our values shine through as our other IDEX businesses banded together to provide release supplies to our colleagues there and our IDEX Foundation Board of Directors approved a large donation to the American Red Cross. Our facility did sustain some damage, but we have returned to operations. I would also like to extend my public congratulations to Katrina Helmkamp who has replaced Bill Cook as the non-executive chair of our Board of Directors. Bill Grogan and I have both worked closely with Katrina since she joined our Board in 2015, and we look forward to continuing to lever her strong operating leadership skills and experience across multiple markets and technologies to drive IDEX forward. I'd also like to thank Bill Cook, who has been an invaluable contributor to our company, our board, and my personal development throughout his 14-year tenure. With that I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Mike Halloran of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Halloran: Hey, good morning everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Good morning, Mike.\nMike Halloran: So couple of questions here more on the demand order side of things. First, on the order side, flash orders against really tough multi-year stack comps here. It seems like a good outcome sequentially lower. When I think about those in order numbers, is there anything in there from a weakening perspective we should think about? And then how much of that sequential change is seasonality or just a normal air pocket that develops as lead times start normalizing to kind of historically normal levels?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. I mean, well you hit a lot of the elements there. I mean, there's a piece of this that we always suspected was going to be there as we start to come off of incredibly high backlog positions, especially for a short cycle, quick lead time business like ourselves. So there's a piece of it that no doubt will be that, and we'll keep an eye on the rate of travel of it as it runs out. There is some summer \u2013 kind of summer month seasonality that that's in there as well. I would say from a categorical softness standpoint, probably the one area we'd point to it covers a lot of IDEX businesses would be just some general softening on the European front, which probably isn't too surprising. And then I know, I'm sure we'll talk later here about projects \u2013 large projects and things of that nature. That's an interesting story. I mean they were, at the beginning of this whole recovery, I mean, there was a lot of caution on people's parts, sort of held them back, I think in the middle part or a lot of the duration, honestly there was just not enough time and energy to get at it or resources. And now you're kind of seeing that tilt back probably more of a cautionary tone again. We've got a few things that have moved out and placed themselves decisions into Q1 of next year, things of that nature as well. So a few things that we can point to. Some things that are sort of normal based on where we are from a backlog position and time of year, but underneath and around all of that really, really strong support across the board.\nMike Halloran: Thanks for that. Super helpful and in the prepared remarks you talked about the ability for IDEX to manage with whatever kind of environments during your way in 2023 and certainly your track record supports that pretty aggressively. What is the base case as you guys are thinking about it today as we move into next year? Obviously we've talked a lot about the need and the opportunity for a strong industrial cycle. It doesn't mean you can't get some weaknesses we move into next year. So as you look through your pretty varied end markets going into next year, how are you thinking about that setup and what's the opportunity set for growth?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. Well look, I think as I said in the prepared remarks, you could see a few paths that would run out here. I mean, one that's more positive, something that's short-term and kind of a short term pullback and then obviously maybe something with a catalyst that's more negative that none of us can imagine. I just always come back, when we talk about that in the company, I mean, we literally scenario play every one of those. We understand kind of what's variable, what's not variable across all our businesses. We always go back to the top growth that's in the company, almost all of which we can kind of see traveling across the duration here. We factor that in as well. We've certainly learned a lot like every company of about how low you can take discretionary spend, in many ways lower than we would've thought possible before. We know where that floor is and kind of how we would stack that against any of those scenarios. We've talked for a while on the headcount side, we'd be careful. Talent is hard to get, I mean, we're not really at a flush position there anyways. We're actually still pretty lean and we'd be very careful there. And then honestly we would \u2013 we would rotate towards the strong and we'd go pretty lean on areas that are weaker. And so, I want to be too predictive here because I think it's still pretty variable in our minds but our approach to each one of those paths is not, we actually know exactly what that is.\nMike Halloran: Thanks for that. Really appreciate it.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nNathan Jones: Good morning everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Hey Nathan.\nNathan Jones: I wanted to just with some price/cost discussion. You guys have said that price/cost has been dilutive to margins in 2022, is that something you target recapturing in 2023 as we've started to see costs moderate. Do you believe you can recapture that margin that was lost in 2022 to price/cost?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. No, definitely. As you said in the prepared remarks we're back to our historical levels here in the third quarter as we continue to ramp, our price capture, inflation hasn't gone down but it's moderated a bit. So as we look forward to the stickiness of the price that we implemented here as we progressed through 2022, that's sticking in in 2023 optimistic about our ability to keep above our historical levels.\nNathan Jones: Okay. And maybe you could just talk a little bit about some of the order cadence in your shortest cycle businesses. I know you guys have a few businesses that tend to be canaries in the coal mine. I think you said BAND-IT still remains pretty strong, but any commentary you can give us on those businesses that you consider to be leading indicators of the order cadence there?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. They're still really strong. I mean they have held steady many \u2013 in many places and there's four or five of them. We've done a really nice job on putting some strategic inventory together. Our natural ability to replenish fast has allowed us to go capture some share and some orders and then turned them and converted them to sales pretty quick on top of it. So no real pressure signs coming from that very short cycle stuff that, that we always talk about. We look at that constantly that's holding up, there's still an awful lot of demand for it. A lot of capacity that's got to lay in and it's always been pretty indicative of kind of the level that the industrial machine is working at because a lot of it is one-for-one replacement. And I think, I mean all of our plants are working pretty fast and I suspect that's the case out in a lot of the places we supply to. So that's holding up well.\nNathan Jones: And one last one just on your own inventory levels. Obviously everybody's been carrying a bit of extra inventory through these disrupted times plans on where you think that goes to in 2023 and what kind of catch generation we should be looking at for next year?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. Look the third quarter was the, first time in the last several that we actually didn't build incremental inventory and we've start. We've stabilized our current levels and looked to bleed here in the fourth quarter progressing into the first half of next year. Obviously we've set our long-term goal is to be at over 100% cash flow conversion and I think we'll progress to that level over the next couple quarters. First half is always a little bit light from a cash flow perspective on timing and we're more back half loaded. But we look to continue to progress inventory balances down here over the next six months.\nNathan Jones: Thank you very much for taking my questions.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks Nathan.\nOperator: Our next question comes on the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Hi Deane.\nDeane Dray: Hey, I'd like to follow up on Nathan's last question there for Bill. Is there any way to quantify the inventory that you're carrying that would be considered more buffer inventory? That is lead times begin to normalize, you can start to sell that down? And then Eric just talked about being aggressive with the opportunity on some of the fast short cycle businesses that the inventory ready to go. So, and that's kind of, it would be offsetting to that. But can you quantify for us what that opportunity would be to a normalize working capital?\nBill Grogan: I think internally we're targeting to get somewhere between a half a turn and a turn as we progress to our more historic levels. The buffer inventory is probably at the lower end of that that we'll keep some of that is the businesses look on the strategic side, where we've been able to take share with some of that inventory level. We'll keep that and the focus is, is just as we've built up inventory to buffer and or have had to increase inventory levels based upon quantities we had to commit to you or customers that have paused some of their shipments as they've worked out supply chain issues on their side. We've built up a little bit of finished goods. Those parts will be the first part to bleed and the things that we think are strategic to enable some of the share capture will hold onto that.\nDeane Dray: All right, good. That's helpful. And then could we just go through at whatever level you'd like to share the whole cancellation of the customer COVID test application? I think you framed for how it was \u2013 how that came about and the impairment that you took. Is that the end of it in terms has it been completely written off, and you did include it in your operating results, which we appreciate?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. That's the end of it. I mean, there's small \u2013 some small shipments here in the fourth quarter, but fundamentally it was an initiative that we started and highlighted back in 2020. We partnered with that customer and had a great relationship relative to the partnership on developing the technology and them committing a significant amount of capital to support our production capabilities. And obviously as they've moved in a different direction and got out of the testing, cause the impairment and then the recognition of all that deferred revenue here within the quarter. So most of the noises is they have been taken here in the third quarter. We've kind of moved past with significant knowledge gained in terms of production capabilities and technology that we'll continue to leverage as we move forward.\nDeane Dray: That's real helpful, thank you.\nEric Ashleman: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed your question.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. Eric, would love a little more color on the decision to align FSD and FMT under one leader. Does that indicate sort of maybe potentially more divestitures as you kind of look to refine the portfolio going forward; just any thoughts there?\nEric Ashleman: No. I'd appreciate the question. What I was really trying to emphasize in the remarks is we were looking for a leader with frankly experience, scale and depth of experiences and in the broad reach, which would line-up well with where we want to go as a company. And so that that by sort of combining those businesses at least under her watch, it allows us to essentially position the skill, attract somebody of that caliber and put somebody on the team that's honestly got some experience in some of the areas where we want to go. That it's completely about that. Everything else underneath Melissa is identical to what we've seen before. We've kept it very separate and distinct. We run it exactly the same, but it allows one person to come onto the team with some very, very good capabilities.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. And then Bill just going back to the HST orders, I think you kind of alluded to the fact that they were just \u2013 there were some orders that were essentially just pushed into to Q4. Have they been executed on? Have they turned into orders or is it something we're still leading to come forward here?\nBill Grogan: Yes. No, not yet. The teams are still negotiating final pricing for things going in the next year. So if we get them in Q4, first part of Q1, we'll get them. It's just a matter of timing.\nAllison Poliniak: Great, thank you.\nBill Grogan: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nBrett Linzey: Hi. Good morning all.\nEric Ashleman: Hi Brett.\nBrett Linzey: Hey. I was hoping you might be able to parse out how you're thinking about accretion this year in next on a carryover basis for the two recent acquisitions, Muon and KZ?\nBill Grogan: In terms of incremental eps?\nBrett Linzey: Yeah. So EPS accretion baked into the guide for this year and then what you're thinking about for next year carryover?\nBill Grogan: This year it's just a couple cents here in the back half. And then we'll have a couple of cents there in the, in the first half of next year is it'll comp as we progress in the Q3 and Q4.\nBrett Linzey: Okay, great. And then I was hoping maybe you could just give a little bit of color on the regional dynamic within orders and then specifically, what the pace of that looked like through the \u2013 through the quarter on a monthly basis and what you're seeing in October in Europe specifically?\nBill Grogan: I'm sorry, Brett, the cadence of orders within each month in the third quarter?\nBrett Linzey: Yes. I was thinking more on a regional basis what the cadence of monthly orders was and how that progressed into October as well by the different regions?\nBill Grogan: I would say the third quarters got some seasonality historically relative to European holidays and slowness within August. Relative to normal order patterns there weren't anything that was a significant outlier relative to what we've seen over the years. As Eric talked about, fundamental orders in our book and ship businesses were strong throughout the quarter. That continued to be strong here in October. Most of the softness, like we said, a little bit on the book and ship stuff in Europe and then some of the project related business and some of the ordering was probably the, the bigger item within our European geographical look; North American-Asia still remain really, really strong.\nEric Ashleman: And October pretty consistent with what we saw on Q3.\nBrett Linzey: Okay, great. I'll pass it along. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Johnson with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nThomas Johnson: Hi. Thanks. Congratulations on the strong quarter. I just had a question on kind of near-term results here specific to the HST business you provided some pretty helpful commentary for us on some of those main drivers, the lower productivity and some of the discretionary investments that offset volume and improving price cost from a margin standpoint in 3Q. So it would be helpful if there is any way that you could kind of quantify how that impacted EBIT margins on a sequential basis? Just trying to think through the evolution from 2Q to 3Q from those headwinds? And maybe how you see that progressing moving through the remainder of the year.\nBill Grogan: Yes. I'd probably highlight to some of the productivity challenges as we ramped on some of the higher tech stuff in a couple of businesses within HST. Yes, sequentially, it was down versus the second quarter. We think it will ramp back up here as the business continues to progress and normalize and get more efficient in several of the facilities that we'll see a pickup in the fourth quarter.\nThomas Johnson: Great. Thanks. That's all for me.\nOperator: Our next question coming from the line of Vlad Bystricky with Citi Group. Please proceed with your question.\nVlad Bystricky: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the call.\nEric Ashleman : Hey Vlad.\nVlad Bystricky: Hi. So can you just talk about \u2013 you've obviously talked throughout the recovery about taking some share, given your ability to service customers and your availability. So as we're starting to see supply chain constraints gradually ease, can you talk about how you expect share trends to evolve as some of your competitors who were maybe more hamstrung at times or coming back more online to normalize service levels?\nEric Ashleman: Sure. Well, there is probably two elements of there I want to cover. There is one that I would argue we kind of carry most days. We generally have shorter lead times than a lot of the people we compete against when things are in normal state. I mean, we\u2019ve engineered the businesses to run that way and its kind of all set up there. What's actually happened for us here with a lot of the share capture over the last couple of quarters is we made some really sharp calls on some inventory that's pretty specific, highly technical and not in wide supply. We could see some things come in the businesses to their credit without frankly approval loops and things that we don't need in a company like ours, they said, hey, we know how critical this is, we can kind of see where it's going to go, we're going to lay some in. And so almost all of the share capture that we talk about, you can kind of take it right back into very specialized material that we accumulated. So I think that's important because otherwise you might just think it's very benign stuff and metal bits and brackets and things like that where we just have to have them laying around. That actually would normalize as things improve. This is actually very, very strategic inventory that these businesses accumulated. So that's an advantage state out of the gate. That's what we're largely referring to here. But then as we go and things normalize, we normalize and maintain that advantage, the natural advantage we have in many of our businesses. So it\u2019s just an area that we always emphasize. It's kind of been dramatically positive for us because of really, really good choices in businesses.\nVlad Bystricky: Okay. That's really helpful color. And then maybe just as we think about organic sales obviously you have surprised to the upside here over the past couple of quarters and just raised your 2022 organic growth outlook. So, can you just maybe parse out a little more, what's driving that better top line growth? How much of it is incremental, better pricing than you expected versus just better volume-driven growth?\nEric Ashleman: Well, yes, I mean, there are certainly components of outperformance that are here. So, I'm glad that you are bringing that up. I mean, our pricing is the highest level we've had out throughout the year. We've been pushing that continuously. This is the kind of environment where our differentiated products are going to command the highest level of pricing. So, that is no doubt a component and it's competitively advantaged.  We talk a lot about the top bets in the company, the top best growth bets. They are of the highest quality we've had. And so interspersed in all of the numbers that we're talking about, you see great things like broadband, and outer space and things we're doing in genomics and some of the things going on in water and precision ag and through FMT and now some acceleration that we've been waiting for and the Fire businesses and FSD, so those bets are layered in with higher unit of measures than we've seen historically on top of recovering markets and well-positioned businesses. That's kind of the entitlement that we have. Really strong price capture and a great stack up of \u2013 that's across the company.\nVlad Bystricky: That's helpful. Great quarter. Thank you guys.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Wertheimer: Good morning everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Good morning.\nRob Wertheimer: So, I just have a general question. I wonder if you might tell, I guess, the story of Muon Group acquisition and how it sheds by the new process, multiples and other opportunities you have, whether it soaks up a lot of the availability or whether you are still active. Just kind of walk through how obviously you've had pretty strong success and acquisitions lately, and that's been a focus and I'd just like to get color and how that transpired.\nEric Ashleman: Yes. Well, it's a business we've known for a few years. It's very much an IDEX business. I mean, it's a highly precise, niche component doing wonderful jobs for a variety of high-end markets, including the ones that we had identified in the prepared remarks. I gave a lot of credit to Marc Uleman, who I referenced in my opening remarks. It's a Netherlands-based business. Marc is located in the Netherlands, and he kept a very active cadence with this team over the last few years. We found a time and a space where we were able to generate some actionability and got the deal done mainly because we could get our head around it very, very quickly based on the work we've done over the last few years and our familiarity with it. What's great about a business like this one is, and the reason I say it's so IDEX-like, is it's actually very tuneable. It's one of the reasons we like these precise components businesses. So, it pings into some very high quality areas of semicon, there is some great applications in medical devices, food production, high-end food production, all areas that we study and participate in across the business. So we can leverage that insights and then apply it on a high quality niche business like this one. Longer, turn down the road this actually sits next to a lot of things we have in our Scientific Fluidics & Optics. So there is some commercial relationships that we could leverage there. There is actually some very interesting technical questions and things that we're going to explore together over a longer duration. And then honestly, when we think of value creation, we start to apply the way we run things at IDEX. You can take a high quality business like that, we would start with 80-20. It's not all applications are created equal. We have a way of thinking about that that we can teach to others, things like value capture with customers. I mean, we do that really well. And so there is a whole bunch of leverageable assets as well, just that you apply against an already very, very strong business that's got a demonstrated history of growth. So, I think, we're really, really excited about it. I think it's indicative of the kind of things that we're looking at and looking for. And yes, we'll see, we'll certainly talk to you about it as we go.\nBill Grogan: And then, Rob, your capacity comment, I mean, after the completion of Muon, we'll have spent about a $1.5 billion over the last two years with really taking on a minimal amount of incremental leverage. So we'll have a $1.5 billion to spend here over the next 12 months with a robust funnel, lot of actionable assets within that funnel.\nRob Wertheimer: No, that was a comprehensive answer. Thank you. Any commentary on whether that's an abnormally large asset within your funnel, whether it's peppered through a big and small? And with that I will stop.\nEric Ashleman: Yes. No, I mean, it's a little larger than we've seen before. But I mean, the nature of these kind of high quality niches, they tend to be in very similar spaces and the kind of the top end of the size of them is actually relatively constant across even the wide variety of businesses that we have. So, a well-positioned business that's closer to the top end in a high quality niche like we think about is often this size. So it's a little higher than we've seen before but there is certainly more of them like it out there. \nRob Wertheimer: Great. Thank you.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Summerville: Thanks. Just a couple quick ones here. With FSD how far behind is that business in terms of price cost, meaning, how much more margin can we look forward to as you fully close that gap? And then sticking with that business on the dispensing side, how much of a revenue whole should we expect in 2023 from those big projects that have revenue this year? And then I have one follow-up.\nEric Ashleman : Sure. I think we look for FSD to continue its ramp. We had said last quarter had bottomed out, it will continue to progress as we move forward. With the caveat that we still need to assess the project funnel for next year for dispensing. Right now we don't think there is a huge hole. There will be some softness on the replenishment side. If we weren't able to fill some of those larger projects that would put a little bit of pressure on FSD\u2019s margins relative to the progress that fire and rescue has made. So right now we're still evaluating the impact of what the project funnel is for dispensing and obviously give you more detail here as we get into the guide in January.\nMatt Summerville: And then just a modeling question. The divestiture, the Knight divestiture can you disclose the financial profile of that business?\nBill Grogan: Yes, I mean, it was less than 1% of revenue and obviously a non-material, non-profit for us.\nMatt Summerville: Got it. That's all for me. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Loop Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Graham: Yes, hi. Good morning all. And congratulations on another standout quarter. I have questions. Just sort of a broad based question on organic first. With the supply chain improving a little bit \u2013 several quarters ago, Eric, you were able to take your best guess at quantifying what the negative was. With the improvement in the chain can you maybe quantify what the positive was on organic this quarter?\nEric Ashleman: I mean, from a share capture and things we're able to do, I mean\u2026\nScott Graham: Well actually trying to maybe share capture is part of it sure. But kind of more like backlog, depletion, things getting out, that were hung up in backlog that maybe you didn't expect, I'm assuming that there was a bit additive to organic from a better chain.\nEric Ashleman: I think it's a small amount. Scott, I think, we've stabilized relative to our production output levels as you look at where we've been from a revenue perspective, it's slightly elevated. So, a point or two at most, we've burned a little bit of backlog the quarter, but backlog position is still pretty high.\nBill Grogan: Pretty high. It was a pretty minor burn there.\nScott Graham: Got you. Okay, great. That was helpful. Thank you. Also, and I hope this doesn't count as a follow-up. What was pricing I didn't hear it if you said it?\nBill Grogan: No. We didn\u2019t. Second quarter we were at 4%. We ramped here in the third little over 5%.\nScott Graham: Okay. Thank you. And then just a question about the water business. It's a pretty big business. You called it out as a certainly an area of strength. Can you kind of talk about the dynamics of the growth in the quarter? Is that a market that maybe would be a clear sort of green shoot market for you next year as well? \nEric Ashleman: I mean, it's a good market. I always remind people that the work that we do there is on the analytical side of supporting whether the infrastructure\u2019s ability to work well. So that kind of work, I mean it maps well with a lot of the digital solutions that are out there. That's where some of our more digital businesses are. So robot crawlers and flow monitoring to prevent overflows and things that could harm the environment, that's the work that we're doing. The bulk of it. Of course, made an acquisition to deepen that here recently. So we've got some very good assets that in. We think long-term, obviously there is no question the work needs to be done. It's long overdue. There is a decent amount of stimulus and government support that's out there that always takes longer to find its way into projects than people imagine. But that frankly extends it over multiple years or two. So, just we kind of put that in a positive side. I would agree on the green shoot side of it. We are very, very well positioned. We're continuing integration work with the acquisition that we have to deepen all of it in our major geographies. And we view it as very favorable.\nScott Graham: Got it. Okay, thanks again. \nEric Ashleman: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. \nMichael Anastasiou: Good morning, this is Michael on for Joe.\nEric Ashleman: Hi, Michael.\nMichael Anastasiou: In the prepared remarks you mentioned strength around energy. Can you just dive a bit into the LNG outlook for FMT and if there is any future alternative energy opportunities? I know historically that's been an area of inorganic growth.\nEric Ashleman: Yes, well, I think, our energy businesses have recovered pretty nicely throughout the year. I mean, we've seen a few \u2013 we don't have a ton of upstream presence, but that's been stronger here lately. I think the midstream has got some delays and things on the project side and supply chain, some of the classic stuff, but probably lines up behind it, because there are some things that are overdue there. I mean we've got kind of a classic custody transfer business, a lot of it is fossil fuel dependent with the current assets. A lot of that technology, we're actually asking all the questions, as you might imagine, of how transferable it is to other alternate energy sources and things that might be out there. Whatever it is, whether it's hydrogen or some other gases and liquids, it's going to need \u2013 people are going to need to get paid and we're going to need to measure that custody transfer happens. And that's kind of work that we long have done and are excited about. There are actually other areas of IDEX that map against some of those same vectors in a way that's probably would strike folks in the outside is kind of unusual as well. That's one of the ways we think of a trend like that is we kind of draw lines and tentacles into different verticals within IDEX and then we sort of leverage insight around how the work is done, how things are shaping up, and then distribute it across a variety of IDEX businesses that might be involved. They may not be going to market together, they might not even be in the same room, but actually some of the same dynamics are meaningful for them in terms of why they would want to invest in it. So it's an area of interest for us in terms of how this will ultimately play out over time. But I think for now the kind of core things that we have are doing pretty well with a decent road and runway ahead. \nMichael Anastasiou: Thanks, that's helpful. And just in one follow-up if I may. Are there any product adjacencies that within the energy sphere that you see more favorable? And if this is something that's sort of in the funnel for the next 12 months or so? \nEric Ashleman: I mean, we got some great projects there. They, as you might imagine, go very, very niche very, very quickly. As an example, we've got a great application that makes sure that when you offload a rail car with propane you get all of it out of the bottom. I mean, seems kind of funny, you did suspect, everybody would suspect that actually happens, it doesn't. So our team developed something that guarantees that 100% of the fuel is taken out of the car, and then that's available as productivity for a variety of people. So it's that kind of work that's sort of the \u2013 that's the unit of measure of things we think about and develop for customers. And there are others along the way, but that's just one we happen to take a look at about a month ago that's really, really interesting. \nMichael Anastasiou: Thank you. \nOperator: That's all the time we have for questions. I would like to hand a call back to management for closing remarks. \nEric Ashleman: Well, thanks. I appreciate the comments and the reflection on what we think was a very strong quarter here. For any of the IDEX team members are listening, I want to thank you all again personally for your hard work. Certainly difficult circumstances, a lot of change happening quarter-over-quarter, month-over-month. But as I said in the end of my remarks, this is a company where we really lean into that. Anytime the world gets difficult, the problem is worth solving. And we solve them, with well positioned businesses, I mean, it's a huge financial benefit for ourselves and our shareholders. So thanks for your interest. Look forward to talking to you more along the way.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Bill Grogan",
            "content": "Thanks, Eric. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 8. Q3 orders of $781 million were up 1% overall and down 1% organically. We experienced orders growth in FMT, but some contraction in HST and FSD, primarily driven by timing of some larger orders. Core demand rates remain positive across the segments. Third quarter sales of $824 million were up 16% overall and up 15% organically. We experienced record sales with double digit organic increases across all three of our segments and strong performance across all geographies. Third quarter gross margin expanded by 250 basis points and adjusted gross margin expanded by 10 basis points compared to the prior year at 45.1%, driven by strong volume leverage and favorable price cost partially offset by higher employee-related costs. Third quarter operating margin was 24.5%, up 190 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 24.9%, up 60 basis points. Incremental amortization related to the Nexsight in KZValve acquisitions, unfavorably impacted adjusted operating margin by 30 basis points. I will discuss additional drivers of adjusted operating income on the next slide. Our Q3 effective tax rate was 21.8%. It decreased compared to the prior ETR of 23.4%, primarily driven due to the tax benefits associated with the sale of the Knight business. Third quarter net income was $179 million, which resulted in an EPS of $2.36. Adjusted net income was $162 million resulting in an EPS, and adjusted EPS of $2.14, up $0.35 or 20% over prior year. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $182 million, 112% of adjusted net income. This was a record free cash flow for us, mainly driven by higher earnings we are seeing inventory levels stabilize and expect further reductions as we exit the year. Moving on to Slide 9, which details the drivers of our adjusted operating income. Third quarter adjusted operating income increased $28 million compared to last year. Our 15% organic growth contributed approximately $26 million flowing through at our prior year adjusted gross margin rate. We levered well on the volume increase and we had strong price capture to offset inflation headwinds. Price cost was accretive to margins and has returned to historic levels driven by our FMT and HST segments with FSD making improvements sequentially versus the second quarter. We experienced slight positive mix of $2 million in various parts of the portfolio. We reinvested $6 million taking the form of engineering and commercial resources in the businesses and M&A and DE&I resources at corporate tracking to the $0.20 to $0.25 a full year spend we highlighted at the beginning of the year. Lastly, discretionary spending increased by $6 million versus last year, which is slightly below the second quarter of 2022. As we said last quarter we have reached a more normalized post COVID spend rate and significantly higher sales volume. This delivered a strong organic flow through of 31% in the quarter. Flow through is then negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions, divestitures and FX, getting us to our reported flow through of 30%. With that, I'll provide a deeper look at our segment performance. I'm on Page 10. In our Fluid & Metering Technologies segment, we experience excellent order in sales performance with organic growth of 2% and 17% respectively. FMT adjusted operating margin expanded by 250 basis points versus last year. The increase included 80 basis points of headwind due to the incremental amortization related to the next site in KZValve acquisitions. We experienced continued strong volume leverage in operational productivity as well as favorable price cost. Our industrial markets continued exhibit steady demand with tailwinds from energy, mining and infrastructure tempered a bit by some European softness. Our look for our municipal water businesses continues to be positive. We see healthy quoting activities in sync with underlying market trends of growing urbanization, further CCTV inspection adoption and infrastructure investments in the U.S. Agriculture remains strong. We are seeing positive signals from both our OEMs and distributors. Commodity prices remain high and increased fuel and fertilizer costs are incenting farmers to invest in precision technologies. Our investment in Banjo's process automation have improved our delivery putting us in a good position to capture share, and we continue to leverage KZValve's expertise and technology to enhance our product offerings. Our energy business is performing well with strong oil and LPG price support. We continue to see favorable results upstream with midstream investments lagging a bit due to supply chain constraints at our customers in larger project spend delays. Moving on to the Health & Technology segment. Orders contracted by 4%, but sales were strong at 13%. Our backlog position remains robust. The contraction and orders were driven by several large orders that the delayed out of the quarter. European capital good softness and tough comparables from the prior year where we grew orders organically by 44%. HST adjusted operating margin contracted by 70 basis points versus last year. The segment experienced strong volume leverage and positive price cost, which was more than offset by increased engineering and resource investments, higher discretionary spending and some inefficiencies incurred as we continue to onboard labor to meet demand and navigate supply chain challenges. We continue to experience strong demand for analytical instrumentation in chromatography and mass spectrometry as well as next gen sequencing technology for oncology testing and research. Our targeted growth initiatives tied to global broadband and energy efficient fuel cells are performing very well. Two great examples of how we are leveraging our tech in fast growing niche markets. The semiconductor market remains steady. We see customer related supply chain issues driving some slowing, but we are offsetting this headwind through share gains. We provide consumables and technology to drive fab efficiency buffering us for some of the CapEx slowdown on the new equipment side. Our material processing business remains strong on continued pharma and biopharma demand. We are seeing some order slowdown due to investment delays by our customers, but our funnel remains strong and of high quality. Our HST industrial market performance is very much like the experience in FMT. Finally, turning to our Fire, Safety & Diversified product segment. Orders were flat year-over-year as a difficult quarter-over-quarter comparables in our dispensing business was offset by strong growth by the balance of the portfolio. Sales were quite strong with an organic increase of 14%. FSD adjusted operating margin expanded by 70 basis points versus the third quarter of 2021 driven by strong volume leverage, partly offset by pressure on price cost and higher employee related costs. Although price cost is still diluted to margins, it did improve sequentially. Our dispensing business performed well with the delivery of North American project volume and continued strength in the global architectural paint market, but orders were down 30% year-over-year due to large North American replenishment orders that we received last year. Within our fire business, OEMs continue to struggle with supply chain constraints, but we did see positive organic growth from price realization, improved execution and favorable performance in loose equipment. On the rescue side we continue to win with our latest generation E3 tool, bringing enhanced tool features to the market. Finally, BAND-IT experienced strong results across industrial, automotive and energy markets. We continue to win share by having shorter lead times and material availability. On the auto side we are outperforming the market by capturing share on new platforms and winning content on priority, high volume vehicles. With that, I'd like to provide an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. I'm on Slide 11, which lays out our updated guidance. For the fourth quarter of 2022 we are projecting organic revenue growth of approximately 9% and operating margin of approximately 23.5%. We expect that the volume will decrease sequentially from the third to fourth quarter due to normal seasonality and scheduled maintenance shutdowns. Q4 forecasted op margin is down versus Q3 due to the loss leverage on lower revenues. We expect GAAP EPS to range from $1.75 to $1.80 and adjusted EPS to range from $1.92 to $1.97. Turning to the full year. Given our strong performance in the prior three quarters we are raising our full year guidance. We now expect full year organic revenue growth of approximately 12%. We expect GAAP EPS to range between $7.75 to $7.80 and expect EPS to range from $8.04 to $8.09. Our operating margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 24% and we expect free cash flow as a percent of adjusted net income to range from 75% to 80%. With that, I would like to turn it back to Eric for closing remarks. I think internally we're targeting to get somewhere between a half a turn and a turn as we progress to our more historic levels. The buffer inventory is probably at the lower end of that that we'll keep some of that is the businesses look on the strategic side, where we've been able to take share with some of that inventory level. We'll keep that and the focus is, is just as we've built up inventory to buffer and or have had to increase inventory levels based upon quantities we had to commit to you or customers that have paused some of their shipments as they've worked out supply chain issues on their side. We've built up a little bit of finished goods. Those parts will be the first part to bleed and the things that we think are strategic to enable some of the share capture will hold onto that. Yes. No, not yet. The teams are still negotiating final pricing for things going in the next year. So if we get them in Q4, first part of Q1, we'll get them. It's just a matter of timing. Sure. In terms of incremental eps? This year it's just a couple cents here in the back half. And then we'll have a couple of cents there in the, in the first half of next year is it'll comp as we progress in the Q3 and Q4. I'm sorry, Brett, the cadence of orders within each month in the third quarter? I would say the third quarters got some seasonality historically relative to European holidays and slowness within August. Relative to normal order patterns there weren't anything that was a significant outlier relative to what we've seen over the years. As Eric talked about, fundamental orders in our book and ship businesses were strong throughout the quarter. That continued to be strong here in October. Most of the softness, like we said, a little bit on the book and ship stuff in Europe and then some of the project related business and some of the ordering was probably the, the bigger item within our European geographical look; North American-Asia still remain really, really strong. Yes. I'd probably highlight to some of the productivity challenges as we ramped on some of the higher tech stuff in a couple of businesses within HST. Yes, sequentially, it was down versus the second quarter. We think it will ramp back up here as the business continues to progress and normalize and get more efficient in several of the facilities that we'll see a pickup in the fourth quarter. And then, Rob, your capacity comment, I mean, after the completion of Muon, we'll have spent about a $1.5 billion over the last two years with really taking on a minimal amount of incremental leverage. So we'll have a $1.5 billion to spend here over the next 12 months with a robust funnel, lot of actionable assets within that funnel. Yes, I mean, it was less than 1% of revenue and obviously a non-material, non-profit for us. Pretty high. It was a pretty minor burn there. No. We didn't. Second quarter we were at 4%. We ramped here in the third little over 5%."

            "name": "Eric Ashleman",
            "content": "Thank you, Allison, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6. Our global teams achieved excellent results in the third quarter. We delivered record sales, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. Organic sales grew 15% with double digit record growth across all three of our segments. Orders moderated a bit in the quarter, but backlog positions remain robust overall. It's been a strong record setting year so far for IDEX, not easy to achieve in this environment. I'd like to thank all our IDEX employees around the globe for their outstanding efforts. On the capital deployment side, last month we announced our intent to acquire the Muon Group for \u20ac700 million, marking our largest acquisition to date. Muon expands upon a growing core of market-leading precision components technologies, an area of the portfolio we continue to invest in both organically and inorganically. Muon's technical capabilities like many others within IDEX are well positioned, differentiated, and tunable towards high growth niche applications within broader mega-trends. Muon technology solve critical problems within the most demanding application sets of semi manufacturing, patient care within med tech, food production, and other high quality markets. This acquisition demonstrates the success of our expanded M&A strategy. We combine bottoms-up business intelligence with analysis and insights from a small, strategic community across IDEX to build conviction within a grid of high quality niche applications. Increasingly, as we build and optimize the portfolio, we find that we can drive growth within a target vertical from multiple points organically from within IDEX businesses and externally via M&A. We think this approach is unique and advantaged. It leverages 80-20 in segmentation, our operating model and the quality and strength of our diverse collection of businesses. We also completed the sale of our Knight LLC business in the third quarter. Knight supports cleaning and sanitization within hospitality and janitorial markets. As we've discussed in the past, we continually seek to optimize our portfolio. When we identify businesses or product lines that would grow and thrive for other owners we've divested those assets. I want to express my appreciation to the Knight team for all they have contributed in their 25 years with IDEX. Next, I want to share some exciting organizational news. I'm happy to announce that Melissa Aquino recently joined IDEX, as Senior Vice President, Group executive for FMT and FSD. Melissa has a broad understanding of what it takes to grow and succeed as a team in manufacturing, having served in a wide variety of commercial, operational and leadership roles. She has scale and depth of experience across multiple industries, including consumer, industrial, diagnostic and life sciences. Although we are aligning these segments under a single leader internally, they will continue to be separate reportable segments. I'd also like to take a moment to celebrate the tenure and accomplishments of our HST Group Executive Marc Uleman. We've seen outstanding results under his more than 10 years of leadership at IDEX, driving organic growth, operational excellence, and capital deployment in our fastest growing segment. Finally, we recognize there is considerable churn in the global economy right now, whether tied to geopolitical uncertainty, inflation interest rates, or the fear of a recession. There are several scenarios that could play out ranging from continued industrial growth to a shallow, short term pullback to a deeper recession. We have a plan of attack for each, and I'm confident we'll outperform as we have in the past. Our teams are smart and agile. They will quickly adjust and put their best resources on the best opportunities. That's at the core of our operating approach. We've made great progress in building a strong and sustainable growth engine. It sits on top of a solid foundation of execution within any environment. That's the \u2018and' not \u2018or' that we talk about all the time at IDEX. We are leaning in as a team towards the challenges and opportunities ahead. With that, let me turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results. Thanks Bill. As we wrap-up I'd like to share with my thoughts are with our Pulsafeeder team and Punta Gorda, Florida. Who continue to cope with the aftermath of Hurricane Ian? All our employees are safe and our values shine through as our other IDEX businesses banded together to provide release supplies to our colleagues there and our IDEX Foundation Board of Directors approved a large donation to the American Red Cross. Our facility did sustain some damage, but we have returned to operations. I would also like to extend my public congratulations to Katrina Helmkamp who has replaced Bill Cook as the non-executive chair of our Board of Directors. Bill Grogan and I have both worked closely with Katrina since she joined our Board in 2015, and we look forward to continuing to lever her strong operating leadership skills and experience across multiple markets and technologies to drive IDEX forward. I'd also like to thank Bill Cook, who has been an invaluable contributor to our company, our board, and my personal development throughout his 14-year tenure. With that I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Good morning, Mike. Yes. I mean, well you hit a lot of the elements there. I mean, there's a piece of this that we always suspected was going to be there as we start to come off of incredibly high backlog positions, especially for a short cycle, quick lead time business like ourselves. So there's a piece of it that no doubt will be that, and we'll keep an eye on the rate of travel of it as it runs out. There is some summer \u2013 kind of summer month seasonality that that's in there as well. I would say from a categorical softness standpoint, probably the one area we'd point to it covers a lot of IDEX businesses would be just some general softening on the European front, which probably isn't too surprising. And then I know, I'm sure we'll talk later here about projects \u2013 large projects and things of that nature. That's an interesting story. I mean they were, at the beginning of this whole recovery, I mean, there was a lot of caution on people's parts, sort of held them back, I think in the middle part or a lot of the duration, honestly there was just not enough time and energy to get at it or resources. And now you're kind of seeing that tilt back probably more of a cautionary tone again. We've got a few things that have moved out and placed themselves decisions into Q1 of next year, things of that nature as well. So a few things that we can point to. Some things that are sort of normal based on where we are from a backlog position and time of year, but underneath and around all of that really, really strong support across the board. Yes. Well look, I think as I said in the prepared remarks, you could see a few paths that would run out here. I mean, one that's more positive, something that's short-term and kind of a short term pullback and then obviously maybe something with a catalyst that's more negative that none of us can imagine. I just always come back, when we talk about that in the company, I mean, we literally scenario play every one of those. We understand kind of what's variable, what's not variable across all our businesses. We always go back to the top growth that's in the company, almost all of which we can kind of see traveling across the duration here. We factor that in as well. We've certainly learned a lot like every company of about how low you can take discretionary spend, in many ways lower than we would've thought possible before. We know where that floor is and kind of how we would stack that against any of those scenarios. We've talked for a while on the headcount side, we'd be careful. Talent is hard to get, I mean, we're not really at a flush position there anyways. We're actually still pretty lean and we'd be very careful there. And then honestly we would \u2013 we would rotate towards the strong and we'd go pretty lean on areas that are weaker. And so, I want to be too predictive here because I think it's still pretty variable in our minds but our approach to each one of those paths is not, we actually know exactly what that is. Thank you. Hey Nathan. Yes. No, definitely. As you said in the prepared remarks we're back to our historical levels here in the third quarter as we continue to ramp, our price capture, inflation hasn't gone down but it's moderated a bit. So as we look forward to the stickiness of the price that we implemented here as we progressed through 2022, that's sticking in in 2023 optimistic about our ability to keep above our historical levels. Yes. They're still really strong. I mean they have held steady many \u2013 in many places and there's four or five of them. We've done a really nice job on putting some strategic inventory together. Our natural ability to replenish fast has allowed us to go capture some share and some orders and then turned them and converted them to sales pretty quick on top of it. So no real pressure signs coming from that very short cycle stuff that, that we always talk about. We look at that constantly that's holding up, there's still an awful lot of demand for it. A lot of capacity that's got to lay in and it's always been pretty indicative of kind of the level that the industrial machine is working at because a lot of it is one-for-one replacement. And I think, I mean all of our plants are working pretty fast and I suspect that's the case out in a lot of the places we supply to. So that's holding up well. Yes. Look the third quarter was the, first time in the last several that we actually didn't build incremental inventory and we've start. We've stabilized our current levels and looked to bleed here in the fourth quarter progressing into the first half of next year. Obviously we've set our long-term goal is to be at over 100% cash flow conversion and I think we'll progress to that level over the next couple quarters. First half is always a little bit light from a cash flow perspective on timing and we're more back half loaded. But we look to continue to progress inventory balances down here over the next six months. Thanks Nathan. Hi Deane. Yes. That's the end of it. I mean, there's small \u2013 some small shipments here in the fourth quarter, but fundamentally it was an initiative that we started and highlighted back in 2020. We partnered with that customer and had a great relationship relative to the partnership on developing the technology and them committing a significant amount of capital to support our production capabilities. And obviously as they've moved in a different direction and got out of the testing, cause the impairment and then the recognition of all that deferred revenue here within the quarter. So most of the noises is they have been taken here in the third quarter. We've kind of moved past with significant knowledge gained in terms of production capabilities and technology that we'll continue to leverage as we move forward. Sure. No. I'd appreciate the question. What I was really trying to emphasize in the remarks is we were looking for a leader with frankly experience, scale and depth of experiences and in the broad reach, which would line-up well with where we want to go as a company. And so that that by sort of combining those businesses at least under her watch, it allows us to essentially position the skill, attract somebody of that caliber and put somebody on the team that's honestly got some experience in some of the areas where we want to go. That it's completely about that. Everything else underneath Melissa is identical to what we've seen before. We've kept it very separate and distinct. We run it exactly the same, but it allows one person to come onto the team with some very, very good capabilities. Hi Brett. And October pretty consistent with what we saw on Q3. Hey Vlad. Sure. Well, there is probably two elements of there I want to cover. There is one that I would argue we kind of carry most days. We generally have shorter lead times than a lot of the people we compete against when things are in normal state. I mean, we've engineered the businesses to run that way and its kind of all set up there. What's actually happened for us here with a lot of the share capture over the last couple of quarters is we made some really sharp calls on some inventory that's pretty specific, highly technical and not in wide supply. We could see some things come in the businesses to their credit without frankly approval loops and things that we don't need in a company like ours, they said, hey, we know how critical this is, we can kind of see where it's going to go, we're going to lay some in. And so almost all of the share capture that we talk about, you can kind of take it right back into very specialized material that we accumulated. So I think that's important because otherwise you might just think it's very benign stuff and metal bits and brackets and things like that where we just have to have them laying around. That actually would normalize as things improve. This is actually very, very strategic inventory that these businesses accumulated. So that's an advantage state out of the gate. That's what we're largely referring to here. But then as we go and things normalize, we normalize and maintain that advantage, the natural advantage we have in many of our businesses. So it's just an area that we always emphasize. It's kind of been dramatically positive for us because of really, really good choices in businesses. Well, yes, I mean, there are certainly components of outperformance that are here. So, I'm glad that you are bringing that up. I mean, our pricing is the highest level we've had out throughout the year. We've been pushing that continuously. This is the kind of environment where our differentiated products are going to command the highest level of pricing. So, that is no doubt a component and it's competitively advantaged.  We talk a lot about the top bets in the company, the top best growth bets. They are of the highest quality we've had. And so interspersed in all of the numbers that we're talking about, you see great things like broadband, and outer space and things we're doing in genomics and some of the things going on in water and precision ag and through FMT and now some acceleration that we've been waiting for and the Fire businesses and FSD, so those bets are layered in with higher unit of measures than we've seen historically on top of recovering markets and well-positioned businesses. That's kind of the entitlement that we have. Really strong price capture and a great stack up of \u2013 that's across the company. Thank you. Good morning. Yes. Well, it's a business we've known for a few years. It's very much an IDEX business. I mean, it's a highly precise, niche component doing wonderful jobs for a variety of high-end markets, including the ones that we had identified in the prepared remarks. I gave a lot of credit to Marc Uleman, who I referenced in my opening remarks. It's a Netherlands-based business. Marc is located in the Netherlands, and he kept a very active cadence with this team over the last few years. We found a time and a space where we were able to generate some actionability and got the deal done mainly because we could get our head around it very, very quickly based on the work we've done over the last few years and our familiarity with it. What's great about a business like this one is, and the reason I say it's so IDEX-like, is it's actually very tuneable. It's one of the reasons we like these precise components businesses. So, it pings into some very high quality areas of semicon, there is some great applications in medical devices, food production, high-end food production, all areas that we study and participate in across the business. So we can leverage that insights and then apply it on a high quality niche business like this one. Longer, turn down the road this actually sits next to a lot of things we have in our Scientific Fluidics & Optics. So there is some commercial relationships that we could leverage there. There is actually some very interesting technical questions and things that we're going to explore together over a longer duration. And then honestly, when we think of value creation, we start to apply the way we run things at IDEX. You can take a high quality business like that, we would start with 80-20. It's not all applications are created equal. We have a way of thinking about that that we can teach to others, things like value capture with customers. I mean, we do that really well. And so there is a whole bunch of leverageable assets as well, just that you apply against an already very, very strong business that's got a demonstrated history of growth. So, I think, we're really, really excited about it. I think it's indicative of the kind of things that we're looking at and looking for. And yes, we'll see, we'll certainly talk to you about it as we go. Yes. No, I mean, it's a little larger than we've seen before. But I mean, the nature of these kind of high quality niches, they tend to be in very similar spaces and the kind of the top end of the size of them is actually relatively constant across even the wide variety of businesses that we have. So, a well-positioned business that's closer to the top end in a high quality niche like we think about is often this size. So it's a little higher than we've seen before but there is certainly more of them like it out there. Thank you. Sure. I think we look for FSD to continue its ramp. We had said last quarter had bottomed out, it will continue to progress as we move forward. With the caveat that we still need to assess the project funnel for next year for dispensing. Right now we don't think there is a huge hole. There will be some softness on the replenishment side. If we weren't able to fill some of those larger projects that would put a little bit of pressure on FSD's margins relative to the progress that fire and rescue has made. So right now we're still evaluating the impact of what the project funnel is for dispensing and obviously give you more detail here as we get into the guide in January. I mean, from a share capture and things we're able to do, I mean... I think it's a small amount. Scott, I think, we've stabilized relative to our production output levels as you look at where we've been from a revenue perspective, it's slightly elevated. So, a point or two at most, we've burned a little bit of backlog the quarter, but backlog position is still pretty high. I mean, it's a good market. I always remind people that the work that we do there is on the analytical side of supporting whether the infrastructure's ability to work well. So that kind of work, I mean it maps well with a lot of the digital solutions that are out there. That's where some of our more digital businesses are. So robot crawlers and flow monitoring to prevent overflows and things that could harm the environment, that's the work that we're doing. The bulk of it. Of course, made an acquisition to deepen that here recently. So we've got some very good assets that in. We think long-term, obviously there is no question the work needs to be done. It's long overdue. There is a decent amount of stimulus and government support that's out there that always takes longer to find its way into projects than people imagine. But that frankly extends it over multiple years or two. So, just we kind of put that in a positive side. I would agree on the green shoot side of it. We are very, very well positioned. We're continuing integration work with the acquisition that we have to deepen all of it in our major geographies. And we view it as very favorable. Thank you. Hi, Michael. Yes, well, I think, our energy businesses have recovered pretty nicely throughout the year. I mean, we've seen a few \u2013 we don't have a ton of upstream presence, but that's been stronger here lately. I think the midstream has got some delays and things on the project side and supply chain, some of the classic stuff, but probably lines up behind it, because there are some things that are overdue there. I mean we've got kind of a classic custody transfer business, a lot of it is fossil fuel dependent with the current assets. A lot of that technology, we're actually asking all the questions, as you might imagine, of how transferable it is to other alternate energy sources and things that might be out there. Whatever it is, whether it's hydrogen or some other gases and liquids, it's going to need \u2013 people are going to need to get paid and we're going to need to measure that custody transfer happens. And that's kind of work that we long have done and are excited about. There are actually other areas of IDEX that map against some of those same vectors in a way that's probably would strike folks in the outside is kind of unusual as well. That's one of the ways we think of a trend like that is we kind of draw lines and tentacles into different verticals within IDEX and then we sort of leverage insight around how the work is done, how things are shaping up, and then distribute it across a variety of IDEX businesses that might be involved. They may not be going to market together, they might not even be in the same room, but actually some of the same dynamics are meaningful for them in terms of why they would want to invest in it. So it's an area of interest for us in terms of how this will ultimately play out over time. But I think for now the kind of core things that we have are doing pretty well with a decent road and runway ahead. I mean, we got some great projects there. They, as you might imagine, go very, very niche very, very quickly. As an example, we've got a great application that makes sure that when you offload a rail car with propane you get all of it out of the bottom. I mean, seems kind of funny, you did suspect, everybody would suspect that actually happens, it doesn't. So our team developed something that guarantees that 100% of the fuel is taken out of the car, and then that's available as productivity for a variety of people. So it's that kind of work that's sort of the \u2013 that's the unit of measure of things we think about and develop for customers. And there are others along the way, but that's just one we happen to take a look at about a month ago that's really, really interesting. Well, thanks. I appreciate the comments and the reflection on what we think was a very strong quarter here. For any of the IDEX team members are listening, I want to thank you all again personally for your hard work. Certainly difficult circumstances, a lot of change happening quarter-over-quarter, month-over-month. But as I said in the end of my remarks, this is a company where we really lean into that. Anytime the world gets difficult, the problem is worth solving. And we solve them, with well positioned businesses, I mean, it's a huge financial benefit for ourselves and our shareholders. So thanks for your interest. Look forward to talking to you more along the way."

Before we begin, a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to safe harbor language in last night's press release and in IDEX' filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  With that, I'll now turn this call over to our CEO and President, Eric Ashleman.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you, Allison, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6. IDEX delivered outstanding results in the second quarter. We achieved record sales levels, 12% organic growth supported by double-digit contributions from each of our operating segments. Our backlog grew by 43 million, and we now sit at record levels to continue momentum into Q3. Core profitability continues to be strong even as we return to more normal discretionary spend levels, allowing us to fully invest in our best growth investments.  We delivered record adjusted EPS of $2.02, an increase of 15% over the prior year's second quarter. Last quarter, I described how our IDEX teams leveraged 8020 to accelerate throughput within a challenging supply chain environment. That positive momentum continued in the second quarter as our teams improve their ability to execute and deliver for our customers.  Our decentralized operating model, which aligns decision-making at the point of impact close to the customer, drives the speed and agility required for us to outperform. Our lead times were a competitive advantage and enabled share gain in pockets across the company.  Inflationary pressures remain, but the rate of increase decelerated, while we continue to capture price equivalent with our differentiation. Gross price capture increased and we expanded our price/cost spread trending back towards historic levels.  We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy and M&A remains a top priority for us. This quarter, we closed on the acquisition of KZValve, a complement to our agriculture business within FMT. Our pipeline is strong, and we continue to evaluate opportunities in higher-growth markets that support our style of competition. We have a healthy balance sheet and are confident that we can continue to put our capital to work.  We're also deploying capital organically across our portfolio to drive operational efficiencies and increase capacity to support our growth. We continue to make investments in commercial, engineering and M&A resources that enable us to execute on our strategy.  During the quarter, we increased our share repurchases and deployed $88 million to buy back 475,000 shares of IDEX stock. We remain disciplined with our methodology to create long-term value for shareholders when we see a disconnect between our intrinsic assessment of IDEX enterprise value and our public valuation.  Lastly, in the second quarter, our Board approved an 11% increase in our dividend. Rising interest rates, continued inflation and geopolitical dynamics all present some uncertainty for us as we consider and head into the second half of the year, but we're not yet seeing any major signals of near-term slowing within our commercial environments. We have good line of sight to the next 90 days, and we continue to see strength in almost all our end markets.  As we look across the industries we serve and our portfolio of differentiated technologies, we're confident that IDEX is well positioned to outperform during any short-term market volatility. It's been a really strong first half of the year, and our teams have a lot to be proud of, but it's not easy to overdeliver in this environment. I'd like to thank our IDEX employees around the globe for their hard work, diligence and agility as they execute for all our stakeholders.  With that, let me turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results.\nWilliam Grogan: Thanks, Eric. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 8. Q2 orders of 839 million were up 12% overall and up 7% organically. We experienced strong orders growth in HST and FMT, but saw contraction in FSD driven by dispensing North America's strong replenishment orders received last year. Second quarter sales of $796 million were up 16% overall and up 12% organically. We experienced record sales with double-digit increases across all 3 of our segments.  Second quarter operating margin was 23.4%, up 30 basis points compared to prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 23.8%, down 60 basis points. Incremental amortization related to Airtech, Nexsight and KZValve acquisitions unfavorably impacted adjusted operating margin by 80 basis points.  Second quarter net income was $138 million, which resulted in EPS of $1.81. Adjusted net income was $154 million, resulting in an adjusted EPS of $2.02, up $0.27 or 15% over prior year. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $97 million or 63% of adjusted net income. This reflects higher accounts receivables driven by the significant increase in sales versus last year as well as elevated inventory levels. Inventory has increased to buffer supply chain challenges and leveraged material availability as a competitive tool to take share in the market. We have spent a lot of time with our teams reviewing their inventory reduction plans and are targeting to bleed down our inventory positions in the second half of the year.  Moving on to Slide 9, which details the drivers of our adjusted operating income. Second quarter adjusted operating income increased $23 million compared to last year. Our 12% organic growth contributed approximately $22 million flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. We levered well on the volume increase. Our teams drove operational productivity, and we had strong price capture to offset inflation headwinds. Price cost was accretive to margins and is trending towards our historic levels.  We experienced positive mix of $2 million across the portfolio. We reinvested $4 million, mainly in the form of engineering and commercial resources, to drive long-term growth and additional resources to support our accelerated M&A activity. Lastly, discretionary spending increased by $9 million versus last year and up $7 million versus the first quarter of 2022. Our teams across the globe are back to in-person partnering with our customers, actively marketing our products and investing to support innovation.  As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we do not expect this level of sequential increase to continue. We've now ramped to our pre-pandemic spending rate, but on significantly higher sales. Our organic flow-through was 23%, in line with the flow-through expectations we set at the beginning of the year, but most likely the lowest rate we will experience this year. Flow-through is then negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX getting us to a reported flow-through of 21%.  With that, I'd like to provide a deeper look at our segment performance. I'm on Page 10. In our Fluid & Metering Technologies segment, we experienced a strong second quarter for both orders and sales with organic growth of 8% and 13%, respectively. FMT adjusted operating margin expanded by 170 basis points versus last year. The increase included 60 basis points of headwind due to incremental amortization related to the Nexsight and KZValve acquisitions.  Volume leverage, strong operational productivity and favorable price costs were the main drivers of the increased adjusted operating margin. Our industrial markets are exhibiting stable demand with consistent quote activity over the last few quarters. We are seeing small to midsized projects coming through in the oil and gas and petrochemical markets as well as in applications tied to mining, asphalt and lithium-ion battery production.  Agriculture continues to perform well. Farmers are experiencing record inflation and look to our technology and precision ag to drive productivity. The KZValve integration is going extremely well, and our automation project at Banjo is on track.  Market conditions remain favorable in our municipal water business. We continue to see a strong commercial funnel and long-term optimism, driven by government funding and ESG initiatives. On the energy side, upstream markets are experiencing healthy demand with oil prices providing strong support. Midstream investments have yet to see a bump in activity due to customer supply chain constraints and caution our long-term price sustainability.  Moving on to Health & Science/Technology. Stellar commercial performance continues with organic orders up 13% and organic sales up 12%. HST adjusted operating margin contracted by 130 basis points versus the second quarter of 2021. Incremental amortization related to the Airtech acquisition unfavorably impacted adjusted operating margin by 130 basis points.  Additionally, adjusted operating margin was driven by strong volume leverage and positive price cost, partially offset by increased employee-related costs, discretionary spending and resource investments. HST continues to benefit from strong secular growth trends within life science, analytical instrumentation, semiconductor and food and pharma markets. The life sciences market is experiencing strong demand for next-gen sequencing instruments and consistent core diagnostic market performance. Analytical instrumentation and material processing results remain strong on continued pharma and biopharma demand.  On the semiconductor side, we continue to see growth, but at a slower pace. We've been able to offer shorter lead times than our competitors, enabling share gain across a variety of applications. We continue to see strong growth in our optics businesses tied to broadband satellite technology and strength in our industrial businesses similar to the FMT results.  Finally, turning to our Fire & Safety/Diversified product segment. Orders contracted by 5%, but sales were strong with an organic increase of 11%. FSD adjusted operating margin contracted by 280 basis points versus the second quarter of last year. This was driven by higher volume being more than offset by higher employee-related costs and discretionary spending as well as pressure on price cost due to aged OEM backlogs on the fire side and automotive exposure with more metal content within BAND-IT.  As we noted in prior calls, we have taken action to address this gap and expect the price/cost will improve in the second half of 2022 as those increases pull through our backlog. Our dispensing business performed well, driven by delivery of North American project volume and an overall positive global paint market.  BAND-IT had strong results across the industrial, automotive and oil and gas markets. On the automotive side, we continue to outperform the market and capture share on new platforms. In Energy, we see strong downhole market demand and capture share due to material availability with shorter lead times for our customers.  Within Fire & Safety, we are seeing strong demand with our E3 rescue tools. On the fire side, core North American and European markets remain choppy due to OEM supply chain constraints, but we are starting to see some modest improvement.  With that, I'll like to provide an outlook for the third quarter and our full year 2022 results. I'm on Slide 11, which lays out our updated guidance. For the third quarter of 2022, we are projecting organic revenue growth of 9% to 10% and operating margin of approximately 24%. Q3 forecasted op margin is up slightly versus second quarter due to improved price cost, partially offset by lower seasonal volume leverage. We expect GAAP EPS to range from $1.80 to $1.85 and adjusted EPS to range from $1.98 to $2.03.  Turning to the full year. Given our strong performance in the first half of the year, we are raising our full year guidance. We now expect full year organic revenue growth of approximately 10%. This reflects our confidence in line of sight for the third quarter, but some caution in the fourth quarter due to the short-cycle nature of our business. We expect GAAP EPS to range between $7.19 to $7.29 and adjusted EPS to range from $7.88 to $7.98. Our operating margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 24%.  We are expecting free cash flow as a percent of adjusted net income to range from 75% to 80%, down from our previous guidance. With our higher revenue expectations for the back half of the year, elevating our year-end receivables balance and a slower-than-expected inventory bleed, this is our best estimate as we head into the second half of the year.  Our long-term goal remains to be above 100% and consider the current guidance a reflection of the volatile external environment versus a structural shift in our cash generation capabilities.  With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird.\nMichael Halloran: So let's start with the comment, Eric, that you said you're really not seeing anything yet in terms of deterioration. Things are going well, and you can certainly hear that from all the end market commentary you guys gave. And then balance that with the guidance outlook that says you're taking a little bit more of a cautious outlook into the fourth quarter given short-cycle business and you don't know what you don't know.  So -- maybe just talk about those 2 competing things and what things you're looking for in your portfolio to say that things are going to keep this pace, maybe decelerate, could be the BAND-IT business, could be something else, but would love to kind of compare and contrast, all that stuff?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. Well, thanks. So we're always looking at what we refer to as our canaries in the coal mine businesses. Those are the shortest cycle, more industrial businesses that are very, very close to the actual consumption that's going on out there in the industrial landscape.  And those have held up really, really well. I mean, I think that's the story of this whole post-pandemic recovery is just the industrial system that's been working feverishly to try to catch up. So that, for us, is always something that we're looking at first to see if there's an indicator of weakness there that usually sends up a signal and then you start to see things come after that.  And so far, as I said in the comments, that's holding in. And then I'm sure we'll talk about this more in the call, but then we balance that with some of the exposure we have across a whole host of markets on the project side. That's more of an indicator for us of overall future confidence where how people are tilting towards uncertainty, those things.  And there's a couple of places where we've seen that slow down. I mean, it's an interesting story overall, where in many ways, it's -- that kind of business has just struggled to get traction in this whole recovery cycle. But other than a few indicators and pockets there, we're sending point out a bit further into the future, we sort of keep a look at all of those and then look at our own backlog support on top of all of it that gives us at least the assurance in the short term. And of course, we'll always adjust that and recalibrate it, and that's the joy of a short cycle business. You can do that pretty quick.\nWilliam Grogan: Yes. And just to frame that, I mean our implied guidance, like, is kind of a 1 percentage sequential deceleration in Q4. So it's small, just a little bit of noise that could potentially be out there. But right now, what we have line of sight to and the confidence in our order patterns, we still think the back half is going to be really strong.\nMichael Halloran: No, that makes sense. And I think you said the backlog built in the quarter by $39 million, something like that. Is that -- are you seeing lead times extend come in? Is that more a reflection of that underlying order strength through the quarter? Maybe just talk a little bit about the backlog piece.\nEric Ashleman: I mean, it's really broad-based. We're looking at the other day to see if it was kind of in pockets and chunks, and it's not. I mean, it's kind of layered across a lot of things.  Our lead times in aggregate are holding or decelerating. I mean, we made a comment there that we are seeing some pockets where frankly, our advantaged lead times that are reducing are giving us some opportunity to go grab some share in things. So I'd say on balance, we're not doing anything to drive that in the wrong direction. It's going in the right direction. And the backlog build is very, very broad-based.\nMichael Halloran: Last question for me. You made a comment there that you invested to support accelerated M&A processes. Is that a reflection of a pretty healthy pipeline? I know the environment has gotten a little more challenging on the M&A side. So I would like to understand what you're seeing and what you hope those investments could get you.\nEric Ashleman: Yes. I'd say -- I mean, look, I think the environment for high-quality assets is held up pretty well as we've gone through this. But a lot of this is very deliberate work on our part to say that we want to go deeper, frankly, into our insight into those sort of concentric circles that surround our best applications.  So there's a purposeful step-up in work of that type, in both resources and some things we're doing with third-party analytics to make sure that we understand it as well as we can, in an environment that so far is holding up pretty well for high-quality assets.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Maybe we could start with the free cash flow guidance cut there. And look, we're seeing this across the sector. This is getting to be pretty familiar, but the idea of carrying more buffer inventory and then the expectation with all this demand likely resulting in higher receivables towards year-end. So we get the way the math works. But Bill, can you expand on the time frame for bleeding the inventory down? I guess it really does depend on how the supply chain begins to normalize. But just take us through the math on that.\nWilliam Grogan: Yes. No, I think that's exactly right. As we sit here now and lead times, as Eric just talked about on our side are improving, we're starting to see that across the broader aspects of our supply chain. So our increased purchases to buffer some of the longer lead times to continue to deliver for our customers is shrinking.  Now it's just catching up with our production and getting that through our system. So -- as we look at third quarter, there will be some improvement, but more material decreases in the fourth quarter leading into the first part of next year.  So again, we've spent a lot of time with the teams to understand and calibrate around still having this robust demand, measuring what our vendors and their capabilities are from a lead time perspective and then drawing down our open POs, and then increasing the throughput as we have here in the second quarter to the first and maintaining that as we progress through the back half of the year.\nDeane Dray: Is there anything on product shortages, semiconductor-related where your inventory is -- you've got nearly finished goods, but they're waiting on a particular product that's adding to your inventory? Is that an issue at all?\nWilliam Grogan: Yes. That is a component as we've had customers who other suppliers for them haven't then is capable to produce have held up some of their receipts. So we have finished goods at a higher level than we have had historically because of issues our customers are facing with other suppliers.\nEric Ashleman: And maybe, Dean, to the extent you were -- I think you were also asking about maybe unfinished things that we have in our own factories or something waiting on a part, much like you see in the auto world.  I mean, I wouldn't say that it's completely devoid of our environment, but you don't see it all that often because we have pretty quick rapid turn one piece flow kind of build so it doesn't do well with something that's half done, there's really nowhere to put it. And our production process is quick enough, you're better off not starting it just because in general, most of our businesses, that's how we produce things.\nDeane Dray: That's helpful color there. Because you do hear like for the autos, where they've got all these cars lined up that still need semiconductors and...\nEric Ashleman: We wouldn't put a pump or something into the build schedule because we'll make 40 of them in a couple of hours, those kind of things.\nDeane Dray: Good. Last question for me, Eric, you kind of begged the question earlier to Mike's when he's asking about the macro, you said there are some pockets of slowing on projects. So -- and absolutely, that's a reflection of kind of what we say CEO confidence.  Are they going to move ahead? I think you made a reference to midstream, and we've heard plenty of that. It just really hasn't realized in full kind of spending given oil prices. But where and how would you describe some of these pockets of projects slowing or just not getting the release that you thought you were going to get?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. I'd say probably more of the second category, not getting the release or not coming on the line, something we've been thinking about or projecting for a while now and some of these just get extended out.  So you mentioned the midstream side. I mean, there's some pockets in our chemical markets exposure, maybe more on the European side than elsewhere. A little bit in the paint dispensing area. We're just kind of coming off the end of a big replenishment cycle there. And then a few things in just specific industrial markets, food expansion, places like that.  I mean, they're pretty isolated. It's not a massive part of our business, but they're good indicators, things to watch. And I would just say it's been interesting over the cycle here is this category never really took off. I think in the beginning, it was very much clouded with uncertainty. The nature of the recovery, then it turned into a kind of a bandwidth issue.  Can anybody put together the materials or the time and energy to work on it? Maybe here in the later innings of it, it's sort of all of those factors. Uncertainty creeping in back a bit, the bandwidth issue is still there and now inflation and the cost of these projects is causing some recalibration for -- in certain markets where people have to kind of go back and run the math again.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak: Keeping in line with that project comment. I know you talked verticals, but is it any like weighted towards a specific geography? Or does it seem very broad-based by vertical at this point just in terms of what you're seeing?\nEric Ashleman: Well, I mean, I'd say broad-based in terms of the way I just described it. I mean, we are seeing a bit more geographic strength in North America than Europe for all the reasons I think we would suspect in terms of things people are watching there on the geopolitical side, the energy side, those things. But both are positive for us. But if I had to call it, I would say, a little bit more positive on the North American side than Europe.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. And then just kind of going back to the free cash flow and just CapEx in general, tepid start to sort of the approach to that $90 million. You talked about Banjo and then investment in emerging markets. I mean, are those still on track? Or do you kind of risk that some of that gets pushed to next year just because of the uncertainty right now?\nWilliam Grogan: No, that's what's going to drive the increased spend in the back half. We're expecting both the India and China facilities to open later this year. And then Banjo I think is kind of late third quarter, early fourth quarter.  So there's -- those projects, I think, are on track. Obviously, that's a subset of the $60 million ramp -- $30 million ramp, $60 million spend in the back half that. Relative to supply chain delays and things, we have seen some items smaller as pushed from the first half to the second. So there's a little bit of play in that number. But for the large ones, we're confident that those will hit here in the next couple of months.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Worthermeier with Melius Research.\nRobert Wertheimer: My question is just a little bit more on M&A. Can you talk about just what the feel is like from potential sellers out there, whether -- I don't know whether things get repriced as you kind of edge through different parts of the process and the market is corrected and interest rates are higher? I don't know if there's a standoff as people adjust to different pricing or not? And then any comment you'd make on how big your funnel and kind of pipeline are versus prior periods?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. So as I said before, I mean, all this is bracketed a bit by the step up in intentionality and work that we're doing. So in that respect, again, there's a lot of things we're looking at, a lot of analysis that we're doing and a lot of conversations that we're having.  You would say our -- that just activity level is north of where it has been, much of it driven by our work. Now in those conversations, probably much like the conversations you have, there is definitely more discussions around near-term prospects and what's going on with the forecast and how do you see the sales tracking out and to the extent that all links back to valuation, it's just more intense than it has been for all the reasons you'd suspect.  As Bill and I have always said, though, when you're looking at assets of the quality that we look at, you're generally looking at a history that's very sharp, well positioned, driving in strong ways. And then a reasonable projection path, especially if we're the owners that kind of picks that up again.  So -- that doesn't mean that both sides are going to be able to see that and get through it. So that's always a possibility, but our perspective is very long term in nature for the kind of assets that we're looking at. So long story short, more activity on our part, which means I think a strong funnel for us, a lot of activity, engaging with people more near-term discussions around what this all means and where it's going to go, but then kind of just take a deep breath, stare over the horizon and be confident that for quality, I think ideally both sides see it that way and stay engaged.\nRobert Wertheimer: Perfect. And if I can, I guess, follow up on that on the uncertainty and so forth. You touched on backlog earlier. I don't know if you're willing to give any more color on where your backlog stands versus prior cycles or versus prior record levels, et cetera. It seems there's a bit of a standoff and that everybody is uncertain about the future, but the future doesn't look bad currently. I don't know if the backlog will help us triangulate that a bit?\nWilliam Grogan: No, definitely. I mean, our backlog is kind of 2x of what it has been historically. And normally, we'd go into a quarter with 50% of the quarter sales in backlog. We've got close to 2/3 now. So we have a lot more visibility to temper any dramatic short-term falloff.  So again, relative to the next couple of months, we're fairly confident in our numbers. So I don't think there's a huge pause that would come because our backlog could support any short-term decrease in orders.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.\nMatt Summerville: Just a couple of quick questions. With respect to price, can you comment on where you were price realization second quarter year-over-year? And how much incrementally on top of that you expect to realize in the back half? And then I have a follow-up.\nWilliam Grogan: We're a little over 4% here in the second quarter, which ramped from a little over 3% in the first quarter. We don't guide the balance of the year price, but we're really confident in what the teams have gone out with to combat inflation, which seems to have leveled off. So I mentioned we have an expectation that our price cost is going to continue to improve through the back half of the year to support some of our higher-margin profile expectations.\nMatt Summerville: In certain areas of the commodity markets, certainly in metals, steel, aluminum, copper, things have come off their highs pretty materially, still elevated from historical standards, but certainly off-peak. When does some of that start to actually add some incremental benefit to your P&L?\nWilliam Grogan: I would say a couple of things. One, relative to -- we only have a couple of businesses that have direct exposure to commodity prices. From a materiality level, we're buying components that are a couple of phases through that value stream.  So obviously, we didn't have the vast inflation impact on the way in that a lot of other companies did. Again, 4% price increase is still price cost positive, and we're building. So -- that will, I think, wean out over time, it will be a material impact, but we will keep all the incremental pricing that we've had. Again, we've holistically gone out with price increases versus surcharge. So we like where we're positioned here going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.\nJeffrey Sprague: Eric, can we come back to what you said really on deal cultivation, right, in the activity being more of a function of your internal efforts? Maybe you could elaborate on that. Have you significantly up resourced the deal teams? Does this heavy level of activity indicate any interest in kind of pursuing new adjacencies? Just maybe a little bit of kind of strategic and tactical color on what's going on there.\nEric Ashleman: Yes. I mean, we're not a massive center-led kind of organization. Never have been. So this might sound more dramatic than it probably is from a headcount perspective. I mean, it's a few well-positioned ads from the outside work that we're doing on the third-party side. And then frankly, the biggest component is just a higher level of engagement overall business to business. I mean, this is something we've been driving now for a couple of years.  And we really focus to combine growth outperformance on top of our just sort of institutional great well-deserved execution shops. And so a lot of it is that way. In terms of where we're looking and what it looks like, I mean, we've always favored. I always come back to this analogy of concentric circles around these applications that we kind of currently sit in.  We know these environments really well. We know what's to the right or left of us, and the best work for me is really starting to understand where is this market heading, should we make a move slightly left or right and how would we do that.  The recent acquisitions that we've layered into the company are perfect examples of that. As we said before, we're also thinking about the broader world in general and where problems are presenting themselves and where IDEX like styles of competition could come in play, and maybe that would open up a flank for us and some applications that are new to the company. So that's in the mix as well.  But if you really had to overgeneralize it and think of it, think of it as just radiating circles from the best parts of the company with more intensity, a lot of it from the ground up. That's the way we like to do it.\nWilliam Grogan: Yes. I think those actions, the depth and quality of the funnel is probably at an all-time high. Like that work that the team has done across a variety of different end market applications, those concentric circles that Eric highlighted, and one of the main reasons why we are so confident in our ability to deploy capital much more consistently as we progress.\nJeffrey Sprague: Great. And unrelated, just back to this -- I mean, everybody's got their hair to the ground trying to snip out an issue with the economy. Any gut feel that actually these improving lead times are actually the canary in the coal mine? And anything happening in just kind of the supply dynamics and kind of order the shipment dynamics or anything that maybe are an earlier precursor of some deceleration?\nEric Ashleman: That's a good question. I mean, it's hard to say, though, because in many ways, we've been running us, others at such a hot level. It's pretty abnormal. Pulling back from that in any way, even if it's just simply the deceleration of the tremendous acceleration we've been feeling is going to have a material noticeable impact inside just how it feels in the business.  But I don't know that, that's the same thing as a broader call on economic conditions, maybe more than it's just, okay, it's not at peak levels. We can catch a breath. We can actually be a little bit more planful, mindful. And that's for us and that's for others as well. So think of it more in those terms but then let's say, since there's nothing else to do, we can get product quicker. I don't see it as an indicator of that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vlad Bystricky with Citigroup.\nVladimir Bystricky: So I just wanted to ask, kind of following up on these macro-related questions. In your businesses that go through distribution, can you give us some color on what you're seeing and hearing in terms of distributor inventories and whether there are any areas where you're more concerned about a potential for destocking in the event of a slowdown?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. Well, I always kind of preface this question with a reminder that we have a lot of configured customized products with quick replenishment, which means not a ton of our inventory on shelves. So it's a small number.  I will say we've got some good visibility to at line of sight minimum. You can see it visually when you go visit them. So you can see some slight increases there for our product. I would assume that's applicable to more stockable components as well.  In our world, we think of that as if ultimately that bleeds off over time, in some ways, it's pretty similar the way that it works in our own business. It takes a while because of the wide variety of SKUs that are out there. None of it's really clumped around a standard solution that if you made a deterministic call on it would just flow out in a big pocket or chunk.  So we think about it a lot for IDEX, mainly just as more of an indicator of health overall. But from a meaningful impact to the numbers up or down, it extends over a large time horizon. It's not a giant piece of the business, and it usually is kind of lost in the math, to be honest.\nVladimir Bystricky: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just stepping back. So you talked about obviously, the intent to bleed down some inventory here over the back half and into '23. But your availability has been, I think, a competitive advantage for you.  So can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of your own supply chain availability and logistics that gives you the confidence to begin to bring down inventory without giving up any of the competitive advantage that you've gained through the recovery?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. Well, I mean, some of it -- the impends are fact-based. So we can see and we track our own -- our suppliers' performance and their lead times and their on-time delivery to us. So you basically start there and say, \"Well, we can see factually some improvement.\" The logistics loops are quite a bit better than where they have been on the first part of the year. And frankly, our teams are really good now, at navigating them when they kind of run astray. I think the biggest thing for us and anybody that wants to go tackle this now is, in some ways, you got to take advantage of the ability to take a breath. I would say as we've improved throughput, momentum, and we're executing stronger here, that does buy us a little bit of time, space and energy to go back and recalibrate the systems, which is what you actually have to do to go attack inventory.  You've got to go change demand signals. That's part by part. It's -- you do it on lines of paper laid out across the desk. And so -- and Bill talked about our engagement with our teams, that's the kind of work we're making sure is happening. People are kind of racking and stacking it 80s to 20s and making the calls based on fact-based patterns that they can see, and taking advantage of the time and energy, they have to go do it.\nWilliam Grogan: And then some of the areas we have been able to take shares, it's because we have an 80 position with that vendor. And we're getting a higher allocation than some of our smaller competitors. So if they don't have the material availability, we're able to go in and take their volume.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.\nNathan Jones: Let's start with a question on Health & Science and the organic order growth that you're seeing there. Everybody is focused on the economy going up and down at the moment but that's a business that's less cyclical for you and still showing extremely strong orders.  Maybe you can just talk in a bit more detail about what's driving those? Are these product cycles that have a specific duration? What the outlook is for continued growth there? Just any more color you can give us on the strength around that business.\nEric Ashleman: Yes. I mean it's exactly the way you described it. I mean it's very much tied to strong trends that we're going to, I think, see run out for quite some time here. So we -- like everything else in IDEX, we break it down into all sorts of little components and drivers and specific application sets. Some of the ones that are going well there, the AI space is healthy.  That's a decent part of the business -- sorry, analytical instrumentation. And then the genomics space has been very, very active. A lot of that is involving initially COVID and COVID surveillance. I think now as the pandemic has kind of moved on and entering in its third year. We're seeing now some more targeted work around taking some of that technology and applying it for things like targeted medicine and all the things that were always out there for that field of study. So those have been healthy as well.  We continue to have some isolated pockets where we do support for vaccines and things of that nature that stayed strong to the duration as they're continuing to work on different targeted vaccines and things like that for both COVID as well as other things. So it's definitely picking up most of the macro dynamics and trends that we have long known are out there, and it's why we spend a lot of time investing in it and talking about it.\nNathan Jones: Maybe one on gross margins. I mean you obviously have very strong gross margins for an industrial company to begin with. They've been pretty consistent over the last few years in this 45%, plus or minus kind of range.  Is there a negative impact that you've seen to gross margins with all of the disruptions around supply chain in COVID that maybe are less related to price cost but modest in efficiencies within your manufacturing that maybe go away that could lead to higher gross margins or anywhere else that you see opportunities to expand gross margins?\nWilliam Grogan: Yes. No, I think the biggest pressure has been price/cost. With 45% gross margins, you have to have a price cost spread well in excess of that to expand. So that has put constant pressure. And then we continue to invest in engineering resources, which to remind everyone, that is included in our gross margin number.  So we've been able to maintain through robust productivity across the portfolio to offset some of those headwinds. So I do think price cost getting back to historical levels and then our continued volume leverage that we get on the high contribution margins we have in our business.  Once we stabilize a little bit from an operations perspective, we'll be able to pull through some increases. With, again, just the very difficult operating environment we've been in, the ability to have discrete productivity projects across the portfolio that we've historically been able to execute on has been muted a little bit too here is another point. So I think as things normalize, we'll get another kicker off of that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Loop Capital.\nScott Graham: Congratulations on what was a really good quarter from you guys. I have one quick one for Bill. Kind of can you give us an idea of where sort of your sales are running OpEx versus CapEx?\nWilliam Grogan: We don't really disclose that externally to be honest. We don't look at it internally. It goes a little bit to the project comment that Eric talked about a little bit earlier. It's not a huge part of our business. So I would say, holistically, most of our projects are OpEx, replacing like-for-like, current IDEX volume and then some incremental market share gains that we have.  The CapEx, we have some specific things that we would be able to realize with plant expansions, new plant creation. But overall, relative to our portfolio, it's not an overly material number. So the short answer would be, holistically, it's more OpEx-related on our sales.\nScott Graham: Got it. So now I want to maybe understand dispensing a little bit. There's a comment in the deck, talks about non-repeat orders, quarter back, maybe 2 quarters back, you talked about how dispensing should weaken fairly materially in the second half of this year. I'm just trying to triangulate what that means now for the second half of the year. How does dispensing look? Is it -- does it look better now or not?\nWilliam Grogan: No, I think it's in line with our expectations that we had at the beginning of the year. I mean orders pressure in the second quarter will have more pressure in the third, but they'll continue to have sales growth in the third quarter with sales finally fallen off a little bit kind of post those replenishment projects in the fourth quarter.  So still a great business. Very global. Still having wins in emerging markets. They're launching new technologies on the software side. So although they're going to lose the replenishment, their core business continues to grow. So it's been cyclical over its life span, but a little bit of pressure here in the short term as those projects roll off. But holistically, lots of additional opportunity through software and emerging markets growth.\nScott Graham: Got it. And if I could just squeeze this last one on the fire business, where the OEMs, your customers are still saying that they're pretty supply chain restrained. Has anything changed in the last couple of quarters there as it's a pretty good business for you guys, particularly now with your having a nice little beachhead in Europe? Could you give us an idea of where that business goes in the next couple of quarters?\nEric Ashleman: Yes, I'd say the headlines there, the supply chain constraints and some of the larger folks that are in that space are still there, still challenging, still fighting that.  I will say that there's kind of smaller to medium specialty players have done a decent job jumping in. So that's helped us a bit, just not the biggest part of the market. We remain really, really focused in that business on technology. So there's only so much we can do to help out on the supply chain side. Eventually, that will come to a better place. As it does, we want to be ready with all of the automation that we've been talking about, not only the pieces that we have in the water path of the mobile platform, but we've got a nozzle now that's got connectivity in it and diagnostics. We're doing the same thing on the rescue tools piece. So we've got some really, really good things there just presented in a giant global show here in the second quarter. So that for us is kind of the longer-term headline on an industry that we think will ultimately start to dial in and improve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Mizuho.\nBrett Linzey: Just wanted to come back to the orders. So the underlying run rates in the quarter very strong, even more encouraging on a 2-year stack basis. What is your expectation for year-over-year order growth in the second half as customers are no longer advanced ordering or some of this backlog in mind? I mean do you think you can grow orders and anything that July would inform you here?\nWilliam Grogan: Obviously, back half, we've got much tougher comps. In the third quarter, at least relative to we have visibility. We think we'll still be positive from an organic perspective, highlighted a little bit of the dispensing pressure that will continue. But overall, IDEX still positive. And from a July perspective, no material changes versus the trends that we've experienced here across the portfolio.\nBrett Linzey: Okay. Great. And then I just was hoping you could spend a moment on the KZValve acquisition, how that performed on a stand-alone basis heading into the close relative to expectations? And then what are you calibrating for accretion within the guidance framework for this year?\nEric Ashleman: Sure. I'll cover kind of the general state of the business, let Bill answer the financial question. So I mean that has been a really, really strong acquisition, strong integration process. It is a very, very close complement to our Banjo franchise in the ag space within FMT.  It's conveniently not very far away. And so the teams have really attacked it. It's performed strong as all our agricultural businesses have both in North America and Europe. And so this has been, in some ways, one of the easier integrations because the commercial linkage is so strong in the business, and everybody is speaking the same -- on the same page with technology and the broader market supports it. So very, very strong out of the gate. Excited on the long-term prospects here, and I'll let Bill talk about the specifics.\nWilliam Grogan: Yes. EPS in the back half, $0.02 to $0.03.\nEric Ashleman: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Anastasio with Cowen.\nUnidentified Analyst: Congrats on the strong quarter. You mentioned the strength you're seeing more broadly, but obviously, the macro is deteriorating. What types of initiatives are you doing internally to prepare for those macro data points, ultimately, if they start impacting the business?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. No, thanks for that. So I mean we've seen a lot of these cycles before. We have kind of a standard way that we look at it. I think -- for us, the first lever would be looking at discretionary spend. We've called that out a few times because we came off a base with almost none of it. Now we are out engaging with customers going to trade shows. So it's elevated a bit.  But we know, frankly, if we learned anything over the last couple of years, you can make it through with a much lower level of discretionary spending. That would be the first lever.  As Bill mentioned, I think there is an opportunity here for a pretty hard look at productivity across a factory setting. If things were to cool off a bit, and we actually got some bandwidth back on the team's perspective, rethought how flow is working, how different product lines are in different positions than where they may have been a couple of years ago.  So we go there next. The one area that might be a little bit different. We have been talking about it a lot is on the headcount side, on the people side. I mean even today, we still have -- we're still looking for people. The war on talent is real. Some of the communities we live and work in, it's been harder to find labor. I mean that's improved here more recently, but it's still -- there's still pressure in that area.  So that's probably the area, given all the focus we have on growing the company long term and that dynamic, we would be the most thoughtful about where we would make choices, investments and things along the way. Otherwise, I'd say it's a pretty familiar process for us. The short-cycle nature helps us get at it fast. And -- so it's never far away the playbook to run that.  Anything, Bill, you'd add there?\nWilliam Grogan: No, I think you said it well. It is -- at least our expectation for decrementals will be a little bit higher than they have been historically because of us relative to current profit levels and the war on talent that Eric highlighted. So maybe we would historically have been in the low 30s. We're probably closer to 40% here if there's a slight pickup here as we progress over the next couple of quarters.\nUnidentified Analyst: That's really helpful. Just one more, if I may. I know we had mentioned orders before, but declining sequentially over the past quarter. What are you seeing from a cadence perspective going forward?\nWilliam Grogan: Yes, I think there's always our first quarter, we generally get our annual blankets from a lot of our customers. So it's generally inflated relative to sequential profile of the balance of the year. So -- that's the real driver from the Q1 to Q2. For us now, it's kind of leveling off with keeping an eye on just our daily order rates, which have sustained here in the month of July.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.\nEric Ashleman: Okay. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining today. We're really, really proud of our first half performance here. And as I close, just -- I guess the one thing I'd want you to take away is it's really a story of \"and\" not \"or\" here at IDEX.  I mean we've long, I think, earned our reputation for tactical execution, good times, difficult times. We're seeing that in the performance that we're addressing here today. And we're working deliberately to drive growth outperformance as an additive component of value creation on top of it.  We basically do that by picking the top bets that align really, really well to the macro trends that are going to be great over the long haul. We rally resources around those. And then here, as I spoke a few times, we very deliberately complemented those efforts with organic and inorganic investments, and we'll continue to do that as we go forward.  So I think you're seeing it play out. We're seeing it play out in the acquisitions we made that celebrate precision ag or alternative energy in the pneumatic space or water solutions and what that can be. So you're seeing that come together. And I just want to highlight the additive component of those 2 things, and we'll continue to talk about that as we move forward. Thanks very much for your interest in joining today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "William Grogan",
            "content": "Thanks, Eric. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 8. Q2 orders of 839 million were up 12% overall and up 7% organically. We experienced strong orders growth in HST and FMT, but saw contraction in FSD driven by dispensing North America's strong replenishment orders received last year. Second quarter sales of $796 million were up 16% overall and up 12% organically. We experienced record sales with double-digit increases across all 3 of our segments.  Second quarter operating margin was 23.4%, up 30 basis points compared to prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 23.8%, down 60 basis points. Incremental amortization related to Airtech, Nexsight and KZValve acquisitions unfavorably impacted adjusted operating margin by 80 basis points.  Second quarter net income was $138 million, which resulted in EPS of $1.81. Adjusted net income was $154 million, resulting in an adjusted EPS of $2.02, up $0.27 or 15% over prior year. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $97 million or 63% of adjusted net income. This reflects higher accounts receivables driven by the significant increase in sales versus last year as well as elevated inventory levels. Inventory has increased to buffer supply chain challenges and leveraged material availability as a competitive tool to take share in the market. We have spent a lot of time with our teams reviewing their inventory reduction plans and are targeting to bleed down our inventory positions in the second half of the year.  Moving on to Slide 9, which details the drivers of our adjusted operating income. Second quarter adjusted operating income increased $23 million compared to last year. Our 12% organic growth contributed approximately $22 million flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. We levered well on the volume increase. Our teams drove operational productivity, and we had strong price capture to offset inflation headwinds. Price cost was accretive to margins and is trending towards our historic levels.  We experienced positive mix of $2 million across the portfolio. We reinvested $4 million, mainly in the form of engineering and commercial resources, to drive long-term growth and additional resources to support our accelerated M&A activity. Lastly, discretionary spending increased by $9 million versus last year and up $7 million versus the first quarter of 2022. Our teams across the globe are back to in-person partnering with our customers, actively marketing our products and investing to support innovation.  As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we do not expect this level of sequential increase to continue. We've now ramped to our pre-pandemic spending rate, but on significantly higher sales. Our organic flow-through was 23%, in line with the flow-through expectations we set at the beginning of the year, but most likely the lowest rate we will experience this year. Flow-through is then negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX getting us to a reported flow-through of 21%.  With that, I'd like to provide a deeper look at our segment performance. I'm on Page 10. In our Fluid & Metering Technologies segment, we experienced a strong second quarter for both orders and sales with organic growth of 8% and 13%, respectively. FMT adjusted operating margin expanded by 170 basis points versus last year. The increase included 60 basis points of headwind due to incremental amortization related to the Nexsight and KZValve acquisitions.  Volume leverage, strong operational productivity and favorable price costs were the main drivers of the increased adjusted operating margin. Our industrial markets are exhibiting stable demand with consistent quote activity over the last few quarters. We are seeing small to midsized projects coming through in the oil and gas and petrochemical markets as well as in applications tied to mining, asphalt and lithium-ion battery production.  Agriculture continues to perform well. Farmers are experiencing record inflation and look to our technology and precision ag to drive productivity. The KZValve integration is going extremely well, and our automation project at Banjo is on track.  Market conditions remain favorable in our municipal water business. We continue to see a strong commercial funnel and long-term optimism, driven by government funding and ESG initiatives. On the energy side, upstream markets are experiencing healthy demand with oil prices providing strong support. Midstream investments have yet to see a bump in activity due to customer supply chain constraints and caution our long-term price sustainability.  Moving on to Health & Science/Technology. Stellar commercial performance continues with organic orders up 13% and organic sales up 12%. HST adjusted operating margin contracted by 130 basis points versus the second quarter of 2021. Incremental amortization related to the Airtech acquisition unfavorably impacted adjusted operating margin by 130 basis points.  Additionally, adjusted operating margin was driven by strong volume leverage and positive price cost, partially offset by increased employee-related costs, discretionary spending and resource investments. HST continues to benefit from strong secular growth trends within life science, analytical instrumentation, semiconductor and food and pharma markets. The life sciences market is experiencing strong demand for next-gen sequencing instruments and consistent core diagnostic market performance. Analytical instrumentation and material processing results remain strong on continued pharma and biopharma demand.  On the semiconductor side, we continue to see growth, but at a slower pace. We've been able to offer shorter lead times than our competitors, enabling share gain across a variety of applications. We continue to see strong growth in our optics businesses tied to broadband satellite technology and strength in our industrial businesses similar to the FMT results.  Finally, turning to our Fire & Safety/Diversified product segment. Orders contracted by 5%, but sales were strong with an organic increase of 11%. FSD adjusted operating margin contracted by 280 basis points versus the second quarter of last year. This was driven by higher volume being more than offset by higher employee-related costs and discretionary spending as well as pressure on price cost due to aged OEM backlogs on the fire side and automotive exposure with more metal content within BAND-IT.  As we noted in prior calls, we have taken action to address this gap and expect the price/cost will improve in the second half of 2022 as those increases pull through our backlog. Our dispensing business performed well, driven by delivery of North American project volume and an overall positive global paint market.  BAND-IT had strong results across the industrial, automotive and oil and gas markets. On the automotive side, we continue to outperform the market and capture share on new platforms. In Energy, we see strong downhole market demand and capture share due to material availability with shorter lead times for our customers.  Within Fire & Safety, we are seeing strong demand with our E3 rescue tools. On the fire side, core North American and European markets remain choppy due to OEM supply chain constraints, but we are starting to see some modest improvement.  With that, I'll like to provide an outlook for the third quarter and our full year 2022 results. I'm on Slide 11, which lays out our updated guidance. For the third quarter of 2022, we are projecting organic revenue growth of 9% to 10% and operating margin of approximately 24%. Q3 forecasted op margin is up slightly versus second quarter due to improved price cost, partially offset by lower seasonal volume leverage. We expect GAAP EPS to range from $1.80 to $1.85 and adjusted EPS to range from $1.98 to $2.03.  Turning to the full year. Given our strong performance in the first half of the year, we are raising our full year guidance. We now expect full year organic revenue growth of approximately 10%. This reflects our confidence in line of sight for the third quarter, but some caution in the fourth quarter due to the short-cycle nature of our business. We expect GAAP EPS to range between $7.19 to $7.29 and adjusted EPS to range from $7.88 to $7.98. Our operating margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 24%.  We are expecting free cash flow as a percent of adjusted net income to range from 75% to 80%, down from our previous guidance. With our higher revenue expectations for the back half of the year, elevating our year-end receivables balance and a slower-than-expected inventory bleed, this is our best estimate as we head into the second half of the year.  Our long-term goal remains to be above 100% and consider the current guidance a reflection of the volatile external environment versus a structural shift in our cash generation capabilities.  With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions. Yes. And just to frame that, I mean our implied guidance, like, is kind of a 1 percentage sequential deceleration in Q4. So it's small, just a little bit of noise that could potentially be out there. But right now, what we have line of sight to and the confidence in our order patterns, we still think the back half is going to be really strong. Yes. No, I think that's exactly right. As we sit here now and lead times, as Eric just talked about on our side are improving, we're starting to see that across the broader aspects of our supply chain. So our increased purchases to buffer some of the longer lead times to continue to deliver for our customers is shrinking.  Now it's just catching up with our production and getting that through our system. So -- as we look at third quarter, there will be some improvement, but more material decreases in the fourth quarter leading into the first part of next year.  So again, we've spent a lot of time with the teams to understand and calibrate around still having this robust demand, measuring what our vendors and their capabilities are from a lead time perspective and then drawing down our open POs, and then increasing the throughput as we have here in the second quarter to the first and maintaining that as we progress through the back half of the year. Yes. That is a component as we've had customers who other suppliers for them haven't then is capable to produce have held up some of their receipts. So we have finished goods at a higher level than we have had historically because of issues our customers are facing with other suppliers. No, that's what's going to drive the increased spend in the back half. We're expecting both the India and China facilities to open later this year. And then Banjo I think is kind of late third quarter, early fourth quarter.  So there's -- those projects, I think, are on track. Obviously, that's a subset of the $60 million ramp -- $30 million ramp, $60 million spend in the back half that. Relative to supply chain delays and things, we have seen some items smaller as pushed from the first half to the second. So there's a little bit of play in that number. But for the large ones, we're confident that those will hit here in the next couple of months. No, definitely. I mean, our backlog is kind of 2x of what it has been historically. And normally, we'd go into a quarter with 50% of the quarter sales in backlog. We've got close to 2/3 now. So we have a lot more visibility to temper any dramatic short-term falloff.  So again, relative to the next couple of months, we're fairly confident in our numbers. So I don't think there's a huge pause that would come because our backlog could support any short-term decrease in orders. We're a little over 4% here in the second quarter, which ramped from a little over 3% in the first quarter. We don't guide the balance of the year price, but we're really confident in what the teams have gone out with to combat inflation, which seems to have leveled off. So I mentioned we have an expectation that our price cost is going to continue to improve through the back half of the year to support some of our higher-margin profile expectations. I would say a couple of things. One, relative to -- we only have a couple of businesses that have direct exposure to commodity prices. From a materiality level, we're buying components that are a couple of phases through that value stream.  So obviously, we didn't have the vast inflation impact on the way in that a lot of other companies did. Again, 4% price increase is still price cost positive, and we're building. So -- that will, I think, wean out over time, it will be a material impact, but we will keep all the incremental pricing that we've had. Again, we've holistically gone out with price increases versus surcharge. So we like where we're positioned here going forward. Yes. I think those actions, the depth and quality of the funnel is probably at an all-time high. Like that work that the team has done across a variety of different end market applications, those concentric circles that Eric highlighted, and one of the main reasons why we are so confident in our ability to deploy capital much more consistently as we progress. And then some of the areas we have been able to take shares, it's because we have an 80 position with that vendor. And we're getting a higher allocation than some of our smaller competitors. So if they don't have the material availability, we're able to go in and take their volume. Yes. No, I think the biggest pressure has been price/cost. With 45% gross margins, you have to have a price cost spread well in excess of that to expand. So that has put constant pressure. And then we continue to invest in engineering resources, which to remind everyone, that is included in our gross margin number.  So we've been able to maintain through robust productivity across the portfolio to offset some of those headwinds. So I do think price cost getting back to historical levels and then our continued volume leverage that we get on the high contribution margins we have in our business.  Once we stabilize a little bit from an operations perspective, we'll be able to pull through some increases. With, again, just the very difficult operating environment we've been in, the ability to have discrete productivity projects across the portfolio that we've historically been able to execute on has been muted a little bit too here is another point. So I think as things normalize, we'll get another kicker off of that. We don't really disclose that externally to be honest. We don't look at it internally. It goes a little bit to the project comment that Eric talked about a little bit earlier. It's not a huge part of our business. So I would say, holistically, most of our projects are OpEx, replacing like-for-like, current IDEX volume and then some incremental market share gains that we have.  The CapEx, we have some specific things that we would be able to realize with plant expansions, new plant creation. But overall, relative to our portfolio, it's not an overly material number. So the short answer would be, holistically, it's more OpEx-related on our sales. No, I think it's in line with our expectations that we had at the beginning of the year. I mean orders pressure in the second quarter will have more pressure in the third, but they'll continue to have sales growth in the third quarter with sales finally fallen off a little bit kind of post those replenishment projects in the fourth quarter.  So still a great business. Very global. Still having wins in emerging markets. They're launching new technologies on the software side. So although they're going to lose the replenishment, their core business continues to grow. So it's been cyclical over its life span, but a little bit of pressure here in the short term as those projects roll off. But holistically, lots of additional opportunity through software and emerging markets growth. Obviously, back half, we've got much tougher comps. In the third quarter, at least relative to we have visibility. We think we'll still be positive from an organic perspective, highlighted a little bit of the dispensing pressure that will continue. But overall, IDEX still positive. And from a July perspective, no material changes versus the trends that we've experienced here across the portfolio. Yes. EPS in the back half, $0.02 to $0.03. No, I think you said it well. It is -- at least our expectation for decrementals will be a little bit higher than they have been historically because of us relative to current profit levels and the war on talent that Eric highlighted. So maybe we would historically have been in the low 30s. We're probably closer to 40% here if there's a slight pickup here as we progress over the next couple of quarters. Yes, I think there's always our first quarter, we generally get our annual blankets from a lot of our customers. So it's generally inflated relative to sequential profile of the balance of the year. So -- that's the real driver from the Q1 to Q2. For us now, it's kind of leveling off with keeping an eye on just our daily order rates, which have sustained here in the month of July."

            "content": "Thank you, Allison, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6. IDEX delivered outstanding results in the second quarter. We achieved record sales levels, 12% organic growth supported by double-digit contributions from each of our operating segments. Our backlog grew by 43 million, and we now sit at record levels to continue momentum into Q3. Core profitability continues to be strong even as we return to more normal discretionary spend levels, allowing us to fully invest in our best growth investments.  We delivered record adjusted EPS of $2.02, an increase of 15% over the prior year's second quarter. Last quarter, I described how our IDEX teams leveraged 8020 to accelerate throughput within a challenging supply chain environment. That positive momentum continued in the second quarter as our teams improve their ability to execute and deliver for our customers.  Our decentralized operating model, which aligns decision-making at the point of impact close to the customer, drives the speed and agility required for us to outperform. Our lead times were a competitive advantage and enabled share gain in pockets across the company.  Inflationary pressures remain, but the rate of increase decelerated, while we continue to capture price equivalent with our differentiation. Gross price capture increased and we expanded our price/cost spread trending back towards historic levels.  We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy and M&A remains a top priority for us. This quarter, we closed on the acquisition of KZValve, a complement to our agriculture business within FMT. Our pipeline is strong, and we continue to evaluate opportunities in higher-growth markets that support our style of competition. We have a healthy balance sheet and are confident that we can continue to put our capital to work.  We're also deploying capital organically across our portfolio to drive operational efficiencies and increase capacity to support our growth. We continue to make investments in commercial, engineering and M&A resources that enable us to execute on our strategy.  During the quarter, we increased our share repurchases and deployed $88 million to buy back 475,000 shares of IDEX stock. We remain disciplined with our methodology to create long-term value for shareholders when we see a disconnect between our intrinsic assessment of IDEX enterprise value and our public valuation.  Lastly, in the second quarter, our Board approved an 11% increase in our dividend. Rising interest rates, continued inflation and geopolitical dynamics all present some uncertainty for us as we consider and head into the second half of the year, but we're not yet seeing any major signals of near-term slowing within our commercial environments. We have good line of sight to the next 90 days, and we continue to see strength in almost all our end markets.  As we look across the industries we serve and our portfolio of differentiated technologies, we're confident that IDEX is well positioned to outperform during any short-term market volatility. It's been a really strong first half of the year, and our teams have a lot to be proud of, but it's not easy to overdeliver in this environment. I'd like to thank our IDEX employees around the globe for their hard work, diligence and agility as they execute for all our stakeholders.  With that, let me turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results. Yes. Well, thanks. So we're always looking at what we refer to as our canaries in the coal mine businesses. Those are the shortest cycle, more industrial businesses that are very, very close to the actual consumption that's going on out there in the industrial landscape.  And those have held up really, really well. I mean, I think that's the story of this whole post-pandemic recovery is just the industrial system that's been working feverishly to try to catch up. So that, for us, is always something that we're looking at first to see if there's an indicator of weakness there that usually sends up a signal and then you start to see things come after that.  And so far, as I said in the comments, that's holding in. And then I'm sure we'll talk about this more in the call, but then we balance that with some of the exposure we have across a whole host of markets on the project side. That's more of an indicator for us of overall future confidence where how people are tilting towards uncertainty, those things.  And there's a couple of places where we've seen that slow down. I mean, it's an interesting story overall, where in many ways, it's -- that kind of business has just struggled to get traction in this whole recovery cycle. But other than a few indicators and pockets there, we're sending point out a bit further into the future, we sort of keep a look at all of those and then look at our own backlog support on top of all of it that gives us at least the assurance in the short term. And of course, we'll always adjust that and recalibrate it, and that's the joy of a short cycle business. You can do that pretty quick. I mean, it's really broad-based. We're looking at the other day to see if it was kind of in pockets and chunks, and it's not. I mean, it's kind of layered across a lot of things.  Our lead times in aggregate are holding or decelerating. I mean, we made a comment there that we are seeing some pockets where frankly, our advantaged lead times that are reducing are giving us some opportunity to go grab some share in things. So I'd say on balance, we're not doing anything to drive that in the wrong direction. It's going in the right direction. And the backlog build is very, very broad-based. Yes. I'd say -- I mean, look, I think the environment for high-quality assets is held up pretty well as we've gone through this. But a lot of this is very deliberate work on our part to say that we want to go deeper, frankly, into our insight into those sort of concentric circles that surround our best applications.  So there's a purposeful step-up in work of that type, in both resources and some things we're doing with third-party analytics to make sure that we understand it as well as we can, in an environment that so far is holding up pretty well for high-quality assets. And maybe, Dean, to the extent you were -- I think you were also asking about maybe unfinished things that we have in our own factories or something waiting on a part, much like you see in the auto world.  I mean, I wouldn't say that it's completely devoid of our environment, but you don't see it all that often because we have pretty quick rapid turn one piece flow kind of build so it doesn't do well with something that's half done, there's really nowhere to put it. And our production process is quick enough, you're better off not starting it just because in general, most of our businesses, that's how we produce things. We wouldn't put a pump or something into the build schedule because we'll make 40 of them in a couple of hours, those kind of things. Yes. I'd say probably more of the second category, not getting the release or not coming on the line, something we've been thinking about or projecting for a while now and some of these just get extended out.  So you mentioned the midstream side. I mean, there's some pockets in our chemical markets exposure, maybe more on the European side than elsewhere. A little bit in the paint dispensing area. We're just kind of coming off the end of a big replenishment cycle there. And then a few things in just specific industrial markets, food expansion, places like that.  I mean, they're pretty isolated. It's not a massive part of our business, but they're good indicators, things to watch. And I would just say it's been interesting over the cycle here is this category never really took off. I think in the beginning, it was very much clouded with uncertainty. The nature of the recovery, then it turned into a kind of a bandwidth issue.  Can anybody put together the materials or the time and energy to work on it? Maybe here in the later innings of it, it's sort of all of those factors. Uncertainty creeping in back a bit, the bandwidth issue is still there and now inflation and the cost of these projects is causing some recalibration for -- in certain markets where people have to kind of go back and run the math again. Well, I mean, I'd say broad-based in terms of the way I just described it. I mean, we are seeing a bit more geographic strength in North America than Europe for all the reasons I think we would suspect in terms of things people are watching there on the geopolitical side, the energy side, those things. But both are positive for us. But if I had to call it, I would say, a little bit more positive on the North American side than Europe. Yes. So as I said before, I mean, all this is bracketed a bit by the step up in intentionality and work that we're doing. So in that respect, again, there's a lot of things we're looking at, a lot of analysis that we're doing and a lot of conversations that we're having.  You would say our -- that just activity level is north of where it has been, much of it driven by our work. Now in those conversations, probably much like the conversations you have, there is definitely more discussions around near-term prospects and what's going on with the forecast and how do you see the sales tracking out and to the extent that all links back to valuation, it's just more intense than it has been for all the reasons you'd suspect.  As Bill and I have always said, though, when you're looking at assets of the quality that we look at, you're generally looking at a history that's very sharp, well positioned, driving in strong ways. And then a reasonable projection path, especially if we're the owners that kind of picks that up again.  So -- that doesn't mean that both sides are going to be able to see that and get through it. So that's always a possibility, but our perspective is very long term in nature for the kind of assets that we're looking at. So long story short, more activity on our part, which means I think a strong funnel for us, a lot of activity, engaging with people more near-term discussions around what this all means and where it's going to go, but then kind of just take a deep breath, stare over the horizon and be confident that for quality, I think ideally both sides see it that way and stay engaged. Yes. I mean, we're not a massive center-led kind of organization. Never have been. So this might sound more dramatic than it probably is from a headcount perspective. I mean, it's a few well-positioned ads from the outside work that we're doing on the third-party side. And then frankly, the biggest component is just a higher level of engagement overall business to business. I mean, this is something we've been driving now for a couple of years.  And we really focus to combine growth outperformance on top of our just sort of institutional great well-deserved execution shops. And so a lot of it is that way. In terms of where we're looking and what it looks like, I mean, we've always favored. I always come back to this analogy of concentric circles around these applications that we kind of currently sit in.  We know these environments really well. We know what's to the right or left of us, and the best work for me is really starting to understand where is this market heading, should we make a move slightly left or right and how would we do that.  The recent acquisitions that we've layered into the company are perfect examples of that. As we said before, we're also thinking about the broader world in general and where problems are presenting themselves and where IDEX like styles of competition could come in play, and maybe that would open up a flank for us and some applications that are new to the company. So that's in the mix as well.  But if you really had to overgeneralize it and think of it, think of it as just radiating circles from the best parts of the company with more intensity, a lot of it from the ground up. That's the way we like to do it. That's a good question. I mean, it's hard to say, though, because in many ways, we've been running us, others at such a hot level. It's pretty abnormal. Pulling back from that in any way, even if it's just simply the deceleration of the tremendous acceleration we've been feeling is going to have a material noticeable impact inside just how it feels in the business.  But I don't know that, that's the same thing as a broader call on economic conditions, maybe more than it's just, okay, it's not at peak levels. We can catch a breath. We can actually be a little bit more planful, mindful. And that's for us and that's for others as well. So think of it more in those terms but then let's say, since there's nothing else to do, we can get product quicker. I don't see it as an indicator of that. Yes. Well, I always kind of preface this question with a reminder that we have a lot of configured customized products with quick replenishment, which means not a ton of our inventory on shelves. So it's a small number.  I will say we've got some good visibility to at line of sight minimum. You can see it visually when you go visit them. So you can see some slight increases there for our product. I would assume that's applicable to more stockable components as well.  In our world, we think of that as if ultimately that bleeds off over time, in some ways, it's pretty similar the way that it works in our own business. It takes a while because of the wide variety of SKUs that are out there. None of it's really clumped around a standard solution that if you made a deterministic call on it would just flow out in a big pocket or chunk.  So we think about it a lot for IDEX, mainly just as more of an indicator of health overall. But from a meaningful impact to the numbers up or down, it extends over a large time horizon. It's not a giant piece of the business, and it usually is kind of lost in the math, to be honest. Yes. Well, I mean, some of it -- the impends are fact-based. So we can see and we track our own -- our suppliers' performance and their lead times and their on-time delivery to us. So you basically start there and say, \"Well, we can see factually some improvement.\" The logistics loops are quite a bit better than where they have been on the first part of the year. And frankly, our teams are really good now, at navigating them when they kind of run astray. I think the biggest thing for us and anybody that wants to go tackle this now is, in some ways, you got to take advantage of the ability to take a breath. I would say as we've improved throughput, momentum, and we're executing stronger here, that does buy us a little bit of time, space and energy to go back and recalibrate the systems, which is what you actually have to do to go attack inventory.  You've got to go change demand signals. That's part by part. It's -- you do it on lines of paper laid out across the desk. And so -- and Bill talked about our engagement with our teams, that's the kind of work we're making sure is happening. People are kind of racking and stacking it 80s to 20s and making the calls based on fact-based patterns that they can see, and taking advantage of the time and energy, they have to go do it. Yes. I mean it's exactly the way you described it. I mean it's very much tied to strong trends that we're going to, I think, see run out for quite some time here. So we -- like everything else in IDEX, we break it down into all sorts of little components and drivers and specific application sets. Some of the ones that are going well there, the AI space is healthy.  That's a decent part of the business -- sorry, analytical instrumentation. And then the genomics space has been very, very active. A lot of that is involving initially COVID and COVID surveillance. I think now as the pandemic has kind of moved on and entering in its third year. We're seeing now some more targeted work around taking some of that technology and applying it for things like targeted medicine and all the things that were always out there for that field of study. So those have been healthy as well.  We continue to have some isolated pockets where we do support for vaccines and things of that nature that stayed strong to the duration as they're continuing to work on different targeted vaccines and things like that for both COVID as well as other things. So it's definitely picking up most of the macro dynamics and trends that we have long known are out there, and it's why we spend a lot of time investing in it and talking about it. Yes, I'd say the headlines there, the supply chain constraints and some of the larger folks that are in that space are still there, still challenging, still fighting that.  I will say that there's kind of smaller to medium specialty players have done a decent job jumping in. So that's helped us a bit, just not the biggest part of the market. We remain really, really focused in that business on technology. So there's only so much we can do to help out on the supply chain side. Eventually, that will come to a better place. As it does, we want to be ready with all of the automation that we've been talking about, not only the pieces that we have in the water path of the mobile platform, but we've got a nozzle now that's got connectivity in it and diagnostics. We're doing the same thing on the rescue tools piece. So we've got some really, really good things there just presented in a giant global show here in the second quarter. So that for us is kind of the longer-term headline on an industry that we think will ultimately start to dial in and improve. Sure. I'll cover kind of the general state of the business, let Bill answer the financial question. So I mean that has been a really, really strong acquisition, strong integration process. It is a very, very close complement to our Banjo franchise in the ag space within FMT.  It's conveniently not very far away. And so the teams have really attacked it. It's performed strong as all our agricultural businesses have both in North America and Europe. And so this has been, in some ways, one of the easier integrations because the commercial linkage is so strong in the business, and everybody is speaking the same -- on the same page with technology and the broader market supports it. So very, very strong out of the gate. Excited on the long-term prospects here, and I'll let Bill talk about the specifics. Yes. Yes. No, thanks for that. So I mean we've seen a lot of these cycles before. We have kind of a standard way that we look at it. I think -- for us, the first lever would be looking at discretionary spend. We've called that out a few times because we came off a base with almost none of it. Now we are out engaging with customers going to trade shows. So it's elevated a bit.  But we know, frankly, if we learned anything over the last couple of years, you can make it through with a much lower level of discretionary spending. That would be the first lever.  As Bill mentioned, I think there is an opportunity here for a pretty hard look at productivity across a factory setting. If things were to cool off a bit, and we actually got some bandwidth back on the team's perspective, rethought how flow is working, how different product lines are in different positions than where they may have been a couple of years ago.  So we go there next. The one area that might be a little bit different. We have been talking about it a lot is on the headcount side, on the people side. I mean even today, we still have -- we're still looking for people. The war on talent is real. Some of the communities we live and work in, it's been harder to find labor. I mean that's improved here more recently, but it's still -- there's still pressure in that area.  So that's probably the area, given all the focus we have on growing the company long term and that dynamic, we would be the most thoughtful about where we would make choices, investments and things along the way. Otherwise, I'd say it's a pretty familiar process for us. The short-cycle nature helps us get at it fast. And -- so it's never far away the playbook to run that.  Anything, Bill, you'd add there? Okay. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining today. We're really, really proud of our first half performance here. And as I close, just -- I guess the one thing I'd want you to take away is it's really a story of \"and\" not \"or\" here at IDEX.  I mean we've long, I think, earned our reputation for tactical execution, good times, difficult times. We're seeing that in the performance that we're addressing here today. And we're working deliberately to drive growth outperformance as an additive component of value creation on top of it.  We basically do that by picking the top bets that align really, really well to the macro trends that are going to be great over the long haul. We rally resources around those. And then here, as I spoke a few times, we very deliberately complemented those efforts with organic and inorganic investments, and we'll continue to do that as we go forward.  So I think you're seeing it play out. We're seeing it play out in the acquisitions we made that celebrate precision ag or alternative energy in the pneumatic space or water solutions and what that can be. So you're seeing that come together. And I just want to highlight the additive component of those 2 things, and we'll continue to talk about that as we move forward. Thanks very much for your interest in joining today."

With that, I\u2019ll now turn this call over to our CEO and President, Eric Ashleman.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you, Allison, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m on Slide 6. The first quarter was an outstanding start to the year for IDEX. I\u2019d like to thank our IDEX employees around the globe for their hard work and contributions to our success. We saw strong broad-based demand for our differentiated technologies with growth across all 3 of our segments leading to record orders, sales and backlog. This robust market plus outstanding operating performance resulted in 12% organic sales growth and excellent margins. We achieved adjusted EPS of $1.96, setting another IDEX record. Overall, the operating environment in the first quarter was much like the fourth quarter of 2021, but our team\u2019s improved their ability to navigate through this challenging environment. We effectively mapped our 80s and 20s from customers through work cells [ph] and back to the supply base in a way that increased overall throughput and velocity. We also work together to attack our most problematic supply challenges through resourcing or to redesign. Although, we expect these challenges will remain with \u2013 for us in the near term, we are confident in our ability to adapt, execute and deliver for our customers. This period of rapid economic recovery coupled with geopolitical disruptions and constrained supply continues to drive material and freight costs higher. We kept pace with our own robust price capture efforts as we leverage the highly differentiated nature of IDEX\u2019s product portfolio and our leadership positions in critical niche markets around the world. We also saw strong benefits from our productivity initiatives, specifically benefits from our site consolidations in FMT, capital investments that drove efficiencies, and product design changes that reduce material consumption. The results in Q1 are a testament to our team\u2019s long view across business cycles as they build productivity roadmaps to support growth and margin expansion. Turning to capital deployment, M&A continues to be a key priority for us. We recently announced our intent to acquire KZValve, a leading manufacturer of electric valves and controllers. This acquisition will extend our expertise in providing OEMs with critical solutions for precision agricultural and industrial applications, and serve as a complement to our agriculture business within FMT. We\u2019re excited to welcome KZValve to IDEX. We also closed on Nexsight, a compliment to our FMT water platform. Our funnel is strong and we continue to build conviction and interest around faster growing areas that complement the IDEX style of competition. Roopa Unnikrishnan, who joined us in March, will be an outstanding addition to these efforts, as she leads Strategy and Corporate Development for the company. Also, in the first quarter, we deployed $28 million to repurchase approximately 148,000 shares of company stock. We employ a discipline methodology to create long-term value for shareholders, when we see a break between our intrinsic assessment of IDEX enterprise value and our public valuation. Finally, we continue to make reasonable and modest resource investments to drive long-term sustainable growth. These investments typically involve incremental additions to our commercial and engineering resources to support our best organic bets, or targeted resources to support our inorganic efforts through M&A. With that, let me turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results.\nWilliam Grogan: Thanks, Eric. I\u2019ll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 8. Q1 orders of $856 million were up 20% overall and up 16% organically. We experienced favorable performance across all our segments and built $105 million of backlog. First quarter sales of $751 million were up 15% overall and up 12% organically. We saw favorable performance within each of our segments led by strong results in HST. Q1 gross margin expanded 70 basis points and adjusted gross margins expanded 60 basis points versus last year at 45.6% driven by favorable volume leverage, operational productivity and favorable price cost, despite rising inflation. First quarter operating margin was 25%, up 110 basis points compared to prior year. Adjusted operating margin was also 25%, up 70 basis points compared to prior year. Excluding the impact of acquisition-related intangible amortization, adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points. I\u2019ll discuss the drivers about adjusted operating income on the next slide. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 22.4%, down slightly versus our prior year rate of 22.6% due to the mix of global pre-tax income among their jurisdictions. First quarter net income was $140 million, which resulted in EPS of $1.83. Adjusted net income was $150 million, resulting in an adjusted EPS of $1.96, up $0.34 or 21% over prior year adjusted EPS. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $64 million, approximately 43% of adjusted net income. This result is driven by higher earnings being more than offset by increases in working capital due to the volume impact on receivables, as well as additional inventory we\u2019ve strategically added to help mitigate some of the longer lead times we are experiencing. Moving on to Slide 9, which details the drivers of our adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income increased $29 million for the quarter compared to the prior year. Our 12% organic growth contributed approximately $25 million flowing through with our prior year gross margin rate. We levered well on the volume increase had strong price capture, and our team\u2019s drove operational productivity to offset the profit headwinds we experienced from inflation. Additionally, we saw benefits from our FMT site consolidations, and non-repeat of prior year inventory reserves associated with COVID-19 related new product development. Mix was not a significant driver of this quarter. We reinvested $4 million mainly in the form of engineering, commercial and M&A resources to enhance our long-term growth capabilities. Lastly, discretionary spending increased by $4 million versus last year. COVID-related constraints remained in place for a portion of the first quarter, limiting our spending. As we noted in our full year guidance, we expect discretionary to continue to ramp up as we progress through the year and restore to our normal pre-pandemic spend base, although on significantly higher sales. Our organic flow through was a solid 35% for the quarter. Flow through was then negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX, getting us to our reported flow through of 29%. With that, I\u2019ll provide a deeper look at our segment performance. I\u2019m on Page 10. In our Fluid & Metering Technologies segment, we experienced a strong first quarter for both orders and sales with organic growth of 14% and 11%, respectively. FMT adjusted operating margin expanded by 300 basis points versus last year, driven by strong volume leverage and operational productivity, which includes benefits from our energy and Italy site consolidation projects, non-repeat of prior inventory reserve adjustments, and some offset from resource investments. Our industrial day rates were strong. Customers do remain cautious around larger projects though, but we have seen some projects come through in the oil and gas, and petrochemical markets. Agriculture continues to perform well to the strong global crop demand and higher prices. Our municipal water business is stable, though, project activity is increasing. States are actively submitting applications for infrastructure bill funding, and there is general optimism for funding availability in the second half of the year. We see potential for larger spending in the long-term, and we are well positioned to capture this demand. Our energy business continues to improve. Higher oil and home-heating fuel prices are providing support and funnel activity is increasing, as global energy supply volatility is expected to drive higher U.S. production. Domestic pipeline companies continue to communicate increased cutbacks, but there is some lag due to supply chain constraints in the Russia-Ukraine uncertainty. Moving on to Health & Science Technology. We experienced excellent commercial performance with orders up organically 21% and organic sales up 16%. HST adjusted operating margin contracted by 40 basis points versus the first quarter of 2021, but expanded by 90 basis points excluding the impact of incremental amortization tied to the Airtech acquisition. This was driven by strong volume leverage, partially offset by increased discretionary spending and resource investments. HST continues to benefit from strong secular growth trends within life sciences, analytical instrumentation, semicon, and the food and pharma markets. Life sciences continues to experience strong demand due to an overall awarded focused around healthcare in areas such as point-of-care and patient diagnostics, as well as increased next-gen sequencing demand as the market for cell-based therapies expands and applications like cancer research. On the semiconductor side, we continue to see broad-based growth tied to wafer production and quality inspection. Other growth areas include optics applications and additive manufacturing, as well as broadband satellite technology. Finally, turning to our Fire, Safety and Diversified Products segment. This segment posted favorable orders and sales performance with organic growth of 12% and 5%, respectively. FSD adjusted operating margin contracted by 340 basis points versus last year. This was driven by higher employee related cost and discretionary spending, as well as pressure on price costs due to longer term OEM contracts on the fire side, and automotive exposure with high metal content and BAND-IT. We have taken action to address this gap and expect that price costs will improve in the second half of the year. Our dispensing business continues to experience strong results driven by North American project volume and overall positive global paint market. Our BAND-IT business performed well with industrial and energy demand more than offsetting lags in automotive driven by supply chain related customer delays. Within Fire & Safety, we are seeing core North American and European markets improving, but still challenge due to supply chain. North American fire OEMs continue to experience supply chain constraints flowing their order to revenue conversion cycle. With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2022. I\u2019m on Slide 11, which lays out our updated guidance. For the second quarter of 2022, we\u2019re projecting organic revenue growth of 8% to 9% and operating margin between 23% and 23.5%. Q2 forecasted op margin is lower sequentially due to a full quarter of Nexsight, which is diluted to our operating margin by approximately 50 basis points due to intangible amortization, as well as increased resource investment and discretionary spending. We expect GAAP EPS to range from $1.69 to $1.74, and adjusted EPS to range from $1.85 to $1.90. Turning to the full year. Given our strong first quarter performance, but potential risk and uncertainty on the back half of the year, we are raising the low-end and holding the high-end of organic growth and adjusted EPS guidance. We now expect full year organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%, which does not imply significant sales ramp from the second half of the year rather we are applying a normal seasonal pattern to our current output level. At this time, we see potential risks that further revenue acceleration may be tempered by the Russia-Ukraine war and supply chain effects related to the China\u2019s Zero-COVID policy. We will continue to monitor the situation and reassess our guidance range in the next quarter\u2019s update. We expect GAAP EPS to range between $6.87 to $7, and adjusted EPS to range from $7.50 to $7.63. Our operating margin expectations for the full year to be approximately 24% and is diluted by Nexsight intangible amortization of about 50 basis points. With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: And at this time, we\u2019ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Halloran: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Hi, Mike.\nMichael Halloran: Hey there, Eric. So maybe just start on the demand side of things. Obviously, there\u2019s a lot going on the environment here. But sounds like demand still pretty healthy order. It\u2019s still pretty healthy underneath the hood for you, I know, you mentioned in the prepared remarks maybe some hesitancy on the larger project side of things. But I\u2019d like to a little sense for how you\u2019re thinking about how those challenges from a broader perspective are impacting the business from the demand perspective. Are you seeing any cracks emerging anywhere? How was momentum through the quarter? Just really any context you can give around what you\u2019re seeing?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah, thanks, Mike. Look, it\u2019s holding pretty steady for us all over the place. I mean, the sectors we outline have been strong, they were strong through the first quarter that momentum has continued into the early part here the second quarter. Probably the only thing that we\u2019ve seen continually here that it\u2019s been held back a bit is the large projects category that we talk about a lot. I continue to see that, honestly, it\u2019s just a question of resource availability, ability to focus on doing the work, either in the current context or even projecting across the future as people consider all the things that that are on the table there that could disrupt that. That being said, we\u2019ve seen some projects here and there, and places like energy, and certainly a few in the chemical space, some short-term stuff in water that indicates, people are trying to get at capacity just like we are and throughput, so that continues to add to the mix. So I \u2013 very, very strong, overall steady, and that\u2019s one thing that makes it pretty easy to navigate.\nMichael Halloran: No, that makes sense. And on the margin side of things, the FMT margins really stood out this quarter. I know, Bill highlighted some of the reasons, but maybe just some thoughts on sustainability on that side, if there\u2019s anything that wasn\u2019t repeatable in that mix, as we look forward here?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. Now look, I think, we \u2013 as you can see, and I said on the remarks, I mean, we made some nice progress on throughput and velocity that always helps our situation. It\u2019s nice from a leverage perspective and it also implies that things are working more efficiently. The impasse the consolidations that we had last year in FMT specifically has been a big benefit for us as we go. And then, I know, we\u2019ll dive into price cost along the way. But, of course, we\u2019ve done our best there to keep our head above water. You\u2019ve kind of put that into the mix with more throughput and output. That\u2019s a good mix for us overall, and you see it reflected in performance.\nMichael Halloran: Appreciate it. Thanks for time.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nNathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Hi, Nathan.\nNathan Jones: Just a couple of questions on the guidance to start with, it looks like pretty much your guidance for revenue for the rest of the year, even at the high end relative to the first quarter, the quarterly run rate is up only by about as much as the Nexsight acquisition adds. I think, Bill, you said you built $100 million-plus of backlog during the quarter. Is this really you guys just assuming that supply chain limits your output for the remainder of the year maybe core demand is a little bit better than that. But you\u2019re just assuming that you don\u2019t get a lot of relief from the supply chain constraints and that restrains what you can actually ship?\nWilliam Grogan: Not exactly, Nathan. As we look at, obviously, the team\u2019s ability to increase their output directions we\u2019re taking internally has improved with some of the external events that have happened recently in the unknown longer-term implications just can\u2019t count on significant ramp from our current volumes that we\u2019re at now. Obviously, if things unwind and resolve there\u2019s upside opportunity in the back half, definitely based upon the strong backlog that you\u2019ve highlighted.\nNathan Jones: Okay. I think cautions fair enough that things could only get worse, right?\nWilliam Grogan: Yeah, exactly.\nNathan Jones: Second question I had is on capital deployment here. You guys have certainly stepped up the pace of acquisitions, and how aggressive you\u2019ve been there. The markets clearly worried about recession in 2023. Does this change your calculus in how you are thinking about going up there acquisitions in terms of, how you\u2019re de-risking your deal models, risk premiums, that you\u2019re putting on things. Any change to the calculus that you guys are using over there as you\u2019re approaching acquisitions at the moment?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah, I\u2019d say, I mean, not a lot in the short-term, again, it come back to kind of the nature of the assets that we\u2019re looking at here. They\u2019re very representative of kind of classic IDEX businesses, high mission critical solutions, risk adverse end markets, I mean, they\u2019re not the kind of businesses that Bob and we\u2019ve a lot in the short-term. And ultimately, the valuation on the part of the seller and for us on the part of the buyer comes down to the assurance of pretty steady growth and cash streams and high quality earnings over time. And, of course, what we think we could do to a business on the inside, which is mostly under our control anyways. So not to say, we\u2019re discounting any of those things, but certainly \u2013 particularly in the short-term, it doesn\u2019t really change the view of what we think is favorable for the long-term health of the company.\nNathan Jones: Have you seen that uncertainty in the market out there at the moment from the seller\u2019s perspective, improved pricing at all on any of these assets that you\u2019re looking at?\nEric Ashleman: No, I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve seen that that\u2019s often a lagging phenomenon. And again, this \u2013 we\u2019re in very high quality waters, with generally long histories that anybody would refer to, and just degrees of health in the future, all positive. So it doesn\u2019t really enter the mix of these kinds of assets too much.\nNathan Jones: Perfect. Thanks for taking my questions.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you, Nathan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Hi, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Hi. When we see record orders, record sales, record backlog, and upside in organic, it\u2019s not sure that you did miss any revenues, because of supply chain. But did you have any projects that you couldn\u2019t ship past due anything you could size there?\nEric Ashleman: I mean, there was a couple of isolated things, the amount left on the table versus the number we quoted in Q4 was down substantially. Again, the team\u2019s ability to work through some of the operational output, and then just slight improvements in some of the supply chain areas, a lot less than, I think, we quoted around 3% in the fourth quarter, much lower number kind of a couple of basis points type of framework.\nDeane Dray: That\u2019s really helpful. And on the cascade on that shows the growth investments in discretionary, I\u2019m always interested in knowing some of the specifics inside there, because, obviously, you could cut-back on growth investments anytime and dress up quarterly earnings, but that\u2019s not what you all do. So what\u2019s in the growth investment and the discretionary buckets? And what kind of payback should we expect?\nWilliam Grogan: Yeah, Deane, we\u2019re committed to invest, making these investments and outside of what happens in the short-term, these are things that we\u2019re committed to that are going to drive growth for us long-term. We talked about engineering resources, different commercial initiatives we have across the portfolio. Eric\u2019s highlighted several times just the build out of our M&A team to improve the conversion that you\u2019ve seen in our M&A pipeline. And we\u2019ve got great projects in all 3 segments, either through new product launches, investigating new markets to leverage different applications for our technologies. And then even in the second quarter here, we\u2019ve got some larger trade shows that we\u2019re back in the largest North American trade show for Fire & Rescue that we\u2019re going to launch a couple new products and bring those to market. So a lot of exciting things across the portfolio that we\u2019re committed to investing, as we progress through the year like we talked about, we gave our initial guidance. And then, Eric, anything else you\u2019d want to add.\nEric Ashleman: Yeah, I would just continue to highlight, we talk a lot about the top kind of those that list of top organic bets for the company, the resources, Bill was talking about maps really, really solidly to that list. So it\u2019s not spread evenly. It\u2019s very disproportionately tuned with that addition for sort of more enterprise work around strategy and sectors we\u2019re interested in as we think of putting money to work.\nDeane Dray: That\u2019s really helpful. And Eric, since you asked \u2013 to be asked about price costs take us through where the pricing is expected to read through the rest of the year, and how you expect to end up on price cost?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah, I\u2019ll hit it generally, like, Bill kind of fill in the blanks in terms of models and numbers. But, I mean, like we\u2019ve been, as you\u2019d suspect, very, very aggressive on the pricing front and talking about it for a long time, where we think we\u2019re entitled to it, given the differentiation and the problems that we solve out there. We\u2019ve worked at very systematically across the company, I mean, there\u2019s an approach to how we do that. We take into consideration, the long and deep often personal relationships that we have customers and how to navigate that effectively in an environment like this. So I would say here, as we\u2019ve talked through last year, we got some ways that the cycle came up, and the velocity of it was in many ways unexpected in the beginning of the year. We kind of caught up with it in the back half. And then, I see us in a more favorable position as we enter the year here, and I think you see that reflected in the margins.\nWilliam Grogan: Yeah, I think, continued progression here in the first quarter. I think as each month goes by the additional pricing actions we\u2019ve taken, we have seen increased inflation, the teams are doing a much better job getting out in front of it. And, I think, towards the back half of the year will be add or an excess of our historical price cost based upon the line of sight to what we have as of now.\nDeane Dray: That\u2019s real helpful. Thank you.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Deane.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning.\nEric Ashleman: Hi, Allison.\nAllison Poliniak: I just want to get back to your comments on the project side, Eric. You had mentioned, it seemed like it was more of a win not if kind of scenario with, obviously, elevated concerns of this next downturn, which seemed more consumer facing at the time. Just would love your perspective, as you kind of think forward here in terms of this project is, would it support maybe a more shallow recession, if when one comes for industrial just any thoughts on your view there?\nEric Ashleman: Well, I mean, the second half of that is a broader question that involves a lot of other things. But I would say, just from what we can see here, it\u2019s just been a consistent story. I mean, I think a lot of companies have got work that they need to get at. In many ways, it\u2019s concentrated in certain areas that are more favorable than others, they would love to deploy capital and get at it sometimes at larger scale. But you just see, increasingly, I mean, that the bigger the project, the harder it is to put together, you\u2019ve got to have the people to do it, they\u2019ve got to be familiar with the company, and then you got to be able to marshal all the resources and count on it across a horizon that\u2019s going to be longer than it has been before, so all lead times are much longer than they have been. So any projects duration has got to be able to traverse essentially more risk and uncertainty. And so, I think, what we\u2019re seeing and in fact, even some of the things that I look at that we deploy in our own companies, you kind of go to the head of the list and you say, all right, well, where\u2019s the absolute place that we have to put some money to work and you can see the return sitting in front of us, because the demand is pronounced. And if you can do it in a slightly different way maybe it\u2019s a little bit faster, it\u2019s quicker the scale is of a different nature. Those are the kinds of things that we\u2019re in interacting with. And it\u2019s kind of it matches the deployment within our own business, which, of course, is sort of a different scale. So, I think, that bigger transformative project stuff that\u2019s out there, it\u2019s just that\u2019s the situations that it face, I don\u2019t know, when that ends, I guess, that\u2019s the open question for all of us. But, I see a lot of that related to, it\u2019s just got to find a way to settle into a very different planning environment that has been this way now for a while. But, I think, if folks had a magic wand, they would like it to go away, and they\u2019d like to put that capital to work. That\u2019s what continues to kind of give us the competence and the momentum on the longer term nature of the cycle, as you can see how much of it does need to be deployed?\nAllison Poliniak: That\u2019s great. And then just a question on max and neutral in the quarter, just based on the backlog, and it\u2019s certainly the pricing items, but more on the mix side. How should we think about that mix as we kind of moved through the year based on what you\u2019re seeing in your order book at this point?\nEric Ashleman: No material impact on the year-over-year, I think, for us a lot of the margin mix will be just the FMT margin expansion that\u2019ll be more consistent this year relative to other productivity initiatives that we had last year, so more productivity driving the margin expansion versus favorable or unfavorable mix having major impact.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thank you.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJoseph Giordano: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Hi, Joe.\nJoseph Giordano: So I\u2019m just curious, like obviously with what\u2019s going on in Europe, some major themes around how we transfer energy and food shortages globally. I mean, it realizes are more international problems and domestic here, but just curious if you can kind of take us through how you might be able to help attack those problems that are emerging now.\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. Well, of course, we go from macro to micro pretty quick, when we start to think of, how that impacts us. But I like the way you framed it, which is actually anytime there\u2019s disruption, there are problems to solve, and that\u2019s usually healthy for us. So, as things swing around in production goes from one zone to another that means largely the infrastructure might be used in ways that\u2019s more aggressive or higher rates than it has before. We do things like custody transfer on the energy side, if we\u2019re shipping it around the world, or building out ports to do that, that\u2019s places that we play. And so, I think, ultimately, I\u2019d put that in the net favorable for us. And, I think, we saw some of that activity in the first quarter in places like energy. Same thing over on food production, I mean, is that becomes a bigger deal and starts to move around in different geographies and things like that, where capital may be or may not be a need to be deployed, we come along with it with the mission critical fluidic solutions that we have in there as well. So a lot of a lot of major trends to track and get a sense of where they\u2019re heading or where they\u2019re coming from. But I would say just the fact that they\u2019re changing, often presents opportunities for us in the ways that that I described here.\nJoseph Giordano: That\u2019s helpful. And just on the backlog, just given the orders and the backlog where it is. What\u2019s your ability to kind of protect what\u2019s there, I assume that the duration of the backlog is long, and it\u2019s longer than it typically is. So as you get like kind of inflation while it\u2019s still there, you\u2019re able to protect the margins inherent in the backlog?\nWilliam Grogan: Yeah, in most of it, Joe, we\u2019ve been able to evolve our terms and conditions over the last 18 months to make sure that we can pass on incremental inflation as it comes into there\u2019s certain contracts that we have that we can\u2019t, but I think we\u2019re well positioned overall.\nEric Ashleman: Yeah.\nJoseph Giordano: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vlad Bystricky with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nVlad Bystricky: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my call.\nEric Ashleman: Sure.\nVlad Bystricky: So strong results, impressive first quarter, and you put up strong operating leverage and productivity, despite what we know is a challenging period given Omicron in North America for a lot of the companies we hear from. So can you just talk more about how you were able to navigate that environment and what you\u2019ve seen now in terms of ongoing productivity runway in your plants?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. That\u2019s a great question. So there\u2019s a number of factors at play, some of which we turned to our advantage here in the quarter. I mean, from an external perspective, I\u2019d say the supply chain environment is basically the same difficult some subjects better, some worse, but that not really markedly different. The labor availability piece, I mean, we\u2019re low labor content, but it is critical, somebody eventually has to put things together, that actually improved for us in the first quarter, mainly from absenteeism. We enter the year with high rates. And then as we went on February and March, that actually improved. And I\u2019d say labor availability, generally, while it\u2019s a tough market out there for people, I mean, it did get a bit better for us. And we\u2019ve got less kind of open roles, especially in the production side overall. So that was a component that turned more favorable for us. And then a lot of the work that we do, I mentioned in the remarks, it\u2019s tuning 80/20, from beginning to end supply right through the factory, right to the customer base. We\u2019ve kind of always naturally had that orientation and how we produce, the harder part is actually to draw those connections all the way back into the supply chain, and then move them around. And that\u2019s where I\u2019d say, we\u2019ve done the best work here over the last really 6 months, but you saw the benefit in the last 3. So all that simply means is, you\u2019ve got your best supplier making the part, that\u2019s the most critical for our best part of the factory to our best customer set that alignment is in place, we\u2019ve got ways to query that across the company now. And we can really see the benefit of that, and then that gives you a lot of that volume throughput that we referenced. And I don\u2019t want to lose the other 2 pieces we called out. I mean, we did very difficult consolidations in the middle of a very difficult time. Last year, we\u2019re now, those are completely behind us and they\u2019re in parts of the business that have got good order velocity against them. So that\u2019s like an additive component here.\nVlad Bystricky: That\u2019s great color and it shows in the results. Maybe just one follow-up from me on the capital allocation side, it\u2019s nice to see you deploy some cash to share buybacks. And, I guess, first we\u2019ve seen in the past year plus, can you just talk about given the stock performance year-to-date, how you and the board are thinking about repurchases going forward, and whether that\u2019s an area we could maybe see you be more aggressive through the years, the shares remain around where they are?\nWilliam Grogan: Yeah. No, Vlad, I\u2019ll take that one. We\u2019ve historically had a very disciplined approach for our share buyback program. When we think the stocks undervalued, what we consider our intrinsic value of the company, we\u2019re back in buying shares. And, obviously, with the significant decline we\u2019ve seen here, and we think that\u2019s short-term related, a lot of the conversation, Eric\u2019s highlight is we\u2019re really bullish on the next couple years, both from an industrial cycle and our ability to put broader capital work in the M&A space. So we\u2019re taking advantage of where the share price is, and we\u2019re going to continue to buy at the current level, if we\u2019re still at this value here as we progress through the quarter.\nVlad Bystricky: Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.\nEric Ashleman: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Loop Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Graham: Hey, good morning, all. Thanks for taking my question. I understand for sure from your comments, Eric, that the impact of supply chain on the top line was a lot less than this quarter than last. But is that a number that you guys can maybe give us the impact on sales?\nEric Ashleman: Well, I mean, it so from how much that we would attribute to gating is supply chain conditions overall? I mean, it\u2019s a slight step down, I think, we\u2019ve said typically before we\u2019ve been somewhere in the point or two, things we wish we would have been able to get out or otherwise. And I\u2019d say, this is a slightly more favorable tune, or landing position for us, largely for a lot of the work that I just talked through there. I mean, I\u2019d say the one external component is that slight uptick in labor availability for us, recognizing again it\u2019s a relatively small part of kind of our spent in P&L.\nScott Graham: Understood. Thank you. And as far as like the 20 to 25 projects, I know that they look a little bit different today than they did a pre-COVID. Recall that you talked about the monetization when you guys pivoted into a post-COVID environment. Forgive me for not remembering that number, I thought it was like $100 million in incremental sales, something like that that you guys envision maybe being able to capture. Can you kind of tell us where you guys are on that curve?\nWilliam Grogan: Scott, maybe I\u2019ll take that one. So, yeah, back in late 2020, we said, a $50 million to $100 million of potential incremental COVID opportunities. In 2021, we said incrementally was probably flat, 50 versus 50, so no big increase last year. And as we progress through this year, it\u2019s been pretty consistent. There\u2019s been no material pickup in COVID opportunities or decrease. So\u2026\nEric Ashleman: But then that would \u2013 Scott that would still leave kind of standard deck to drive out performance for us 200 to 300 basis points. And as Bill said, we went through a period where there was more COVID things in it. Now, those have kind of normalized to some degree, and we\u2019re back looking at fast growing applications that kind of map to the world we see ahead of us. So we tune that fairly regularly and we\u2019re always looking at what should be up there, which should be \u2013 should not, we don\u2019t do that around sort of calendar cycles, we\u2019re continually evaluating that and saying, if we hit a milestone that would suggest something needs to come off, and we\u2019re seeing an opportunity elsewhere.\nWilliam Grogan: Got it. Well, thank you. And if I could just squeeze one in on dispensing, fourth quarter, the call you were a little bit of a lot got it on the dispensing outlook for this year, and then it looks like it had a pretty good first quarter. Could you kind of update on what you\u2019re seeing there and what to expect?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah, Scott, I think that\u2019s a first half versus second half. We continue through the back half of last year to win some larger projects here in North America, that\u2019ll be delivered in the first half, so continued strength here over the second quarter, and then much more difficult comps in the back half of the year.\nWilliam Grogan: Thanks very much.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Summerville with D. A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nWill Jellison: Hi, this is Will Jellison on for Matt, this morning. Good morning.\nEric Ashleman: Hi.\nWill Jellison: So I want to ask about the first quarter performance and try to understand better the extent to which the performance was enabled by preparation measures taken throughout 2021 versus things that were more on the fly, if you will, in response to things as they arose through that first quarter?\nEric Ashleman: Well, I mean, if I go back to the comments, I had just a few moments ago, where I sort of delineated, the labor impact, which was positive for us, I mean, I would say almost all of that that\u2019s an external situation playing through, coming off the Omicron infection rates and higher absenteeism, and then that moderated as we went through the quarter. And I do think labor availability, more generally, in some of the regions we do business improved from conditions last year. So I put that on the external side, that\u2019s a component, the tuning I talked about relative to 80/20, and supply chain, and how we move that through the supply base or resourcing. I made some comments about that engineering, resourcing in our engineering design work in the opening comments, prepared remarks. And that\u2019s our side of it. That\u2019s things we\u2019ve long been doing to try to keep pace with a very, very difficult supply environment. So I don\u2019t know with the exact balance, I would say, but you got some of both coming together there. And, in both, I think likely to continue for us as we go forward.\nWill Jellison: Understood. That\u2019s helpful. And then I do want to ask you about China, I know that at this point, it\u2019s a relatively small portion of the footprint. But I know that throughout 2021, you were making investments in facilities there. I\u2019m wondering at this juncture in April, given the kinds of lock downs activity we\u2019ve seen there. What\u2019s your view on the impact, or potential impact there might be and how IDEX might be positioned to respond to it?\nEric Ashleman: Well, I think like everybody else were watching the current situation play out, I mean, pretty hard to predict how things are going to go, also hard to imagine that this is a big long-term event, I mean, there\u2019s no doubt be some overhang here. But I would just kind of go back to what we said, when we made when we thought of the investment, we talked to everyone here about it. This is a massive economy. Our approach there is very local, it\u2019s completely local. So we\u2019ve got resources on the ground, we\u2019ve got technologies available, and we\u2019ve got domain expertise to solve local problems from within the economy. And so, that doesn\u2019t insulate it entirely from macro events that happen there, but it does minimize the sort of disruptive things you can get doing lots of cross border, and that\u2019s never really been our model there, it isn\u2019t the model for India as well, we have a similar campus there. So the investments that we talked about the facilities expansion is, is actually nearing completion. And we look forward as everybody does for hopefully a healthy resolution to what\u2019s going on over there where we\u2019ve got a lot of employees in the region and are going to start there with our first concern is with their health and well being. And then, I still feel very confident about the investments we\u2019re making to be appropriate given the potential of that economy.\nWill Jellison: I appreciate that. Thanks for taking my question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nConnor Lynagh: Yeah, thanks. I think we\u2019ve covered a lot on the full year outlook, so just wanted to ask a couple on the near-term thoughts here. I mean, it seems like your overall messages demand looks strong and there aren\u2019t any sort of warning signs you\u2019re seeing, but you want to be conservative given the overall macro environment. I guess, I\u2019m curious, just in the second quarter, it seems like you are pointing to some potential for some margin compression. Is that based on what you\u2019ve actually seen thus far, either in March or April? Or is that just similar sort of conservative vein there?\nWilliam Grogan: No, I think, we highlighted sequential margins decline, 50 basis points of it just the Nexsight acquisition coming into the fold on the dilutive impact of the deal amortization. It depending on what your competence, there\u2019s kind of another 50 to 100 basis points, primarily through incremental investments on the discretionary and resource side. As we said, hey, we\u2019re going to have about $20 million, $25 million for each category this year. We spent 4 [ph] in both incrementally that\u2019s going to ramp a little bit here in the second quarter compressed margins slightly.\nConnor Lynagh: Okay. Understood. Understood. And then just in terms of capital deployment for the year, so the CapEx guidance for the full year would indicate that you\u2019re sort of accelerating there. Just want to make sure, we have context for \u2013 what are the incremental things that you\u2019re investing in there? What are sort of some of the big focal areas for you guys over the next year here?\nWilliam Grogan: Yeah, I think some of the big ones, Eric highlighted, continued investments in facilities in emerging markets are China expansion and India expansion, the CapEx associated with that\u2019ll ramp here over the next few quarters. And then, we talked about a large infrastructure investment in our Banjo business, with new technology to increase automation and overall output is that business has continued to grow and scale here relative to the differentiation that that product brings to market along with a bunch of other investments is for growth and productivity across the portfolio.\nEric Ashleman: Yeah, we got some things in life sciences and in our ceiling business related to semicon expansion, too. So we\u2019re invested in that machine tools and equipment to do that, I wouldn\u2019t say within additive emphasis on the automation capabilities that are out there today, that also has a secondary benefit of helping us on the labor front.\nConnor Lynagh: Makes sense. Thanks very much.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Shlosh with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Shlosh: Hey, good morning, guys.\nEric Ashleman: Hi, Andy.\nAndrew Shlosh: Firstly, do you know what total price was in the quarter?\nWilliam Grogan: Yeah, it\u2019s close to 3%.\nAndrew Shlosh: 3%, right. That\u2019s great color. The other thing I was kind of curious about, what do you think the demand outlook is for kind of [bios/medical flow?] [ph] What are you seeing there?\nEric Ashleman: I mean, that\u2019s been very, very healthy. I mean, obviously, there\u2019s a piece of that that\u2019s involved with COVID, or at a minimum the vaccine that therapeutic side of that, lots of interesting things going on with cell-based therapies and other things that are out there. So, I mean, it\u2019s an area of focus for us, we\u2019ve got a nice presence there that has done well, and we continue to stay very interested in it.\nAndrew Shlosh: Great. Thanks for the color. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nBrett Linzey: Good morning, all.\nEric Ashleman: Good morning.\nBrett Linzey: Hey, I wanted to come back to the guidance framework. You brought up the low-end, left some contingency there and certainly understandable, you mentioned the potential risks. I was just hoping, you could put a finer point on are there specific 1 or 2 regions or areas of the portfolio that where you\u2019re most in this is really a demand side versus price cost, any color would be great?\nEric Ashleman: I\u2019d say from a high level there, none of this really comes back to specific areas of concern that map against where we are and kind of where we intersect the world out there. They\u2019re more general, and they\u2019re pretty close to the same ones that everybody else is thinking about. So region locked down in China and what happens is that all plays out and broader exposure to Asia-PAC and supply sides back into mature economies you put us. But it\u2019s on the radar keeping an eye on that certainly the issues geopolitically in Europe. We don\u2019t have a lot of direct presence there. But there\u2019s a bunch of derivative impacts for us and others, we\u2019ll see how that plays out. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re looking at it, units of measure that are different than the ones that are on the macro screen for most people.\nWilliam Grogan: And again, I think relative to some of the earlier commentary, less on the demand side, more on the supply side.\nEric Ashleman: Yeah.\nBrett Linzey: Got it. Makes sense. And then just back to HST, the continued wins in sequencing in semiconductor. I was hoping you could just unbundle that in what the contribution was to the 20% order print. And then specifically within semiconductor, how are you aligning with some of these big capital commitments here in the U.S. and Europe on the fabs?\nEric Ashleman: Well, I mean, so like I \u2013 it\u2019s kind of hard to do that specifically, because it goes in different businesses and goes in different places, I would just say, very, very strong on both of those categories. On the semi side, I mean, we\u2019re \u2013 like we\u2019re involved in different aspects of that we\u2019re involved in some businesses, we kind of come in there on the fab side, when we build out infrastructure, and other places, we\u2019re actually involved in the metrology side, or the inspection of things that are made in that infrastructure. So we\u2019re well positioned throughout and well positioned with the names that most people think of when they think of that industry.\nBrett Linzey: Okay, great. I appreciate it. Thanks a lot.\nEric Ashleman: You bet.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Wertheimer: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nEric Ashleman: Hi, Rob.\nRob Wertheimer: I just wanted to see if you\u2019d round up discussion a little bit on capital deployment and acquisition, where you\u2019ve obviously been successful and steady in the past year, and to this quarter, 1Q and 2Q. Can you give any just sort of background on how the funnel looks versus a year-ago versus a year and change ago, you\u2019d be operational focus, I think is shifting more and more towards there, any changes to how that broads out the funnel or accelerates progress through it? And I\u2019ll stop there.\nEric Ashleman: Sure. Well, I think for a while we\u2019ve been talking about the intentionality of the work, so we resourced it in a different way, put some people on, brought some folks in from the outside, I mentioned, Roopa, in my earlier comments, she brings a lot to the effort as we go. But a lot of this comes from \u2013 bottoms up, I mean, it comes out of the businesses who know their worlds and markets the best. And you can kind of see that if you look at the last few acquisitions in particular, they\u2019re all very close to home to our businesses. And, in fact, we\u2019ve known them for a long, long time. So in some ways, we\u2019re taking advantage of targets that have been out there that we\u2019ve understood with much more focused cultivation, understanding and ability to get the transaction done, and then integrate it successfully in the company. So that\u2019s always going to be a big piece of what we do. Right next to that, then is broadening that work and starting to think about, well, if you go slightly to the left or to the right, or extend out the time horizon a bit further, what does that suggest about the universe that\u2019s out there, which could be known in some cases isn\u2019t known. And so it\u2019s very, very focused work, it\u2019s process driven. You can think of it is almost a grid of intersection between the work that we do and the problems that need to be solved in the world and where they cross over. Again, a lot of it is relatively close to home, because we\u2019re looking to leverage the domain expertise that we have the market insight and presence and positioning of current businesses. But it\u2019s coming together in an interesting way, and we long, et cetera, I\u2019d said, ever since I took the seat, I was trying to level loaded a bit. And that\u2019s now happened, it makes that resource base more stable, and makes the work more predictable, and it\u2019s easier to optimize. So that\u2019s kind of where we are now looking forward to where we\u2019re going to take it and talking to you about it as we go.\nRob Wertheimer: That\u2019s fantastic. And so that\u2019s obviously the process focus seems like it\u2019s paying off. I mean, as you look at your metrics on just scale of opportunities, out of opportunity progress through, I assume you anticipate this higher level of acquisition activity is well supported to continue.\nEric Ashleman: That\u2019s the plan. I mean, we\u2019ve got the \u2013 to complete the kind of growth maps that we have for the businesses, we\u2019re going to often want to bring in some technologies and position points that we don\u2019t have today. This is a great way to do it. And we\u2019ve got the great cash generating facility and balance sheet to pull it off. And so, but doing it in a way that works for us process driven, people dependent, we like that. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to build there.\nRob Wertheimer: Perfect. Thank you.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Walt Liptak with Seaport Research. Please proceed with your question.\nWalter Liptak: Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Hi, Walt.\nWalter Liptak: Hi. We didn\u2019t cover a lot of ground, but I thought I\u2019d try and drill into a couple of things. Certainly, you recognize that the Europe and plenty of geopolitical things are in the quarter. Did you notice anything with demand like orders or with any kind of project delays or anything like that? And if you compare it and contrast in supply chain in the U.S. versus Europe, or can you see any differences?\nEric Ashleman: I would say nothing yet. Nothing on the front that\u2019s hit the radar here. And we have a big broad cross section of different markets, different pressure points, and I wouldn\u2019t be able to pick anything out specifically yet.\nWalter Liptak: Okay. All right. Fair enough. And then, I think, Bill\u2019s remarks about the paint dispensing market. I think, he made a comment that globally, it was looking, okay, is what I wrote down. But, and then on the follow-up question, you said that it was still the second half where you thought that was going to slow down. I just wanted to make sure I didn\u2019t miss hear something, was there some sort of a pickup in dispensing internationally for orders that might get better?\nWilliam Grogan: Yeah, Walt, I think overall, the paint markets strong, obviously, from time to time, there\u2019s large replenishment orders in North America that were coming off of the back of a huge cycle there that\u2019ll be have the tougher comps in the second half of the year. So demand \u2013 core demand is still strong across the globe with just tough comps on some of these projects.\nEric Ashleman: And you still have a lot of especially the Asia side of things is, I mean, it\u2019s just now automating we\u2019re still involved in that cycle, which is a little bit more steady state, less project specific. So it\u2019s really how these things come together and timeout.\nWalter Liptak: Okay, great. Okay, thanks very much.\nWilliam Grogan: Thanks.\nOperator: And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to CEO, Eric Ashleman for closing remarks.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks very much. I\u2019d like to thank everybody on the call for your interest and support to IDEX. Just 2 final points for me: one, that just a really, really big thank you to our IDEX teams and business partners that are out there. Bill and I do our best to simplify the story here makes it seem easy enough, it\u2019s not. I mean, we deliver highly engineered solutions to very demanding customers to solve super critical problems. It\u2019s tough to do on the best days. This has been a pronounced difficult environment. And I\u2019m really, really proud of how our teams have come together and made the improvements and progress they have here. So I just really want to thank them. And look, we talked a lot about those challenges that are out there, the things that that folks are wondering about. And I just remind everybody, our company is uniquely positioned to help with many of those problems to solve them. It\u2019s reflective our mission and values, and when we do our job as well. We\u2019re rewarded financially with gross margin expansion tasked to take the business to the next level. So we\u2019re leaning forward, we feel good about where we are and look forward to talking with you, as we go about the progress we\u2019re making. Thanks very much.\nOperator: And this concludes today\u2019s conference, and you may disconnect your line at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "William Grogan",
            "content": "Thanks, Eric. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 8. Q1 orders of $856 million were up 20% overall and up 16% organically. We experienced favorable performance across all our segments and built $105 million of backlog. First quarter sales of $751 million were up 15% overall and up 12% organically. We saw favorable performance within each of our segments led by strong results in HST. Q1 gross margin expanded 70 basis points and adjusted gross margins expanded 60 basis points versus last year at 45.6% driven by favorable volume leverage, operational productivity and favorable price cost, despite rising inflation. First quarter operating margin was 25%, up 110 basis points compared to prior year. Adjusted operating margin was also 25%, up 70 basis points compared to prior year. Excluding the impact of acquisition-related intangible amortization, adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points. I'll discuss the drivers about adjusted operating income on the next slide. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 22.4%, down slightly versus our prior year rate of 22.6% due to the mix of global pre-tax income among their jurisdictions. First quarter net income was $140 million, which resulted in EPS of $1.83. Adjusted net income was $150 million, resulting in an adjusted EPS of $1.96, up $0.34 or 21% over prior year adjusted EPS. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $64 million, approximately 43% of adjusted net income. This result is driven by higher earnings being more than offset by increases in working capital due to the volume impact on receivables, as well as additional inventory we've strategically added to help mitigate some of the longer lead times we are experiencing. Moving on to Slide 9, which details the drivers of our adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income increased $29 million for the quarter compared to the prior year. Our 12% organic growth contributed approximately $25 million flowing through with our prior year gross margin rate. We levered well on the volume increase had strong price capture, and our team's drove operational productivity to offset the profit headwinds we experienced from inflation. Additionally, we saw benefits from our FMT site consolidations, and non-repeat of prior year inventory reserves associated with COVID-19 related new product development. Mix was not a significant driver of this quarter. We reinvested $4 million mainly in the form of engineering, commercial and M&A resources to enhance our long-term growth capabilities. Lastly, discretionary spending increased by $4 million versus last year. COVID-related constraints remained in place for a portion of the first quarter, limiting our spending. As we noted in our full year guidance, we expect discretionary to continue to ramp up as we progress through the year and restore to our normal pre-pandemic spend base, although on significantly higher sales. Our organic flow through was a solid 35% for the quarter. Flow through was then negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX, getting us to our reported flow through of 29%. With that, I'll provide a deeper look at our segment performance. I'm on Page 10. In our Fluid & Metering Technologies segment, we experienced a strong first quarter for both orders and sales with organic growth of 14% and 11%, respectively. FMT adjusted operating margin expanded by 300 basis points versus last year, driven by strong volume leverage and operational productivity, which includes benefits from our energy and Italy site consolidation projects, non-repeat of prior inventory reserve adjustments, and some offset from resource investments. Our industrial day rates were strong. Customers do remain cautious around larger projects though, but we have seen some projects come through in the oil and gas, and petrochemical markets. Agriculture continues to perform well to the strong global crop demand and higher prices. Our municipal water business is stable, though, project activity is increasing. States are actively submitting applications for infrastructure bill funding, and there is general optimism for funding availability in the second half of the year. We see potential for larger spending in the long-term, and we are well positioned to capture this demand. Our energy business continues to improve. Higher oil and home-heating fuel prices are providing support and funnel activity is increasing, as global energy supply volatility is expected to drive higher U.S. production. Domestic pipeline companies continue to communicate increased cutbacks, but there is some lag due to supply chain constraints in the Russia-Ukraine uncertainty. Moving on to Health & Science Technology. We experienced excellent commercial performance with orders up organically 21% and organic sales up 16%. HST adjusted operating margin contracted by 40 basis points versus the first quarter of 2021, but expanded by 90 basis points excluding the impact of incremental amortization tied to the Airtech acquisition. This was driven by strong volume leverage, partially offset by increased discretionary spending and resource investments. HST continues to benefit from strong secular growth trends within life sciences, analytical instrumentation, semicon, and the food and pharma markets. Life sciences continues to experience strong demand due to an overall awarded focused around healthcare in areas such as point-of-care and patient diagnostics, as well as increased next-gen sequencing demand as the market for cell-based therapies expands and applications like cancer research. On the semiconductor side, we continue to see broad-based growth tied to wafer production and quality inspection. Other growth areas include optics applications and additive manufacturing, as well as broadband satellite technology. Finally, turning to our Fire, Safety and Diversified Products segment. This segment posted favorable orders and sales performance with organic growth of 12% and 5%, respectively. FSD adjusted operating margin contracted by 340 basis points versus last year. This was driven by higher employee related cost and discretionary spending, as well as pressure on price costs due to longer term OEM contracts on the fire side, and automotive exposure with high metal content and BAND-IT. We have taken action to address this gap and expect that price costs will improve in the second half of the year. Our dispensing business continues to experience strong results driven by North American project volume and overall positive global paint market. Our BAND-IT business performed well with industrial and energy demand more than offsetting lags in automotive driven by supply chain related customer delays. Within Fire & Safety, we are seeing core North American and European markets improving, but still challenge due to supply chain. North American fire OEMs continue to experience supply chain constraints flowing their order to revenue conversion cycle. With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2022. I'm on Slide 11, which lays out our updated guidance. For the second quarter of 2022, we're projecting organic revenue growth of 8% to 9% and operating margin between 23% and 23.5%. Q2 forecasted op margin is lower sequentially due to a full quarter of Nexsight, which is diluted to our operating margin by approximately 50 basis points due to intangible amortization, as well as increased resource investment and discretionary spending. We expect GAAP EPS to range from $1.69 to $1.74, and adjusted EPS to range from $1.85 to $1.90. Turning to the full year. Given our strong first quarter performance, but potential risk and uncertainty on the back half of the year, we are raising the low-end and holding the high-end of organic growth and adjusted EPS guidance. We now expect full year organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%, which does not imply significant sales ramp from the second half of the year rather we are applying a normal seasonal pattern to our current output level. At this time, we see potential risks that further revenue acceleration may be tempered by the Russia-Ukraine war and supply chain effects related to the China's Zero-COVID policy. We will continue to monitor the situation and reassess our guidance range in the next quarter's update. We expect GAAP EPS to range between $6.87 to $7, and adjusted EPS to range from $7.50 to $7.63. Our operating margin expectations for the full year to be approximately 24% and is diluted by Nexsight intangible amortization of about 50 basis points. With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions. Not exactly, Nathan. As we look at, obviously, the team's ability to increase their output directions we're taking internally has improved with some of the external events that have happened recently in the unknown longer-term implications just can't count on significant ramp from our current volumes that we're at now. Obviously, if things unwind and resolve there's upside opportunity in the back half, definitely based upon the strong backlog that you've highlighted. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, Deane, we're committed to invest, making these investments and outside of what happens in the short-term, these are things that we're committed to that are going to drive growth for us long-term. We talked about engineering resources, different commercial initiatives we have across the portfolio. Eric's highlighted several times just the build out of our M&A team to improve the conversion that you've seen in our M&A pipeline. And we've got great projects in all 3 segments, either through new product launches, investigating new markets to leverage different applications for our technologies. And then even in the second quarter here, we've got some larger trade shows that we're back in the largest North American trade show for Fire & Rescue that we're going to launch a couple new products and bring those to market. So a lot of exciting things across the portfolio that we're committed to investing, as we progress through the year like we talked about, we gave our initial guidance. And then, Eric, anything else you'd want to add. Yeah, I think, continued progression here in the first quarter. I think as each month goes by the additional pricing actions we've taken, we have seen increased inflation, the teams are doing a much better job getting out in front of it. And, I think, towards the back half of the year will be add or an excess of our historical price cost based upon the line of sight to what we have as of now. Yeah, in most of it, Joe, we've been able to evolve our terms and conditions over the last 18 months to make sure that we can pass on incremental inflation as it comes into there's certain contracts that we have that we can't, but I think we're well positioned overall. Yeah. No, Vlad, I'll take that one. We've historically had a very disciplined approach for our share buyback program. When we think the stocks undervalued, what we consider our intrinsic value of the company, we're back in buying shares. And, obviously, with the significant decline we've seen here, and we think that's short-term related, a lot of the conversation, Eric's highlight is we're really bullish on the next couple years, both from an industrial cycle and our ability to put broader capital work in the M&A space. So we're taking advantage of where the share price is, and we're going to continue to buy at the current level, if we're still at this value here as we progress through the quarter. Scott, maybe I'll take that one. So, yeah, back in late 2020, we said, a $50 million to $100 million of potential incremental COVID opportunities. In 2021, we said incrementally was probably flat, 50 versus 50, so no big increase last year. And as we progress through this year, it's been pretty consistent. There's been no material pickup in COVID opportunities or decrease. So... Got it. Well, thank you. And if I could just squeeze one in on dispensing, fourth quarter, the call you were a little bit of a lot got it on the dispensing outlook for this year, and then it looks like it had a pretty good first quarter. Could you kind of update on what you're seeing there and what to expect? Thanks very much. No, I think, we highlighted sequential margins decline, 50 basis points of it just the Nexsight acquisition coming into the fold on the dilutive impact of the deal amortization. It depending on what your competence, there's kind of another 50 to 100 basis points, primarily through incremental investments on the discretionary and resource side. As we said, hey, we're going to have about $20 million, $25 million for each category this year. We spent 4 [ph] in both incrementally that's going to ramp a little bit here in the second quarter compressed margins slightly. Yeah, I think some of the big ones, Eric highlighted, continued investments in facilities in emerging markets are China expansion and India expansion, the CapEx associated with that'll ramp here over the next few quarters. And then, we talked about a large infrastructure investment in our Banjo business, with new technology to increase automation and overall output is that business has continued to grow and scale here relative to the differentiation that that product brings to market along with a bunch of other investments is for growth and productivity across the portfolio. Yeah, it's close to 3%. And again, I think relative to some of the earlier commentary, less on the demand side, more on the supply side. Yeah, Walt, I think overall, the paint markets strong, obviously, from time to time, there's large replenishment orders in North America that were coming off of the back of a huge cycle there that'll be have the tougher comps in the second half of the year. So demand \u2013 core demand is still strong across the globe with just tough comps on some of these projects. Thanks."

            "name": "Eric Ashleman",
            "content": "Thank you, Allison, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6. The first quarter was an outstanding start to the year for IDEX. I'd like to thank our IDEX employees around the globe for their hard work and contributions to our success. We saw strong broad-based demand for our differentiated technologies with growth across all 3 of our segments leading to record orders, sales and backlog. This robust market plus outstanding operating performance resulted in 12% organic sales growth and excellent margins. We achieved adjusted EPS of $1.96, setting another IDEX record. Overall, the operating environment in the first quarter was much like the fourth quarter of 2021, but our team's improved their ability to navigate through this challenging environment. We effectively mapped our 80s and 20s from customers through work cells [ph] and back to the supply base in a way that increased overall throughput and velocity. We also work together to attack our most problematic supply challenges through resourcing or to redesign. Although, we expect these challenges will remain with \u2013 for us in the near term, we are confident in our ability to adapt, execute and deliver for our customers. This period of rapid economic recovery coupled with geopolitical disruptions and constrained supply continues to drive material and freight costs higher. We kept pace with our own robust price capture efforts as we leverage the highly differentiated nature of IDEX's product portfolio and our leadership positions in critical niche markets around the world. We also saw strong benefits from our productivity initiatives, specifically benefits from our site consolidations in FMT, capital investments that drove efficiencies, and product design changes that reduce material consumption. The results in Q1 are a testament to our team's long view across business cycles as they build productivity roadmaps to support growth and margin expansion. Turning to capital deployment, M&A continues to be a key priority for us. We recently announced our intent to acquire KZValve, a leading manufacturer of electric valves and controllers. This acquisition will extend our expertise in providing OEMs with critical solutions for precision agricultural and industrial applications, and serve as a complement to our agriculture business within FMT. We're excited to welcome KZValve to IDEX. We also closed on Nexsight, a compliment to our FMT water platform. Our funnel is strong and we continue to build conviction and interest around faster growing areas that complement the IDEX style of competition. Roopa Unnikrishnan, who joined us in March, will be an outstanding addition to these efforts, as she leads Strategy and Corporate Development for the company. Also, in the first quarter, we deployed $28 million to repurchase approximately 148,000 shares of company stock. We employ a discipline methodology to create long-term value for shareholders, when we see a break between our intrinsic assessment of IDEX enterprise value and our public valuation. Finally, we continue to make reasonable and modest resource investments to drive long-term sustainable growth. These investments typically involve incremental additions to our commercial and engineering resources to support our best organic bets, or targeted resources to support our inorganic efforts through M&A. With that, let me turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results. Hi, Mike. Yeah, thanks, Mike. Look, it's holding pretty steady for us all over the place. I mean, the sectors we outline have been strong, they were strong through the first quarter that momentum has continued into the early part here the second quarter. Probably the only thing that we've seen continually here that it's been held back a bit is the large projects category that we talk about a lot. I continue to see that, honestly, it's just a question of resource availability, ability to focus on doing the work, either in the current context or even projecting across the future as people consider all the things that that are on the table there that could disrupt that. That being said, we've seen some projects here and there, and places like energy, and certainly a few in the chemical space, some short-term stuff in water that indicates, people are trying to get at capacity just like we are and throughput, so that continues to add to the mix. So I \u2013 very, very strong, overall steady, and that's one thing that makes it pretty easy to navigate. Yeah. Now look, I think, we \u2013 as you can see, and I said on the remarks, I mean, we made some nice progress on throughput and velocity that always helps our situation. It's nice from a leverage perspective and it also implies that things are working more efficiently. The impasse the consolidations that we had last year in FMT specifically has been a big benefit for us as we go. And then, I know, we'll dive into price cost along the way. But, of course, we've done our best there to keep our head above water. You've kind of put that into the mix with more throughput and output. That's a good mix for us overall, and you see it reflected in performance. Thanks, Mike. Hi, Nathan. Yeah, I'd say, I mean, not a lot in the short-term, again, it come back to kind of the nature of the assets that we're looking at here. They're very representative of kind of classic IDEX businesses, high mission critical solutions, risk adverse end markets, I mean, they're not the kind of businesses that Bob and we've a lot in the short-term. And ultimately, the valuation on the part of the seller and for us on the part of the buyer comes down to the assurance of pretty steady growth and cash streams and high quality earnings over time. And, of course, what we think we could do to a business on the inside, which is mostly under our control anyways. So not to say, we're discounting any of those things, but certainly \u2013 particularly in the short-term, it doesn't really change the view of what we think is favorable for the long-term health of the company. No, I wouldn't say we've seen that that's often a lagging phenomenon. And again, this \u2013 we're in very high quality waters, with generally long histories that anybody would refer to, and just degrees of health in the future, all positive. So it doesn't really enter the mix of these kinds of assets too much. Thank you, Nathan. Hi, Deane. I mean, there was a couple of isolated things, the amount left on the table versus the number we quoted in Q4 was down substantially. Again, the team's ability to work through some of the operational output, and then just slight improvements in some of the supply chain areas, a lot less than, I think, we quoted around 3% in the fourth quarter, much lower number kind of a couple of basis points type of framework. Yeah, I would just continue to highlight, we talk a lot about the top kind of those that list of top organic bets for the company, the resources, Bill was talking about maps really, really solidly to that list. So it's not spread evenly. It's very disproportionately tuned with that addition for sort of more enterprise work around strategy and sectors we're interested in as we think of putting money to work. Yeah, I'll hit it generally, like, Bill kind of fill in the blanks in terms of models and numbers. But, I mean, like we've been, as you'd suspect, very, very aggressive on the pricing front and talking about it for a long time, where we think we're entitled to it, given the differentiation and the problems that we solve out there. We've worked at very systematically across the company, I mean, there's an approach to how we do that. We take into consideration, the long and deep often personal relationships that we have customers and how to navigate that effectively in an environment like this. So I would say here, as we've talked through last year, we got some ways that the cycle came up, and the velocity of it was in many ways unexpected in the beginning of the year. We kind of caught up with it in the back half. And then, I see us in a more favorable position as we enter the year here, and I think you see that reflected in the margins. Thanks, Deane. Hi, Allison. Well, I mean, the second half of that is a broader question that involves a lot of other things. But I would say, just from what we can see here, it's just been a consistent story. I mean, I think a lot of companies have got work that they need to get at. In many ways, it's concentrated in certain areas that are more favorable than others, they would love to deploy capital and get at it sometimes at larger scale. But you just see, increasingly, I mean, that the bigger the project, the harder it is to put together, you've got to have the people to do it, they've got to be familiar with the company, and then you got to be able to marshal all the resources and count on it across a horizon that's going to be longer than it has been before, so all lead times are much longer than they have been. So any projects duration has got to be able to traverse essentially more risk and uncertainty. And so, I think, what we're seeing and in fact, even some of the things that I look at that we deploy in our own companies, you kind of go to the head of the list and you say, all right, well, where's the absolute place that we have to put some money to work and you can see the return sitting in front of us, because the demand is pronounced. And if you can do it in a slightly different way maybe it's a little bit faster, it's quicker the scale is of a different nature. Those are the kinds of things that we're in interacting with. And it's kind of it matches the deployment within our own business, which, of course, is sort of a different scale. So, I think, that bigger transformative project stuff that's out there, it's just that's the situations that it face, I don't know, when that ends, I guess, that's the open question for all of us. But, I see a lot of that related to, it's just got to find a way to settle into a very different planning environment that has been this way now for a while. But, I think, if folks had a magic wand, they would like it to go away, and they'd like to put that capital to work. That's what continues to kind of give us the competence and the momentum on the longer term nature of the cycle, as you can see how much of it does need to be deployed? No material impact on the year-over-year, I think, for us a lot of the margin mix will be just the FMT margin expansion that'll be more consistent this year relative to other productivity initiatives that we had last year, so more productivity driving the margin expansion versus favorable or unfavorable mix having major impact. Thank you. Hi, Joe. Yeah. Well, of course, we go from macro to micro pretty quick, when we start to think of, how that impacts us. But I like the way you framed it, which is actually anytime there's disruption, there are problems to solve, and that's usually healthy for us. So, as things swing around in production goes from one zone to another that means largely the infrastructure might be used in ways that's more aggressive or higher rates than it has before. We do things like custody transfer on the energy side, if we're shipping it around the world, or building out ports to do that, that's places that we play. And so, I think, ultimately, I'd put that in the net favorable for us. And, I think, we saw some of that activity in the first quarter in places like energy. Same thing over on food production, I mean, is that becomes a bigger deal and starts to move around in different geographies and things like that, where capital may be or may not be a need to be deployed, we come along with it with the mission critical fluidic solutions that we have in there as well. So a lot of a lot of major trends to track and get a sense of where they're heading or where they're coming from. But I would say just the fact that they're changing, often presents opportunities for us in the ways that that I described here. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. That's a great question. So there's a number of factors at play, some of which we turned to our advantage here in the quarter. I mean, from an external perspective, I'd say the supply chain environment is basically the same difficult some subjects better, some worse, but that not really markedly different. The labor availability piece, I mean, we're low labor content, but it is critical, somebody eventually has to put things together, that actually improved for us in the first quarter, mainly from absenteeism. We enter the year with high rates. And then as we went on February and March, that actually improved. And I'd say labor availability, generally, while it's a tough market out there for people, I mean, it did get a bit better for us. And we've got less kind of open roles, especially in the production side overall. So that was a component that turned more favorable for us. And then a lot of the work that we do, I mentioned in the remarks, it's tuning 80/20, from beginning to end supply right through the factory, right to the customer base. We've kind of always naturally had that orientation and how we produce, the harder part is actually to draw those connections all the way back into the supply chain, and then move them around. And that's where I'd say, we've done the best work here over the last really 6 months, but you saw the benefit in the last 3. So all that simply means is, you've got your best supplier making the part, that's the most critical for our best part of the factory to our best customer set that alignment is in place, we've got ways to query that across the company now. And we can really see the benefit of that, and then that gives you a lot of that volume throughput that we referenced. And I don't want to lose the other 2 pieces we called out. I mean, we did very difficult consolidations in the middle of a very difficult time. Last year, we're now, those are completely behind us and they're in parts of the business that have got good order velocity against them. So that's like an additive component here. Sure. Well, I mean, it so from how much that we would attribute to gating is supply chain conditions overall? I mean, it's a slight step down, I think, we've said typically before we've been somewhere in the point or two, things we wish we would have been able to get out or otherwise. And I'd say, this is a slightly more favorable tune, or landing position for us, largely for a lot of the work that I just talked through there. I mean, I'd say the one external component is that slight uptick in labor availability for us, recognizing again it's a relatively small part of kind of our spent in P&L. But then that would \u2013 Scott that would still leave kind of standard deck to drive out performance for us 200 to 300 basis points. And as Bill said, we went through a period where there was more COVID things in it. Now, those have kind of normalized to some degree, and we're back looking at fast growing applications that kind of map to the world we see ahead of us. So we tune that fairly regularly and we're always looking at what should be up there, which should be \u2013 should not, we don't do that around sort of calendar cycles, we're continually evaluating that and saying, if we hit a milestone that would suggest something needs to come off, and we're seeing an opportunity elsewhere. Yeah, Scott, I think that's a first half versus second half. We continue through the back half of last year to win some larger projects here in North America, that'll be delivered in the first half, so continued strength here over the second quarter, and then much more difficult comps in the back half of the year. Thanks, Scott. Hi. Well, I mean, if I go back to the comments, I had just a few moments ago, where I sort of delineated, the labor impact, which was positive for us, I mean, I would say almost all of that that's an external situation playing through, coming off the Omicron infection rates and higher absenteeism, and then that moderated as we went through the quarter. And I do think labor availability, more generally, in some of the regions we do business improved from conditions last year. So I put that on the external side, that's a component, the tuning I talked about relative to 80/20, and supply chain, and how we move that through the supply base or resourcing. I made some comments about that engineering, resourcing in our engineering design work in the opening comments, prepared remarks. And that's our side of it. That's things we've long been doing to try to keep pace with a very, very difficult supply environment. So I don't know with the exact balance, I would say, but you got some of both coming together there. And, in both, I think likely to continue for us as we go forward. Well, I think like everybody else were watching the current situation play out, I mean, pretty hard to predict how things are going to go, also hard to imagine that this is a big long-term event, I mean, there's no doubt be some overhang here. But I would just kind of go back to what we said, when we made when we thought of the investment, we talked to everyone here about it. This is a massive economy. Our approach there is very local, it's completely local. So we've got resources on the ground, we've got technologies available, and we've got domain expertise to solve local problems from within the economy. And so, that doesn't insulate it entirely from macro events that happen there, but it does minimize the sort of disruptive things you can get doing lots of cross border, and that's never really been our model there, it isn't the model for India as well, we have a similar campus there. So the investments that we talked about the facilities expansion is, is actually nearing completion. And we look forward as everybody does for hopefully a healthy resolution to what's going on over there where we've got a lot of employees in the region and are going to start there with our first concern is with their health and well being. And then, I still feel very confident about the investments we're making to be appropriate given the potential of that economy. Yeah, we got some things in life sciences and in our ceiling business related to semicon expansion, too. So we're invested in that machine tools and equipment to do that, I wouldn't say within additive emphasis on the automation capabilities that are out there today, that also has a secondary benefit of helping us on the labor front. Thank you. Hi, Andy. I mean, that's been very, very healthy. I mean, obviously, there's a piece of that that's involved with COVID, or at a minimum the vaccine that therapeutic side of that, lots of interesting things going on with cell-based therapies and other things that are out there. So, I mean, it's an area of focus for us, we've got a nice presence there that has done well, and we continue to stay very interested in it. Good morning. I'd say from a high level there, none of this really comes back to specific areas of concern that map against where we are and kind of where we intersect the world out there. They're more general, and they're pretty close to the same ones that everybody else is thinking about. So region locked down in China and what happens is that all plays out and broader exposure to Asia-PAC and supply sides back into mature economies you put us. But it's on the radar keeping an eye on that certainly the issues geopolitically in Europe. We don't have a lot of direct presence there. But there's a bunch of derivative impacts for us and others, we'll see how that plays out. But I don't think we're looking at it, units of measure that are different than the ones that are on the macro screen for most people. Yeah. Well, I mean, so like I \u2013 it's kind of hard to do that specifically, because it goes in different businesses and goes in different places, I would just say, very, very strong on both of those categories. On the semi side, I mean, we're \u2013 like we're involved in different aspects of that we're involved in some businesses, we kind of come in there on the fab side, when we build out infrastructure, and other places, we're actually involved in the metrology side, or the inspection of things that are made in that infrastructure. So we're well positioned throughout and well positioned with the names that most people think of when they think of that industry. You bet. Hi, Rob. Sure. Well, I think for a while we've been talking about the intentionality of the work, so we resourced it in a different way, put some people on, brought some folks in from the outside, I mentioned, Roopa, in my earlier comments, she brings a lot to the effort as we go. But a lot of this comes from \u2013 bottoms up, I mean, it comes out of the businesses who know their worlds and markets the best. And you can kind of see that if you look at the last few acquisitions in particular, they're all very close to home to our businesses. And, in fact, we've known them for a long, long time. So in some ways, we're taking advantage of targets that have been out there that we've understood with much more focused cultivation, understanding and ability to get the transaction done, and then integrate it successfully in the company. So that's always going to be a big piece of what we do. Right next to that, then is broadening that work and starting to think about, well, if you go slightly to the left or to the right, or extend out the time horizon a bit further, what does that suggest about the universe that's out there, which could be known in some cases isn't known. And so it's very, very focused work, it's process driven. You can think of it is almost a grid of intersection between the work that we do and the problems that need to be solved in the world and where they cross over. Again, a lot of it is relatively close to home, because we're looking to leverage the domain expertise that we have the market insight and presence and positioning of current businesses. But it's coming together in an interesting way, and we long, et cetera, I'd said, ever since I took the seat, I was trying to level loaded a bit. And that's now happened, it makes that resource base more stable, and makes the work more predictable, and it's easier to optimize. So that's kind of where we are now looking forward to where we're going to take it and talking to you about it as we go. That's the plan. I mean, we've got the \u2013 to complete the kind of growth maps that we have for the businesses, we're going to often want to bring in some technologies and position points that we don't have today. This is a great way to do it. And we've got the great cash generating facility and balance sheet to pull it off. And so, but doing it in a way that works for us process driven, people dependent, we like that. And that's what we're trying to build there. Thank you. Hi, Walt. I would say nothing yet. Nothing on the front that's hit the radar here. And we have a big broad cross section of different markets, different pressure points, and I wouldn't be able to pick anything out specifically yet. And you still have a lot of especially the Asia side of things is, I mean, it's just now automating we're still involved in that cycle, which is a little bit more steady state, less project specific. So it's really how these things come together and timeout. Thanks very much. I'd like to thank everybody on the call for your interest and support to IDEX. Just 2 final points for me: one, that just a really, really big thank you to our IDEX teams and business partners that are out there. Bill and I do our best to simplify the story here makes it seem easy enough, it's not. I mean, we deliver highly engineered solutions to very demanding customers to solve super critical problems. It's tough to do on the best days. This has been a pronounced difficult environment. And I'm really, really proud of how our teams have come together and made the improvements and progress they have here. So I just really want to thank them. And look, we talked a lot about those challenges that are out there, the things that that folks are wondering about. And I just remind everybody, our company is uniquely positioned to help with many of those problems to solve them. It's reflective our mission and values, and when we do our job as well. We're rewarded financially with gross margin expansion tasked to take the business to the next level. So we're leaning forward, we feel good about where we are and look forward to talking with you, as we go about the progress we're making. Thanks very much."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Allison Lausas, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. Ms. Lausas, you may now begin.\nAllison Lausas: Good morning, everyone. This is Allison Lausas, Vice-President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the IDEX fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the three months and full-year ending December 31, 2023. The press release along with the presentation slides to be used during today's webcast can be accessed on our company website at idexcorp.com. Joining me today are Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer and President; and Abhi Khandelwal, our new Senior Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer. Today, we will begin with Eric, providing an overview of the state of IDEX's business. Abhi will then discuss our fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 financial results and provide an update on the various markets we serve. He will also discuss our outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2024. Lastly, Eric will close the call with his final remarks. We will then open the call for your questions. If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes by dialing the toll-free number (877) 660-6853 and entering conference ID 13742102, or simply log on to our company homepage for the webcast replay. Before we begin a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the Safe Harbor language in last night's press release and in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I will now turn this call over to our CEO and President, Eric Ashleman.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Allison, and good morning everyone. First, I'd like to introduce and welcome our new CFO, Abhi Khandelwal back to IDEX. Abhi previously worked at IDEX for 10 years and served as my finance partner for the majority of that tenure. I'm thrilled to welcome them back. And in many ways, it feels like you never left. Turning to Slide 6. We navigated the challenging backdrop in 2023 with really strong execution. As backlogs normalized, we took inventory out of the system, reduced lead times for customers, increased cash-flow to record levels, and delivered productivity through strong price capture and operational excellence. As always, I want to reach out to our IDEX employees around the globe with a sincere and appreciative thank you. I want to apply a bit of high level perspective as I covered last year's dynamic demand patterns. Coming into 2023, we expect this would be a year of re-calibration across our broad array of markets and our thesis certainly held. Our fragmented industrial markets within FMT and parts of FSDP and HST played out as expected. Supply chains improved, dropping overall lead times bringing artificially high backlog and inventory levels into focus. Customers attack these positions moderately over time through order reductions to our businesses, ultimately reaching levels of stability for us in the fall. Our less fragmented markets within Life Sciences and Analytical Instrumentation and Semicon recalibrated in a dramatically different way. Through much of the post pandemic recovery, these markets had run red-hot with demand that was really only constrained by supply chain availability. Demand pressures from high interest rates, lower capital availability and a lackluster post-COVID recovery in China, combined with outside inventory balances and backlogs drove sharp order reductions throughout these normally fast-growing sectors. This played out dramatically in the first half for IDEX. Given our short-cycle character, we saw the decline quicker than many and reached equilibrium in the fall sooner than some. As we delivered against expectations within a stable Q4, we took a breath and developed a plan of attack for the year ahead. Lead times and backlogs are back to pre-pandemic levels. The majority of our industrial and municipal businesses are stable and seeing improvement with early and encouraging signs of modest growth ahead. The open questions are the specific catalysts and timing to support further acceleration. Our teams continue to aggressively engage with our top growth bets to drive market out performance. These initiatives are spread across all segments in a variety of niche verticals. We're particularly excited about our growth work with customers in our water, Semicon, space communications, and energy transition markets. The markets not yet showing signs of near-term recovery remains Life Sciences and Analytical Instrumentation. We haven't forecasted a positive inflection yet for 2024. That said, our teams continue to work a robust pipeline of innovative projects in conjunction with our customers, positioning us to win on tomorrow's Next-Gen platforms. We believe in the long-term growth potential of these end markets and are well-positioned to support growth at the first signs of improved demand. We continue to focus on aggressive capital deployment towards M&A as we tune the portfolio towards faster-growing high-quality markets. We acquired Iridian and STC Material Solutions last year, adding important pieces of material science technology to our HST segment. Our funnel is expanding, filled with targets that enhance our growth potential. Our balance sheet is strong, fully supporting our ambitions. Finally, we divested two businesses Micropump and Novotema as we practice AD20 at the enterprise level. With that, I'll turn it over to Abhi to discuss our financial results.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Thanks, Eric, and thanks to everyone for welcoming me back to IDEX. It's great to be here and be re-joining a great organization. Moving onto the consolidated financial results on Slide 8. All comparisons are against the prior year period unless stated otherwise. Orders of $754 million in the fourth quarter were down 6% overall, and down 10% organically. We experienced an organic decrease in each of our three segments. FMT and FSDP declined mid-single-digits while HST contracted by about 17% as market stabilized at a new level post-recalibration. For the year orders were down 7% overall, and down 11% organically. Our HST segment contracted upwards of 20% as customer experienced a sharp inventory recalibration during the year and level-set to new near-term demand targets that include stunted growth expectations for China coming out of the pandemic. Our FMT and FSDP segments were down low-single digits as they also experienced recalibration although at a much smaller scale. Fourth quarter sales of $789 million were down 3% overall, and down 6% organically. We experienced a 19% organic decrease in HST while both FMT and FSDP grew by 3% organically. Full-year sales of $3.3 billion were up 3% overall and down 1% organically. HST contracted by 10% on an organic basis driven by declining life sciences analytical instrumentation and semiconductor markets, partially offset by price. FMT and FSDP grew mid-single-digits, driven largely by strong price capture on slightly higher volumes. Fourth-quarter gross margin was essentially flat at 42.7% while adjusted gross margin, which was also 42.7% contracted 90 basis points due to lower volume leverage, unfavorable mix and the dilutive impact of acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by strong price-cost and operational productivity. Both full-year gross margin and adjusted gross margin of 44.2% contracted 60 basis points for the same reasons I just described. Fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.8%, down 120 basis points. I will discuss the drivers of fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA on the next slide. On a full-year basis adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 40 basis points to 27.5%. A bridge of the full-year adjusted EBITDA can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Despite a year of significant volume pressure, our teams delivered on price-cost and operational productivity, significantly muting the impact of these unprecedented volume declines. On a GAAP basis, our Q4 effective tax rate of 22.7% versus last year's fourth-quarter effective tax rate of 20.5% increased primarily due to the absence of one-time foreign currency benefits realized in 2022 in connection with the funding of the acquisition of Muon as well as the impact of the loss recorded on the sale of Novotema during 2023. For which no related tax benefit was realized due to the type of consolidated group in which it participated. Our full-year GAAP effective tax rate of 21.7% was flat with the prior year. However, both 2023 and 2022 included favorable discrete events. Fourth-quarter net income was $109 million generating EPS of $1.43. Adjusted net income was $139 million with adjusted EPS of $1.83, down $0.18 from the prior year fourth quarter. Full-year net income was $596 million, resulting in EPS of $7.85. Adjusted net income was $624 million. Generating adjusted EPS of $8.22, up $0.10 or 1% from last year. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $179 million, up 22% over the prior year period. We achieved a conversion rate of 129% of adjusted net income, mainly driven by improved working capital performance despite lower adjusted net income. On an organic basis, we drove more than $40 million of inventory reduction in the quarter through our targeted reduction efforts and we saw inventory turns improve. For the year we delivered record free cash flow of $627 million, up 28% versus last year and coming in at 101% of adjusted net income. Mainly driven by lower net working capital as we reduced organic inventory levels by almost $65 million and achieved higher adjusted net income. We achieved this despite higher year-over-year capital expenditure as we maintain focus on investing for the future. We will continue to drive inventory levels down and optimize working capital levels further in 2024. Moving on to Slide 9 which details the drivers of our fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $15 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Our 6% organic sales reduction unfavorably impacted adjusted EBITDA by $36 million, flowing through at our prior year adjusted gross margin rate. Price cost was accretive to margins and we drove operational productivity that offset employee-related inflation. Mix was unfavorable by $3 million. Reductions in variable compensation contributed $3 million of benefit in the quarter. These results yielded a negative 39% organic flow-through. Overall, our team's focus on cost containment and resource reallocation has effectively managed our revenue declines. IDEX is well-positioned to recover and grow back stronger than before when market dynamics turn favorable. The impact of FX and acquisitions, net of divestitures contributed $5 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. However, the divestiture of Micropump load flow-through as the margins were higher than those of our newly acquired assets who were experiencing volume deleveraging, given the end markets deplane. With that, I will provide a deeper look at our segment performance. I'm on Slide 10. Let me walk you through our outlook as it relates to our end markets. First, as I consider the markets served by our Fluid & Metering technology segment. Industrial derates began to see some sequential improvement in the fourth quarter and we expect continued stability in the near-term as our short-cycle businesses meet underlying customer demand. We continue to see normalized book-and-bill order patterns given shorter lead times and normalized supply chain dynamics. As we move into 2024, we're cautiously optimistic as we continue to see tailwinds due to domestic infrastructure initiatives and within mining. We anticipate these patterns will hold. Dolby will continue to mind our derates to evaluate longer-term expectations as this is the most short-cycle market exposure. Our water businesses continue to be favorably positioned as we enter 2024. Municipal project activity remains strong with no signs of funding delays and the project funnel is healthy with new opportunities winning share to deliver solutions for critical water challenges. Our energy business has been steady, even as new oil production is down and fuel markets are flat, driven by declining fuel prices and mild heating seasons in North America and Europe. As consolidation occurs within this industry and funding for new projects remain delayed, we see operators doing more with less using the same infrastructure to drive production. These market dynamics favorably impact our demand profile. As our energy businesses meet customers' need for replacements as they keep existing infrastructure running. In the chemical market, we continue to see positive results across US and Europe with pharma and battery applications providing opportunities for growth. China softness is being mitigated by the rest of Asia. The one area experiencing pronounced headwinds in FMT is our agricultural business. The size of this market is about 10% of the FMT segment, which equates to mid-single-digits for overall IDEX. We continue to see headwinds as OEMs have stepped down their projections due to continued destocking and declining net farm income and crop prices. Our KZValve acquisition continues to be a differentiator with its automated actuation valve technology and we are focused on targeted share gain to offset the pressure of current market challenges. Moving onto the Health & Science Technologies segment. We continue to see positive results stemming from our space broadband laser communication initiatives which are bolstered by Iridian's technological capabilities. We expect this space to grow in 2024. The industrial markets served by businesses in the HST segment are experiencing signals in line with FMT has expectations. Our material processing technology business is gaining share in battery production with the step up in new orders as we enter the year. And we continue to see signs of improvement within biopharma related to new vaccine development, where our technologies are uniquely positioned. We see particular strength in emerging markets. For semiconductor, we began to see initial signs of improvement as we exited 2023. We expect this market will continue to recover somewhat in '24 driven by an improved outlook for memory chips due to demand for devices. Further out, we look forward to continued growth in Semicon driven by artificial intelligence, automotive and long-term secular tailwinds driven by electrification. While these markets point towards growth area within the HST, that is not yet showing signs of recovery is in our Life Sciences and Analytical Instrumentation markets, which represents nearly 35% of HST and about 15% of overall IDEX. However, the long-term growth drivers have not changed. While orders appear to be stabilizing, we have not forecasted a positive inflection yet for 2024. While this industry navigates immediate-term challenges, we continue to have our eye on the future. We are closely partner with our customers across our Life Sciences businesses and we're actively innovating to provide tomorrow solution. With our focus on innovation and operational scale to support customers from prototyping to production we are uniquely positioned for growth as these markets recover. Turning to our Fire & Safety Diversified Products. We expect FSDP will be flattish to down slightly in 2024 driven by headwinds in dispensing as key customers recently completed the multi-year refreshment cycle. We expect Fire & Safety end markets to remain stable and growth to be driven by strategic share gain initiatives our teams are focused on. We continue to win through value-added integrated systems and technology and standardized offerings that enable higher OEM throughput. Overall demand Band-it continues to remain strong and we expect growth on a year-over-year basis. With that, I'd like to provide an update on our outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2024. I'm on Slide 11. We expect full-year organic growth of 0% to 2% with the majority of our end markets stable to growing as I highlighted in my market outlook commentary. This wage reflects low-single-digit growth from FMT and includes acknowledgment of the uncertainty in timing and scale of recovery given the short-cycle nature of our business. For HST we expect low-single-digit growth as broader expectations for year-over-year growth across its markets are moderated by the lack of visibility in the Life Sciences and Analytical Instrumentation space. And we expect FSDP to be down slightly as the dispensing refreshment cycle has completed and volume in that space will step down. The dynamic is expected to lower overall IDEX organic growth by 1% and offset the growth expected by Fire & Safety and Band-it. This organic rate guide equals earnings per share contraction of $0.03 to growth of $0.26 depending on top-line results and includes price-cost, which we anticipate will be positive for the year and mixed pressure stemming from dispensing volumes. Additionally, we expect our operational productivity will more than offset pressure from wage-related inflation and provide $0.10 to $0.15 of EPS growth. As always, we're committed to investing in the future growth prospects and expect to make incremental resource investments of $0.05 to $0.09 during the year as we invest in the people needed to champion our growth efforts and drive the next chapter for outperformance. The reset of variable compensation levels after a challenging 2023 provides a $0.16 headwind while the impact of recent acquisitions and divestitures contributes $0.12 of adjusted EPS growth. Finally, considering a few non-operational items lower levels of debt due to pay-downs in the second half of 2023 are expected to yield $0.07 of EPS growth and we expect FX to also provide $0.07 of benefit. These are more than offset by an increase in the effective tax rate on a year-over-year basis, creating $0.19 of headwinds to adjusted EPS. The 2023 effective tax rate includes certain discrete events, which produced $0.09 of benefit to adjusted EPS in '23, as compared to 2022. Those benefits do not repeat in 2024 and conversely, the projected 2024 rate of 23%, includes a heavier mix of improved performance in geographical regions with higher tax rates, as well as certain legislative changes increasing global tax. So in summary, we're projecting organic revenue growth of 0% to 2% for the year. The variable compensation and tax-rate pressure essentially erodes 4% of EPS growth year-over-year lending adjusted EPS expectation in the range of $8.15 to $8.45 or down 1% to up 3% over 2023. Moving to Slide 12. I'll provide additional details regarding our 2024 guidance for both our first quarter and full-year. In Q1, we are projecting GAAP EPS to range from $1.45 to $1.50 and adjusted EPS to range from $1.70 to $1.75. Organic revenue is expected to decline 6% to 7% year-over-year due to tough comps and adjusted EBITDA margins are estimated to be about 25%. While it is not a factor impacting year-over-year comparability, I would like to remind you that on a sequential basis when walking from fourth-quarter results to first-quarter we have a headwind of $0.10 related primarily to the accelerated recognition of share-based compensation in the first-quarter of each year. Turning to the full-year 2024, in summary, we estimate full-year organic revenue of flat to up 2%, to yield GAAP EPS of $7.15 to $7.45 and adjusted EPS of $8.15 to $8.45. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 28%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be about $75 million normalized upon the completion of certain factory automation investments and emerging market footprint expansion in 2023. And free cash flow is expected to be over 100% of adjusted net income. Corporate costs are also expected to be approximately $95 million, up from 2023 by approximately $10 million as variable compensation resets to current market expectations, With that, I'll turn it over to Eric for closing remarks.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Abhi. I'm on Slide 13. In summary, the majority of our businesses are stable and starting to see the early days of market recovery. We're working together as a team to drive out performance above that baseline and we are well-positioned to capitalize on growth to come as we invest our cash-back into the business to support organic and inorganic expansion. Our core FMT businesses are back in world-class lead times with expanded margins, they're ready to expand them again as volume leverage broadly returns. Fire & Safety and Band-It within FSDP have differentiated technologies to accelerate growth and continue as the leading players in their global markets. Much of HST is seeing recovery or the early signs of growth. We temper these expectations a bit, overall, given our lack of insights supporting demand recovery within Life Sciences and Analytical Instrumentation markets, and we also face the cyclical headwinds from global dispensing in our agriculture businesses. Finally, it's really the early days of a new normal following three years of unprecedented change, better to be appropriately cautious and careful as we line up our resources and strategic plans to support the full cycle ahead. One I feel will be especially strong for companies like ours. We are prepared to help customers solve their toughest problems we see as their greatest opportunities, our businesses and technologies are outstanding. Our teams and talent are world-class and our culture is really unique. We appreciate your support and interest in IDEX. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question will be coming from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.\nNathan Jones: Good morning, everyone. Welcome back, Abhi.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Thank you, Nathan.\nNathan Jones: I just wanted to start off with a question on inventory destocking bonuses demand. I guess it's most appropriate to the Life Sciences and Analytical Instrumentation businesses. Obviously, sharp declines you saw in 2023, is there any way for you to parse out or give this more color around what you think was actually called declines in your customers' demand versus them taking down their levels of inventory of your products?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. Well, certainly the second is much larger than the first probably outlet by a level of two. So, we saw these kind of double-digit declines here pushing I think 20% at some point. I don't think that's representative of their underlying markets, and we haven't seen that in the public comments for them either. So this really was an incredible run-up and then, obviously, kind of an artificial plunge down as those things were normalized. So where is the state of their markets? Down low-single digits to maybe slightly double or the early start of double. But again, I think one of the main points we want to make sure people understand is while the comparisons even in Q4 for were dramatically different for us and we could continue to see that calibration, we've actually been living in-kind of a sequential level of stability here for a while now. And we were talking about in late summer and certainly saw through the bulk of the fourth quarter and are now projecting that more formally across '24. And so it's kind of a case of two realities, one that's going to for a while now continue to still have those year-over-year comparisons, because of the market difference we have 12 months ago the periods we're going to move through at least through the first half of the year. But a relatively stable platform here. Just lacking a little bit of visibility as to when that catalyst comes in there, that starts to accelerate again.\nNathan Jones: Yeah. I was looking at the order rates in HST and they've certainly stabilized over the last couple of quarters. There is a sequential improvement from 3Q to 4Q. Can you possibly parse out the different pieces in HST sequentially on the order rates, where you're seeing things improve versus the Life Sciences and Analytical Instrumentation or where it's going on a sequential basis?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. A couple of things there and Abhi can fill in anything I miss. But I mean, we do get a little bit more blanket activity at the end of the year even in those core lifecycle Analytical Instrumentation market, there is a little step-up there. About half of HST is kind of classically more industrial anyways and mirrors a lot of what we have over in FMT. And so that same kind of broader support and early indicators of growth that I know we'll talk about a lot here on the call we saw that kind of hit that Thanksgiving time on there too. So that accounts for a piece of it. Little bit of activity on the Semicon side, although that's real early days and modest too. So, nothing really on the declining side. A few things moving up. The only thing, again, most of it just sort of reflective of broad-based support with that one exception of a little bit of year-end blanket activity on the Life science world.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Yeah, Nathan. The only thing I'd add is, if you look at the sequential order lift in HST we are up about $30 million. Majority of that to Eric's point was demand, there about $10 million of blanket activity that happens typically year-over-year. But to Eric's point, we saw orders improve starting Thanksgiving through December.\nNathan Jones: And then I guess last one, just across the portfolio. Your customers' level of inventory now, I mean, you guys talked about still taking your inventory down in the first half of '24. Do you think your customers are still accepting similar and there is still a headwind from destocking in the first half of '24 and when do you think we'll actually get to a point where customer inventories match demand levels?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. I mean I would say I'd parse that out a bit, too I mean, a lot of inventory that would be closest to us on the FMT side would be largely in distributor channels and places like that, highly fragmented, that's largely corrected now. We never as -- we always remind you we don't sell a lot of products that stock real well, anyways. So we probably hit quicker levels there may be some, but we're good on that side. On the OEM side, I think it's customer-by-customer, but between us and our end-customers I mean we're really, clean. And a lot of that's just been driven by the fact that we got back to really, high levels of customer performance and lead-time performance early and then even if nobody is monitoring that in a manual way eventually and pretty quickly and it automates. And so, kind of, then ties those two things together. The only piece of course that we can't quite see would be, end-customer solutions inventory way out into the extended nature of their channels and we hear about pockets of it here and there from different places, but again the fragmentation and the diversification of IDEX I think puts us in a place where no one or two of those places is going to upset the balance much.\nNathan Jones: Excellent. Thanks very much for taking my questions.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Thanks, Nathan.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to ask on the Life Sciences side, new product development, I think you mentioned it was ongoing. Could you talk to it relative to historicals, like, how it's pacing is stronger, is it sort of the same amount of investments? And then just any, fairly large reset in that business as well. Has any of the competitive dynamics changed as a result of that? Just any thoughts there. Thanks.\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. No. Great questions and early here in the year there's a number of conferences and trade shows and things that always reoccur. So it's a good time to, have good touch points with people. I will tell you and I think I've said this the last couple of quarters, the level of innovation that's happening between our folks on the ground and our major customers is at a really strong level. And, I think if you step back a second, I mean, it actually makes sense Intuitively. It's a tough environment. People are coming off of a phase where largely it was about replenishment and trying to make things. And now I think there's a recognition, it's back to dynamics that are a bit more normal. You've got real competition between some very, very serious and well-established customers. Innovation in this sector is going to lead the way. And then if you look at the way that we typically interface with IDEX, I mean, we're really good at scaling with customers. So, we're hearing a lot of things now around, can you get the prototypes done sooner? Because if we do that, then that gives you the scalable production right behind it. And so I think that's as healthy as I've seen it. And in many ways to the extent that people are grappling with their own dimensions of trying to normalize cost and potentially might not have as many resources. That actually in well for the kind of work that we do as well, because we've got now a full suite of integrated capabilities. So, I think that side of it actually is our most healthy barometer about long-term, success here for both us and the sector. Competitive dynamics, there's not a ton of names in this world, I think we've good understanding of where we stack up and how we're positioned in our share. So I feel very good about, we've maintained if not enhanced our position with all the major players. And then, we continue to follow how they're doing as they battle it out side-by-side. And I always feel very good about the number of bets that we have with virtually all of them.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. Understood. And then just on working capital. I know you mentioned you wanted to bring it down. Is there any target that you're focused on and trying to attain in '24? Just any thoughts there. Thanks.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Yeah, Allison. As we mentioned in our opening remarks, we took down inventory about $65 million in 2023, which is about a 0.4 point improvement as we think of 2024 we're targeting another 0.5 point of improvement from an inventory standpoint.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. Thanks for the color.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Baird. Please proceed with your questions.\nMike Halloran: Good morning, everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Good morning, Mike.\nMike Halloran: So let's just start on the overall thought process for the year. Certainly appreciate all the color, prepared remarks. But as you think about how you're conceptually setting the guidance here, is the thought that you're basically looking for sequential stability across the platform from current levels, understanding that the ag piece, the dispencing piece, have some cyclical pressures. But the remaining pieces is just relatively normal cyclicality, not assuming an inflection or should we be thinking about those positive catalyst markets as you're pushing some sort of inflection in the numbers this year as an offset, and then maybe just talk about how you're expecting that cadencing to workout.\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. I'll kind of hit it from a revenue and demand side and let Abhi sort of square up how it financially tracks alongside of it. But, yeah, I think if you move from left to right, kind of start at the midpoint of last year. Again, we saw a back half that was pretty stable for us. Slight reductions in final reductions in backlog, but really ended the year with a normalized position. And I'll remind people that for IDEX what that means is, we turn things really, really fast, it gives us about a half a quarter of visibility when we stand here, here on January 1 looking at it. So we're kind of back to equilibrium in that perspective. And then, we started to see this sort of broader support emerging out of the snow, if you will in the end of Q4 and continuing through January. January was a nice start for us in all three segments. And so then as you project forward, you're right, Mike, we actually have a -- it's a little bit of a seasonal uptick for us, that's fairly typical from Q1 to Q2. We've not been able to see it the last couple of years because of some different dynamics that have been out there that's simply weather-related and hits businesses like water and a few others. And so we have a natural uptick there. Some of these early bookings and some of the support that we've seen just given our lead times and customer expectations kind of dials in around Q2 as well. So there's a little bit of an additive bounce there and explains a bit of a difference between Q1 and Q2. We have a series of growth bets that of course we have positioned across all verticals. I offered a few highlights in the opening comments. Those are known programs, known platforms we're engaged on those now and we feel more assured about when they're going to start along the way. And then we have things like, a slight recovery in the semiconductor markets kind of modeled more back-half than the first. So, I think it's normal IDEX, certainly a normal entry position as we look at the year some normal seasonality, normal run-out of growth bets that we have that accelerate through the year. Made a little bit more exaggerated, I think by, certainly a conservative call on the first quarter, given that we just landed here. We just landed here, we're seeing some things come together and we just kind of have a -- there is a little bit of an air pocket here just based on lead times as to where those things land and how quickly we can get at them.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Yeah, Mike. Just to add a little more color to it as you kind of-- just to build on Eric's commentary here. So if you go from left to right, kind of think about where we ended Q4. We ended Q4 at $1.83, as I move the pencil forward and look at, what we're seeing in Q1, again to Eric's point, we took a bit of a conservative view. Just sequentially, we expect operationally to get better by $0.12 to $0.15. So if you just look at operationally, $1.83 at $0.15 to it you have not $1.98 closer to $2. Year-over-year, it doesn't matter sequentially as I think about it, what does impact us is a $0.10 stock-comp timing and then $0.04 of variable comp reset that kind of takes our guide down to what we've laid up in the paper here from $1.75 to $1.77. But sequentially as you look at it operationally, we are seeing the improvement that Eric is talking about, it's early days. But as Eric mentioned we build backlog in January, majority of that is shippable in Q2 and beyond and then you see a seasonal uptick from Q1 to Q2.\nMike Halloran: Great. Super helpful. And then, just an update on how you're looking at the M&A landscape here actionability of the portfolio. I mean, from loss of opportunity, I'm guessing it's probably not that different than what you talked about the last few quarters, the last couple of years, but any revenue update you have?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. No, it continues to be an area of tremendous focus I think irrespective of what the backdrop is. We've driven the increases in potential there with funnel build and cultivation and conversations and analysis and other things that really are at the highest level we've ever had in the company. I do think though that as maybe the year feel some of the same, fundamental support that we're talking about here, I could imagine that that might help availability of targets and people might start to think about monetizing them and moving and maybe they lift the market around us as well. So it's still largely being driven by our efforts, but I think a good environment and we feel very, very positive about what we're going to be able to do there.\nMike Halloran: Great. Really appreciate everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Hi, Deane.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Hey. Just want to also add my welcome back to Abhi and also thanks for all the detail and how you've laid out the assumptions very, very clear. We appreciate all the specifics.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Thank you, Deane.\nDeane Dray: I want to circle back on the Life Sciences Analytical story here and just make sure I understand how you're not expecting and not forecasting any inflection in '24 and I get that you want to be conservative here because it's been a moving target. But if you listen to what your customers are saying, in terms of their earnings reports and how they're forecasting they're collectively talking if I were to generalize that there would be still some inventory normalization running at least through the midyear, so call it the end of the second quarter. And at that point, they would start to see some normalization, some recovery. They've got easy comps in the second half. So, I would imagine maybe there is a timing issue for you and to when that would start to read across into your recovery with these customers. But let's just start there, just what's the lead timing difference in terms of that recovery because it does seem like it pivot this year.\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. From an inventory reduction perspective, I mean, again, this is a big industry with a lot of end markets, we have different platforms, different programs and all of them. So, I mean we really get it down to customer-by-customer, factory-by-factory and inventory position between us and them in every single case. So we've known for a while that, we're in pretty lockstep at that level. Then it comes down to individual demand swings and to be fair, there'll be some and maybe in line with what you're talking about there is some pockets of end-customer inventory that might still be out there and in the way of recovery and pieces of what we have. But in other places, I think we're comfortable that the mix is going to work over and kind of hold the flat narrative that we have here and the flat projections that we have internally. Absolutely I've heard some of the same commentary around the back half. I don't have information to refute any of that and I'd be quite happy if it were to come about that way. But I think just from an internal planning and forecasting perspective. Being conservative in this way, making sure our costs are in control, we've got everything ready to go from a materials, resourcing perspective. We've built some muscle here to be more dynamic than ever before. I think presents us in lines us up in a way, should that then start to happen in the second half. So, I certainly take the point, I think, if you could see it at our level, you'd see kind of technology and major platform and customers sort of arrayed on a grid that is the way that our teams think about it as they just move across quarter-to-quarter.\nDeane Dray: That's really helpful. One question that's come up in a couple of calls and discussions that we've had in this market is a question of inventory obsolescence, just because of this pocket that we've been in of a destock as some of the inventory just is obsolete. It probably is not as much of an effect for you all. But is there any issue there and what might the dynamics be?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. I mean, I haven't heard that raised as an internal concern or issue. I'm thinking, a lot of the business we do, let's say in Analytical Instrumentation I mean it's a bit more of a mature space, mature industry maybe not as likely in the short-term, dimension to be obsoleted by major steps in technology, but I can add it there. That hasn't been something that we've talked a lot about.\nDeane Dray: Good that would be my impression as well. And then just separately just because it's a good time of year to look at that very near-term crystal ball that you have. All of your bellwether businesses collectively, whether it's Band-It or gas or Warren Rupp, just what is the kind of the cadence of demand that you're seeing in your day rates versus your expectations?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. That's one of the healthiest indicators that we have here. Just for everybody on the call, again, these are the shortest cycle more sort of widely dispersed businesses that we have with the most fragmented customer sets. And so when they move they tend to indicate, where the world is going either way. When they move together they strongly indicate where the world is going and, we saw them move together, back at the original zones of recalibration here as they move down. And in Q4 and certainly continuing here in January, they are all moving together towards the positive. These are modest rates, but a simple green arrow next to all of those names across IDEX, is meaningful and supports a lot of the confidence that we have.\nDeane Dray: That sounds great. Because we look at those and it's coincident with some of the better indicators we've seen from the ISM new orders. So I'm glad it's consistent. And that's it. Thank you.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Thanks you, Deane.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Vlad Bystricky with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.\nVlad Bystricky: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my call and thanks for all the great information. Just quickly, and sorry if I missed it, did you say what price cost actually was in the quarter and what you're assuming for price cost in '24 as well as your overall price assumptions in the 0% to 2% organic growth outlook?\nAbhi Khandelwal: Yeah. Absolutely, Vlad. This is Abhi. So firstly, for the fourth quarter, we saw pricing around 4%. It was definitely start-- we definitely start to see it come down as the year progress, so a few quarters later compared to the, prior quarters, but it's closer to 4%. As I think about 2024 what we're modeling is a 2%, price in the guide. But what we're more focused on is the price cost spread. As I think about the price-cost spread it's in the, 80 basis points to 100 basis points, which is again it's higher than the historical averages IDEX has seen. And even the 2% price capture, if you go back in time and look at the IDEX historical pre-pandemic was in the 80 to 100 basis point, 120 basis points. So that's what we've modeled in the guide.\nVlad Bystricky: Perfect. That's really helpful. Thanks, Abhi. And then I just wanted to ask you a little more-- Slide 10 is very helpful color around what you're seeing in businesses and the end markets. Can you talk a little more about what you're seeing with respect to energy transition-related demand. Kind of particular project types that are seeing a pickup or driving that and whether you're seeing it across regions or more pronounced in any particular geographies.\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. I'll take a shot at that and of course, it always go through a bit of an IDEX filters. So we're a couple of derivatives away from what you might notice is a headline. So think of this as almost any technology that's involved in, kind of the transition from traditional energy to alternate sources and emerging sustainable sources. And we see that in places like battery manufacturing. We don't make the batteries but we do a lot of the work around material handling because it's pretty nasty caustic material. And so we've seen really, really nice velocity there and continuing into '24 on things supporting kind of all the work that goes on for switch-over to battery tech. Even some of the businesses that we have in FMT that have a little bit of mining exposure have been strong for a while, they continue strong and of course, it's tied to the mineral extraction that goes with that. One of our recent acquisitions on the Airtech side and that business ever since it came and was a part of IDEX, one of its strongest catalyst has been alternative energy solutions where we do some of the thermal management that happens inside. So it's, again, we're kind of in the box, with our high-tech components and we're doing very, very critical jobs and we're doing them a little far away from the headlines, but you can absolutely see the lines coming right back into that industry. You asked about geographic spread. I wouldn't say there's I mean, we have projects in Europe. Some of them ultimately land in Asia. So it's pretty uniform across the globe. But again, we're hitting it in these niche verticals and niche applications.\nVlad Bystricky: Great. That's really helpful color. I appreciate it. Thanks.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Thanks, Vlad.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Wertheimer: Thanks. So my question is going to be on HST, Life Sciences within it and how you manage costs and I guess there's a kind of a specific one, to your question on how the financials may play out and then just a larger question on philosophy on how you manage the business. Is the cost structure currently set such that if demand does come back, and you see above-normal incrementals you kind of return towards historical margin levels? I mean that's kind of the first one, do you kind of prime for return would cost come back. And then the second question is more just how do you think about cutting cost when businesses turn down? Obviously nobody has a crystal ball, we can't see what happens in two years. If you'd known how deep this downturn would have been would you have managed the business any differently or not? Thanks.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Well, look. Thanks for the questions. So as I think about where we've been over the last couple of years as just good operators, good business cadence, we've been looking at our cost structure, you can see in our financials where quarter-after-quarter if you look at our restructuring around, right, we've done work in that area. Where we are today from a cost standpoint in our Life Sciences business, because that was the question, we feel comfortable with where we are, given where the volume levels are. To your point, as the volumes start to turn, the leverage on that is going to be a point where the margin rates are going to expand. As I think about how we're going to be thinking about this business long-term, it is all about, balancing our cost structure in a way where it physically volume levels. We don't have any specific plans today to take any more cost out.\nEric Ashleman: But I think coming back to, kind of how we manage it and maybe then applying some hindsight in whether or not we would have done a different. I mean, I would put the same for all IDEX businesses, that the places where we've the most careful are areas of domain expertise, technical know-how and, customer relationships. We're really, really careful with those. Because look at these programs and the lifecycle in these risk-averse areas they only change and come around so often even when it's in a market as dynamic as this one. And so if you're not staffed and ready to go. And I use my comments earlier here about, this might seem like a counter-intuitive part of the cycle where business is down, we're wondering when it's going to recover, and yet the innovation moves are actually really active. And again maybe counter intuitively because customers are struggling with some maybe potentially their own resource allocation abilities. That actually dials in quite favorably to our ability to help solve problems with our people. And so think of that is like a very solid core that's sort of under-glass and we're very, very careful about going near it. Labor obviously labor markets have eased up a bit. Frankly, it's easier to flex them and so some of what Abhi is talking about under the year we've made those moves. We've taken variable resources out that can be brought back in we think quite easily should we need to go up, but that technical core kind of remains. The other thing that we leverage really, really well at IDEX and I think do it quite intuitively as frankly when we look at our leaders. All of our leaders are kind of ready when they need comes to be able to go do more, because they're really-- we have a flat organizational structure and we're close to the point of impact anyways. And so, avoidance is actually a big thing, cost avoidance and holding back additions. We are actually able to flex that muscle a lot more than most companies. And so when, environments are here and we're starting to see the early signs we can sort of be really careful and hold back because we've got the deployment plans that allows very smart people to get close to the action and step in. So, I think it's those two things working around frankly a labor environment that's healthier for some of that flexing that you just would want to do. All of which says that in the early days of demand run up back to Abhi's points on margin expansion, we always perform very well as we're coming out of a period like this for all of these reasons. The leverage is kind of its highest point.\nRob Wertheimer: Perfect. Thank you for the mini-education there Eric and I look forward to meeting you Abhi. Thanks.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Same here. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nBrett Linzey: Hey. Good morning, all.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Good morning, Brett.\nBrett Linzey: Hey. Just wanted to come back to the, distribution MRO and some of the stabilization you're seeing there, good to see. Just curious, on the other side around CapEx and planning assumptions among your customers. Has the tone changed in terms of capital outlays and things of that nature and what are you expecting in those types of businesses for the year?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. I mean, you kind of see that large project work and large capital in primarily in our water business to some degree you see it, of course, that's municipal capital, be it in energy, a little bit in pharma. So I mean, in those zones, I would say it's early days and modest, but it is positive. So these would be small expansion opportunities or projects that they've been talking about for a while that they want to now start to get moving. I don't know that in many of them I would say you're at the, kind of mega project level or we're ready to go, or it's been sanctioned, but to be fair, that's the usual step-up when things get more positive. So we are hearing some good indications, from a variety of different markets, about more intentional capital deployment. Not yet at the levels of kind of full-cycle supporting multi-quarter or even year in duration, but good early signs that it's actually quite different than what we saw in a lot of 2023.\nBrett Linzey: Okay. Got it. And then just one last one on the margin outlook for this year. So 28% EBITDA margins, I was hoping you might be able to provide a little bit of context and dimension to the segment levels. FMT, specifically, I'm interested with that, softer, but how are you thinking about the, outlook for the segments around that 28%?\nAbhi Khandelwal: Yeah, absolutely. I can do that for you. So as you saw in our guide for '24 for the company is 28%. So if you think about HST, I think as we exit the year, you're going to start to see our margins come closer to 30%, as the volumes flexes back up in the back half of the year. On the FMT side, you should expect slight bit of margin expansion on top of what you saw in 2023. And about the FSDP side, you should expect to see slight margin erosion due to the, completion of the big-box retailer refresh cycle, which puts some mix pressure on the margin line But again, HST you should see expansion, FMT slight bit of expansion and FSD a little bit of contraction, tied to dispensing.\nBrett Linzey: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your questions.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you good morning everyone. A lot covered here, so maybe I'll zoom out and Eric, maybe just a little bit longer-term perspective here. Some talk about, being positioned for the recovery and the like I just wonder your confidence level or your view on sort of normalized organic growth for the company, right? We've come through this tumultuous three years, but looking at it through the lens of kind of, your pre-COVID growth rate 2011 to 2019 was 3% or 4% organic, on average, it sounds like from Abhi's comment, maybe there's another point of price in the future relative what you have. But what is your confidence level that, maybe putting aside kind of a snapback here in 2025 that you're at a higher level of organic growth going forward on a normalized basis?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. Well, I appreciate the question and that's absolutely where we're heading. And so think of this as two levers primarily that we're moving. One is just the nature of the portfolio of IDEX. So, we've been more aggressive towards capital deployment. Everything we're bringing into IDEX today is inherently in faster-growing markets than, let's say, more of the industrial core that we see, most notably in FMT. So, the comparative basis that's tuning. We haven't done a lot of pruning on the other side, it's fairly modest. But to the extent we're doing it, that's actually moving that portfolio average up as well. And then, if with reasonable market support sort of absent massive swings of either way, as you suggested, I think we've long been targeting 200 basis points to 300 basis points of outperformance and everything we're working on today is moving that towards the upper bound of that run-out. So if you think of a world that let's say would start to dial itself in more from a fundamental perspective towards something in the 2% to 3% range and sort of natural entitlement. And maybe that's lifting from there because of the work that we're doing, as I mentioned, and then out performance above it, it has us, moving into a space where we're targeting mid-single-digit growth for IDEX. On an organic basis. With then obviously some, fundamental capital deployment on top of it, which would then extend the overall organic rate of the company. It's absolutely the area of focus, has been for a while and we're really, we're excited about potentially taking out some of the forces that have been swinging up-and-down and sideways making that hard to see.\nJeff Sprague: And where do you stand on the view of price, right? You have more than normal still in 2024. There is some argument out there that industrial companies have, developed more price muscle coming through this period. Do you think, there's kind of durable stickiness in the 2% range or do we sort of head back to something more like one over time?\nAbhi Khandelwal: Well, look, first of all. I think to your point, where the world is we're not back to the inflation levels that we were at, pre-pandemic. I mean even if you look at the near-term view it's still at what 2.5%, 3%. So are we going to hang on to where we are today? No. Does that mean we're going to, go back to where they used to be back in the historical levels? No, it's going to be somewhere in the middle. But looking at 2024, we feel pretty good about our position and where we are from a price cost standpoint.\nEric Ashleman: And, I would say, here, I think this is a point of absolute point of competitive advantage for us, where price capture, we've always been in the price capture game. And we've done that because of our positioning and our innovation with great customers. Period. So, yes, we've come through a phase here where kind of everybody got price, because you had to. But, I think as the world normalizes here as Abhi says we'll probably land a little north of where we've been, as long as the underlying, core inflation stays a little harder too. So we'll maintain the spread that you'd expect. But I'm really proud and I think we will be noticed to be noticeably differentiated because of this core capability that we have to differentiate in sticky markets with risk-averse customers that reward us when we do our job well.\nJeff Sprague: Thanks. And just one other quick one. What percent of your total Life Sciences and Analytical is in China at this point?\nEric Ashleman: I mean, we don't have a lot of direct business there, we're kind of following customers. So it's closer-- a better ratio would be what percentage of their business is in China, which is-- I mean it's a fraction. It's less than 20% plus or minus depending on the sector that we're involved with. But again that's-- it's kind of an indirect vectoring for us there. We don't have a lot of feet on the ground there in a direct way.\nJeff Sprague: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with BNP. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Hey, Andrew.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Just wanted to -- on Slide 10, you gave a great breakdown of kind of where you're thinking things shake out, where they're going by end-market. I'm wondering HST, margins really kind of struggled towards the end of the year there. That Life Sciences and Analytical Instrumentation piece, how do we think about it from a mix standpoint because you mentioned mix a few times, I imagine if that were to come back this year that could be a nice bonus for your margins.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Yeah. Just so I make myself clear. The mix that we were talking about was the mix of the dispensing business causing pressure in 2024 since the refresh cycle with the big-box retailers were over. But to go back to your question, if I think about the Life Sciences business and think about volumes coming back, I think as Eric mentioned just where we are positioned on our cost structure as the business has come back and we still see a little help from volume, you should see our margins expand in our HST segment throughout the year.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. In FMT, I thought that was surprising the growth you saw this quarter. How much is attributed to really like some of the government stimulus you're seeing? And is that where some of your confidence is coming in '24?\nEric Ashleman: I mean, that's out there to some extent, it's probably most directly linked to spaces like water within it. But that's a small part of the overall segment. It's an indirect relationship for us. So to the extent that is one of the elements that's out there as a backstop, providing some confidence. Yes, it of course correlates. I would say more generally, for me this is it's just a healthier view from a number of folks that think it's time to be confident, lean into their markets, stop reaping inventory out of the system and kind of get to work. Again, just to make sure everybody can 3D think this through. So they're building a lot of roads out there. I'll use that as an example, or if they're starting to fix them with abandon. We've got a lot of pumps and things that are involved in pumping liquid asphalt. So that's kind of a nature of some of these relationships. So you can line up both government-intensive work that's supported that way as well as just general industrial are people feeling confident about the work that they're doing in their factories. Either one and taken together drive this dynamic.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Yeah. All right. Thanks for the color.\nEric Ashleman: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Joe Giordano with TD, Cowen. Please proceed with your questions.\nJoe Giordano: Hey, guys. Thanks for sneaking me in here. I had a question on HST just on the revenue guide. I was a little surprised at the strength there and I know you guys don't guide to orders, specifically. But if you just kind of hold orders around the fourth-quarter level, maybe a little bit above into the 2024 and just run off the excess orders that were done like post-COVID when book-to-bill was really high it kind of implies like a decent decline next year. So, I was curious if you're contemplating, in order of recovery of more magnitude in 2024 for HST?\nAbhi Khandelwal: Yeah. So if I kind of think about the guide for the year and look at the order-- sequential order run up from Q3 to Q4, as you mentioned. First of all, the uptick in orders of $30 million from Q3 to Q4 $10 million of that was blanket orders. That's going to ship throughout 2024 and $20 million of debt was through demand or sequential improvement that we saw throughout the quarter. That said, as I think about 2024, we do expect to build or build the orders up as we go throughout the year. As Eric mentioned, we are being cautious, given where we are seeing early signs of recovery in the different parts of HST. So as you think about the order profile and think about the balance of the year, we expect to continue to build that order book up and ship that throughout the year.\nEric Ashleman: And then just a reminder that, again, about half the segment is pretty industrial in nature, so it kind of mirrors a lot of the other comments that we've had many of them around FMT businesses, but you get about half of that, driving and supporting HST as well.\nJoe Giordano: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session and I will turn the call over to Eric Ashleman for closing remarks.\nEric Ashleman: Okay. Well, thanks everyone on the call for your questions and the interest in IDEX. Abhi, thanks for joining and coming to your first earnings call with me. Just a few things here. I mean, number one, we realize from the outside, IDEX is a complex and diversified company. And it hasn't helped that we've had a lot of, swings in some of the larger markets of the company, both up-and-down over the last couple of years. So, we've done our best to work through that with you and help you understand where we are. I think right now that we're actually in a place where things are a lot clearer than they've been in a while. Certainly, one of our key messages here is we've hit a uniform market stability, we hit that last fall and we really enjoyed Q4 and being having a chance to take a breath and get lined up here for the beginnings of what we think will be a great cycle. The vast majority of our end markets are starting to see a return to growth, as we said and I think that point around the shorter cycle business is starting to move together. That has always been a very reliable proxy for us in the company. Early days, but we've seen that, we've now seen it reinforced in January. And I remind people that as we've tuned IDEX and tuned it to the kind of companies that we brought in that are faster-growing closer to really, really strong OEMs, it drives a series of bets and initiatives across the company where the unit measure is a little bit larger. We're working to execute that and laying that on a foundation as we go. The fundamental piece of the story here is, we have confidence in accelerating through the year. The Life Sciences and Analytical Instrumentation world, it is uncertain for 2024. But I do want to come back and just echo some comments I've made before about just our commitment to that space and are confident in the long-term fundamental performance that we're all going to enjoy there and our positioning is fantastic. We see that evidenced by the innovation that we're being asked to do. And finally, we put a lot of capital to work over the last three years with real intentionality in some pretty choppy seas. And so if things are going to calm down and we'll get some more winds at our back, I'm really, really confident we'll be able to push that further, and continue to do that work and continue to transform the company. So thanks again for joining. Have a great day.\nOperator: This will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "name": "Abhi Khandelwal",
            "content": "Thanks, Eric, and thanks to everyone for welcoming me back to IDEX. It's great to be here and be re-joining a great organization. Moving onto the consolidated financial results on Slide 8. All comparisons are against the prior year period unless stated otherwise. Orders of $754 million in the fourth quarter were down 6% overall, and down 10% organically. We experienced an organic decrease in each of our three segments. FMT and FSDP declined mid-single-digits while HST contracted by about 17% as market stabilized at a new level post-recalibration. For the year orders were down 7% overall, and down 11% organically. Our HST segment contracted upwards of 20% as customer experienced a sharp inventory recalibration during the year and level-set to new near-term demand targets that include stunted growth expectations for China coming out of the pandemic. Our FMT and FSDP segments were down low-single digits as they also experienced recalibration although at a much smaller scale. Fourth quarter sales of $789 million were down 3% overall, and down 6% organically. We experienced a 19% organic decrease in HST while both FMT and FSDP grew by 3% organically. Full-year sales of $3.3 billion were up 3% overall and down 1% organically. HST contracted by 10% on an organic basis driven by declining life sciences analytical instrumentation and semiconductor markets, partially offset by price. FMT and FSDP grew mid-single-digits, driven largely by strong price capture on slightly higher volumes. Fourth-quarter gross margin was essentially flat at 42.7% while adjusted gross margin, which was also 42.7% contracted 90 basis points due to lower volume leverage, unfavorable mix and the dilutive impact of acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by strong price-cost and operational productivity. Both full-year gross margin and adjusted gross margin of 44.2% contracted 60 basis points for the same reasons I just described. Fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.8%, down 120 basis points. I will discuss the drivers of fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA on the next slide. On a full-year basis adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 40 basis points to 27.5%. A bridge of the full-year adjusted EBITDA can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Despite a year of significant volume pressure, our teams delivered on price-cost and operational productivity, significantly muting the impact of these unprecedented volume declines. On a GAAP basis, our Q4 effective tax rate of 22.7% versus last year's fourth-quarter effective tax rate of 20.5% increased primarily due to the absence of one-time foreign currency benefits realized in 2022 in connection with the funding of the acquisition of Muon as well as the impact of the loss recorded on the sale of Novotema during 2023. For which no related tax benefit was realized due to the type of consolidated group in which it participated. Our full-year GAAP effective tax rate of 21.7% was flat with the prior year. However, both 2023 and 2022 included favorable discrete events. Fourth-quarter net income was $109 million generating EPS of $1.43. Adjusted net income was $139 million with adjusted EPS of $1.83, down $0.18 from the prior year fourth quarter. Full-year net income was $596 million, resulting in EPS of $7.85. Adjusted net income was $624 million. Generating adjusted EPS of $8.22, up $0.10 or 1% from last year. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $179 million, up 22% over the prior year period. We achieved a conversion rate of 129% of adjusted net income, mainly driven by improved working capital performance despite lower adjusted net income. On an organic basis, we drove more than $40 million of inventory reduction in the quarter through our targeted reduction efforts and we saw inventory turns improve. For the year we delivered record free cash flow of $627 million, up 28% versus last year and coming in at 101% of adjusted net income. Mainly driven by lower net working capital as we reduced organic inventory levels by almost $65 million and achieved higher adjusted net income. We achieved this despite higher year-over-year capital expenditure as we maintain focus on investing for the future. We will continue to drive inventory levels down and optimize working capital levels further in 2024. Moving on to Slide 9 which details the drivers of our fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $15 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Our 6% organic sales reduction unfavorably impacted adjusted EBITDA by $36 million, flowing through at our prior year adjusted gross margin rate. Price cost was accretive to margins and we drove operational productivity that offset employee-related inflation. Mix was unfavorable by $3 million. Reductions in variable compensation contributed $3 million of benefit in the quarter. These results yielded a negative 39% organic flow-through. Overall, our team's focus on cost containment and resource reallocation has effectively managed our revenue declines. IDEX is well-positioned to recover and grow back stronger than before when market dynamics turn favorable. The impact of FX and acquisitions, net of divestitures contributed $5 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. However, the divestiture of Micropump load flow-through as the margins were higher than those of our newly acquired assets who were experiencing volume deleveraging, given the end markets deplane. With that, I will provide a deeper look at our segment performance. I'm on Slide 10. Let me walk you through our outlook as it relates to our end markets. First, as I consider the markets served by our Fluid & Metering technology segment. Industrial derates began to see some sequential improvement in the fourth quarter and we expect continued stability in the near-term as our short-cycle businesses meet underlying customer demand. We continue to see normalized book-and-bill order patterns given shorter lead times and normalized supply chain dynamics. As we move into 2024, we're cautiously optimistic as we continue to see tailwinds due to domestic infrastructure initiatives and within mining. We anticipate these patterns will hold. Dolby will continue to mind our derates to evaluate longer-term expectations as this is the most short-cycle market exposure. Our water businesses continue to be favorably positioned as we enter 2024. Municipal project activity remains strong with no signs of funding delays and the project funnel is healthy with new opportunities winning share to deliver solutions for critical water challenges. Our energy business has been steady, even as new oil production is down and fuel markets are flat, driven by declining fuel prices and mild heating seasons in North America and Europe. As consolidation occurs within this industry and funding for new projects remain delayed, we see operators doing more with less using the same infrastructure to drive production. These market dynamics favorably impact our demand profile. As our energy businesses meet customers' need for replacements as they keep existing infrastructure running. In the chemical market, we continue to see positive results across US and Europe with pharma and battery applications providing opportunities for growth. China softness is being mitigated by the rest of Asia. The one area experiencing pronounced headwinds in FMT is our agricultural business. The size of this market is about 10% of the FMT segment, which equates to mid-single-digits for overall IDEX. We continue to see headwinds as OEMs have stepped down their projections due to continued destocking and declining net farm income and crop prices. Our KZValve acquisition continues to be a differentiator with its automated actuation valve technology and we are focused on targeted share gain to offset the pressure of current market challenges. Moving onto the Health & Science Technologies segment. We continue to see positive results stemming from our space broadband laser communication initiatives which are bolstered by Iridian's technological capabilities. We expect this space to grow in 2024. The industrial markets served by businesses in the HST segment are experiencing signals in line with FMT has expectations. Our material processing technology business is gaining share in battery production with the step up in new orders as we enter the year. And we continue to see signs of improvement within biopharma related to new vaccine development, where our technologies are uniquely positioned. We see particular strength in emerging markets. For semiconductor, we began to see initial signs of improvement as we exited 2023. We expect this market will continue to recover somewhat in '24 driven by an improved outlook for memory chips due to demand for devices. Further out, we look forward to continued growth in Semicon driven by artificial intelligence, automotive and long-term secular tailwinds driven by electrification. While these markets point towards growth area within the HST, that is not yet showing signs of recovery is in our Life Sciences and Analytical Instrumentation markets, which represents nearly 35% of HST and about 15% of overall IDEX. However, the long-term growth drivers have not changed. While orders appear to be stabilizing, we have not forecasted a positive inflection yet for 2024. While this industry navigates immediate-term challenges, we continue to have our eye on the future. We are closely partner with our customers across our Life Sciences businesses and we're actively innovating to provide tomorrow solution. With our focus on innovation and operational scale to support customers from prototyping to production we are uniquely positioned for growth as these markets recover. Turning to our Fire & Safety Diversified Products. We expect FSDP will be flattish to down slightly in 2024 driven by headwinds in dispensing as key customers recently completed the multi-year refreshment cycle. We expect Fire & Safety end markets to remain stable and growth to be driven by strategic share gain initiatives our teams are focused on. We continue to win through value-added integrated systems and technology and standardized offerings that enable higher OEM throughput. Overall demand Band-it continues to remain strong and we expect growth on a year-over-year basis. With that, I'd like to provide an update on our outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2024. I'm on Slide 11. We expect full-year organic growth of 0% to 2% with the majority of our end markets stable to growing as I highlighted in my market outlook commentary. This wage reflects low-single-digit growth from FMT and includes acknowledgment of the uncertainty in timing and scale of recovery given the short-cycle nature of our business. For HST we expect low-single-digit growth as broader expectations for year-over-year growth across its markets are moderated by the lack of visibility in the Life Sciences and Analytical Instrumentation space. And we expect FSDP to be down slightly as the dispensing refreshment cycle has completed and volume in that space will step down. The dynamic is expected to lower overall IDEX organic growth by 1% and offset the growth expected by Fire & Safety and Band-it. This organic rate guide equals earnings per share contraction of $0.03 to growth of $0.26 depending on top-line results and includes price-cost, which we anticipate will be positive for the year and mixed pressure stemming from dispensing volumes. Additionally, we expect our operational productivity will more than offset pressure from wage-related inflation and provide $0.10 to $0.15 of EPS growth. As always, we're committed to investing in the future growth prospects and expect to make incremental resource investments of $0.05 to $0.09 during the year as we invest in the people needed to champion our growth efforts and drive the next chapter for outperformance. The reset of variable compensation levels after a challenging 2023 provides a $0.16 headwind while the impact of recent acquisitions and divestitures contributes $0.12 of adjusted EPS growth. Finally, considering a few non-operational items lower levels of debt due to pay-downs in the second half of 2023 are expected to yield $0.07 of EPS growth and we expect FX to also provide $0.07 of benefit. These are more than offset by an increase in the effective tax rate on a year-over-year basis, creating $0.19 of headwinds to adjusted EPS. The 2023 effective tax rate includes certain discrete events, which produced $0.09 of benefit to adjusted EPS in '23, as compared to 2022. Those benefits do not repeat in 2024 and conversely, the projected 2024 rate of 23%, includes a heavier mix of improved performance in geographical regions with higher tax rates, as well as certain legislative changes increasing global tax. So in summary, we're projecting organic revenue growth of 0% to 2% for the year. The variable compensation and tax-rate pressure essentially erodes 4% of EPS growth year-over-year lending adjusted EPS expectation in the range of $8.15 to $8.45 or down 1% to up 3% over 2023. Moving to Slide 12. I'll provide additional details regarding our 2024 guidance for both our first quarter and full-year. In Q1, we are projecting GAAP EPS to range from $1.45 to $1.50 and adjusted EPS to range from $1.70 to $1.75. Organic revenue is expected to decline 6% to 7% year-over-year due to tough comps and adjusted EBITDA margins are estimated to be about 25%. While it is not a factor impacting year-over-year comparability, I would like to remind you that on a sequential basis when walking from fourth-quarter results to first-quarter we have a headwind of $0.10 related primarily to the accelerated recognition of share-based compensation in the first-quarter of each year. Turning to the full-year 2024, in summary, we estimate full-year organic revenue of flat to up 2%, to yield GAAP EPS of $7.15 to $7.45 and adjusted EPS of $8.15 to $8.45. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 28%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be about $75 million normalized upon the completion of certain factory automation investments and emerging market footprint expansion in 2023. And free cash flow is expected to be over 100% of adjusted net income. Corporate costs are also expected to be approximately $95 million, up from 2023 by approximately $10 million as variable compensation resets to current market expectations, With that, I'll turn it over to Eric for closing remarks. Thank you, Nathan. Yeah, Nathan. The only thing I'd add is, if you look at the sequential order lift in HST we are up about $30 million. Majority of that to Eric's point was demand, there about $10 million of blanket activity that happens typically year-over-year. But to Eric's point, we saw orders improve starting Thanksgiving through December. Thanks, Nathan. Yeah, Allison. As we mentioned in our opening remarks, we took down inventory about $65 million in 2023, which is about a 0.4 point improvement as we think of 2024 we're targeting another 0.5 point of improvement from an inventory standpoint. Thank you. Yeah, Mike. Just to add a little more color to it as you kind of-- just to build on Eric's commentary here. So if you go from left to right, kind of think about where we ended Q4. We ended Q4 at $1.83, as I move the pencil forward and look at, what we're seeing in Q1, again to Eric's point, we took a bit of a conservative view. Just sequentially, we expect operationally to get better by $0.12 to $0.15. So if you just look at operationally, $1.83 at $0.15 to it you have not $1.98 closer to $2. Year-over-year, it doesn't matter sequentially as I think about it, what does impact us is a $0.10 stock-comp timing and then $0.04 of variable comp reset that kind of takes our guide down to what we've laid up in the paper here from $1.75 to $1.77. But sequentially as you look at it operationally, we are seeing the improvement that Eric is talking about, it's early days. But as Eric mentioned we build backlog in January, majority of that is shippable in Q2 and beyond and then you see a seasonal uptick from Q1 to Q2. Good morning, Deane. Thank you, Deane. Thanks you, Deane. Yeah. Absolutely, Vlad. This is Abhi. So firstly, for the fourth quarter, we saw pricing around 4%. It was definitely start-- we definitely start to see it come down as the year progress, so a few quarters later compared to the, prior quarters, but it's closer to 4%. As I think about 2024 what we're modeling is a 2%, price in the guide. But what we're more focused on is the price cost spread. As I think about the price-cost spread it's in the, 80 basis points to 100 basis points, which is again it's higher than the historical averages IDEX has seen. And even the 2% price capture, if you go back in time and look at the IDEX historical pre-pandemic was in the 80 to 100 basis point, 120 basis points. So that's what we've modeled in the guide. Thanks, Vlad. Well, look. Thanks for the questions. So as I think about where we've been over the last couple of years as just good operators, good business cadence, we've been looking at our cost structure, you can see in our financials where quarter-after-quarter if you look at our restructuring around, right, we've done work in that area. Where we are today from a cost standpoint in our Life Sciences business, because that was the question, we feel comfortable with where we are, given where the volume levels are. To your point, as the volumes start to turn, the leverage on that is going to be a point where the margin rates are going to expand. As I think about how we're going to be thinking about this business long-term, it is all about, balancing our cost structure in a way where it physically volume levels. We don't have any specific plans today to take any more cost out. Same here. Thank you. Good morning, Brett. Yeah, absolutely. I can do that for you. So as you saw in our guide for '24 for the company is 28%. So if you think about HST, I think as we exit the year, you're going to start to see our margins come closer to 30%, as the volumes flexes back up in the back half of the year. On the FMT side, you should expect slight bit of margin expansion on top of what you saw in 2023. And about the FSDP side, you should expect to see slight margin erosion due to the, completion of the big-box retailer refresh cycle, which puts some mix pressure on the margin line But again, HST you should see expansion, FMT slight bit of expansion and FSD a little bit of contraction, tied to dispensing. Well, look, first of all. I think to your point, where the world is we're not back to the inflation levels that we were at, pre-pandemic. I mean even if you look at the near-term view it's still at what 2.5%, 3%. So are we going to hang on to where we are today? No. Does that mean we're going to, go back to where they used to be back in the historical levels? No, it's going to be somewhere in the middle. But looking at 2024, we feel pretty good about our position and where we are from a price cost standpoint. Hey, Andrew. Yeah. Just so I make myself clear. The mix that we were talking about was the mix of the dispensing business causing pressure in 2024 since the refresh cycle with the big-box retailers were over. But to go back to your question, if I think about the Life Sciences business and think about volumes coming back, I think as Eric mentioned just where we are positioned on our cost structure as the business has come back and we still see a little help from volume, you should see our margins expand in our HST segment throughout the year. Yeah. So if I kind of think about the guide for the year and look at the order-- sequential order run up from Q3 to Q4, as you mentioned. First of all, the uptick in orders of $30 million from Q3 to Q4 $10 million of that was blanket orders. That's going to ship throughout 2024 and $20 million of debt was through demand or sequential improvement that we saw throughout the quarter. That said, as I think about 2024, we do expect to build or build the orders up as we go throughout the year. As Eric mentioned, we are being cautious, given where we are seeing early signs of recovery in the different parts of HST. So as you think about the order profile and think about the balance of the year, we expect to continue to build that order book up and ship that throughout the year."

            "name": "Eric Ashleman",
            "content": "Thanks, Allison, and good morning everyone. First, I'd like to introduce and welcome our new CFO, Abhi Khandelwal back to IDEX. Abhi previously worked at IDEX for 10 years and served as my finance partner for the majority of that tenure. I'm thrilled to welcome them back. And in many ways, it feels like you never left. Turning to Slide 6. We navigated the challenging backdrop in 2023 with really strong execution. As backlogs normalized, we took inventory out of the system, reduced lead times for customers, increased cash-flow to record levels, and delivered productivity through strong price capture and operational excellence. As always, I want to reach out to our IDEX employees around the globe with a sincere and appreciative thank you. I want to apply a bit of high level perspective as I covered last year's dynamic demand patterns. Coming into 2023, we expect this would be a year of re-calibration across our broad array of markets and our thesis certainly held. Our fragmented industrial markets within FMT and parts of FSDP and HST played out as expected. Supply chains improved, dropping overall lead times bringing artificially high backlog and inventory levels into focus. Customers attack these positions moderately over time through order reductions to our businesses, ultimately reaching levels of stability for us in the fall. Our less fragmented markets within Life Sciences and Analytical Instrumentation and Semicon recalibrated in a dramatically different way. Through much of the post pandemic recovery, these markets had run red-hot with demand that was really only constrained by supply chain availability. Demand pressures from high interest rates, lower capital availability and a lackluster post-COVID recovery in China, combined with outside inventory balances and backlogs drove sharp order reductions throughout these normally fast-growing sectors. This played out dramatically in the first half for IDEX. Given our short-cycle character, we saw the decline quicker than many and reached equilibrium in the fall sooner than some. As we delivered against expectations within a stable Q4, we took a breath and developed a plan of attack for the year ahead. Lead times and backlogs are back to pre-pandemic levels. The majority of our industrial and municipal businesses are stable and seeing improvement with early and encouraging signs of modest growth ahead. The open questions are the specific catalysts and timing to support further acceleration. Our teams continue to aggressively engage with our top growth bets to drive market out performance. These initiatives are spread across all segments in a variety of niche verticals. We're particularly excited about our growth work with customers in our water, Semicon, space communications, and energy transition markets. The markets not yet showing signs of near-term recovery remains Life Sciences and Analytical Instrumentation. We haven't forecasted a positive inflection yet for 2024. That said, our teams continue to work a robust pipeline of innovative projects in conjunction with our customers, positioning us to win on tomorrow's Next-Gen platforms. We believe in the long-term growth potential of these end markets and are well-positioned to support growth at the first signs of improved demand. We continue to focus on aggressive capital deployment towards M&A as we tune the portfolio towards faster-growing high-quality markets. We acquired Iridian and STC Material Solutions last year, adding important pieces of material science technology to our HST segment. Our funnel is expanding, filled with targets that enhance our growth potential. Our balance sheet is strong, fully supporting our ambitions. Finally, we divested two businesses Micropump and Novotema as we practice AD20 at the enterprise level. With that, I'll turn it over to Abhi to discuss our financial results. Thanks, Abhi. I'm on Slide 13. In summary, the majority of our businesses are stable and starting to see the early days of market recovery. We're working together as a team to drive out performance above that baseline and we are well-positioned to capitalize on growth to come as we invest our cash-back into the business to support organic and inorganic expansion. Our core FMT businesses are back in world-class lead times with expanded margins, they're ready to expand them again as volume leverage broadly returns. Fire & Safety and Band-It within FSDP have differentiated technologies to accelerate growth and continue as the leading players in their global markets. Much of HST is seeing recovery or the early signs of growth. We temper these expectations a bit, overall, given our lack of insights supporting demand recovery within Life Sciences and Analytical Instrumentation markets, and we also face the cyclical headwinds from global dispensing in our agriculture businesses. Finally, it's really the early days of a new normal following three years of unprecedented change, better to be appropriately cautious and careful as we line up our resources and strategic plans to support the full cycle ahead. One I feel will be especially strong for companies like ours. We are prepared to help customers solve their toughest problems we see as their greatest opportunities, our businesses and technologies are outstanding. Our teams and talent are world-class and our culture is really unique. We appreciate your support and interest in IDEX. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions. Yeah. Well, certainly the second is much larger than the first probably outlet by a level of two. So, we saw these kind of double-digit declines here pushing I think 20% at some point. I don't think that's representative of their underlying markets, and we haven't seen that in the public comments for them either. So this really was an incredible run-up and then, obviously, kind of an artificial plunge down as those things were normalized. So where is the state of their markets? Down low-single digits to maybe slightly double or the early start of double. But again, I think one of the main points we want to make sure people understand is while the comparisons even in Q4 for were dramatically different for us and we could continue to see that calibration, we've actually been living in-kind of a sequential level of stability here for a while now. And we were talking about in late summer and certainly saw through the bulk of the fourth quarter and are now projecting that more formally across '24. And so it's kind of a case of two realities, one that's going to for a while now continue to still have those year-over-year comparisons, because of the market difference we have 12 months ago the periods we're going to move through at least through the first half of the year. But a relatively stable platform here. Just lacking a little bit of visibility as to when that catalyst comes in there, that starts to accelerate again. Yeah. A couple of things there and Abhi can fill in anything I miss. But I mean, we do get a little bit more blanket activity at the end of the year even in those core lifecycle Analytical Instrumentation market, there is a little step-up there. About half of HST is kind of classically more industrial anyways and mirrors a lot of what we have over in FMT. And so that same kind of broader support and early indicators of growth that I know we'll talk about a lot here on the call we saw that kind of hit that Thanksgiving time on there too. So that accounts for a piece of it. Little bit of activity on the Semicon side, although that's real early days and modest too. So, nothing really on the declining side. A few things moving up. The only thing, again, most of it just sort of reflective of broad-based support with that one exception of a little bit of year-end blanket activity on the Life science world. Yeah. I mean I would say I'd parse that out a bit, too I mean, a lot of inventory that would be closest to us on the FMT side would be largely in distributor channels and places like that, highly fragmented, that's largely corrected now. We never as -- we always remind you we don't sell a lot of products that stock real well, anyways. So we probably hit quicker levels there may be some, but we're good on that side. On the OEM side, I think it's customer-by-customer, but between us and our end-customers I mean we're really, clean. And a lot of that's just been driven by the fact that we got back to really, high levels of customer performance and lead-time performance early and then even if nobody is monitoring that in a manual way eventually and pretty quickly and it automates. And so, kind of, then ties those two things together. The only piece of course that we can't quite see would be, end-customer solutions inventory way out into the extended nature of their channels and we hear about pockets of it here and there from different places, but again the fragmentation and the diversification of IDEX I think puts us in a place where no one or two of those places is going to upset the balance much. Yeah. No. Great questions and early here in the year there's a number of conferences and trade shows and things that always reoccur. So it's a good time to, have good touch points with people. I will tell you and I think I've said this the last couple of quarters, the level of innovation that's happening between our folks on the ground and our major customers is at a really strong level. And, I think if you step back a second, I mean, it actually makes sense Intuitively. It's a tough environment. People are coming off of a phase where largely it was about replenishment and trying to make things. And now I think there's a recognition, it's back to dynamics that are a bit more normal. You've got real competition between some very, very serious and well-established customers. Innovation in this sector is going to lead the way. And then if you look at the way that we typically interface with IDEX, I mean, we're really good at scaling with customers. So, we're hearing a lot of things now around, can you get the prototypes done sooner? Because if we do that, then that gives you the scalable production right behind it. And so I think that's as healthy as I've seen it. And in many ways to the extent that people are grappling with their own dimensions of trying to normalize cost and potentially might not have as many resources. That actually in well for the kind of work that we do as well, because we've got now a full suite of integrated capabilities. So, I think that side of it actually is our most healthy barometer about long-term, success here for both us and the sector. Competitive dynamics, there's not a ton of names in this world, I think we've good understanding of where we stack up and how we're positioned in our share. So I feel very good about, we've maintained if not enhanced our position with all the major players. And then, we continue to follow how they're doing as they battle it out side-by-side. And I always feel very good about the number of bets that we have with virtually all of them. Good morning, Mike. Yeah. I'll kind of hit it from a revenue and demand side and let Abhi sort of square up how it financially tracks alongside of it. But, yeah, I think if you move from left to right, kind of start at the midpoint of last year. Again, we saw a back half that was pretty stable for us. Slight reductions in final reductions in backlog, but really ended the year with a normalized position. And I'll remind people that for IDEX what that means is, we turn things really, really fast, it gives us about a half a quarter of visibility when we stand here, here on January 1 looking at it. So we're kind of back to equilibrium in that perspective. And then, we started to see this sort of broader support emerging out of the snow, if you will in the end of Q4 and continuing through January. January was a nice start for us in all three segments. And so then as you project forward, you're right, Mike, we actually have a -- it's a little bit of a seasonal uptick for us, that's fairly typical from Q1 to Q2. We've not been able to see it the last couple of years because of some different dynamics that have been out there that's simply weather-related and hits businesses like water and a few others. And so we have a natural uptick there. Some of these early bookings and some of the support that we've seen just given our lead times and customer expectations kind of dials in around Q2 as well. So there's a little bit of an additive bounce there and explains a bit of a difference between Q1 and Q2. We have a series of growth bets that of course we have positioned across all verticals. I offered a few highlights in the opening comments. Those are known programs, known platforms we're engaged on those now and we feel more assured about when they're going to start along the way. And then we have things like, a slight recovery in the semiconductor markets kind of modeled more back-half than the first. So, I think it's normal IDEX, certainly a normal entry position as we look at the year some normal seasonality, normal run-out of growth bets that we have that accelerate through the year. Made a little bit more exaggerated, I think by, certainly a conservative call on the first quarter, given that we just landed here. We just landed here, we're seeing some things come together and we just kind of have a -- there is a little bit of an air pocket here just based on lead times as to where those things land and how quickly we can get at them. Yeah. No, it continues to be an area of tremendous focus I think irrespective of what the backdrop is. We've driven the increases in potential there with funnel build and cultivation and conversations and analysis and other things that really are at the highest level we've ever had in the company. I do think though that as maybe the year feel some of the same, fundamental support that we're talking about here, I could imagine that that might help availability of targets and people might start to think about monetizing them and moving and maybe they lift the market around us as well. So it's still largely being driven by our efforts, but I think a good environment and we feel very, very positive about what we're going to be able to do there. Thank you. Hi, Deane. Yeah. From an inventory reduction perspective, I mean, again, this is a big industry with a lot of end markets, we have different platforms, different programs and all of them. So, I mean we really get it down to customer-by-customer, factory-by-factory and inventory position between us and them in every single case. So we've known for a while that, we're in pretty lockstep at that level. Then it comes down to individual demand swings and to be fair, there'll be some and maybe in line with what you're talking about there is some pockets of end-customer inventory that might still be out there and in the way of recovery and pieces of what we have. But in other places, I think we're comfortable that the mix is going to work over and kind of hold the flat narrative that we have here and the flat projections that we have internally. Absolutely I've heard some of the same commentary around the back half. I don't have information to refute any of that and I'd be quite happy if it were to come about that way. But I think just from an internal planning and forecasting perspective. Being conservative in this way, making sure our costs are in control, we've got everything ready to go from a materials, resourcing perspective. We've built some muscle here to be more dynamic than ever before. I think presents us in lines us up in a way, should that then start to happen in the second half. So, I certainly take the point, I think, if you could see it at our level, you'd see kind of technology and major platform and customers sort of arrayed on a grid that is the way that our teams think about it as they just move across quarter-to-quarter. Yeah. I mean, I haven't heard that raised as an internal concern or issue. I'm thinking, a lot of the business we do, let's say in Analytical Instrumentation I mean it's a bit more of a mature space, mature industry maybe not as likely in the short-term, dimension to be obsoleted by major steps in technology, but I can add it there. That hasn't been something that we've talked a lot about. Yeah. That's one of the healthiest indicators that we have here. Just for everybody on the call, again, these are the shortest cycle more sort of widely dispersed businesses that we have with the most fragmented customer sets. And so when they move they tend to indicate, where the world is going either way. When they move together they strongly indicate where the world is going and, we saw them move together, back at the original zones of recalibration here as they move down. And in Q4 and certainly continuing here in January, they are all moving together towards the positive. These are modest rates, but a simple green arrow next to all of those names across IDEX, is meaningful and supports a lot of the confidence that we have. Yeah. I'll take a shot at that and of course, it always go through a bit of an IDEX filters. So we're a couple of derivatives away from what you might notice is a headline. So think of this as almost any technology that's involved in, kind of the transition from traditional energy to alternate sources and emerging sustainable sources. And we see that in places like battery manufacturing. We don't make the batteries but we do a lot of the work around material handling because it's pretty nasty caustic material. And so we've seen really, really nice velocity there and continuing into '24 on things supporting kind of all the work that goes on for switch-over to battery tech. Even some of the businesses that we have in FMT that have a little bit of mining exposure have been strong for a while, they continue strong and of course, it's tied to the mineral extraction that goes with that. One of our recent acquisitions on the Airtech side and that business ever since it came and was a part of IDEX, one of its strongest catalyst has been alternative energy solutions where we do some of the thermal management that happens inside. So it's, again, we're kind of in the box, with our high-tech components and we're doing very, very critical jobs and we're doing them a little far away from the headlines, but you can absolutely see the lines coming right back into that industry. You asked about geographic spread. I wouldn't say there's I mean, we have projects in Europe. Some of them ultimately land in Asia. So it's pretty uniform across the globe. But again, we're hitting it in these niche verticals and niche applications. But I think coming back to, kind of how we manage it and maybe then applying some hindsight in whether or not we would have done a different. I mean, I would put the same for all IDEX businesses, that the places where we've the most careful are areas of domain expertise, technical know-how and, customer relationships. We're really, really careful with those. Because look at these programs and the lifecycle in these risk-averse areas they only change and come around so often even when it's in a market as dynamic as this one. And so if you're not staffed and ready to go. And I use my comments earlier here about, this might seem like a counter-intuitive part of the cycle where business is down, we're wondering when it's going to recover, and yet the innovation moves are actually really active. And again maybe counter intuitively because customers are struggling with some maybe potentially their own resource allocation abilities. That actually dials in quite favorably to our ability to help solve problems with our people. And so think of that is like a very solid core that's sort of under-glass and we're very, very careful about going near it. Labor obviously labor markets have eased up a bit. Frankly, it's easier to flex them and so some of what Abhi is talking about under the year we've made those moves. We've taken variable resources out that can be brought back in we think quite easily should we need to go up, but that technical core kind of remains. The other thing that we leverage really, really well at IDEX and I think do it quite intuitively as frankly when we look at our leaders. All of our leaders are kind of ready when they need comes to be able to go do more, because they're really-- we have a flat organizational structure and we're close to the point of impact anyways. And so, avoidance is actually a big thing, cost avoidance and holding back additions. We are actually able to flex that muscle a lot more than most companies. And so when, environments are here and we're starting to see the early signs we can sort of be really careful and hold back because we've got the deployment plans that allows very smart people to get close to the action and step in. So, I think it's those two things working around frankly a labor environment that's healthier for some of that flexing that you just would want to do. All of which says that in the early days of demand run up back to Abhi's points on margin expansion, we always perform very well as we're coming out of a period like this for all of these reasons. The leverage is kind of its highest point. Yeah. I mean, you kind of see that large project work and large capital in primarily in our water business to some degree you see it, of course, that's municipal capital, be it in energy, a little bit in pharma. So I mean, in those zones, I would say it's early days and modest, but it is positive. So these would be small expansion opportunities or projects that they've been talking about for a while that they want to now start to get moving. I don't know that in many of them I would say you're at the, kind of mega project level or we're ready to go, or it's been sanctioned, but to be fair, that's the usual step-up when things get more positive. So we are hearing some good indications, from a variety of different markets, about more intentional capital deployment. Not yet at the levels of kind of full-cycle supporting multi-quarter or even year in duration, but good early signs that it's actually quite different than what we saw in a lot of 2023. Yeah. Well, I appreciate the question and that's absolutely where we're heading. And so think of this as two levers primarily that we're moving. One is just the nature of the portfolio of IDEX. So, we've been more aggressive towards capital deployment. Everything we're bringing into IDEX today is inherently in faster-growing markets than, let's say, more of the industrial core that we see, most notably in FMT. So, the comparative basis that's tuning. We haven't done a lot of pruning on the other side, it's fairly modest. But to the extent we're doing it, that's actually moving that portfolio average up as well. And then, if with reasonable market support sort of absent massive swings of either way, as you suggested, I think we've long been targeting 200 basis points to 300 basis points of outperformance and everything we're working on today is moving that towards the upper bound of that run-out. So if you think of a world that let's say would start to dial itself in more from a fundamental perspective towards something in the 2% to 3% range and sort of natural entitlement. And maybe that's lifting from there because of the work that we're doing, as I mentioned, and then out performance above it, it has us, moving into a space where we're targeting mid-single-digit growth for IDEX. On an organic basis. With then obviously some, fundamental capital deployment on top of it, which would then extend the overall organic rate of the company. It's absolutely the area of focus, has been for a while and we're really, we're excited about potentially taking out some of the forces that have been swinging up-and-down and sideways making that hard to see. And, I would say, here, I think this is a point of absolute point of competitive advantage for us, where price capture, we've always been in the price capture game. And we've done that because of our positioning and our innovation with great customers. Period. So, yes, we've come through a phase here where kind of everybody got price, because you had to. But, I think as the world normalizes here as Abhi says we'll probably land a little north of where we've been, as long as the underlying, core inflation stays a little harder too. So we'll maintain the spread that you'd expect. But I'm really proud and I think we will be noticed to be noticeably differentiated because of this core capability that we have to differentiate in sticky markets with risk-averse customers that reward us when we do our job well. I mean, we don't have a lot of direct business there, we're kind of following customers. So it's closer-- a better ratio would be what percentage of their business is in China, which is-- I mean it's a fraction. It's less than 20% plus or minus depending on the sector that we're involved with. But again that's-- it's kind of an indirect vectoring for us there. We don't have a lot of feet on the ground there in a direct way. I mean, that's out there to some extent, it's probably most directly linked to spaces like water within it. But that's a small part of the overall segment. It's an indirect relationship for us. So to the extent that is one of the elements that's out there as a backstop, providing some confidence. Yes, it of course correlates. I would say more generally, for me this is it's just a healthier view from a number of folks that think it's time to be confident, lean into their markets, stop reaping inventory out of the system and kind of get to work. Again, just to make sure everybody can 3D think this through. So they're building a lot of roads out there. I'll use that as an example, or if they're starting to fix them with abandon. We've got a lot of pumps and things that are involved in pumping liquid asphalt. So that's kind of a nature of some of these relationships. So you can line up both government-intensive work that's supported that way as well as just general industrial are people feeling confident about the work that they're doing in their factories. Either one and taken together drive this dynamic. Yeah. And then just a reminder that, again, about half the segment is pretty industrial in nature, so it kind of mirrors a lot of the other comments that we've had many of them around FMT businesses, but you get about half of that, driving and supporting HST as well. Okay. Well, thanks everyone on the call for your questions and the interest in IDEX. Abhi, thanks for joining and coming to your first earnings call with me. Just a few things here. I mean, number one, we realize from the outside, IDEX is a complex and diversified company. And it hasn't helped that we've had a lot of, swings in some of the larger markets of the company, both up-and-down over the last couple of years. So, we've done our best to work through that with you and help you understand where we are. I think right now that we're actually in a place where things are a lot clearer than they've been in a while. Certainly, one of our key messages here is we've hit a uniform market stability, we hit that last fall and we really enjoyed Q4 and being having a chance to take a breath and get lined up here for the beginnings of what we think will be a great cycle. The vast majority of our end markets are starting to see a return to growth, as we said and I think that point around the shorter cycle business is starting to move together. That has always been a very reliable proxy for us in the company. Early days, but we've seen that, we've now seen it reinforced in January. And I remind people that as we've tuned IDEX and tuned it to the kind of companies that we brought in that are faster-growing closer to really, really strong OEMs, it drives a series of bets and initiatives across the company where the unit measure is a little bit larger. We're working to execute that and laying that on a foundation as we go. The fundamental piece of the story here is, we have confidence in accelerating through the year. The Life Sciences and Analytical Instrumentation world, it is uncertain for 2024. But I do want to come back and just echo some comments I've made before about just our commitment to that space and are confident in the long-term fundamental performance that we're all going to enjoy there and our positioning is fantastic. We see that evidenced by the innovation that we're being asked to do. And finally, we put a lot of capital to work over the last three years with real intentionality in some pretty choppy seas. And so if things are going to calm down and we'll get some more winds at our back, I'm really, really confident we'll be able to push that further, and continue to do that work and continue to transform the company. So thanks again for joining. Have a great day."

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Allison Lausas. Thank you. You may begin.\nAllison Lausas: Good morning, everyone. This is Allison Lausas, Interim Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the IDEX third quarter 2023 financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the 3 months ending September 30, 2023. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today's webcast, can be accessed on our company website at idexcorp.com. Joining me today is Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer and President. Today, we will begin with Eric providing an overview of the state of IDEX's business. I will then discuss IDEX's third quarter financial results, an update on segment performance in the markets they serve, and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay beginning approximately 2 hours after the call concludes, by dialing the toll-free number (877) 660-6853 and entering conference ID 13734464, or simply log on to our company homepage for the webcast replay. Before we begin, a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor language in last night's press release and in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I will now turn this call over to our CEO and President, Eric Ashleman.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Allison, and good morning, everyone. I have some important news on Slide 5. Before turning to our results and outlook, I'd like to introduce Allison Lausas, who is serving as our interim CFO. Allison has been with us for over 2 years, serving as our Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. She also leads our Investor Relations and financial planning and analysis functions. During her tenure at IDEX, Allison has done an outstanding job, serving as a strong partner to our former CFO, Bill Grogan, and myself. Thank you, Allison, for all you're doing in your expanded interim role. And I'd also like to thank Bill for his many years of service at IDEX. Also, as you saw in our release yesterday, we are pleased to announce that Abhi Khandelwal is joining IDEX in November as our next CFO. Abhi joins us from Multi-Color Corporation, a global packaging services and label solutions provider, where he served as CFO. Prior to that, he served as Senior Vice President and CFO of CIRCOR International. He previously worked at IDEX for over 10 years, serving as my financial partner during most of my term as COO. We're thrilled to have him back with us, and I consider us very fortunate to have leaders like Abhi and Allison at the top of our finance organization. With that, I'll turn to our Q3 performance. I'm on Slide 7. IDEX delivered strong results in the third quarter, delivering robust profitability in an environment where volumes are stabilizing at lower levels. We also generated excellent cash flows as we continue to execute on our cost containment and inventory reduction plans. I'd like to thank our IDEX teams around the globe for their contributions in driving these outstanding results. This was very solid execution in a difficult environment. Recall that we expected our industrial and municipal markets within FMT and FSDP to reach the end of an elongated and moderate destocking cycle within the third quarter. That played out as expected. Our analytical instrumentation, life sciences, pharma and semicon markets within HST largely held at equilibrium in Q3 and bounced along the bottom after an unprecedented rapid destocking cycle in the first half of the year. Taken together, this moves IDEX into a very natural position, where lead times, backlogs and next quarter visibility, all aligned with typical pre-pandemic profiles. Looking forward, we continue to see divergence between end market prospects. There are discrete attractive opportunities within each of our segments, many of which are tied to transformational catalysts within environmental sustainability or critical infrastructure. Examples include water analytics, space broadband and battery production. These sit within a broader framework of uncertainty driven by macro concerns that include higher interest rates and expanding geopolitical risk. More specifically, demand rebounds for our most pressured HST businesses appear to have moved out a bit into 2024. We continue to believe that organizational agility, speed of decision-making, outstanding business quality and a strong culture serve us well to navigate the twists and turns ahead. We can both dynamically assign capital and resources to our best near-term opportunities, while we stay focused on our long-term strategy of profitable growth outperformance. In terms of capital deployment, M&A continues to be a top focus. Within our funnel builds, we are aggressively following complementary threads between our most growth advantaged businesses and technologies as we seek to build our breakthrough competitive advantage. We did this recently with our Nexsight acquisition, expanding our reach within water analytics through enhanced hardware and software capabilities. Our Iridian acquisition earlier this year boosted integrated capabilities within thin-film optics. Our inorganic pipeline is robust and of high quality, allowing us to engage in M&A with discipline and strong strategic intent. And our balance sheet has ample capacity to continue to execute on our best opportunities. Finally, we divested our Micropump business during the quarter and repaid $150 million on our term note facility. As we continue to focus on long-term growth, occasional portfolio realignment will occur. We expect this transfer of ownership will better position Micropump as it joins a collection of like-minded businesses, focused on similar technologies and customers. I would like to express my appreciation for all the Micropump team has done since joining IDEX in 1995. With that, I'll turn it over to Allison to discuss our financial results.\nAllison Lausas: Thanks, Eric. Moving on to our third quarter consolidated financial results on Slide 9. All comparisons are against the third quarter of 2022, unless otherwise stated. Orders of $712 million were down 9% overall and down 11% organically. We experienced an organic decrease within our HST and FMT segment and organic growth in FSD. Sales of $793 million were down 4% overall and down 6% organically. We experienced a 15% organic decrease in HST and a 1% decrease in FMT. FSD revenues grew organically by 3%. Gross margin of 44.1% decreased by 220 basis points compared with last year. Adjusted gross margin decreased 90 basis points, primarily due to lower volume leverage and unfavorable mix, which was partially offset by strong operational productivity and price costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.4%, down 30 basis points. I will discuss the drivers of adjusted EBITDA on the next slide. On a GAAP basis, our Q3 effective tax rate of 20.2% was lower than our effective rate in the third quarter of 2022 of 21.8%. The rate was driven down by both the finalization of research expenditure capitalization treatment that served to increase tax benefits on foreign source income and a tax election related to the Muon acquisition that reduced our minimum tax on foreign earnings. These favorable rate items were partly offset by tax recorded on the gain from the Micropump divestiture and are not expected to have a significant impact on our fourth quarter rate. Net income was $209 million, which resulted in GAAP EPS of $2.75. Adjusted net income was $161 million, with adjusted EPS of $2.12, which is down $0.02 or 1%. The lower tax rate contributed $0.11 of adjusted EPS favorability in the current quarter compared to both the prior year and the midpoint of our third quarter guidance. Finally, cash from operations of $227 million was up 14%, primarily due to lower working capital, driven by inventory reductions. Free cash flow for the quarter was $207 million, up 14% versus last year and achieved a conversion rate of 129% of adjusted net income. We drove over $25 million of inventory out of the business in the third quarter through our targeted reduction efforts, and we saw inventory turns remain consistent with last quarter due to lower sales. Moving on to Slide 10, which details the drivers of our third quarter adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $6 million compared to the third quarter 2022. Our 6% organic sales reduction unfavorably impacted adjusted EBITDA by $37 million flowing through at our prior year adjusted gross margin rate. Price cost was accretive to margins, and we drove operational productivity that offset employee-related inflation. Mix was unfavorable by $6 million, mainly centered in HST, due to continued volume declines in our analytical instrumentation, life science and semiconductor components. Resource and discretionary spending was favorable versus last year, as we continue to execute on our cost containment plan given the top line pressure we are experiencing. Reductions in variable compensation expense contributed $8 million of benefit in the quarter. These results yielded a negative 31% organic flow-through. Overall, our team's focus on cost containment and resource reallocation has effectively managed our revenue decline, ensuring continuity of our most valuable resources has IDEX well positioned to recover and grow back stronger than before when market dynamics turn favorable. Muon and Iridian acquisitions, net of Knight and Micropump divestitures and FX contributed an additional $9 million of adjusted EBITDA. With that, I'll provide a deeper look at our segment performance. I'm on Page 11. In our Fluid & Metering technology segment, orders decreased by 5% organically, mainly due to an expected slowdown in our industrial businesses and continued customer destocking in our agriculture business. Sales decreased by 1% organically, driven by this destocking impact, partly offset by favorable energy, chemical and water performance. We began to see our industrial order day rates decline in the second quarter of this year, and they remain steady at that level throughout the third quarter. Although our customers continue to exercise caution, due to recession concerns and lower energy prices, we see tailwinds tied to domestic infrastructure initiatives and within mining. Within agriculture, we continue to experience the impact of distribution destocking, exacerbated by declining net farm incoming crop prices. Our delivery continues to outperform our competitors, and we are focused on targeted share gain to offset this pressure. Additionally, the acquisition of KZValve and the adoption of its automated actuation technology is delivering strong results. On the energy side, we continue to execute well, driving down backlogs and lead times. Underlying market demand remains steady, but we expect to see revenue declines versus third quarter as our backlog position normalizes. In the chemical market, we continue to see positive results across the U.S., Europe and Asia, with pharma and battery applications providing opportunities for growth. Our water business continues to exhibit growth. Our opportunity funnels are increasing, and we see no signs of municipal project funding delays as we approach 2024. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 50 basis points compared to last year, primarily due to strong price cost and favorable operational productivity more than offsetting lower volume leverage. Moving to the HST segment. We experienced a 24% organic orders decrease and a 15% organic sales decrease, mainly due to pressure across the life sciences, analytical instrumentation and semiconductor markets as well as industrial market performance similar to that within FMT. Adjusted EBITDA margins contracted by 410 basis points, primarily due to lower volume leverage and unfavorable mix, partially offset by strong price cost and favorable operational productivity. Our analytical instrumentation business continues to experience customers destocking, which remains driven by China softness, lower pharma-biopharma spending and overall caution around the global economy. We expect that performance will remain stable at this level in the fourth quarter, with improvement in 2024. We see a similar trend within our life science business. Semiconductor continues to experience softness with the expectation that the market has reached a bottom in the third quarter. We anticipate a broader market will begin to recover at some point in 2024. We continue to see positive results stemming from our space, broadband laser communication initiatives, which are bolstered by Iridian's technological capabilities. Our material processing technology business continues to experience softness across pharma markets but are seeing some early signs of improvement within biopharma, food and nutrition as well as tailwinds connected to leveraging our technology and battery production application. Industrial markets and HST slowed in the quarter, in line with FMT's results. Finally, turning to our Fire & Safety Diversified Products segment. Organic orders grew by 2% versus third quarter last year and organic sales grew 3%, with strong fire and safety results more than offsetting destocking at BAND-IT. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 150 basis points, primarily due to strong price cost and favorable operational productivity, partially offset by unfavorable mix and lower volume leverage. The paint market remains mixed. The uncertain global macro environment is driving consumer confidence lower, while at the same time, the construction market in North America remains strong. Within our fire business, we do not see any significant changes to North America fire OEM production capacity. We continue to win through value-add integrated systems and technology and standardized offerings that enable higher OEM throughput. Our Europe and Asia businesses remain steady. Rescue performance remains steady as well, although we are seeing some signs of North American budget delays and inventory reduction due to high borrowing costs. BAND-IT continues to outperform a relatively flat U.S. auto market due to having content on high-priority vehicles. There is some pressure on the energy side, driven by lower oil prices, and we experienced some destocking within aviation. With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. I'm on Slide 12. In Q4, we are projecting GAAP EPS to range from $1.50 to $1.55 and adjusted EPS to range from $1.74 to $1.79. Organic revenue is expected to decline 8% to 9% and adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be about 26%. We expect that our HST revenues will be slightly unfavorable versus our previous guide, offset by FMT volumes landing better than expected. Equally, our strong execution in the third quarter allowed us to work through our backlog faster than expected. This is driving an equal and offsetting $0.05 of impact to third quarter results and fourth quarter expectations. Turning to the full year 2023. We are maintaining our full year organic revenue guidance of down 1% to 2%. At the midpoint, we have raised our EPS guidance by $0.20, with approximately $0.11 driven by lower third quarter effective tax rate and the remainder coming from third quarter operational outperformance, partly offset by $0.05 of revenue timing due to accelerated backlog burn in the third quarter. In summary, we estimate full year organic revenue contraction of 1% to 2% to yield GAAP EPS of $7.91 to $7.96 and adjusted EPS of $8.13 to $8.18. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 27.5%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be about $80 million, and free cash flow is expected to be 100-plus percent of adjusted net income. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: First, start with congratulations on the CFO news. We've heard from a couple of former IDEX executives who are seeing obvious praises. So that's fabulous you got him to rejoin. And then can I add my thanks to Allison for all her help in her role as interim CFO.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks for both comments.\nAllison Lausas: Thank you.\nDeane Dray: So maybe, Eric, for some big picture questions, macro. You're great at kind of synthesizing all the different inputs here and having knows that macro is giving us a lot of mixed signals. But maybe just click through like the day rates, that started to slow in the second quarter. What's your take on that? Lead times and anything from your leading businesses, like BAND-IT and Warren Rupp, that suggests how things are going to play out over the near term?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. Well, I mean, we often refer to those as the kind of canaries in our coal mine. And we discretely track about five of those businesses and keep an eye on weekly order rates and do it at the sort of small order flow day-to-day stuff level. We parse out projects. What we can see in there is, frankly, between the second and the third quarter, they're almost dead on flat. So the kind of moderate destocking cycle that we predicted at the beginning of the year, I think, largely played out through the first half of the year and frankly, moderated. Even quarter to -- month-to-month within the quarter, we didn't see a lot of changes there. So what that says is kind of our distributors because there's a lot in that world. Our end users, all of us were kind of back to the right inventory position based on our quick replenishment, our fast lead times. And now I think it goes into the question of sort of an uncertain environment, when does it start to flex upward? Those would be the businesses. Of course, we would watch to see early indications of that. So for right now, it's flattened out. It's holding. There's decent activity out there. There's certainly opportunities here and there, but not signaling any further trouble and waiting to see if it brings forth some more encouraging signs.\nDeane Dray: And then the second question is in HST in the Analytical Instruments Life Sciences, and I'll preface this with -- no one has gotten this right so far. Just the -- whether it's the Thermo and Danaher and that whole group, it's been pretty fluid. And so I wanted to just see your degree of confidence that we're bottoming here because there's some suggestion that it's not just destocking, but there might be some end market demand here in this equipment, the analytical instrument side, some demand falling off. So it seems to have gotten worse in October. So just your degree of confidence, how does this calibrate the first half of '24 for this business for you?\nEric Ashleman: I want to take a little time here because I think I got to set our context in relation to those comments in the environment you described. First of all, as I said in the prepared remarks, I mean, we're talking about four buckets of business primarily that kind of fall into this category. Analytical instruments, life science, of course, that's the larger piece of it. Pharma exposure as well as semicon, that's about half of HST, and that's the piece that we're describing when we walk through this. Then I want to back up and say, if you think about time line, you actually have to go back, we're almost a year into this, for us. Because of the short clinical nature, we actually saw some of this noise in Q4 of last year. And as you said, we and others, I think, have to get our heads around the fact that it's actually been a series of additive components that's played out here over the course of that year. Initially, thought it was just simply aggressive demand turning to something more moderate. Of course, we felt that in our businesses in Q4. Then, it was a reexamination of inventory positions and just frankly, seeing way too much of it at many points. And of course, that destocking played out. I think here in the second and third quarter, it's been kind of a second or third inning, if you will, of some concerns about some macro forces, probably the most significant being China's contribution or lack thereof as we -- going forward relative to what it has been in earlier periods. So there's kind of three things that played out. What I think that's done for us is, of course, we felt that pretty aggressively in the earlier piece. So there's a lot of businesses because of the component nature of the products we make. And here more moderately in the last quarter, and I can see that our backlog position, our visibility within the quarter, our kind of inventory position in factories where we supply, that's an equilibrium. So I don't see any more external forces or things that would come in there simply trying to unwind the past. That does mean, frankly, that we're kind of open to the recovery loop that's ahead of us and the uncertainty of when it will occur and how it might play out. And again, Deane, I back up a little bit and say, we're hitting that from four different levels. So while there could be some things that fall off in other places as people kind of think about demand and where they may go, maybe some of those are in the life science arenas, that we're going to have some other things that are going to potentially be working against that, that may wash that out in the interim. So equilibrium is a little bit more of a variable term for us. But I think those abnormal shocks to the system that we saw play out over the last year or so. We're essentially seeing that those are behind us. And now, like everybody else, we can lean forward, go and kind of poke the customer level and take a look at what people are doing in innovation streams and start to plan our course from here.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird.\nMike Halloran: So I want to follow up to both those questions Deane asked. So just to make sure I'm clear on what you're saying on the life science analytical instrumentation side. You're not necessarily saying that you're expecting the end market to recover from here in some sort of linear fashion or anything like that? You're just saying sell-in is at the point where it's matching with sell-out? Or am I misinterpreting that?\nEric Ashleman: No, I think that's good. You probably summarized it a little better than I did, but I was trying to make sure people can understand that context for us. Again, we're -- what's really important to recognize here, we're inside the life science instrument at the component level or inside the lithography instruments. So these are critical items, very fast replenishment. And so yes, I was describing us kind of unwinding a series of unnatural patterns, but we are now in sync. And we're in sync and essentially open to the same variability that, that end market is at this point.\nMike Halloran: Exactly. And so as you get into next year, that's where the variability hits, but at least the comps are easy starting from, call it, mid-4Q onward type range?\nEric Ashleman: Well, yes, certainly, as the year progresses, the comps get increasingly easier.\nMike Halloran: Got it. And then you talked about the short cycle side of things. From a destock perspective, that makes a lot of sense. Maybe higher level, how are you thinking about the economically sensitive parts of your business as we head into '24? The risk profile, as you're seeing in, doesn't sound like the day rates are saying that there's much worsening going on, but maybe some of that's being clouded by the destock piece. So just some help as we think on a full [indiscernible].\nEric Ashleman: Yes. I mean, it is interesting. I think the industrial system is still performing at a pretty high level. I mean the day rates that we're talking about here, that flatness that I described in those canary levels, that's a pretty healthy business that suggests people are working, factories are producing things and putting it to work. Certainly around it, though, discussions around longer-term commitments or things that are going to happen in the spring of next year, I mean, they're just -- they're harder conversations to have because of all the uncertainty that people are feeling, pick anything from the higher interest rate position on the increasing geopolitical risk that's out there, consequences of a major election in the U.S. next year, right? You can see to see a lot of people on the one side continuing to kind of forecast on the things that are happening day to day, but kind of backing up with a wait-and-see approach at a higher level just because of uncertainties for anything that sort of passed the horizon.\nMike Halloran: Yes, makes sense. One quick follow-up, a clarification for Allison. Did you say that $0.05 shifted from 4Q into 3Q? I just want to clarify what that statement was, Allison.\nAllison Lausas: That's correct, Mike. So we can find more aggressive backlog pull down in third quarter. So it's just a shift of timing within the back half of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel.\nNathan Jones: I guess I'll ask a question about the order rates here. The order rates in FMT, the actual dollars aboard is a bit lower in 3Q than in 2Q and orders in HST in 3Q a bit lower than 2Q. Is it possible for you to kind of separate out what you think is a decline in customer backlogs versus what actual decline in end market demand? And I guess what I'm trying to get at here is, if you're talking about inventory correction having happened and we moved to selling more towards sell-through, wouldn't that imply then that you should see sequential improvement in the actual dollars of orders in both of those businesses as we move into the fourth quarter?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. But well, look, again, I put a lot of weight on the predictive abilities of those early indicator businesses that we have to talk a lot about sort of day-to-day, how the system is operating. So I think that -- again, that stability means a lot. In this environment, order patterns do change a little bit. Remember, an earlier comment I had there for Mike, I mean I think you're seeing people moving to shorter increments of order patterns. They know now companies like -- I mean, certainly, IDEX, we can deliver with faster replenishment. Our customer satisfaction metrics are really good. So if you feel any uncertainty, you don't have to give us nearly the same kind of visibility in your order requirements that you had to 2 quarters ago or a year ago. So I think you do see a piece of that, that changes in the order profiling, more of a order it as you go. And so -- again, we ate into some pretty aggressive backlog along the way. At any time lead times keep coming down, I mean that does tend to influence order patterns for folks on the other side. So I think it's things like that playing out, by and large, around a pretty stable base, especially on the industrial side. To me, says, I think this is a stable environment, but one that's looking for the next catalyst.\nNathan Jones: I guess my follow-up question, I know you guys don't do a lot of large projects, but you have stuff that goes into larger projects. And I think investors have been concerned that rising interest rates business in inflation, are changing the dynamics, changing the ROI for customers on those investments. Can you talk about what you're seeing on customers' willingness to let out these larger capital projects? I know historically, you've seen people hesitate in these kinds of environments. So just any color you can give us on what you're seeing there.\nEric Ashleman: Yes. Well, that's probably a piece of the answer to your last question as well. I mean the certainty around projects like that is not very good. And you've got some people that are -- they're still talking about them, but they start to move that time horizon. We're getting closer to 2024 like a magnet. And so it becomes a reference point and a point in the calendar where people are pointing to when things might come to fruition in that side of it. Again, contextually for us, that's not all of our businesses, but we'll see it as part of a planned expansion commitment or something like that for food or something related to infrastructure. So those kind of discrete things that require a lot of capital will come together, a lot of planning. I think there is a lot more uncertainty around them. And it's -- instead, it's kind of running the current system faster and a little bit longer before you rebuild it due to that same level of uncertainty.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak: So Eric, I just want to go back to HST. One of the things IDEX has been known for is investing through the cycle. Could you maybe talk to the new product development cycle in analytical instrumentation, life sciences? Or maybe even how you're thinking about that investment? Has that slowed at all? Should we expect maybe a slower organic coming out of this? Just any thoughts there.\nEric Ashleman: Well, I'm actually glad you mentioned that because, in many ways, at ground level in those businesses, you kind of see two realities sitting side by side, and they're actually quite different. One is the near-term reactive reality of what's happened over here in the last year, where order levels are and what daily requirements are, lots of cost containment and being super crisp around productivity and just getting the product out. But even at the customer level, I mean, I think you see that entire world is spending a lot of time thinking through, okay, what do we need to do to innovate to get ahead of the game in the next cycle? Because I can't find anybody that doesn't see that there's going to be something more positive coming here. The same mega trends that have been driving that sector forever are not very far out ahead of us and will occur again. But when they do, we're seeing at the customer level and within our business is a real step-up in terms of innovative steps to get after it. I was talking to Terra Teresa, who runs our businesses there, and she's describing some of the projects that we're working on in conjunction with really significant customers. And it's some of the highest degrees of innovation jumps that I've frankly, seen in the last few years. So I think there's actually a very purposeful, collaborative arrangement here to talk about where this industry is going to go. And as it comes out, this is one of the reasons I think we try to stay as fast nimble as we can, so we can put capital and resources to those best opportunities and, frankly, overfeed them in times like this. So you've actually called it exactly how we see it at a ground level.\nAllison Poliniak: That's great. That's good color. And then a small divestiture, as you think of the portfolio today, obviously, a very unusual cycle here. Was this sort of just a one-off? Or is this something that you think we might see more of as we go forward here? Just any thoughts.\nEric Ashleman: Well, I think it was -- it's a nice little business. I think as we looked at it, we just don't have a lot of technology that's similar. We didn't see necessarily an ability to scale it. And larger-scale versions of it tend to be in markets that are not as attractive for us. So I do think that level of thinking is something that we do constantly, and you could see it play out that way from time to time. But I wouldn't view it just as this one as a massive transformational shift in portfolio for IDEX. But as we increasingly think about -- look, what we're trying to do here is drive growth outperformance, a little tighter integrated ability between the pieces of IDEX. I referenced that in the opening comments. Things that kind of stand-alone that don't have that ability to scale, we're going to take a look at, assess that carefully. And then it seems like the right decision is a potential different element, then we'll continue to make those choices. But I wouldn't sum it up to something more aggressive than that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vlad Bystricky with Citigroup.\nVlad Bystricky: So maybe just one more on HST. I know you previously talked about an expectation for semicon markets to stabilize during 3Q with recovery, I think, beginning in 4Q. I don't know if I missed it, but maybe you can give us more color on how semicon markets specifically are trending versus your prior expectations and your views on the likely trajectory of semicon-related demand going forward?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. Again, it's an important, but a small part of IDEX at less than 10%. But I think I think that one is pushed further into 2024. I mean it's stable here. We're certainly -- and we hit it from a variety of levels. We're in fabs. We're in metrology instruments. We're in memory. We're in sophisticated sides of it. And so we see it from a whole bunch of different spots, but I think all of it suggests the recovery of that sector is a little bit further out into 2024. We're certainly close to those customers. We're critical. They can't do much with our parts and components. So we'll get that intelligence, but I suspect the order ramp will start somewhere out into 2024.\nVlad Bystricky: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just shifting to FSDP. Again, on the orders that FSDP took a step down sequentially. So I guess just any color on, is there something seasonal there? Or just how you're thinking about FSDP orders evolving into 4Q and going forward?\nAllison Lausas: Sure, Vlad. No, I can take that. That's really the step down due to dispensing as that replenishment cycle did come to an end there. So you see that slowdown in the third quarter. You'll see it also a bit into fourth. But also in fourth quarter, we've got a bit of seasonality in Fire & Rescue, fewer production days.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.\nRob Wertheimer: I joined the conversation and the education on life sciences and HST has obviously been a bit more volatile than many expected. And I wonder if you could do almost like a 101, what normalization looks like? With the simpler question is, what drives customer purchasing? Is it your customers' volumes? Is it innovation cycles? Is it CapEx cycles and confidence cycles? Just how your products flow through that life cycle?\nEric Ashleman: No, I appreciate it, Rob. So look, this is -- first of all, it's a super direct business. So we're talking with a relatively concentrated customer set of leading OEMs. So it's quite different from many other parts of IDEX in that respect. Up until the pandemic and some of the forces that we've seen here in the last 3 or 4 years, it's not typically been a very cyclical kind of industry. It's generally stayed at the kind of mid- to high single digits depending on where we sort of jump in, with the exception of the semi portion, of course. In all cases, you can think of this as -- these are platform-centric businesses. So an innovation stream comes in, somebody is looking to move to the next level, and it's either their instrument, or their lithography machine, or their device, is moving up well ahead of that. Our engineers are in there on the design cycle and working on the spec points and you secure the spec. So essentially, it's a pretty classic platform business. Once you're in on a platform, you run the duration of it. And you're concurrently always working on different iterations of things in either early gestation or late. So it's very, very classically aligned that way. So you do have good visibility into plans for programs, plans for program launches the variable that you run into, of course, is the adoption, the runout of those devices, the take up, the inventory positions on them, all the things that we've talked about as we've kind of gone through the last year here.\nRob Wertheimer: Perfect. And if I -- I know there was a lot on that topic, but I appreciate it. And then if I can just go a little bit further field, just in the general acquisition market. You've seen cost of capital rising for private equity, perhaps faster than when you guys have pretty good cash flow are getting easier to win? Or any general characterization of that market? And I'll stop there.\nEric Ashleman: Yes. Well, I mean, certainly and for -- I mean we've tried here for the last 2 or 3 years to be very, very focused on, frankly, cultivating proprietary transactions. We're taking advantage a little bit of the environment where we're comfortable. We were planning components in niche environments. We often see things and interact with people that maybe are not as well-known in the outside world. So we depend on multiyear relationships and conversations to try to get ourselves to a position where frankly, there aren't a lot of competitors in line as we're looking at an asset. That's not always possible to the extent it isn't. I would agree that you've seen something quite different here with higher interest rates. There's obviously some levels because people that need a lot of debt financing can only get to and can't pass. That will allow a property to probably stay out and play longer with strategics like us and others that might be taking a look at it. So you could view that as quite positive. I would say on the other side, though, too, because of that environment, maybe here more recently, you see some others that are a little bit more reluctant to transact in that way because they want to wait for a recovery loop or better demand curves that would support higher valuations in terminal values. So I think it's probably a little bit of wash on that side. But in many ways, we've always considered this better for us if we're working it much more discretely a bit more in the weeds and ideally in a proprietary way.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with BNP.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Looking into your FMT segment, your margins were so strong really on declining organic sales. I'm wondering, kind of tied to a question asked on HST. How do you invest from here with -- your orders are moderating or declining into year-end. How do you tie that to your margins in the context of protecting them? Or if your outlook, it sounds like everything is as expected. So do you continue to invest here? Just kind of seeing where your head is at with where that market is going and what it means for margins?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. Well, a couple of things here. Well, first, I'm glad you noticed. I mean the FMT segment, in particular, I mean, has fantastic performance. Over the last couple of quarters, Q3 was really good. And what you're seeing there is, look, reasonable cost containment, we run them -- we're in those businesses pretty lean anyways. It's much easier to run them at a steady state than kind of the last few years have been. So that brings out our best. And frankly, our teams have recognized, they're doing their part from an IDEX side and really drive an outstanding performance. I would say from an investment profile, I mean these are businesses, some of which are 80, 90, 100 years old. They are really, really well positioned. They do very well in almost all versions of economic realities that are out there. So making sure that they stay innovative, well positioned with the right channel partners, out in the right places, that's something we're always thoughtful of. We -- typically, the investments when we talk about growth investments. They're generally people based. And they are often discrete additive things that we'll do to go at certain things like battery production to support mobility -- e-mobility economy or something like that. So we'll augment and make those investments, or not, depending on how we view kind of the staying in the outside world. But the base of the business, just the kind of core of the franchise, we are really, really careful of that to make sure that, that domain expertise that supports all that positioning, and differentiation and incredible margins is sound for any reality.\nAndrew Buscaglia: And so that mid -- kind of mid-30s EBITDA margin well into the low 30s operating margins, is really sustainable in your view, even if those order trends continue to go negative, and organic sales just -- yes, it weakens into 2024?\nEric Ashleman: I mean there's a couple of things to keep in mind there. At any point, and we've seen it a couple of times over the last few years, if that business gets kind of close to flat or negative, the deleveraging side of things is really tough because of the strong contribution margins and our commitment to kind of maintain the core. So depending where things go, we always have to be aware of that. We are also at probably the best point of the price cost cycle here now. That's -- the spread that we're at today is probably not going to continue out into the future. We've always been a company that gets price. Of course, it's been more aggressive here lately with inflation. We're now at a point where those prices are sticky. There's some moderation on the inputs. This is the best part of the cycle, and this is the best part of the company that gets that pricing. So there's a little bit of a piece on here. I'd be careful of is assuming it's perpetual state, it's the good part of this part of the cycle.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho.\nBrett Linzey: Just one more on HST. So encouraging to see the stabilization and certainly, the recovery path is going to take some time to play out and figure out. But just in terms of the profit recovery on the other side, should we think of the businesses yielding a stronger-than-average incremental margin as they do or when they do recover? Or do you need some cost to come back? Any way to dimension that?\nAllison Lausas: As we recover, they'll lever nicely. And so a longer-term expectation for the HST set of businesses is more in the EBITDA margins of 29%-plus.\nBrett Linzey: Okay. Great. And then just shifting over to the comments you made on water. It sounds like the opportunity funnel is increasing. You might be able to size that. And is it related to some of the fiscal stimulus or other independent factors driving that strength?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. Well, I mean, the water side of things has been steady throughout. I would say it's indirectly related, of course, to a lot of the focused efforts to invest in our infrastructure. Frankly, the state of our infrastructure has now gotten to the point where it's impossible to look away from as well. We've seen that on a major scale in major cities, certainly here in the U.S. I think those two things together are putting in -- I've always thought of it as a warm blanket, multiyear blanket. It's just -- it takes a long time to spend money in that sector. These projects are just -- they take a long time to engineer rollout and go out there. And so no matter how discrete the kind of pop on funding might be, it's always going to have a little bit of an elongated run out. So we sort of view that as a comfortable blanket for businesses like ours and others that are in this sector. We've seen that. It's held up again in this quarter as well. I mean to dimensionalize it, you can look at the size of water in IDEX, and it's -- again, it's a nice piece of the portfolio, and we would see that it would stay at the upper end of the growth profile.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen.\nJoe Giordano: I just want to clarify. A lot of the -- your customers and stuff in HST and the areas of weakness now have been kind of talking about October got worse. So I know that you were very clear that like the inventory situations and destocks have normalized, but what did your actual orders kind of look like in October relative to the rest of the quarter? Like do you think HST orders, should we be thinking up in dollars versus the third quarter and the fourth quarter? Does that make sense?\nEric Ashleman: Look, I'll let -- go ahead, Allison.\nAllison Lausas: Sure. No, I think, on a pure dollar basis, we should expect to see some higher orders in the fourth quarter. But there is some blanket activity also that happens as we wrap the year.\nJoe Giordano: Okay. So that maybe not necessarily a sign that things are improving, it's just kind of a seasonal order uptake?\nAllison Lausas: That's right. We'll need to be -- we'll need to keep close watch.\nJoe Giordano: At what point -- just extension of that, just given like the nature of that business and the fact that you're running kind of book-to-bill sub-1 there still. So like at what point, can you -- there's like an organic decline in HST kind of be like baked in for 2024? Like when do orders need to start to improve for that to be a positive number theoretically?\nEric Ashleman: Look, I think we'd have to monitor this pretty -- we obviously will through the balance of the fourth quarter. As always, everybody kind of does the same planning cycles at the same time. So that's the best opportunity for us to get in front of customers, talk about programs, things that they're launching, their confidence in them. I think we want to watch it quarter by quarter and stay super close to it. These are the most dynamic markets that we have in the whole place. I just -- I come back to kind of the comments I made. I think when Mike asked the question, he did such a good job summarizing it in the beginning. We're basically saying that we've taken all of the inventory-related noise out of this, and that's essentially the echo of the past. I will say, to the extent the industry heads in different directions here, we are in sync with it. We're a critical component supplier for folks that are making very sophisticated instruments and things for a variety of different markets and geographies. And we are somewhat dependent on -- we are completely dependent on their success, their call, the way that they're seeing that those markets are going to traverse. What we can do from our side is to provide, I think, a timely and relevant diagnostic. Mainly, because of the fact we're so short cycle. And we're going to feel and see those inflections sooner than almost anybody. And so with that in mind, we need to stay close to them. We'll understand all of those things. Again, it's four buckets of business for us, occasionally move at slightly different rates, and we can move resources around. So we'll see how it plays out as we go through '24.\nJoe Giordano: That's fair. And just last, with the accelerated kind of backlog burn that you had this quarter, are there targeted opportunities to do that again in the fourth quarter in parts of your business?\nEric Ashleman: We still have a couple of businesses that have longer backlogs. I mean they're still working through generally because lingering issues in supply chains and elsewhere. We spoke of one in energy, where we talked about is pretty strong in the third quarter. A lot of that was us getting some more of that backlog out related to some consolidation stuff that we've done about a year ago. It's not many of them, but we do have a couple of other pockets in here that we're trying to get back down to kind of all IDEX level.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric Ashleman for closing comments.\nEric Ashleman: Okay. Well, thanks for everybody for joining our call. And as I always do, I want to thank the members of the IDEX team that are on for really, really strong execution and performance in the quarter. I just -- a few comments here. I think there's certainly -- look, there's a lot of uncertainty out there in the environment. I think it's going to require a certain amount of patience. But as I think about IDEX and the things that we can control, here's what I know. I know our portfolio is in great shape. It's growing through M&A. It's well positioned, certainly to support long-term growth outperformance. I really think our flat and decentralized structure keeps us agile and nimble. We can move things around and resource things probably faster than anybody, and we do that each and every day. And our teams and leaders are outstanding and frankly, they're going to be outstanding plus one as Abhi joins us here in November. So with that, when things break, we'll be all set up here, I think, to really support a nice extended run for IDEX as the world starts to dial in, and respond to, frankly, the trends that we know are all coming. So with that, thanks for your support, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eric Ashleman",
            "content": "Thanks, Allison, and good morning, everyone. I have some important news on Slide 5. Before turning to our results and outlook, I'd like to introduce Allison Lausas, who is serving as our interim CFO. Allison has been with us for over 2 years, serving as our Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. She also leads our Investor Relations and financial planning and analysis functions. During her tenure at IDEX, Allison has done an outstanding job, serving as a strong partner to our former CFO, Bill Grogan, and myself. Thank you, Allison, for all you're doing in your expanded interim role. And I'd also like to thank Bill for his many years of service at IDEX. Also, as you saw in our release yesterday, we are pleased to announce that Abhi Khandelwal is joining IDEX in November as our next CFO. Abhi joins us from Multi-Color Corporation, a global packaging services and label solutions provider, where he served as CFO. Prior to that, he served as Senior Vice President and CFO of CIRCOR International. He previously worked at IDEX for over 10 years, serving as my financial partner during most of my term as COO. We're thrilled to have him back with us, and I consider us very fortunate to have leaders like Abhi and Allison at the top of our finance organization. With that, I'll turn to our Q3 performance. I'm on Slide 7. IDEX delivered strong results in the third quarter, delivering robust profitability in an environment where volumes are stabilizing at lower levels. We also generated excellent cash flows as we continue to execute on our cost containment and inventory reduction plans. I'd like to thank our IDEX teams around the globe for their contributions in driving these outstanding results. This was very solid execution in a difficult environment. Recall that we expected our industrial and municipal markets within FMT and FSDP to reach the end of an elongated and moderate destocking cycle within the third quarter. That played out as expected. Our analytical instrumentation, life sciences, pharma and semicon markets within HST largely held at equilibrium in Q3 and bounced along the bottom after an unprecedented rapid destocking cycle in the first half of the year. Taken together, this moves IDEX into a very natural position, where lead times, backlogs and next quarter visibility, all aligned with typical pre-pandemic profiles. Looking forward, we continue to see divergence between end market prospects. There are discrete attractive opportunities within each of our segments, many of which are tied to transformational catalysts within environmental sustainability or critical infrastructure. Examples include water analytics, space broadband and battery production. These sit within a broader framework of uncertainty driven by macro concerns that include higher interest rates and expanding geopolitical risk. More specifically, demand rebounds for our most pressured HST businesses appear to have moved out a bit into 2024. We continue to believe that organizational agility, speed of decision-making, outstanding business quality and a strong culture serve us well to navigate the twists and turns ahead. We can both dynamically assign capital and resources to our best near-term opportunities, while we stay focused on our long-term strategy of profitable growth outperformance. In terms of capital deployment, M&A continues to be a top focus. Within our funnel builds, we are aggressively following complementary threads between our most growth advantaged businesses and technologies as we seek to build our breakthrough competitive advantage. We did this recently with our Nexsight acquisition, expanding our reach within water analytics through enhanced hardware and software capabilities. Our Iridian acquisition earlier this year boosted integrated capabilities within thin-film optics. Our inorganic pipeline is robust and of high quality, allowing us to engage in M&A with discipline and strong strategic intent. And our balance sheet has ample capacity to continue to execute on our best opportunities. Finally, we divested our Micropump business during the quarter and repaid $150 million on our term note facility. As we continue to focus on long-term growth, occasional portfolio realignment will occur. We expect this transfer of ownership will better position Micropump as it joins a collection of like-minded businesses, focused on similar technologies and customers. I would like to express my appreciation for all the Micropump team has done since joining IDEX in 1995. With that, I'll turn it over to Allison to discuss our financial results. Thanks for both comments. Yes. Well, I mean, we often refer to those as the kind of canaries in our coal mine. And we discretely track about five of those businesses and keep an eye on weekly order rates and do it at the sort of small order flow day-to-day stuff level. We parse out projects. What we can see in there is, frankly, between the second and the third quarter, they're almost dead on flat. So the kind of moderate destocking cycle that we predicted at the beginning of the year, I think, largely played out through the first half of the year and frankly, moderated. Even quarter to -- month-to-month within the quarter, we didn't see a lot of changes there. So what that says is kind of our distributors because there's a lot in that world. Our end users, all of us were kind of back to the right inventory position based on our quick replenishment, our fast lead times. And now I think it goes into the question of sort of an uncertain environment, when does it start to flex upward? Those would be the businesses. Of course, we would watch to see early indications of that. So for right now, it's flattened out. It's holding. There's decent activity out there. There's certainly opportunities here and there, but not signaling any further trouble and waiting to see if it brings forth some more encouraging signs. I want to take a little time here because I think I got to set our context in relation to those comments in the environment you described. First of all, as I said in the prepared remarks, I mean, we're talking about four buckets of business primarily that kind of fall into this category. Analytical instruments, life science, of course, that's the larger piece of it. Pharma exposure as well as semicon, that's about half of HST, and that's the piece that we're describing when we walk through this. Then I want to back up and say, if you think about time line, you actually have to go back, we're almost a year into this, for us. Because of the short clinical nature, we actually saw some of this noise in Q4 of last year. And as you said, we and others, I think, have to get our heads around the fact that it's actually been a series of additive components that's played out here over the course of that year. Initially, thought it was just simply aggressive demand turning to something more moderate. Of course, we felt that in our businesses in Q4. Then, it was a reexamination of inventory positions and just frankly, seeing way too much of it at many points. And of course, that destocking played out. I think here in the second and third quarter, it's been kind of a second or third inning, if you will, of some concerns about some macro forces, probably the most significant being China's contribution or lack thereof as we -- going forward relative to what it has been in earlier periods. So there's kind of three things that played out. What I think that's done for us is, of course, we felt that pretty aggressively in the earlier piece. So there's a lot of businesses because of the component nature of the products we make. And here more moderately in the last quarter, and I can see that our backlog position, our visibility within the quarter, our kind of inventory position in factories where we supply, that's an equilibrium. So I don't see any more external forces or things that would come in there simply trying to unwind the past. That does mean, frankly, that we're kind of open to the recovery loop that's ahead of us and the uncertainty of when it will occur and how it might play out. And again, Deane, I back up a little bit and say, we're hitting that from four different levels. So while there could be some things that fall off in other places as people kind of think about demand and where they may go, maybe some of those are in the life science arenas, that we're going to have some other things that are going to potentially be working against that, that may wash that out in the interim. So equilibrium is a little bit more of a variable term for us. But I think those abnormal shocks to the system that we saw play out over the last year or so. We're essentially seeing that those are behind us. And now, like everybody else, we can lean forward, go and kind of poke the customer level and take a look at what people are doing in innovation streams and start to plan our course from here. No, I think that's good. You probably summarized it a little better than I did, but I was trying to make sure people can understand that context for us. Again, we're -- what's really important to recognize here, we're inside the life science instrument at the component level or inside the lithography instruments. So these are critical items, very fast replenishment. And so yes, I was describing us kind of unwinding a series of unnatural patterns, but we are now in sync. And we're in sync and essentially open to the same variability that, that end market is at this point. Well, yes, certainly, as the year progresses, the comps get increasingly easier. Yes. I mean, it is interesting. I think the industrial system is still performing at a pretty high level. I mean the day rates that we're talking about here, that flatness that I described in those canary levels, that's a pretty healthy business that suggests people are working, factories are producing things and putting it to work. Certainly around it, though, discussions around longer-term commitments or things that are going to happen in the spring of next year, I mean, they're just -- they're harder conversations to have because of all the uncertainty that people are feeling, pick anything from the higher interest rate position on the increasing geopolitical risk that's out there, consequences of a major election in the U.S. next year, right? You can see to see a lot of people on the one side continuing to kind of forecast on the things that are happening day to day, but kind of backing up with a wait-and-see approach at a higher level just because of uncertainties for anything that sort of passed the horizon. Yes. But well, look, again, I put a lot of weight on the predictive abilities of those early indicator businesses that we have to talk a lot about sort of day-to-day, how the system is operating. So I think that -- again, that stability means a lot. In this environment, order patterns do change a little bit. Remember, an earlier comment I had there for Mike, I mean I think you're seeing people moving to shorter increments of order patterns. They know now companies like -- I mean, certainly, IDEX, we can deliver with faster replenishment. Our customer satisfaction metrics are really good. So if you feel any uncertainty, you don't have to give us nearly the same kind of visibility in your order requirements that you had to 2 quarters ago or a year ago. So I think you do see a piece of that, that changes in the order profiling, more of a order it as you go. And so -- again, we ate into some pretty aggressive backlog along the way. At any time lead times keep coming down, I mean that does tend to influence order patterns for folks on the other side. So I think it's things like that playing out, by and large, around a pretty stable base, especially on the industrial side. To me, says, I think this is a stable environment, but one that's looking for the next catalyst. Yes. Well, that's probably a piece of the answer to your last question as well. I mean the certainty around projects like that is not very good. And you've got some people that are -- they're still talking about them, but they start to move that time horizon. We're getting closer to 2024 like a magnet. And so it becomes a reference point and a point in the calendar where people are pointing to when things might come to fruition in that side of it. Again, contextually for us, that's not all of our businesses, but we'll see it as part of a planned expansion commitment or something like that for food or something related to infrastructure. So those kind of discrete things that require a lot of capital will come together, a lot of planning. I think there is a lot more uncertainty around them. And it's -- instead, it's kind of running the current system faster and a little bit longer before you rebuild it due to that same level of uncertainty. Well, I'm actually glad you mentioned that because, in many ways, at ground level in those businesses, you kind of see two realities sitting side by side, and they're actually quite different. One is the near-term reactive reality of what's happened over here in the last year, where order levels are and what daily requirements are, lots of cost containment and being super crisp around productivity and just getting the product out. But even at the customer level, I mean, I think you see that entire world is spending a lot of time thinking through, okay, what do we need to do to innovate to get ahead of the game in the next cycle? Because I can't find anybody that doesn't see that there's going to be something more positive coming here. The same mega trends that have been driving that sector forever are not very far out ahead of us and will occur again. But when they do, we're seeing at the customer level and within our business is a real step-up in terms of innovative steps to get after it. I was talking to Terra Teresa, who runs our businesses there, and she's describing some of the projects that we're working on in conjunction with really significant customers. And it's some of the highest degrees of innovation jumps that I've frankly, seen in the last few years. So I think there's actually a very purposeful, collaborative arrangement here to talk about where this industry is going to go. And as it comes out, this is one of the reasons I think we try to stay as fast nimble as we can, so we can put capital and resources to those best opportunities and, frankly, overfeed them in times like this. So you've actually called it exactly how we see it at a ground level. Well, I think it was -- it's a nice little business. I think as we looked at it, we just don't have a lot of technology that's similar. We didn't see necessarily an ability to scale it. And larger-scale versions of it tend to be in markets that are not as attractive for us. So I do think that level of thinking is something that we do constantly, and you could see it play out that way from time to time. But I wouldn't view it just as this one as a massive transformational shift in portfolio for IDEX. But as we increasingly think about -- look, what we're trying to do here is drive growth outperformance, a little tighter integrated ability between the pieces of IDEX. I referenced that in the opening comments. Things that kind of stand-alone that don't have that ability to scale, we're going to take a look at, assess that carefully. And then it seems like the right decision is a potential different element, then we'll continue to make those choices. But I wouldn't sum it up to something more aggressive than that. Yes. Again, it's an important, but a small part of IDEX at less than 10%. But I think I think that one is pushed further into 2024. I mean it's stable here. We're certainly -- and we hit it from a variety of levels. We're in fabs. We're in metrology instruments. We're in memory. We're in sophisticated sides of it. And so we see it from a whole bunch of different spots, but I think all of it suggests the recovery of that sector is a little bit further out into 2024. We're certainly close to those customers. We're critical. They can't do much with our parts and components. So we'll get that intelligence, but I suspect the order ramp will start somewhere out into 2024. No, I appreciate it, Rob. So look, this is -- first of all, it's a super direct business. So we're talking with a relatively concentrated customer set of leading OEMs. So it's quite different from many other parts of IDEX in that respect. Up until the pandemic and some of the forces that we've seen here in the last 3 or 4 years, it's not typically been a very cyclical kind of industry. It's generally stayed at the kind of mid- to high single digits depending on where we sort of jump in, with the exception of the semi portion, of course. In all cases, you can think of this as -- these are platform-centric businesses. So an innovation stream comes in, somebody is looking to move to the next level, and it's either their instrument, or their lithography machine, or their device, is moving up well ahead of that. Our engineers are in there on the design cycle and working on the spec points and you secure the spec. So essentially, it's a pretty classic platform business. Once you're in on a platform, you run the duration of it. And you're concurrently always working on different iterations of things in either early gestation or late. So it's very, very classically aligned that way. So you do have good visibility into plans for programs, plans for program launches the variable that you run into, of course, is the adoption, the runout of those devices, the take up, the inventory positions on them, all the things that we've talked about as we've kind of gone through the last year here. Yes. Well, I mean, certainly and for -- I mean we've tried here for the last 2 or 3 years to be very, very focused on, frankly, cultivating proprietary transactions. We're taking advantage a little bit of the environment where we're comfortable. We were planning components in niche environments. We often see things and interact with people that maybe are not as well-known in the outside world. So we depend on multiyear relationships and conversations to try to get ourselves to a position where frankly, there aren't a lot of competitors in line as we're looking at an asset. That's not always possible to the extent it isn't. I would agree that you've seen something quite different here with higher interest rates. There's obviously some levels because people that need a lot of debt financing can only get to and can't pass. That will allow a property to probably stay out and play longer with strategics like us and others that might be taking a look at it. So you could view that as quite positive. I would say on the other side, though, too, because of that environment, maybe here more recently, you see some others that are a little bit more reluctant to transact in that way because they want to wait for a recovery loop or better demand curves that would support higher valuations in terminal values. So I think it's probably a little bit of wash on that side. But in many ways, we've always considered this better for us if we're working it much more discretely a bit more in the weeds and ideally in a proprietary way. Yes. Well, a couple of things here. Well, first, I'm glad you noticed. I mean the FMT segment, in particular, I mean, has fantastic performance. Over the last couple of quarters, Q3 was really good. And what you're seeing there is, look, reasonable cost containment, we run them -- we're in those businesses pretty lean anyways. It's much easier to run them at a steady state than kind of the last few years have been. So that brings out our best. And frankly, our teams have recognized, they're doing their part from an IDEX side and really drive an outstanding performance. I would say from an investment profile, I mean these are businesses, some of which are 80, 90, 100 years old. They are really, really well positioned. They do very well in almost all versions of economic realities that are out there. So making sure that they stay innovative, well positioned with the right channel partners, out in the right places, that's something we're always thoughtful of. We -- typically, the investments when we talk about growth investments. They're generally people based. And they are often discrete additive things that we'll do to go at certain things like battery production to support mobility -- e-mobility economy or something like that. So we'll augment and make those investments, or not, depending on how we view kind of the staying in the outside world. But the base of the business, just the kind of core of the franchise, we are really, really careful of that to make sure that, that domain expertise that supports all that positioning, and differentiation and incredible margins is sound for any reality. I mean there's a couple of things to keep in mind there. At any point, and we've seen it a couple of times over the last few years, if that business gets kind of close to flat or negative, the deleveraging side of things is really tough because of the strong contribution margins and our commitment to kind of maintain the core. So depending where things go, we always have to be aware of that. We are also at probably the best point of the price cost cycle here now. That's -- the spread that we're at today is probably not going to continue out into the future. We've always been a company that gets price. Of course, it's been more aggressive here lately with inflation. We're now at a point where those prices are sticky. There's some moderation on the inputs. This is the best part of the cycle, and this is the best part of the company that gets that pricing. So there's a little bit of a piece on here. I'd be careful of is assuming it's perpetual state, it's the good part of this part of the cycle. Yes. Well, I mean, the water side of things has been steady throughout. I would say it's indirectly related, of course, to a lot of the focused efforts to invest in our infrastructure. Frankly, the state of our infrastructure has now gotten to the point where it's impossible to look away from as well. We've seen that on a major scale in major cities, certainly here in the U.S. I think those two things together are putting in -- I've always thought of it as a warm blanket, multiyear blanket. It's just -- it takes a long time to spend money in that sector. These projects are just -- they take a long time to engineer rollout and go out there. And so no matter how discrete the kind of pop on funding might be, it's always going to have a little bit of an elongated run out. So we sort of view that as a comfortable blanket for businesses like ours and others that are in this sector. We've seen that. It's held up again in this quarter as well. I mean to dimensionalize it, you can look at the size of water in IDEX, and it's -- again, it's a nice piece of the portfolio, and we would see that it would stay at the upper end of the growth profile. Look, I'll let -- go ahead, Allison. Look, I think we'd have to monitor this pretty -- we obviously will through the balance of the fourth quarter. As always, everybody kind of does the same planning cycles at the same time. So that's the best opportunity for us to get in front of customers, talk about programs, things that they're launching, their confidence in them. I think we want to watch it quarter by quarter and stay super close to it. These are the most dynamic markets that we have in the whole place. I just -- I come back to kind of the comments I made. I think when Mike asked the question, he did such a good job summarizing it in the beginning. We're basically saying that we've taken all of the inventory-related noise out of this, and that's essentially the echo of the past. I will say, to the extent the industry heads in different directions here, we are in sync with it. We're a critical component supplier for folks that are making very sophisticated instruments and things for a variety of different markets and geographies. And we are somewhat dependent on -- we are completely dependent on their success, their call, the way that they're seeing that those markets are going to traverse. What we can do from our side is to provide, I think, a timely and relevant diagnostic. Mainly, because of the fact we're so short cycle. And we're going to feel and see those inflections sooner than almost anybody. And so with that in mind, we need to stay close to them. We'll understand all of those things. Again, it's four buckets of business for us, occasionally move at slightly different rates, and we can move resources around. So we'll see how it plays out as we go through '24. We still have a couple of businesses that have longer backlogs. I mean they're still working through generally because lingering issues in supply chains and elsewhere. We spoke of one in energy, where we talked about is pretty strong in the third quarter. A lot of that was us getting some more of that backlog out related to some consolidation stuff that we've done about a year ago. It's not many of them, but we do have a couple of other pockets in here that we're trying to get back down to kind of all IDEX level. Okay. Well, thanks for everybody for joining our call. And as I always do, I want to thank the members of the IDEX team that are on for really, really strong execution and performance in the quarter. I just -- a few comments here. I think there's certainly -- look, there's a lot of uncertainty out there in the environment. I think it's going to require a certain amount of patience. But as I think about IDEX and the things that we can control, here's what I know. I know our portfolio is in great shape. It's growing through M&A. It's well positioned, certainly to support long-term growth outperformance. I really think our flat and decentralized structure keeps us agile and nimble. We can move things around and resource things probably faster than anybody, and we do that each and every day. And our teams and leaders are outstanding and frankly, they're going to be outstanding plus one as Abhi joins us here in November. So with that, when things break, we'll be all set up here, I think, to really support a nice extended run for IDEX as the world starts to dial in, and respond to, frankly, the trends that we know are all coming. So with that, thanks for your support, and have a great day."

            "content": "Good morning, everyone. This is Allison Lausas, Interim Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the IDEX third quarter 2023 financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the 3 months ending September 30, 2023. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today's webcast, can be accessed on our company website at idexcorp.com. Joining me today is Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer and President. Today, we will begin with Eric providing an overview of the state of IDEX's business. I will then discuss IDEX's third quarter financial results, an update on segment performance in the markets they serve, and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay beginning approximately 2 hours after the call concludes, by dialing the toll-free number (877) 660-6853 and entering conference ID 13734464, or simply log on to our company homepage for the webcast replay. Before we begin, a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor language in last night's press release and in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I will now turn this call over to our CEO and President, Eric Ashleman. Thanks, Eric. Moving on to our third quarter consolidated financial results on Slide 9. All comparisons are against the third quarter of 2022, unless otherwise stated. Orders of $712 million were down 9% overall and down 11% organically. We experienced an organic decrease within our HST and FMT segment and organic growth in FSD. Sales of $793 million were down 4% overall and down 6% organically. We experienced a 15% organic decrease in HST and a 1% decrease in FMT. FSD revenues grew organically by 3%. Gross margin of 44.1% decreased by 220 basis points compared with last year. Adjusted gross margin decreased 90 basis points, primarily due to lower volume leverage and unfavorable mix, which was partially offset by strong operational productivity and price costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.4%, down 30 basis points. I will discuss the drivers of adjusted EBITDA on the next slide. On a GAAP basis, our Q3 effective tax rate of 20.2% was lower than our effective rate in the third quarter of 2022 of 21.8%. The rate was driven down by both the finalization of research expenditure capitalization treatment that served to increase tax benefits on foreign source income and a tax election related to the Muon acquisition that reduced our minimum tax on foreign earnings. These favorable rate items were partly offset by tax recorded on the gain from the Micropump divestiture and are not expected to have a significant impact on our fourth quarter rate. Net income was $209 million, which resulted in GAAP EPS of $2.75. Adjusted net income was $161 million, with adjusted EPS of $2.12, which is down $0.02 or 1%. The lower tax rate contributed $0.11 of adjusted EPS favorability in the current quarter compared to both the prior year and the midpoint of our third quarter guidance. Finally, cash from operations of $227 million was up 14%, primarily due to lower working capital, driven by inventory reductions. Free cash flow for the quarter was $207 million, up 14% versus last year and achieved a conversion rate of 129% of adjusted net income. We drove over $25 million of inventory out of the business in the third quarter through our targeted reduction efforts, and we saw inventory turns remain consistent with last quarter due to lower sales. Moving on to Slide 10, which details the drivers of our third quarter adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $6 million compared to the third quarter 2022. Our 6% organic sales reduction unfavorably impacted adjusted EBITDA by $37 million flowing through at our prior year adjusted gross margin rate. Price cost was accretive to margins, and we drove operational productivity that offset employee-related inflation. Mix was unfavorable by $6 million, mainly centered in HST, due to continued volume declines in our analytical instrumentation, life science and semiconductor components. Resource and discretionary spending was favorable versus last year, as we continue to execute on our cost containment plan given the top line pressure we are experiencing. Reductions in variable compensation expense contributed $8 million of benefit in the quarter. These results yielded a negative 31% organic flow-through. Overall, our team's focus on cost containment and resource reallocation has effectively managed our revenue decline, ensuring continuity of our most valuable resources has IDEX well positioned to recover and grow back stronger than before when market dynamics turn favorable. Muon and Iridian acquisitions, net of Knight and Micropump divestitures and FX contributed an additional $9 million of adjusted EBITDA. With that, I'll provide a deeper look at our segment performance. I'm on Page 11. In our Fluid & Metering technology segment, orders decreased by 5% organically, mainly due to an expected slowdown in our industrial businesses and continued customer destocking in our agriculture business. Sales decreased by 1% organically, driven by this destocking impact, partly offset by favorable energy, chemical and water performance. We began to see our industrial order day rates decline in the second quarter of this year, and they remain steady at that level throughout the third quarter. Although our customers continue to exercise caution, due to recession concerns and lower energy prices, we see tailwinds tied to domestic infrastructure initiatives and within mining. Within agriculture, we continue to experience the impact of distribution destocking, exacerbated by declining net farm incoming crop prices. Our delivery continues to outperform our competitors, and we are focused on targeted share gain to offset this pressure. Additionally, the acquisition of KZValve and the adoption of its automated actuation technology is delivering strong results. On the energy side, we continue to execute well, driving down backlogs and lead times. Underlying market demand remains steady, but we expect to see revenue declines versus third quarter as our backlog position normalizes. In the chemical market, we continue to see positive results across the U.S., Europe and Asia, with pharma and battery applications providing opportunities for growth. Our water business continues to exhibit growth. Our opportunity funnels are increasing, and we see no signs of municipal project funding delays as we approach 2024. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 50 basis points compared to last year, primarily due to strong price cost and favorable operational productivity more than offsetting lower volume leverage. Moving to the HST segment. We experienced a 24% organic orders decrease and a 15% organic sales decrease, mainly due to pressure across the life sciences, analytical instrumentation and semiconductor markets as well as industrial market performance similar to that within FMT. Adjusted EBITDA margins contracted by 410 basis points, primarily due to lower volume leverage and unfavorable mix, partially offset by strong price cost and favorable operational productivity. Our analytical instrumentation business continues to experience customers destocking, which remains driven by China softness, lower pharma-biopharma spending and overall caution around the global economy. We expect that performance will remain stable at this level in the fourth quarter, with improvement in 2024. We see a similar trend within our life science business. Semiconductor continues to experience softness with the expectation that the market has reached a bottom in the third quarter. We anticipate a broader market will begin to recover at some point in 2024. We continue to see positive results stemming from our space, broadband laser communication initiatives, which are bolstered by Iridian's technological capabilities. Our material processing technology business continues to experience softness across pharma markets but are seeing some early signs of improvement within biopharma, food and nutrition as well as tailwinds connected to leveraging our technology and battery production application. Industrial markets and HST slowed in the quarter, in line with FMT's results. Finally, turning to our Fire & Safety Diversified Products segment. Organic orders grew by 2% versus third quarter last year and organic sales grew 3%, with strong fire and safety results more than offsetting destocking at BAND-IT. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 150 basis points, primarily due to strong price cost and favorable operational productivity, partially offset by unfavorable mix and lower volume leverage. The paint market remains mixed. The uncertain global macro environment is driving consumer confidence lower, while at the same time, the construction market in North America remains strong. Within our fire business, we do not see any significant changes to North America fire OEM production capacity. We continue to win through value-add integrated systems and technology and standardized offerings that enable higher OEM throughput. Our Europe and Asia businesses remain steady. Rescue performance remains steady as well, although we are seeing some signs of North American budget delays and inventory reduction due to high borrowing costs. BAND-IT continues to outperform a relatively flat U.S. auto market due to having content on high-priority vehicles. There is some pressure on the energy side, driven by lower oil prices, and we experienced some destocking within aviation. With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. I'm on Slide 12. In Q4, we are projecting GAAP EPS to range from $1.50 to $1.55 and adjusted EPS to range from $1.74 to $1.79. Organic revenue is expected to decline 8% to 9% and adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be about 26%. We expect that our HST revenues will be slightly unfavorable versus our previous guide, offset by FMT volumes landing better than expected. Equally, our strong execution in the third quarter allowed us to work through our backlog faster than expected. This is driving an equal and offsetting $0.05 of impact to third quarter results and fourth quarter expectations. Turning to the full year 2023. We are maintaining our full year organic revenue guidance of down 1% to 2%. At the midpoint, we have raised our EPS guidance by $0.20, with approximately $0.11 driven by lower third quarter effective tax rate and the remainder coming from third quarter operational outperformance, partly offset by $0.05 of revenue timing due to accelerated backlog burn in the third quarter. In summary, we estimate full year organic revenue contraction of 1% to 2% to yield GAAP EPS of $7.91 to $7.96 and adjusted EPS of $8.13 to $8.18. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 27.5%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be about $80 million, and free cash flow is expected to be 100-plus percent of adjusted net income. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions. Thank you. That's correct, Mike. So we can find more aggressive backlog pull down in third quarter. So it's just a shift of timing within the back half of the year. Sure, Vlad. No, I can take that. That's really the step down due to dispensing as that replenishment cycle did come to an end there. So you see that slowdown in the third quarter. You'll see it also a bit into fourth. But also in fourth quarter, we've got a bit of seasonality in Fire & Rescue, fewer production days. As we recover, they'll lever nicely. And so a longer-term expectation for the HST set of businesses is more in the EBITDA margins of 29%-plus. Sure. No, I think, on a pure dollar basis, we should expect to see some higher orders in the fourth quarter. But there is some blanket activity also that happens as we wrap the year. That's right. We'll need to be -- we'll need to keep close watch."

A brief question-and-answers session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Allison Lausas, Vice-President and Chief Accounting Officer. Thank you. You may begin.\nAllison Lausas: Good morning, everyone.

With that, I will now turn this call over to our CEO and President, Eric Ashleman.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you, Allison and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6. IDEX delivered record sales and adjusted earnings per share in the second-quarter along with strong free-cash flow. Our Fluid and Metering and Fire and Safety diversified products businesses delivered exceptional performance on strong market fundamentals, both posting strong organic growth and profitability, with FMT delivering an all-time high EBITDA margin. Our Health and Science Technologies segment continue to face challenges impacted by inventory destocking in our analytical instrumentation, life sciences, biopharma and semiconductor markets. Our teams within the segment drove double-digit organic growth over the last two years, admirably executing for customers and the business in very difficult conditions. Now, on the backside of the post-pandemic recovery, our OEM partners are aggressively reducing higher inventory levels, beginning with those suppliers that have demonstrated the quickest returns to pre-pandemic lead times. Our teams are appropriately balanced as they execute targeted cost reductions to mitigate a portion of these volume declines, drive strong cash-flow overall, and continue to innovate for our customers. During our last earnings call, our revised outlook for the year assumed our industrial businesses would slow moderately in the second-half, while our HST segment would experience a modest rebound. While our view on the industrial markets has not changed, we are no longer projecting recovery in HST volumes in the second-half of the year. Our outlook is based on revised forecasts from our key customers who are reevaluating their end-market demand alongside their current inventory levels. They're considering many factors overall, including supply-chain improvements, lower-than-expected growth in China, and overall macro pressures within their market verticals. This is a complex and rapidly evolving context, which played out for us in Q2 with a 27% year-over-year organic drop in HST orders. This moderating demand profile, net of our incremental cost containment actions drives an additional $0.45 of EPS pressure at the midpoint versus our previous guide. With that, as we noted in our press release, we are revising our full-year 2023 adjusted EPS guidance to $7.90 to $8 per share. Bill will discuss the specifics in greater detail during our segment and guidance updates. In the second-quarter, we also closed on the Iridian Spectral Technologies deal we announced earlier this year, adding another market leader in custom optical filter solutions serving the space, life science and telecommunications markets. We continue to focus on driving strong operational performance regardless of business environment, delivering and innovating for our customers. We're driving speed and agility within our businesses taking out inventory and driving world-class lead times, positioning us best for growth cycles to come. We remain committed to managing through the short-term while not losing focus on critical investments in the development of our people, in capital deployment and in our differentiated technologies to enable our long-term growth path and deliver above market performance over the cycle. With that, I will turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results.\nWilliam Grogan: Thanks, Eric. Moving on to our second-quarter consolidated financial results on slide eight. All comparisons are against the second-quarter of 2022, unless otherwise stated. Orders of $766 million were down 9% overall, and down 13% organically, mainly driven by a 27% organic decrease in HST, due to timing of project orders for next-gen sequencing equipment, as well as OEM pressure across the life sciences, analytical, instrumentation, pharma and semiconductor markets. Record sales of $846 million were up 6% overall and up 3% organically. We experienced 10% organic growth within FMT, 8% organic growth within FSD and 6% organic decrease in HST. Gross margin of 44.7% decreased by 10 basis points compared with last year. This was driven by lower-volume leverage in HST, the dilutive impact of acquisitions and unfavorable mix. Partially offset by strong price-cost and favorable operational productivity across the segments. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.4%, up 90 basis points. I will discuss the drivers of adjusted EBITDA on the next slide. Our second-quarter effective tax rate was 22.4% was comparable with our prior year effective tax rate of 22.1%. Net income was $139 million, which resulted in an EPS of $1.82. Adjusted net income was $165 million with an adjusted EPS of $2.18, which was up $0.16 or 8%. Finally, cash from operations of $141 million was up 26%, primarily due to lower investments in working capital versus last year. Free cash flow for the quarter included higher CapEx and was $120 million, up 24% versus last year, coming in at 72% of adjusted net income. We drove over $20 million of inventory out of the business in the quarter through our targeted reduction efforts. And we saw inventory returns improve versus last quarter. Moving on to Slide 9, which details the drivers of our second quarter adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $22 million compared to the second quarter of 2022. Our 3% organic growth included over 4% of price, placing volumes negative for the quarter. This lower volume unfavorably impacted adjusted EBITDA by $9 million flowing through at our prior year adjusted gross margin rate. Price cost was accretive to margins, and we drove operational productivity that offset employee related inflation. The mix was unfavorable by $3 million, mainly centered in HST due to continued volume declines in our analytical instrumentation and life science components. Resource and discretionary spending was approximately flat versus last year. We have executed tight cost controls given our volume pressure, and we continue to identify reduction opportunities for the balance of the year. Reductions and variable compensation expense based on our updated outlook contributed $5 million of benefit in the quarter. These results yielded a 60% organic flow-through. Muon and KZValve acquisitions, net of the Knight divestiture and FX contributed an additional $9 million of adjusted EBITDA. Inclusive of acquisitions, divestitures and FX, we delivered 43% flow-through. Excluding the impact of variable compensation, flow-through is about 35%. With that, I'll provide a deeper look at our segment performance. In our fluid metering technology segment, we experienced strong sales performance with organic growth of 10%. But orders did contract by 4% organically, mainly driven by the slowing industrial landscape. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 340 basis points versus the second quarter of last year, driven by strong price cost performance and volume leverage. We saw our industrial day rate decline early in the second quarter remained steady at that lower level. Customers are taking a cautious view of the second half as they process a variety of economic factors that influence their demand. Our water business performed well. The North American market continues to be positive with extreme weather, necessary technology and infrastructure upgrades and improved funding, all fueling growth. Our energy markets remain mixed. Improved chassis availability is driving strength in our mobile applications and the teams continue to work down past due backlog, but lower oil prices look to slow the pace of investment in the second half of the year. In the chemical market, we saw positive results across the US, Europe and Asia, with battery markets providing additional opportunities for growth. The agricultural demand landscape remains mixed. Farm fundamentals are positive overall, and our OEM business remains strong. However, distributor inventory levels remain high, and we have not seen a material bleed down as we have progressed through the planting season. Moving to the Health & Science Technologies segment. Organic orders contracted 27% in the quarter, driven by analytical instrumentation, life science and biopharma customers' inventory destocking, timing of next-gen sequencing orders, soft semiconductor and slowing industrial demand. Sales were down 6% organically and adjusted EBITDA margins contracted by 420 basis points driven by unfavorable volume leverage and mix as well as higher employee-related costs, partially offset by strong price cost performance. As Eric noted, our Life Science and Analytical Instrumentation businesses are being impacted by customers' inventory destocking and reduced demand. This was driven by a combination of improved supply chain conditions, macroeconomic factors and lower-than-expected China demand. We expect this pressure to remain throughout the balance of the year. The semiconductor market continues to experience softness resulting from memory oversupply, as well as customers feeling the impact of the US export controls. We have exposure to multiple parts of the semiconductor value chain and expect demand will stabilize in the third quarter with recovery in the fourth quarter. Our Material Processing Technology business continues to experience softness across pharma, biopharma and nutrition markets, driven by tighter capital availability and customer hesitancy due to recession concerns. We are seeing some strength in aftermarket and positive impact from our battery market opportunities and we see some signs of improved quotation activity for these early days. Industrial markets and HST slowed in the quarter in line with FMT results. Finally, turning to our Fire & Safety Diversified Products segment. Organic orders grew by 2% versus last year, mainly driven by favorable fire and safety, and dispensing results. Organic sales growth was strong at 8% with double-digit growth in both Fire & Rescue and BAND-IT. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 300 basis points versus last year, largely driven by strong price cost performance, operational productivity, favorable volume leverage, and positive mix. The paint market remains mixed with positive North American results, offset by delays of Europe and Asia customer investments. Within our fire business, we continue to gain share with North America mid-tier and China OEMs through our integrated system strategy. Underlying truck demand remains positive and OEMs continue to improve their output. Rescue markets are stable overall with some distributors burning off excess inventory being balanced by growth in our E3 products. BAND-IT results remain positive. We continue to gain share in an otherwise flat automotive market, which is partially offset by slowing energy and industrial markets. With that, I'll provide an update for our outlook for the third quarter and the full year 2023. I'm on Slide 11. In the third quarter, we are projecting GAAP EPS to range from $1.60 to $1.65 and adjusted EPS to range from $1.84 to $1.89. Organic revenue is expected to decline 7% to 8%, and adjusted EBITDA margins are estimated to be approximately 27%. We project sequential volume declines across HST and FMT with relatively flat FSD sales. On a year-over-year basis, we expect negative mid-teen organic sales decline in HST, negative low to mid-single-digit declines in FMT and low single-digit growth in FSD. Turning to the full year. As Eric mentioned, we have reduced our full year revenue guidance in response to our softening HST second half outlook. We now expect organic revenue declines of 1% to 2%. This implies high single-digit revenue contraction in HST with low to mid-single-digit growth in FMT and FSD. At the midpoint, we have reduced our EPS guidance by $0.45 with approximately $0.60 related to lower volume and the associated leverage and unfavorable mix. We offset $0.15 of this pressure with additional cost containment actions related to targeted restructuring and lower resource investment, and variable compensation along with discretionary spend. In summary, we estimate full year organic revenue contraction of 1% to 2%, GAAP EPS of $6.80 to $6.90 and adjusted EPS of $7.90 to $8. Adjusted EBITDA margin will be approximately 27%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be about $70 million and free cash flow is expected to be 100-plus percent of adjusted net income. With that, I'll turn it back over to Eric for his closing remarks.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Bill. I'm on Slide 12. As we've said in the past, our IDEX leadership will not allow short-term economic fluctuations to alter our foundational objectives, delivering strong execution for our customers, building great global teams and deploying our capital with discipline. We've always invested in our best growth opportunities across our well-positioned diverse franchises. Over the last 10 years, we leveraged 80/20 to optimize business performance and fine-tune our portfolio towards faster-growing application sets. We're now adding power and next level potential to our best advantage businesses and platforms through thoughtful and aggressive capital deployment. Our Muon business, acquired last year, supports the most difficult applications within high-quality semicon, just like our businesses in Sealing Solutions and Optical Technologies. Those optics businesses also play a critical role within space broadband markets, now complemented by our most recent acquisition of Iridian Spectral Technologies. Our acquisition of KZValve opens the door for our Banjo franchise to play even deeper within fluidic handling for precision agriculture solutions. Our Nexsight business brings more software intelligence and channel assets into the water platform. Airtech opens doors within alternate energy gensets. ABEL Pumps helps customers mine deeper to find the minerals required to power the e-mobility revolution. The reality is that, IDEX products are everywhere playing close to the core of the world's most advanced technologies. Our components orientation allows for maximum tunability and flexibility to pivot resources to the fastest-growing mega trends. None of this is possible without talented people and teams who thrive in an outstanding entrepreneurial culture. This aspect is a source of competitive advantage for IDEX. We knew this was going to be a year of transition and dynamic recalibration with a course that would be hard to predict. We're managing the near term urgently and appropriately, but with an enthusiasm that recognizes the potential for great things ahead. With that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.\nMichael Halloran: Hi, good morning, everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Hi, Mike.\nMichael Halloran: So, a couple of questions. First, let's talk about the -- obviously, the biggest piece in the quarter, the analytical instrumentation, life science, biopharma, et cetera, pressure points. And not overly surprising given what your customers are saying publicly as well. Maybe talk about a couple of things here, how you look at this bottoming curve? When you think we can get back to maybe a little bit more normalized environment in the context of some of the funding, the oversupply, over investment, et cetera? I know you don't feel any differently about the long-term growth curve, but would love to get a sense for internally how you guys are thinking about the recovery curve?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. Well, thanks for that. So, I think if we step-back and kind of think about this traversing over the course of the year. I go back to kind of the end of Q4, that's where we went some virtually unbounded demand essentially only capacity and capability, entering the mix is a constraint. To those first signs that, okay, we're going to have to tune this thing and get it to something more sustainable long-term, more normal. So we saw that play-out initially as a lot of focus on inventory, just too much inventory all over the place. I think over-time and here especially in the second-quarter, we saw a view of -- as people start to attack that with analytics and we got a lot closer to our customers. You could see kind of the depth of it; where it was accumulated, how much it was -- how long it was going to take to burn that off, that became kind of a secondary component for us in Q2. And then I think -- I think the piece that's really played out and we saw a lot of this calibration in the second-quarter was another assessment of end-markets and where they really are on the customer's part. So, you kind of had markets clicking along kind of at the top-end of high-single-digits, I think in the pandemic, kind of moved back-down to an assumption that they would be more normal, I'd say, more mid-single digits. And I think closer now to -- in the near-term at least, balance of the year, in that low single digits, with those factors that I talked about in the open remarks. And I think probably maybe strength of China being the one that was the most pronounced and started to really pop out of the page for -- and the conversations that we had in Q2. So we sort of backed-up, took a look at those forecast, that situation, and as you can see here, essentially, cleared the deck for the rest of the year. I think we've bottomed-out from an orders perspective. We've seen kind of the levels that we're at now hold here through July. Even with all the analytics, today we have an inventory, you can see the two kind of working together. So, then I think that all of the visibility shifts to probably the real spirit of your question, which is, when does this start to get back to something that's more traditional in terms of growth rates. For us, I think, honestly, we see that past -- certainly, past the six months that are ahead of us, somewhere probably out in 2024, obviously the comparatives would get a lot easier. But I think we're still going to all have to watch. We're going to have to watch and see what's the long-term call on China. Is this a trough of a cycle there and there is ultimately an uptick? We'll be listening for that intelligence as well. The funding environment, how are people leaning into kind of approving projects and outfitting plants and things that we see in the CapEx intensive sides of our business, probably the semicon piece, that I feel the best about. I mean, that's tracked by everybody and we can kind of see -- everybody pointing to better days ahead starting in kind of -- for us, probably beginning of Q4 and certainly leading into the year. So I think the arrow up in 2024, probably still with some variable rates coming out of it and a lot more assessments that we've got to make as we go through a period that we think now it's been derisked and sort of laid out there in a way that we can all get comfortable with.\nMichael Halloran: Great. No, that's super helpful. And maybe the exact same conversation on the short-cycle industrial pieces, the weakening side of things. Obviously, Bill, in the prepared remarks gave a lot of context on where some of that softening is. I just would like to understand how you think that bottoms out and how that recovery curve plays out in the context of -- clearly a lot of moving pieces out there?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. And I want to emphasize that, that side of the businesses it's kind of run its course exactly the way we thought it would. So you've seen here, order rates declining, that's the normalization of backlog. I want to make it clear to everybody that you all recognize how close to normal we actually are now. So our backlog, when you net out sort of the compounded price, the aggressive price that's happened over the last couple of years and compare it to sort of pre-pandemic levels. We're basically pretty close. We're a little higher-than-normal, but we'll get there soon, certainly in the back-half of the year. So that's on the industrial side of the business. Our quarterly coverage that we have, if you're familiar with us, we typically talk about half the quarter covered, and the other half we have to go find. We're there now. And so, really now we are able to see into these markets and understand and think a lot more about the future than the past. And that's why as we kind of got -- re-examined the list of markets that don't went through. And you're seeing, I think in many ways kind of an absence of catalysts unless it's really, really tied to identifiable mega trend with a bunch of funding sources, like the water space for us. You're seeing kind of that same story of, hey, hesitancy. I wonder where things are going. A little reticence to go ask for big funding of large capital projects. So, I think we're well-positioned for what inevitably at some point will start to move-up, and I do believe that next cycle is going to be a good one. But I think here in the near-term it's still going to be kind of a story of watching the rest of the world catch-up and kind of get to the same point of calibration that we are. And then, I think it's going to be a much bigger, broader kind of macroeconomic conversation as we head into 2024, of which catalysts will be out there. The good news from an IDEX perspective is, I know you know, Mike, we do really well on the entry point, once we kind of hit this point and are ready to go, short lead times, rapid recovery out there at the tip of the spear with innovation. So, that's kind of my take on where things are now with an emphasis on how close to normal the company is actually positioned.\nMichael Halloran: That's great. If I could just squeeze one more in. You mentioned that, confident in the cycle, you added Slide 12, where you're talking about how well you're positioned for growth. Could you just give some context of what you think that growth algorithm looks like for you? What are we talking about in terms of what the sustainable organic growth profile looks, or the relative outperformance you can get versus whatever the markets are doing, maybe put that in context on a longer horizon for us?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. I think the examples I cited there, particularly now that they've been augmented with some really, really strong capital deployment. It gets us closer to that 300% outperformance that we've been shooting for in terms of potential of delivery. So if, let's say, we enter a world that has kind of a 2% nominal floor, we would be expecting to drive with combination of solid price capture, innovation, and the assets that we have, something closer to that 5% level. And then, continuing to deploy capital on top of that, which then ultimately if you kind of run it through the algorithm of contribution margins and the compounding nature of what we have as a company, that sets up the double-digits earning growth that I think everybody kind of expects and is looking-forward to from an IDEX.\nMichael Halloran: Thanks. Really appreciate it, Eric.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets, please proceed.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: I want to follow-up on some of the commentaries, both on the HST and industrial side. And on HST, we agree, this has been well vetted in terms of the public company analytical instrument, companies discuss, saying the destocking, and we're getting the sense that the bottoming is coming, but just share with us, you're one-step removed as a supplier to these OE's. So what is your level of visibility and how has that changed? And what has happened with lead times now that you've had -- much of this destocking happening?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. Well, you're absolutely right. I mean, it's important that people understand that the typical IDEX solution here is a component, which is going into some system or device that thins out there, it goes out into the market. And then there's a whole bunch of other revenue streams that come with it, service and consumables and things -- we don't participate there. And so, we're talking primarily with people in factories and supplying and purchasing change, obviously engineering on the innovation side, but typically not the first-person that they're going to talk to you on a commercial conversation about kind of where they're seeing. So that's always been a little harder for us. It's a conversation to have. And so, you can kind of think of the way this has played out as we have kind of crawled up from the factory floor into front and center commercial conversations, mainly because of our criticality. We're in a place -- we get there where others probably don't, because of the essence of what we're making and what it does for the end device. So, I will absolutely tell you that one of the benefits of what we've come through here is we have a lot deeper relationships, we're in different conversations than we've been able to be into, and our understanding of kind of inventory positions and philosophy, it's better now than it's ever been before, because it has to be. Your second question then was related to lead times. I mean, we are in really, really in good shape and that in some ways is why you're seeing and have seen kind of the rapid degradation of order rates. When -- we did the same thing. We're thinking about taking inventory out of the system, we essentially do 80/20. You lineup dollars of supply and your secondary factor is always assurance supply, OTD and capability. When those two things come together, you essentially hammer the orderbook. So in many ways we've seen that play out probably the most aggressive, given who we are and what we do. And it's an indication of where we are from a lead-time. Our ultimate backlog position for the company, quarterly coverage of order rates is also a validation of where we are, because it's right back to very, very typical levels for us.\nDeane Dray: All right. That's really helpful. And just to flip over on the industrial side, what we're trying to do is connect the dots here about your commentary about slowing industrial orders and slowing industrial landscape and I'm trying to parse out how much of this is just a result of the normalizing supply-chain and release of buffer inventories and shortening lead times, which in itself is kind of a normalized process. But it doesn't sound like there's anything disturbing on the end-market, the sell-through side of the end-market demand, but I just wanted to get clarification on that. So how much of this is strictly from a normalizing supply-chain on the industrial side versus any deterioration on the end-market demand?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. I think you're thinking about it right. I mean the predominant driver here is the normalization of the cycle. Absolutely. It's just -- I said this -- I don't know, in these calls or the last couple of times that eventually you run into physics. There's no need to keep all this backlog around unless you're going to alter permanently the capability of the system, and nobody wants to do that. So a lot of this is playing out. If you look at our last quarter here, particularly on the industrial side, we posted double-digit organic growth, it's not necessarily indicative of the environment that's out there. That's us eating the last of the backlog in the past-due and getting our own lead times where we want to get to. As we are doing that, it's telegraphed through to the customer who is then dropping their order rates exactly the way you'd expect that they would. Underneath all of that, this allows us to, as I said before, really see, okay, what is this environment that's out in front of us, both today and tomorrow. And you're right. I don't see a lot of things in there that are overly negative. In fact, I see kind of a lot of the same behavior that we saw before this. In many ways, still some continued reluctance to make big capital purchase bets and all of those things. But to be honest, those really weren't here over the last couple of years either. So there's not a lot of negative noise that's behind that recalibration curve that's happening there. I would also say, though, there isn't a lot of tons of super positive things there as well, where people are saying, \"Well, now that this is behind us, we're ready to go on Project A, B and C.\" But I don't know that, that's actually different from where we've been. So I don't know. I hope that's helpful, but I think your opening statement is pretty close here that the major driver is a cycle playing out and that fundamentally underneath it, there's not a ton of noise in terms of what's going on market to market.\nDeane Dray: Alright. Eric, that's exactly what we're looking for, and appreciate all the color. Thank you.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks Deane.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak: Hey, good morning. Just on the HST, thanks for the color on how to think of organic decline in Q3. On the EBITDA margin, obviously down year-over-year this quarter, does that take another step down? Or are you stemming through the decrementals now, just given the aggressive approach to cost, just any color on how we should think of that just given the sharp decline in organic next quarter?\nWilliam Grogan: Yes, Allison, it's Bill. I think in the third quarter, you'll see a little bit of additional pressure as volume steps down in the third quarter. And we bottomed out in the orders side here in Q2. Sales will bottom out in Q3. I think margins hit its low point, and we'll start to build back up Obviously, the additional cost actions we have taken have helped mitigate that. And then the volume leverage we'll get as we start to build back in the fourth quarter. We'll start to set our journey back to a 29%, 30% EBITDA-type margin as we progress through the recovery.\nAllison Poliniak: And then just in terms of the dislocation here in the analytical instrumentation market, is that driving any incremental sort of M&A opportunities, just given the unusual nature of it or kind of steady as it's been? Just any color there.\nWilliam Grogan: Yes. No, not really. I mean, I haven't seen anything there. I mean the backdrop matters. It might prevent some folks from putting something out there because they want to let things clear and not be quite as noisy or something like that in the short term, but nothing that's really topped and said because the cycle is playing out a certain way, the funnel is now composed much different than it has been for us.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. And then just one last quick one. The inventory drawdown on your side. Bill, did you say you guys were largely done with that? Or is there still more to go in the second half year?\nWilliam Grogan: No, there's still more to go. I think from absolute dollars, I think we'll continue to bleed. Inventory turns, there will be a little bit pressure just with the decreased volumes within HST, but the teams continue to track, and there's probably another $20 million to $30 million of inventory reduction here in the back half.\nAllison Poliniak: Perfect. Thank you.\nWilliam Grogan: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vlad Bystricky with Citigroup.\nVlad Bystricky: Good morning, team. Thanks for taking the call. So I just wanted to ask within FSDP, a couple of things there. In terms of the durability of the strength you're seeing at Fire & Rescue, are you able to parse out sort of how much of that is better chassis availability with your traditional OEMs versus your growing relationships with the mid-tier OEMs and the retrofit offerings you now have available.\nEric Ashleman: I don't know that, that particular fine-tuning is a big driver here. I would say the chassis availability and that the improving nature of it is a positive catalyst for that business, and it's something we knew when we saw that backlog extend for, frankly, a long period of time that as it would start to expand itself, we knew that would be pretty gradual but ultimately positive for us for business. The composition of who they are in terms of suppliers inside it, it's interesting around the margins, but I would say it's going to be -- put it in the category of generally positive and probably positive for all.\nVlad Bystricky: Got it, okay, that's helpful and then just a follow-up within that segment. The strength in the North American paint dispenser business, I think it was a little surprising versus what I was expecting anyway. So were there any larger onetime type deliveries in there that contributed to that strength? And how are you thinking about the outlook for the NAM dispenser business going forward?\nEric Ashleman: No. I think dispensing had a couple large project orders that they're delivering on here as they progressed in the second quarter and within the third quarter. Then I think as we passed the end of the year, the North American replenishment cycle will be, for the most part, over. And then we look for some of the opportunities to continue on the emerging market side. Europe was a little bit slower for us this year and see if there's a bit of a recovery going into next year to help offset that. But that business will start to decline, especially on the orders as we progress through the back half of the year.\nVlad Bystricky: Okay, great, that's helpful, thanks a lot, get back-in queue.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen.\nJoe Giordano: Hey, good morning guys. Eric, I just kind of wanted to square your commentary about like a lack of catalysts in a lot of the markets is interesting. And how do you kind of -- juxtapose with confidence around and optimism around chip stack and infrastructure bill and manufacturing, non-risk spending kind of like very high levels right here. How do you kind of square all that stuff?\nEric Ashleman: Well, look, I think those are all absolutely legitimate of the things we're planning on. It's what we're tuning the company to be. I'm, in some ways, helping people understand what I'm describing, we're at a position now where we can kind of see exactly the mindset of people in the current -- in the next quarter in a way that for years, we have not been able to. And so I'm with you because I think many of the kind of big broader trends that are out there are going to have nice runs as we go forward. Some of them are underway now. Some are going to be in the next period to come. But I do think there's some noise in the system where, again, people are processing a lot of their own backlog and things like that. And then it's easier to sort of link that to those trends and say, well, there it is. That's validation. I just -- this is a unique point that it's taken us a few years to get to that says, no, no, everything we see now is actually near term or talking about the world that's right in front of us. So -- and again, some of those things are playing out. We had that in the walk. We talked about water. We talked about some decent things happening in chemicals. We just talked about some of the chassis\nEric Ashleman: Availability in this building. So I don't want to diminish those in any way. But in some ways, I'm just trying to show that we've really got solid visibility here. We'll be able to see them as they inevitably start to play in and layer in at different points along the curve as we go forward.\nJoe Giordano: Yes, I think that's fair. And would you just -- would you categorize -- it seems like most companies this quarter are kind of like -- are certainly changing their commentary around like industrial distribution and things like that. It seems to be weakening and orders are getting worse. And you guys -- maybe you feel like you were just kind of there first, and this is...\nEric Ashleman: I will be in a category now. I think actually, we're in sync with distribution. We're out there with them. We're looking for new opportunities, and we already live that. We were seeing that when others weren't talking about it, which is always the frustrating part of the beginning of one of these curves for us. So I knew this year was going to have this element. It puts us to the back side of it, which then says, I think you'll see that we'll be talking about other things, other catalysts in a solid way that maybe it's going to take some time for others to kind of walk into, but that is a perfect example.\nJoe Giordano: Fair enough. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel.\nNathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Hey Nathan.\nNathan Jones: I wanted to start with just taking a finer point on some of the inventory correction. Can you quantify what you think the headwind to growth or the dollars of inventory that are coming out of the business, or coming out of your customers' businesses this year, that will obviously, if we get that destock complete this year won't repeat next year.\nEric Ashleman: No. Nat, let me take a crack at that. I think that's a reasonable amount of the current volume declines as the folks have calibrated on their months of supply pulling down. So that was really our expectation in the first quarter. As they look at their end market demand and then their inventory position had a second-tier bleed down again here in the second quarter with, I think where our order patterns and our volumes are for the balance of the year, that's holistically through. And then any volume shifts are really going to be reflective of true end market demand, really what Eric talked about is us being in sync relative to our lead times with where they've calibrated around new expectations of their volumes. So it's a reasonable portion of the pressure we've experienced so far this year.\nNathan Jones: Okay, then I'm going to ask a question on a metric that I don't think anybody out there has really talked about for the last 3 years, which is on-time delivery, because with all the supply chain challenges, everybody's on-time delivery metrics got blown up. Now that you're talking about lead times being kind of fairly back to normal, how much improvement have you seen in on-time delivery metrics? Where are they relative to where they were before COVID? And how much more improvement is left to go on that?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. So I mean that is a great question. Our on-time delivery is in really, really good shape. I mean, so think of this in the 90% plus. That's where we need to be. A huge piece of that, when you think about it, is that's measured against lead time expectations that customers have. So one of the things that's really changed here in the last couple of years is people have potentially put orders into one or two buckets, either as soon as you can do it, please, which really is there's no yardstick or they've taken the queue from businesses like ours to say, well, what's your current capability, okay, put it in my order for that level. What's important is you start to get better, you have to communicate it to your customers so they understand it. That's kind of one of the first things that we teach within our own operating model, make sure people know where we are. So that, frankly, they understand that they can start to dial that into their own requirements, we can plan a better factory that way. And so you're actually -- the improvement that I'm citing is against a moving bar that moves closer with lower lead times. So that's a really, really interesting point that we're always on the lookout for to make sure that we've kind of moved out of that world of promises to actual customer requirements. And that our lead times are in sync with those, and then the ultimate metric says prove it with the OTD number. And so we're in really, really good shape.\nWilliam Grogan: That's a really-really interesting point that we're always-on the lookout for to make sure that we kind of moved out of that world of promises to actual customer requirements and that our lead times are in sync with those and then the ultimate metrics says prove it with the OTD number. And so we're in a really-really good shape and I think for a couple of businesses where we're still struggling with. Extended lead times or on-time delivery. Those are the business is actually orders have still been fairly positive, because those behaviors, haven't been able to calibrate on their customers exact to the point Eric highlighted earlier, where we have seen all those improvements, you've seen new order rates comprised are aligned with shorter lead times.\nNathan Jones: And just one last one on the cost actions that you're taking here. I understand you guys plan for the long term here and that you're probably not going to cut too deep given that this might be a short sharp correction markets could recover next year. Can you talk about the type of costs that you're taking out and the target costs that you're not taking out?\nWilliam Grogan: Yes. I mean the first phase of cost reduction is obviously on the discretionary side, things that we've implemented broad-based across the portfolio. We talked about that last quarter, even in the businesses that weren't as impacted as [indiscernible]. They helped to mitigate some of the profit shortfalls. And the second phase has been volume-related costs. We've done a little bit of restructuring internally. That's saved some of the economics. But to your last point, fundamentally, we're leveraging 80/20 and a resource allocation model to preserve a vast majority of our growth resources, as Eric's point, I think we are going to be through this phase at some point in time next year. The investments that we're making now will drive results into the future.\nEric Ashleman: And Nathan, this is -- Bill mentioned it, but this is where 80/20 really helps us as a company. And essentially, if you think of it in its simplest form, it says, take your existing people that already work here and know the company and leveraging them as powerfully as possible, so you don't have to hire incremental head count at a time that you're pressured. And we use 80/20 to guide that. So just make sure you're at a point with maximum power and impact and you'd be surprised how much work people can do. And then you kind of get through this and that maintains the base.\nNathan Jones: Great, thanks very much for taking my questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Robert Wertheimer from Melius Research.\nRobert Wertheimer: Thanks, good morning, everybody. You've touched on this throughout the call, and I think you've been pretty clear, but if the issue is trying to figure out how channel inventory dynamics and HST relate to the rest of the business or whether there's a risk of that happening. I wonder if you could step back a little bit and talk about how the channel in HST differs from the other 2 segments? And then I assume the analytic process that you put in the kind of focus in your comments on HST is applied broadly throughout the business. So I wonder if you can just sort of help with that understanding and that risk of the channel destock.\nEric Ashleman: That was a great question that important that people understand. So everything we talked about generally in those HST markets with a massive change, those are direct relationships. So -- and they're some of the most concentrated customer sets we have. So not a lot of names, and we're very directly linked to them. So your first point where it's very different is when you go over into kind of the FMT world and even the industrial side of HST, those are typically distribution environments. Not a lot of stocking that happens there. But think of it, the more important element is there's just a lot of people. So numerous markets, lots of positions, lots of partners, and so it's just fragmented. And you just got a natural buffer there against any real swing either on the way up or the way down, you just don't typically see it that dramatically, and you've got optionality. I mean some people out there will choose to carry more inventory through all of this. They're going to make differentiated calls. But that concentrated OEM set does tend to move like a pack. And here, we've seen it move the most aggressively. Your last point was on analytics. We've always had great distribution analytics. It's a participated model. It's not this kind of stocking model where there's a curtain between us and the end markets. We're partners in this. We've known each other for a long time, and we actually need to participate in the cells. So because of that, we've got -- we've long had good analytics on inventory positions, who we're selling it to, how they're thinking about things. So that's been a staple. I'd say that the move forward to something more positive I referenced earlier, was getting even closer to the nuts and bolts of those OEM relationships where we have that direct line of sight.\nRobert Wertheimer: Perfect. That was educational. And just because I don't know, and I'm not sure you say, but what is the China mix within HST. And is that weakness in China, obviously, China is weak. I don't know if that's general economic slowdown or something industry-specific that accentuated it for you there.\nEric Ashleman: Well, it really doesn't ping for us is a China sale because we're typically selling to the North American partners or something like that. We're reading through their commentary about end placement of instruments and things.\nRobert Wertheimer: Perfect, okay. I'll stop there. Thank you.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Ashleman for closing comments.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you very much. Thanks for everybody joining today. Just a couple of summary takeaways here. I mean we said from the beginning, this was going to be a year of aggressive recalibration. That's certainly proven out. But I think this is truly the final economic phase of this pandemic. It's going to play itself out here through the balance of the year and will be done with it. And for us, that means, look, our backlog is almost back to normal. It will be here soon. Our quarterly order coverage is normal now. I don't think we've got a lot of abnormal pandemic-induced order trends that we're going to be processing and talking about, and I could not be looking more forward to that, I assure you. And then really, I'll just go back to kind of what I talked about on that last slide in the intro here. The future is going to be really, really good. We will accelerate quicker than others is whatever the next cycle is, plays out positively for us. We'll see that. We're good diagnostic there. And because of the strength and resiliency we built over the last couple of years here, we're going to perform very, very well when that happens. All of the things we talked about in terms of capital where we've deployed it, the work we've done intensively around strategy, it's going to take us up another 100 basis points in that outperformance, and I referenced that earlier, too, as we're thinking about outgrowing our core markets. And just last, I know a lot of our team members listen in on these calls. I really want to thank them for just solid, solid execution through all of it, in particular, our teams in HST. You might imagine to kind of go from as fast as you can go to slowing down in the amount of time -- the short duration there, that has been really challenging for them. And they have absolutely stood up in the way that we know IDEX employees do all over the place. So thanks for that. Have a great day. We'll talk to you soon.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Eric. Moving on to our second-quarter consolidated financial results on slide eight. All comparisons are against the second-quarter of 2022, unless otherwise stated. Orders of $766 million were down 9% overall, and down 13% organically, mainly driven by a 27% organic decrease in HST, due to timing of project orders for next-gen sequencing equipment, as well as OEM pressure across the life sciences, analytical, instrumentation, pharma and semiconductor markets. Record sales of $846 million were up 6% overall and up 3% organically. We experienced 10% organic growth within FMT, 8% organic growth within FSD and 6% organic decrease in HST. Gross margin of 44.7% decreased by 10 basis points compared with last year. This was driven by lower-volume leverage in HST, the dilutive impact of acquisitions and unfavorable mix. Partially offset by strong price-cost and favorable operational productivity across the segments. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.4%, up 90 basis points. I will discuss the drivers of adjusted EBITDA on the next slide. Our second-quarter effective tax rate was 22.4% was comparable with our prior year effective tax rate of 22.1%. Net income was $139 million, which resulted in an EPS of $1.82. Adjusted net income was $165 million with an adjusted EPS of $2.18, which was up $0.16 or 8%. Finally, cash from operations of $141 million was up 26%, primarily due to lower investments in working capital versus last year. Free cash flow for the quarter included higher CapEx and was $120 million, up 24% versus last year, coming in at 72% of adjusted net income. We drove over $20 million of inventory out of the business in the quarter through our targeted reduction efforts. And we saw inventory returns improve versus last quarter. Moving on to Slide 9, which details the drivers of our second quarter adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $22 million compared to the second quarter of 2022. Our 3% organic growth included over 4% of price, placing volumes negative for the quarter. This lower volume unfavorably impacted adjusted EBITDA by $9 million flowing through at our prior year adjusted gross margin rate. Price cost was accretive to margins, and we drove operational productivity that offset employee related inflation. The mix was unfavorable by $3 million, mainly centered in HST due to continued volume declines in our analytical instrumentation and life science components. Resource and discretionary spending was approximately flat versus last year. We have executed tight cost controls given our volume pressure, and we continue to identify reduction opportunities for the balance of the year. Reductions and variable compensation expense based on our updated outlook contributed $5 million of benefit in the quarter. These results yielded a 60% organic flow-through. Muon and KZValve acquisitions, net of the Knight divestiture and FX contributed an additional $9 million of adjusted EBITDA. Inclusive of acquisitions, divestitures and FX, we delivered 43% flow-through. Excluding the impact of variable compensation, flow-through is about 35%. With that, I'll provide a deeper look at our segment performance. In our fluid metering technology segment, we experienced strong sales performance with organic growth of 10%. But orders did contract by 4% organically, mainly driven by the slowing industrial landscape. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 340 basis points versus the second quarter of last year, driven by strong price cost performance and volume leverage. We saw our industrial day rate decline early in the second quarter remained steady at that lower level. Customers are taking a cautious view of the second half as they process a variety of economic factors that influence their demand. Our water business performed well. The North American market continues to be positive with extreme weather, necessary technology and infrastructure upgrades and improved funding, all fueling growth. Our energy markets remain mixed. Improved chassis availability is driving strength in our mobile applications and the teams continue to work down past due backlog, but lower oil prices look to slow the pace of investment in the second half of the year. In the chemical market, we saw positive results across the US, Europe and Asia, with battery markets providing additional opportunities for growth. The agricultural demand landscape remains mixed. Farm fundamentals are positive overall, and our OEM business remains strong. However, distributor inventory levels remain high, and we have not seen a material bleed down as we have progressed through the planting season. Moving to the Health & Science Technologies segment. Organic orders contracted 27% in the quarter, driven by analytical instrumentation, life science and biopharma customers' inventory destocking, timing of next-gen sequencing orders, soft semiconductor and slowing industrial demand. Sales were down 6% organically and adjusted EBITDA margins contracted by 420 basis points driven by unfavorable volume leverage and mix as well as higher employee-related costs, partially offset by strong price cost performance. As Eric noted, our Life Science and Analytical Instrumentation businesses are being impacted by customers' inventory destocking and reduced demand. This was driven by a combination of improved supply chain conditions, macroeconomic factors and lower-than-expected China demand. We expect this pressure to remain throughout the balance of the year. The semiconductor market continues to experience softness resulting from memory oversupply, as well as customers feeling the impact of the US export controls. We have exposure to multiple parts of the semiconductor value chain and expect demand will stabilize in the third quarter with recovery in the fourth quarter. Our Material Processing Technology business continues to experience softness across pharma, biopharma and nutrition markets, driven by tighter capital availability and customer hesitancy due to recession concerns. We are seeing some strength in aftermarket and positive impact from our battery market opportunities and we see some signs of improved quotation activity for these early days. Industrial markets and HST slowed in the quarter in line with FMT results. Finally, turning to our Fire & Safety Diversified Products segment. Organic orders grew by 2% versus last year, mainly driven by favorable fire and safety, and dispensing results. Organic sales growth was strong at 8% with double-digit growth in both Fire & Rescue and BAND-IT. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 300 basis points versus last year, largely driven by strong price cost performance, operational productivity, favorable volume leverage, and positive mix. The paint market remains mixed with positive North American results, offset by delays of Europe and Asia customer investments. Within our fire business, we continue to gain share with North America mid-tier and China OEMs through our integrated system strategy. Underlying truck demand remains positive and OEMs continue to improve their output. Rescue markets are stable overall with some distributors burning off excess inventory being balanced by growth in our E3 products. BAND-IT results remain positive. We continue to gain share in an otherwise flat automotive market, which is partially offset by slowing energy and industrial markets. With that, I'll provide an update for our outlook for the third quarter and the full year 2023. I'm on Slide 11. In the third quarter, we are projecting GAAP EPS to range from $1.60 to $1.65 and adjusted EPS to range from $1.84 to $1.89. Organic revenue is expected to decline 7% to 8%, and adjusted EBITDA margins are estimated to be approximately 27%. We project sequential volume declines across HST and FMT with relatively flat FSD sales. On a year-over-year basis, we expect negative mid-teen organic sales decline in HST, negative low to mid-single-digit declines in FMT and low single-digit growth in FSD. Turning to the full year. As Eric mentioned, we have reduced our full year revenue guidance in response to our softening HST second half outlook. We now expect organic revenue declines of 1% to 2%. This implies high single-digit revenue contraction in HST with low to mid-single-digit growth in FMT and FSD. At the midpoint, we have reduced our EPS guidance by $0.45 with approximately $0.60 related to lower volume and the associated leverage and unfavorable mix. We offset $0.15 of this pressure with additional cost containment actions related to targeted restructuring and lower resource investment, and variable compensation along with discretionary spend. In summary, we estimate full year organic revenue contraction of 1% to 2%, GAAP EPS of $6.80 to $6.90 and adjusted EPS of $7.90 to $8. Adjusted EBITDA margin will be approximately 27%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be about $70 million and free cash flow is expected to be 100-plus percent of adjusted net income. With that, I'll turn it back over to Eric for his closing remarks. Yes, Allison, it's Bill. I think in the third quarter, you'll see a little bit of additional pressure as volume steps down in the third quarter. And we bottomed out in the orders side here in Q2. Sales will bottom out in Q3. I think margins hit its low point, and we'll start to build back up Obviously, the additional cost actions we have taken have helped mitigate that. And then the volume leverage we'll get as we start to build back in the fourth quarter. We'll start to set our journey back to a 29%, 30% EBITDA-type margin as we progress through the recovery. Yes. No, not really. I mean, I haven't seen anything there. I mean the backdrop matters. It might prevent some folks from putting something out there because they want to let things clear and not be quite as noisy or something like that in the short term, but nothing that's really topped and said because the cycle is playing out a certain way, the funnel is now composed much different than it has been for us. No, there's still more to go. I think from absolute dollars, I think we'll continue to bleed. Inventory turns, there will be a little bit pressure just with the decreased volumes within HST, but the teams continue to track, and there's probably another $20 million to $30 million of inventory reduction here in the back half. Thanks a lot. That's a really-really interesting point that we're always-on the lookout for to make sure that we kind of moved out of that world of promises to actual customer requirements and that our lead times are in sync with those and then the ultimate metrics says prove it with the OTD number. And so we're in a really-really good shape and I think for a couple of businesses where we're still struggling with. Extended lead times or on-time delivery. Those are the business is actually orders have still been fairly positive, because those behaviors, haven't been able to calibrate on their customers exact to the point Eric highlighted earlier, where we have seen all those improvements, you've seen new order rates comprised are aligned with shorter lead times. Yes. I mean the first phase of cost reduction is obviously on the discretionary side, things that we've implemented broad-based across the portfolio. We talked about that last quarter, even in the businesses that weren't as impacted as [indiscernible]. They helped to mitigate some of the profit shortfalls. And the second phase has been volume-related costs. We've done a little bit of restructuring internally. That's saved some of the economics. But to your last point, fundamentally, we're leveraging 80/20 and a resource allocation model to preserve a vast majority of our growth resources, as Eric's point, I think we are going to be through this phase at some point in time next year. The investments that we're making now will drive results into the future."

            "name": "Eric Ashleman",
            "content": "Thank you, Allison and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6. IDEX delivered record sales and adjusted earnings per share in the second-quarter along with strong free-cash flow. Our Fluid and Metering and Fire and Safety diversified products businesses delivered exceptional performance on strong market fundamentals, both posting strong organic growth and profitability, with FMT delivering an all-time high EBITDA margin. Our Health and Science Technologies segment continue to face challenges impacted by inventory destocking in our analytical instrumentation, life sciences, biopharma and semiconductor markets. Our teams within the segment drove double-digit organic growth over the last two years, admirably executing for customers and the business in very difficult conditions. Now, on the backside of the post-pandemic recovery, our OEM partners are aggressively reducing higher inventory levels, beginning with those suppliers that have demonstrated the quickest returns to pre-pandemic lead times. Our teams are appropriately balanced as they execute targeted cost reductions to mitigate a portion of these volume declines, drive strong cash-flow overall, and continue to innovate for our customers. During our last earnings call, our revised outlook for the year assumed our industrial businesses would slow moderately in the second-half, while our HST segment would experience a modest rebound. While our view on the industrial markets has not changed, we are no longer projecting recovery in HST volumes in the second-half of the year. Our outlook is based on revised forecasts from our key customers who are reevaluating their end-market demand alongside their current inventory levels. They're considering many factors overall, including supply-chain improvements, lower-than-expected growth in China, and overall macro pressures within their market verticals. This is a complex and rapidly evolving context, which played out for us in Q2 with a 27% year-over-year organic drop in HST orders. This moderating demand profile, net of our incremental cost containment actions drives an additional $0.45 of EPS pressure at the midpoint versus our previous guide. With that, as we noted in our press release, we are revising our full-year 2023 adjusted EPS guidance to $7.90 to $8 per share. Bill will discuss the specifics in greater detail during our segment and guidance updates. In the second-quarter, we also closed on the Iridian Spectral Technologies deal we announced earlier this year, adding another market leader in custom optical filter solutions serving the space, life science and telecommunications markets. We continue to focus on driving strong operational performance regardless of business environment, delivering and innovating for our customers. We're driving speed and agility within our businesses taking out inventory and driving world-class lead times, positioning us best for growth cycles to come. We remain committed to managing through the short-term while not losing focus on critical investments in the development of our people, in capital deployment and in our differentiated technologies to enable our long-term growth path and deliver above market performance over the cycle. With that, I will turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results. Thanks, Bill. I'm on Slide 12. As we've said in the past, our IDEX leadership will not allow short-term economic fluctuations to alter our foundational objectives, delivering strong execution for our customers, building great global teams and deploying our capital with discipline. We've always invested in our best growth opportunities across our well-positioned diverse franchises. Over the last 10 years, we leveraged 80/20 to optimize business performance and fine-tune our portfolio towards faster-growing application sets. We're now adding power and next level potential to our best advantage businesses and platforms through thoughtful and aggressive capital deployment. Our Muon business, acquired last year, supports the most difficult applications within high-quality semicon, just like our businesses in Sealing Solutions and Optical Technologies. Those optics businesses also play a critical role within space broadband markets, now complemented by our most recent acquisition of Iridian Spectral Technologies. Our acquisition of KZValve opens the door for our Banjo franchise to play even deeper within fluidic handling for precision agriculture solutions. Our Nexsight business brings more software intelligence and channel assets into the water platform. Airtech opens doors within alternate energy gensets. ABEL Pumps helps customers mine deeper to find the minerals required to power the e-mobility revolution. The reality is that, IDEX products are everywhere playing close to the core of the world's most advanced technologies. Our components orientation allows for maximum tunability and flexibility to pivot resources to the fastest-growing mega trends. None of this is possible without talented people and teams who thrive in an outstanding entrepreneurial culture. This aspect is a source of competitive advantage for IDEX. We knew this was going to be a year of transition and dynamic recalibration with a course that would be hard to predict. We're managing the near term urgently and appropriately, but with an enthusiasm that recognizes the potential for great things ahead. With that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator for your questions. Hi, Mike. Yes. Well, thanks for that. So, I think if we step-back and kind of think about this traversing over the course of the year. I go back to kind of the end of Q4, that's where we went some virtually unbounded demand essentially only capacity and capability, entering the mix is a constraint. To those first signs that, okay, we're going to have to tune this thing and get it to something more sustainable long-term, more normal. So we saw that play-out initially as a lot of focus on inventory, just too much inventory all over the place. I think over-time and here especially in the second-quarter, we saw a view of -- as people start to attack that with analytics and we got a lot closer to our customers. You could see kind of the depth of it; where it was accumulated, how much it was -- how long it was going to take to burn that off, that became kind of a secondary component for us in Q2. And then I think -- I think the piece that's really played out and we saw a lot of this calibration in the second-quarter was another assessment of end-markets and where they really are on the customer's part. So, you kind of had markets clicking along kind of at the top-end of high-single-digits, I think in the pandemic, kind of moved back-down to an assumption that they would be more normal, I'd say, more mid-single digits. And I think closer now to -- in the near-term at least, balance of the year, in that low single digits, with those factors that I talked about in the open remarks. And I think probably maybe strength of China being the one that was the most pronounced and started to really pop out of the page for -- and the conversations that we had in Q2. So we sort of backed-up, took a look at those forecast, that situation, and as you can see here, essentially, cleared the deck for the rest of the year. I think we've bottomed-out from an orders perspective. We've seen kind of the levels that we're at now hold here through July. Even with all the analytics, today we have an inventory, you can see the two kind of working together. So, then I think that all of the visibility shifts to probably the real spirit of your question, which is, when does this start to get back to something that's more traditional in terms of growth rates. For us, I think, honestly, we see that past -- certainly, past the six months that are ahead of us, somewhere probably out in 2024, obviously the comparatives would get a lot easier. But I think we're still going to all have to watch. We're going to have to watch and see what's the long-term call on China. Is this a trough of a cycle there and there is ultimately an uptick? We'll be listening for that intelligence as well. The funding environment, how are people leaning into kind of approving projects and outfitting plants and things that we see in the CapEx intensive sides of our business, probably the semicon piece, that I feel the best about. I mean, that's tracked by everybody and we can kind of see -- everybody pointing to better days ahead starting in kind of -- for us, probably beginning of Q4 and certainly leading into the year. So I think the arrow up in 2024, probably still with some variable rates coming out of it and a lot more assessments that we've got to make as we go through a period that we think now it's been derisked and sort of laid out there in a way that we can all get comfortable with. Yes. And I want to emphasize that, that side of the businesses it's kind of run its course exactly the way we thought it would. So you've seen here, order rates declining, that's the normalization of backlog. I want to make it clear to everybody that you all recognize how close to normal we actually are now. So our backlog, when you net out sort of the compounded price, the aggressive price that's happened over the last couple of years and compare it to sort of pre-pandemic levels. We're basically pretty close. We're a little higher-than-normal, but we'll get there soon, certainly in the back-half of the year. So that's on the industrial side of the business. Our quarterly coverage that we have, if you're familiar with us, we typically talk about half the quarter covered, and the other half we have to go find. We're there now. And so, really now we are able to see into these markets and understand and think a lot more about the future than the past. And that's why as we kind of got -- re-examined the list of markets that don't went through. And you're seeing, I think in many ways kind of an absence of catalysts unless it's really, really tied to identifiable mega trend with a bunch of funding sources, like the water space for us. You're seeing kind of that same story of, hey, hesitancy. I wonder where things are going. A little reticence to go ask for big funding of large capital projects. So, I think we're well-positioned for what inevitably at some point will start to move-up, and I do believe that next cycle is going to be a good one. But I think here in the near-term it's still going to be kind of a story of watching the rest of the world catch-up and kind of get to the same point of calibration that we are. And then, I think it's going to be a much bigger, broader kind of macroeconomic conversation as we head into 2024, of which catalysts will be out there. The good news from an IDEX perspective is, I know you know, Mike, we do really well on the entry point, once we kind of hit this point and are ready to go, short lead times, rapid recovery out there at the tip of the spear with innovation. So, that's kind of my take on where things are now with an emphasis on how close to normal the company is actually positioned. Yes. I think the examples I cited there, particularly now that they've been augmented with some really, really strong capital deployment. It gets us closer to that 300% outperformance that we've been shooting for in terms of potential of delivery. So if, let's say, we enter a world that has kind of a 2% nominal floor, we would be expecting to drive with combination of solid price capture, innovation, and the assets that we have, something closer to that 5% level. And then, continuing to deploy capital on top of that, which then ultimately if you kind of run it through the algorithm of contribution margins and the compounding nature of what we have as a company, that sets up the double-digits earning growth that I think everybody kind of expects and is looking-forward to from an IDEX. Thank you. Good morning, Deane. Yes. Well, you're absolutely right. I mean, it's important that people understand that the typical IDEX solution here is a component, which is going into some system or device that thins out there, it goes out into the market. And then there's a whole bunch of other revenue streams that come with it, service and consumables and things -- we don't participate there. And so, we're talking primarily with people in factories and supplying and purchasing change, obviously engineering on the innovation side, but typically not the first-person that they're going to talk to you on a commercial conversation about kind of where they're seeing. So that's always been a little harder for us. It's a conversation to have. And so, you can kind of think of the way this has played out as we have kind of crawled up from the factory floor into front and center commercial conversations, mainly because of our criticality. We're in a place -- we get there where others probably don't, because of the essence of what we're making and what it does for the end device. So, I will absolutely tell you that one of the benefits of what we've come through here is we have a lot deeper relationships, we're in different conversations than we've been able to be into, and our understanding of kind of inventory positions and philosophy, it's better now than it's ever been before, because it has to be. Your second question then was related to lead times. I mean, we are in really, really in good shape and that in some ways is why you're seeing and have seen kind of the rapid degradation of order rates. When -- we did the same thing. We're thinking about taking inventory out of the system, we essentially do 80/20. You lineup dollars of supply and your secondary factor is always assurance supply, OTD and capability. When those two things come together, you essentially hammer the orderbook. So in many ways we've seen that play out probably the most aggressive, given who we are and what we do. And it's an indication of where we are from a lead-time. Our ultimate backlog position for the company, quarterly coverage of order rates is also a validation of where we are, because it's right back to very, very typical levels for us. Yes. I think you're thinking about it right. I mean the predominant driver here is the normalization of the cycle. Absolutely. It's just -- I said this -- I don't know, in these calls or the last couple of times that eventually you run into physics. There's no need to keep all this backlog around unless you're going to alter permanently the capability of the system, and nobody wants to do that. So a lot of this is playing out. If you look at our last quarter here, particularly on the industrial side, we posted double-digit organic growth, it's not necessarily indicative of the environment that's out there. That's us eating the last of the backlog in the past-due and getting our own lead times where we want to get to. As we are doing that, it's telegraphed through to the customer who is then dropping their order rates exactly the way you'd expect that they would. Underneath all of that, this allows us to, as I said before, really see, okay, what is this environment that's out in front of us, both today and tomorrow. And you're right. I don't see a lot of things in there that are overly negative. In fact, I see kind of a lot of the same behavior that we saw before this. In many ways, still some continued reluctance to make big capital purchase bets and all of those things. But to be honest, those really weren't here over the last couple of years either. So there's not a lot of negative noise that's behind that recalibration curve that's happening there. I would also say, though, there isn't a lot of tons of super positive things there as well, where people are saying, \"Well, now that this is behind us, we're ready to go on Project A, B and C.\" But I don't know that, that's actually different from where we've been. So I don't know. I hope that's helpful, but I think your opening statement is pretty close here that the major driver is a cycle playing out and that fundamentally underneath it, there's not a ton of noise in terms of what's going on market to market. Thanks Deane. I don't know that, that particular fine-tuning is a big driver here. I would say the chassis availability and that the improving nature of it is a positive catalyst for that business, and it's something we knew when we saw that backlog extend for, frankly, a long period of time that as it would start to expand itself, we knew that would be pretty gradual but ultimately positive for us for business. The composition of who they are in terms of suppliers inside it, it's interesting around the margins, but I would say it's going to be -- put it in the category of generally positive and probably positive for all. No. I think dispensing had a couple large project orders that they're delivering on here as they progressed in the second quarter and within the third quarter. Then I think as we passed the end of the year, the North American replenishment cycle will be, for the most part, over. And then we look for some of the opportunities to continue on the emerging market side. Europe was a little bit slower for us this year and see if there's a bit of a recovery going into next year to help offset that. But that business will start to decline, especially on the orders as we progress through the back half of the year. Thank you. Well, look, I think those are all absolutely legitimate of the things we're planning on. It's what we're tuning the company to be. I'm, in some ways, helping people understand what I'm describing, we're at a position now where we can kind of see exactly the mindset of people in the current -- in the next quarter in a way that for years, we have not been able to. And so I'm with you because I think many of the kind of big broader trends that are out there are going to have nice runs as we go forward. Some of them are underway now. Some are going to be in the next period to come. But I do think there's some noise in the system where, again, people are processing a lot of their own backlog and things like that. And then it's easier to sort of link that to those trends and say, well, there it is. That's validation. I just -- this is a unique point that it's taken us a few years to get to that says, no, no, everything we see now is actually near term or talking about the world that's right in front of us. So -- and again, some of those things are playing out. We had that in the walk. We talked about water. We talked about some decent things happening in chemicals. We just talked about some of the chassis Availability in this building. So I don't want to diminish those in any way. But in some ways, I'm just trying to show that we've really got solid visibility here. We'll be able to see them as they inevitably start to play in and layer in at different points along the curve as we go forward. I will be in a category now. I think actually, we're in sync with distribution. We're out there with them. We're looking for new opportunities, and we already live that. We were seeing that when others weren't talking about it, which is always the frustrating part of the beginning of one of these curves for us. So I knew this year was going to have this element. It puts us to the back side of it, which then says, I think you'll see that we'll be talking about other things, other catalysts in a solid way that maybe it's going to take some time for others to kind of walk into, but that is a perfect example. Hey Nathan. No. Nat, let me take a crack at that. I think that's a reasonable amount of the current volume declines as the folks have calibrated on their months of supply pulling down. So that was really our expectation in the first quarter. As they look at their end market demand and then their inventory position had a second-tier bleed down again here in the second quarter with, I think where our order patterns and our volumes are for the balance of the year, that's holistically through. And then any volume shifts are really going to be reflective of true end market demand, really what Eric talked about is us being in sync relative to our lead times with where they've calibrated around new expectations of their volumes. So it's a reasonable portion of the pressure we've experienced so far this year. Yes. So I mean that is a great question. Our on-time delivery is in really, really good shape. I mean, so think of this in the 90% plus. That's where we need to be. A huge piece of that, when you think about it, is that's measured against lead time expectations that customers have. So one of the things that's really changed here in the last couple of years is people have potentially put orders into one or two buckets, either as soon as you can do it, please, which really is there's no yardstick or they've taken the queue from businesses like ours to say, well, what's your current capability, okay, put it in my order for that level. What's important is you start to get better, you have to communicate it to your customers so they understand it. That's kind of one of the first things that we teach within our own operating model, make sure people know where we are. So that, frankly, they understand that they can start to dial that into their own requirements, we can plan a better factory that way. And so you're actually -- the improvement that I'm citing is against a moving bar that moves closer with lower lead times. So that's a really, really interesting point that we're always on the lookout for to make sure that we've kind of moved out of that world of promises to actual customer requirements. And that our lead times are in sync with those, and then the ultimate metric says prove it with the OTD number. And so we're in really, really good shape. And Nathan, this is -- Bill mentioned it, but this is where 80/20 really helps us as a company. And essentially, if you think of it in its simplest form, it says, take your existing people that already work here and know the company and leveraging them as powerfully as possible, so you don't have to hire incremental head count at a time that you're pressured. And we use 80/20 to guide that. So just make sure you're at a point with maximum power and impact and you'd be surprised how much work people can do. And then you kind of get through this and that maintains the base. That was a great question that important that people understand. So everything we talked about generally in those HST markets with a massive change, those are direct relationships. So -- and they're some of the most concentrated customer sets we have. So not a lot of names, and we're very directly linked to them. So your first point where it's very different is when you go over into kind of the FMT world and even the industrial side of HST, those are typically distribution environments. Not a lot of stocking that happens there. But think of it, the more important element is there's just a lot of people. So numerous markets, lots of positions, lots of partners, and so it's just fragmented. And you just got a natural buffer there against any real swing either on the way up or the way down, you just don't typically see it that dramatically, and you've got optionality. I mean some people out there will choose to carry more inventory through all of this. They're going to make differentiated calls. But that concentrated OEM set does tend to move like a pack. And here, we've seen it move the most aggressively. Your last point was on analytics. We've always had great distribution analytics. It's a participated model. It's not this kind of stocking model where there's a curtain between us and the end markets. We're partners in this. We've known each other for a long time, and we actually need to participate in the cells. So because of that, we've got -- we've long had good analytics on inventory positions, who we're selling it to, how they're thinking about things. So that's been a staple. I'd say that the move forward to something more positive I referenced earlier, was getting even closer to the nuts and bolts of those OEM relationships where we have that direct line of sight. Well, it really doesn't ping for us is a China sale because we're typically selling to the North American partners or something like that. We're reading through their commentary about end placement of instruments and things. Thanks. Thank you very much. Thanks for everybody joining today. Just a couple of summary takeaways here. I mean we said from the beginning, this was going to be a year of aggressive recalibration. That's certainly proven out. But I think this is truly the final economic phase of this pandemic. It's going to play itself out here through the balance of the year and will be done with it. And for us, that means, look, our backlog is almost back to normal. It will be here soon. Our quarterly order coverage is normal now. I don't think we've got a lot of abnormal pandemic-induced order trends that we're going to be processing and talking about, and I could not be looking more forward to that, I assure you. And then really, I'll just go back to kind of what I talked about on that last slide in the intro here. The future is going to be really, really good. We will accelerate quicker than others is whatever the next cycle is, plays out positively for us. We'll see that. We're good diagnostic there. And because of the strength and resiliency we built over the last couple of years here, we're going to perform very, very well when that happens. All of the things we talked about in terms of capital where we've deployed it, the work we've done intensively around strategy, it's going to take us up another 100 basis points in that outperformance, and I referenced that earlier, too, as we're thinking about outgrowing our core markets. And just last, I know a lot of our team members listen in on these calls. I really want to thank them for just solid, solid execution through all of it, in particular, our teams in HST. You might imagine to kind of go from as fast as you can go to slowing down in the amount of time -- the short duration there, that has been really challenging for them. And they have absolutely stood up in the way that we know IDEX employees do all over the place. So thanks for that. Have a great day. We'll talk to you soon."

And it is now my pleasure to introduce to you, Allison Lausas, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. Thank you, Allison. You may begin.\nAllison Lausas: Good morning, everyone. This is Allison Lausas, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the IDEX first quarter 2023 financial highlights.  Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the 3 months ending March 31, 2023. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today's webcast, can be accessed on our company website at idexcorp.com.  Joining me today are Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer and President; and Bill Grogan, our Chief Financial Officer. Today, we will begin with Eric providing an overview of the state of IDEX's business. Then Bill will discuss IDEX first quarter financial results and update on segment performance in the markets they serve and our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2023. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions.  If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay, beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes, by dialing the toll-free number 877-660-6853 and entering conference ID 13734462, or simply log on to our company homepage for the webcast replay.  Before we begin, a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor language in last night's press release and in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  With that, I'll now turn this call over to our CEO and President, Eric Ashleman.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you, Allison, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6. I'd like to start with some key first quarter highlights. We delivered record sales with positive organic growth across all 3 of our segments, $2.09 adjusted earnings per share and strong free cash flow. Our FMT and FSD segments performed exceptionally well, both achieving record sales and strong profitability, offsetting some pressure in our HST segment. Price/cost was positive and above IDEX historical performance.  As we look ahead to Q2 and the balance of the year, our outlook has changed. The last time we spoke, we anticipated short-term volume pressures within life sciences from inventory calibration concentrated in a few select OEM customers. However, as we progressed through the quarter, we saw signals of a broader, more prolonged recalibration within our HST segment, largely centered in our analytical instrumentation, life science, pharma and semiconductor markets. End-market demand is still positive, but we believe our customers have sufficient inventory of our critical components to support their needs in the near term.  Over the past 2 years, we experienced robust growth in HST, with sales up over 30% organically to support strong end-user demand and customer-specific inventory replenishment. But as supply chain conditions improve and the broader demand profile normalizes, our OEM partners are aggressively attacking higher inventory levels, beginning with those suppliers that have demonstrated the quickest returns to pre-pandemic lead times. The sharp and simultaneous nature of this inventory recalibration exceeds all prior historical cycles.  In response, we proactively executed cost reductions to offset a portion of this volume impact. We tailored our approach to the specific challenges in individual businesses as well as broader discretionary costs across the entire company, managing through the short term but not losing focus on our longer-term growth path.  These top line challenges, net of our cost-containment plan, drive $0.25 of adjusted EPS headwind for the year. Therefore, as we noted in our press release, we revised our full year adjusted 2023 EPS guidance from $8.25 to $8.55. Bill will discuss the specifics in greater detail during our segment and guidance updates.  Regardless of these end-market challenges, we remain confident in our ability to deliver total shareholder returns over the long term. Our capital deployment plan remains consistent. We continue to look to M&A as a significant source of value creation. To that end, we announced our intent to acquire Iridian Spectral Technologies for CAD 150 million or approximately USD 111 million.  Iridian is a world leader in custom optical filter solutions serving the space, life science and telecommunications markets. Iridian expects fiscal 2023 revenues of CAD 36 million and EBITDA margin in the low-30s range. It is about a 13x EBITDA-trailing deal. And within the IDEX family of businesses, Iridian complements and expands upon the solutions provided by our Scientific Fluidics and Optics businesses within HST. This transaction is expected to close in the second quarter. Iridian will be our sixth acquisition since the beginning of 2021, and we remain bullish on our ability to deploy capital on high-quality assets irrespective of the macro conditions.  The integration of our Muon Group acquisition, which closed in fourth quarter 2022, is progressing well. We've deployed key elements of our operating model, and there continues to be a strong cultural fit between IDEX and Muon as our teams work together to unlock value between our businesses.  Finally, I traveled last week to India to officially open our second plant in the state of Gujarat. It is a world-class facility that effectively doubles our production capacity in the country. Coupled with the opening of our plant expansion in China in late 2022 and our recent commissioning of sales and logistics centers in Singapore and Dubai, we now have a strengthened footprint to attack markets across Asia and the Middle East, a key element of our growth strategy.  With that, I'll turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results.\nWilliam Grogan: Thanks, Eric. Moving on to our first quarter consolidated financial results on Slide 8. All comparisons are against first quarter 2022, unless otherwise stated.  Orders of $826 million were down 4% overall and down 10% organically, mainly driven by the timing of project orders for dispensing in FSD and next-gen sequencing in HST as well as OEM pressure across the life sciences, analytical instrumentation, pharma and semiconductor markets in HST.  Record sales of $845 million were up 13% overall and up 6% organically. We experienced 9% organic growth within our FMT and FSD segments and 3% growth in HST. Gross margin of 45.2% contracted by 40 basis points. This was driven by unfavorable mix, largely centered in HST, the dilutive impact of acquisitions and employee-related inflation, partially offset by favorable price cost and productivity.  Adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes $6 million related to accelerated recognition of share-based compensation, was 27.2%, down 140 basis points. I'll discuss the remaining drivers of adjusted EBITDA on the next slide.  Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.2% and was relatively flat compared with our prior effective tax rate of 22.4%. Net income was $140 million, which resulted in EPS of $1.84. Adjusted net income was $159 million with adjusted EPS of $2.09, which was up $0.13 or 7%. The accelerated recognition of share-based compensation that I mentioned earlier lowered adjusted EPS by $0.06. Finally, cash from operations was $148 million and up 86%, primarily due to lower investments in working capital versus last year. Free cash flow for the quarter, which included higher year-over-year capital investment, was $121 million, up 91% versus last year and coming in at 76% of adjusted net income. This represents the strongest first quarter free cash conversion we have experienced in the past 5 years.  Moving on to Slide 9, which details the drivers of our first quarter adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased $15 million compared to the first quarter of 2022. Our 6% organic growth contributed approximately $6 million flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. Price/cost was accretive to margins, and we drove operational productivity that more than offset employee-related inflation. Mix was unfavorable by $3 million, mainly centered in HST due to volume declines in our analytical instrumentation and life science components businesses.  Resource and discretionary spending increased by $8 million. As we noted in our prior guidance, this was carryover from last year. In 2022, we did not return to a sustainable level of discretionary spending until the second quarter. Equally, we ramped up our resource investment spend as we progress through the year. This will come down as part of our cost mitigation plan for the balance of the year.  We had $6 million related to accelerated recognition of share-based compensation due to the timing of certain participants reaching retirement eligibility status. These results yielded a 5% organic flow through. Excluding the impact of accelerated share-based compensation, our organic flow-through was around 20%.  Nexsight, KZValve and Muon acquisitions, net of the Knight divestiture and FX, contributed an additional $13 million of adjusted EBITDA. Inclusive of acquisitions, divestitures and FX, we delivered 16% flow-through. Excluding the impact of accelerated share-based compensation, we delivered 22% flow-through. With that, I'll provide a deeper outlook for our segment performance.  I'm on Page 10. In our Fluid & Metering technology segment, we experienced strong order and sales performance with organic growth of 5% and 9%, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 50 basis points versus last year, driven by strong price/cost, volume leverage and productivity, which more than offset higher employee-related costs and discretionary spending as well as the dilutive impact of acquisitions.  Industrial demand remained steady throughout the quarter. We experienced tailwinds from energy, mining, chemical and lithium-ion battery markets. Our water businesses performed well. Quote activity remained strong due to U.S. infrastructure funding initiatives, and we see continued momentum around the adoption of AI and cloud technologies.  Our energy markets continue to be strong, driven by favorable oil export and mobile truck demand. In the chemical market, we are experiencing wins in the energy transition space as well as strong China and Middle East demand.  The agricultural demand landscape is mixed. Farm fundamentals are positive with stable commodity prices and net farm incomes as well as lower fertilizer costs versus last year. However, distribution inventory levels were higher than typical coming into the planting season, and a slower start to the season due to weather has delayed the turnover of this inventory.  Moving on to the Health & Science Technologies segment. Organic orders contracted 23%, driven by the OEM inventory calibration impact as well as timing of a large next-gen sequencing order we received in the first quarter of last year. As Eric noted, our life science and analytical instrumentation businesses are being impacted by broad-based inventory destocking as our customers recalibrate to a more normalized demand pattern. We expect that these markets will continue to see this pressure through the second quarter with some recovery in the back half of the year.  The semiconductor market is experiencing softness resulting from memory oversupply as well as customers feeling the impact of U.S. export controls. We anticipate that macro conditions will improve as we progress through the remainder of the year. We do continue to leverage share gain to buffer some of the broader market declines.  Our material processing technology business is seeing softness across pharma, biopharma and nutrition markets, driven by tighter capital availability and customer hesitancy due to recession concerns. Our funnel does remain strong, and we expect some recovery in the second half of the year. The automotive market remains positive. We continue to see a solid global trend towards electrification driving opportunities for our growth.  We delivered 3% organic sales growth in the first quarter, driven by strong next-gen sequencing, satellite broadband and fuel cell-targeted growth initiatives with some offset from the market factors I mentioned earlier. Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted by 300 basis points versus the first quarter of 2022. Most of this pressure is in the gross margin line, with unfavorable volume leverage and mix more than offsetting favorable price/cost. The recent Muon acquisition is accretive to HST's overall EBITDA margin.  Finally, turning to our Fire & Safety Diversified Products segment. Organic orders contracted by 4%, mainly driven by timing of project orders in our dispensing business last year. Organic sales results were strong at 9% growth, with double-digit growth in both Fire & Rescue and BAND-IT offsetting the decline in dispensing.  Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 160 basis points versus last year, largely driven by strong price cost performance, volume leverage and productivity more than offsetting higher discretionary spend and employee-related costs. The paint market is mixed, with pressure from the North American replenishment cycle coming to an end and softness in Southeast Asia being offset with strong European and Indian demand.  Within our Fire business, demand for trucks remains strong. North American OEM volumes continue to be constrained by supply chain. However, we are gaining share with North American mid-tier and China OEMs with our integrated system strategy and have pivoted our go-to-market approach for our SAM product to retrofit in-service trucks to bypass the OEM backlog constraints.  Our rescue markets are stable, and we have experienced favorable demand in Europe and good project activity across most of the globe. BAND-IT results continue to be positive. Industrial demand is steady, energy is strong, and we continue to drive higher than market performance in automotive due to our position on high-demand vehicles and share gain. With that, I'll give an update on our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2023.  I'm on Slide 11. I'll now provide some additional details regarding our revised 2023 guidance for both the second quarter and the full year. In Q2, we are projecting GAAP EPS to range from $1.86 to $1.89 and adjusted EPS to range from $2.10 to $2.13, with organic revenue growth of approximately 3% and adjusted EBITDA margins ranging from 27.3% to 27.7%. We anticipate that HST volumes will be negative in the second quarter, and the strength we saw in Q1 industrial performance sustains.  Turning to the full year. As Eric mentioned, we have reduced our full year revenue guidance, reflecting headwinds related to OEM destocking across the HST segment. At the midpoint, we expect volume and mix impact reduces EPS by $0.48, offset by $0.23 of cost actions, yielding $0.25 of net pressure on our annual guide. This equates to a full year low single-digit organic revenue contraction in HST and low- to mid-single-digit growth in FMT and FSD. Our view on the industrial market has not changed, and we continue to assume a second half decline with a modest recovery in the back half for HST.  Bringing it all together, we project GAAP EPS of $7.30 to $7.60 and adjusted EPS to range from $8.25 to $8.55. We expect full year organic revenue growth of 0% to 3% and adjusted EBITDA margin to range between 27.5% and 27.9%. The high end of our range implies that we will sustain our record profitability from last year. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be about $70 million, and free cash flow is expected to be 100-plus percent of adjusted net income.  With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Just starting with the HST story here. And look, we're seeing this across the sector. We covered Danaher. They've been through this, this whole kind of you're on the other side of the COVID surge in volume. And Dover's biopharma pumps, same story there as well. So it's not execution. We know that. It's not share loss. But what's your degree of confidence in the path to normalizing? Just what kind of visibility do you have here?\nEric Ashleman: Well, thanks, Deane. I mean I'd say a couple of things. One, as you'd expect, given the magnitude of some of the swings, I mean, the discussions and the intensity and the iteration of them with end customers and at all levels, commercial operations is probably at the highest level we've ever had.  And then I would say, as you look at the actual order intake, you can see some things firming up in the back half. So you can see actually kind of the same planning and methods that are pulling it down now are actually repositioning it a little further out in the later -- in the year, sorry.  And you're seeing that for the kind of standard products that we would usually gauge, that are kind of right down the middle of the volume fairway. So that's -- it deviates a little bit market for market, but I'd say, those 2 factors are probably the 2 that we're most reliant on as we think about that.\nWilliam Grogan: And I'd just add is our guide. On the low end, we have kind of that HST recovery only up about 1% sequentially from the first half to the second half. And then on the high side, a 7%. So reasonable range relative to the things that Eric just highlighted.\nDeane Dray: All right. That makes sense. I appreciate that. And then second question, and Eric, maybe you can bridge the comments from last quarter about uncertain period of softness, how that's being playing out here as well as the trends you're seeing across your short-cycle businesses, the implications, day rates, lead times and so forth.\nEric Ashleman: So are you saying, Deane, kind of take it from a little bit more depth...\nDeane Dray: Yes.\nEric Ashleman: On the HST and then rotate it over -- okay.\nDeane Dray: No, no, no. Just broadly for IDEX, your comment last quarter about uncertain period of softness. We're all seeing pockets of softness, but I wanted to see with a quarter through now, what trends you're seeing in the short cycle, is there...\nEric Ashleman: Got it.\nDeane Dray: In lead times and so forth, thanks.\nEric Ashleman: Yes. So obviously, the most pronounced recalibration happening exactly in the area that we're talking about here in HST. As you look at the industrial side of it and in particular, kind of the day rate stuff right down the center of our fairway, first quarter held up really, really well. I mean business to business, I think we called out ag is the only one where we saw some similar dynamics of kind of inventory and things ready to go to plan.  I will say though, in more recent data here in April, some of those canaries that we often reference, you can see things pull back a little bit, and you can see them doing it together. So it is going to be something we'll watch. April is, for whatever reasons, never a real strong predictor for us. It firms up as we go through May and especially into June. But I will say you can see a little bit of that there in those businesses. In terms of just day rates, it's not a big drop, but the uniformity of it is interesting across a couple of weeks here most recently.  And when you kind of hold that up with some other things, some of which we do informally and others have done more formally around inventory positions of distributors and things like that, maybe you can see sort of the same comments, hold that up with the same feelings of uncertainty. So it's not a logic break in terms of how this might play out.  And let's remember, in our comments here last time, I mean, we actually have this positioned in our back half. So we have a bit of a glide path and then here, very recently, seeing some of the first signs of it.\nDeane Dray: That's really helpful. Just to clarify, when you talk about the leading indicator canaries, that's like BAND-IT and Warren Rupp and Gast?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. And a couple of the other FMT pump businesses and even more specifically, a couple of product lines we look at within and where we just know they tend to be ordered typically, 1 and 2 and 3, general replacement. The ones you mentioned, a few other places, but yes, they're the ones we often always look at when we talk to you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Michael Halloran with Baird.\nMichael Halloran: Can we follow up on Deane's question and talk about the other side of the coin, just maybe the CapEx side of things? Are you seeing any pullbacks? Obviously ignore some of the destock HST stuff you already commented on. But on some of the other longer cycle pieces, are you seeing any change in dynamic? Or anything noteworthy underneath the hood?\nEric Ashleman: Well, it's -- these are the larger projects that we sometimes talk about here. I mean we have them in 2 places, and they're a little different. So I think they're more pronounced, more aggressive on the HST side in the markets that we're referencing here. So you can see some concern in places like MPT. We referenced those in the comments. But let's tie those to that sort of general macro story that Deane did a good job framing for us.  I think on the industrial side, I would just kind of come back and say, this -- the entirety of the cycle, it's not been a big piece of our story. I'll remind folks, in the beginning of the ramp-up post COVID, there was a lot of uncertainty there. Frankly, that turned into the inability to put those projects together, then as inflation came about, there was a repricing element that sort of prevented some of them from our side.  And now maybe we're drifting a bit more into uncertainty, too. So I'd argue it kind of held pretty [Technical Difficulty] quite positive for us, not really because of large projects, just that sort of general day-to-day business is doing real well.\nMichael Halloran: And apologies in advance for this one. I think Bill gave some commentary on expectations by the segments for the remainder of the year. Unfortunately, you guys were breaking up on me. Could you just repeat that in case I misheard? Or maybe I'm wrong, maybe you guys didn't do that, but can you comment on that?\nWilliam Grogan: No, no. We did. In our updated guide, the implied organic revenue for HST is negative low single digits, and for FMT and FSD, positive low single digits.\nMichael Halloran: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess just a quick follow-up on that then. On the FMT piece, the orders are good. I think the end markets there are probably a little bit healthier broadly. Why the decel as you work through the year on that piece specifically? Is there anything you're seeing that's concerning? Or is it just how you think things layer out as we look forward?\nWilliam Grogan: No. Exactly. I mean, it's been our stance as we came into the year with an expectation that the industrials were going to start to fall off in the back half of the year. We saw strength in the first quarter. We knew what our backlog positions were. And Eric just highlighted some of the caution we're seeing in our daily book and ship order rates that I think just give us more confidence in our call that the back half will be softer for those businesses, down a couple of percent on the volume side as we progress over the next quarter or 2 -- post the second quarter, still positive there, yes.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak: Keeping on FMT, can you touch on the acquisitions, KZValve and Nexsight, because it seems like they were exceptionally strong? Just want to better understand maybe the drivers there and sort of how we should think about those for the balance of the year.\nEric Ashleman: Yes. I mean, holding up really, really well. KZ, just to remind people, brought a key piece of automation technology that, frankly, goes to the same customer set that we have in our Banjo business. They're very close by. So I mean this is a [Technical Difficulty]. And so we're working on the commercial side, the technical side and all of the pieces of the IDEX operating model. So really, really happy there.  The Nexsight business, reminder, there was -- they were kind of long channel partners, and there's a piece of software that came with that business we've long used as well. So many people have kind of associated this with IDEX for a number of years. So pretty seamless integration, expands our presence in depth. And then the water markets, as we referenced in the earlier comments and we'll say here, are doing well. There's good strong support for municipal projects, municipal work that I think will play out for quite a while. So yes, real favorable with those 2.\nWilliam Grogan: Yes. And KZ, their mix of business is much more concentrated towards OEM. So they're not seeing some of the inventory issues that Banjo is.\nEric Ashleman: Yes.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. And then just on the HST side, again, I know you're looking for maybe that second half recovery from those inventory issues. But as we think about sort of that back half and then maybe even into '24, does that sort of drive that growth somewhat below trend of what you would expect kind of going forward at least over the next 12 months? Just any thoughts there.\nEric Ashleman: I don't think so. I think largely, this is a story of coming off of a multi-period of really aggressive rates, both for us and our end customers. I mean I look at our segment. I mean HST was up 30% across 2 years. I think that tracks with a lot of the end markets where we are. And so a retraction or a pullback down to more typical rates in the single digits. Even if they're mid-single digits, it's pretty dramatic if, in fact, your thinking is changing in a relatively short time horizon.  So I think the single biggest variable for -- certainly for us as a component supplier into it is going to be levels of inventory [Technical Difficulty] taking it into different areas. So it's -- in some ways, it's doing math. It's math and rate of travel. It is different than we've seen before, but the preceding period in the run-up there was different as well. So I think we're all learning to do that together. And as I spoke earlier on the call, the need for even tighter alignment and iteration as we go through that to protect everybody is very important.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.\nNathan Jones: A couple of questions on HST. I was just wanted to hit the margins, down 300 basis points year-over-year in the first quarter. I think, Bill, you said -- you talked about lower absorption, but revenues were up 3% organically. Can you maybe just flesh out a little bit the inputs into the year-over-year margin decline in HST?\nWilliam Grogan: Yes. I think the biggest driver, Nathan, is the mix impact. Some of the volume decreases we've seen are our highest margin product portfolio in the business that has somewhat offset that to keep the business positive from an organic perspective. And then with the overall segment being positive, there are still some pockets that were negative that caused us to deleverage on some of the fixed cost side.\nNathan Jones: Okay. That makes sense. And then just maybe a little bit more color on how you expect the year to sequence on HST. I mean you had in the 20s of orders down. Just maybe any color you can give us on how we should think about the comps, I guess, especially in 2Q, with this being a relatively short-cycle business. Do you take most of the pain here on organic growth in the second quarter, and then you see revenues improve pretty meaningfully, sequentially as we go past that?\nWilliam Grogan: No, no, relative to our backlog position. We will be negative in HST in the second quarter, but kind of low single digits. And then remember, the second half of this year is significant -- or the second half of last year was significantly higher. So we'll have a little bit of comp problems that will keep HST either flattish or slightly negative for the balance of the year.\nNathan Jones: And then just one last one on HST. IDEX is not typically an inventory business. You end up typically seeing a lot of inventory on customer shelves. Obviously, an inventory destock is what we're talking about. And so can you just talk about how this inventory ends up on customer shelves, how that works its way through the system?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. No, it's a great question, Nathan. I mean in general, everything we make here is pretty customized for a very specific end use, if not a specific single customer. And in the area that we're talking about in the health science world, I mean, that absolutely happens. These are spec-ed in components. They don't travel East and West.  When we're more generally talking about an IDEX, though, FMT in that segment, FSD as well, you've got a channel between us and all of these fragmented end markets, which are at much lower volumes. And so no single one of them is going to tend to raise its head up at any one point. So that -- the comment generally holds there.  And while it's specific customized here, this is a highly concentrated customer set, and it's a super direct transaction. So if you chose to do it, and they don't often do it and this is a bit unprecedented, but if you chose to do it that way, you could put mission-critical components down that you know you're going to use because they're the most high-running parts that you have in the system, even though they are absolutely customized for that customer only.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Vlad Bystricky with Citigroup.\nVladimir Bystricky: So I just wanted to ask you, in FMT, I think you, if I'm not mistaken, kind of upgraded your commentary around the strength of the energy and chemical performance you're seeing. I know you mentioned it's not really project activity. So can you just talk a little bit more about where you're seeing improvements in demand in those end markets, and how you're thinking about sort of the sustainability of that strengthening?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. Well, I think in energy specific, remember that we largely do mobile custody transfer there. So there's a little bit of an overhang as the industry gets healthier and price support are out there. You're going to get some general tailwinds for CapEx spend. More specifically for us, though, we do a lot in mobile applications, a lot of which depends upon chassis availability.  That's been -- that was highly constrained for a couple of years. That's freed up as a lot of other supply chains have, and some of it is just captive demand at a good and favorable time in the environment, that -- something like that, a micro story like that actually matters for us.  On the chemical side, we've seen strength in China, specifically, with our Richter business. I think some of that is probably also related to the fact the country was kind of locked down for a while. There are some investments that have to be made. We're super well positioned there. We'll see how that plays out longer term. And actually, Europe in the chemical side, which is an area of concern and was pretty depressed as well for a bunch of reasons we've talked about, that was actually pretty strong for us as well.  So it's these little pockets that kind of play out in typical IDEX fashion that goes from big to small stories here. But I would say, generally, we're still following others out there that are larger. So not a massive component of project spend or multi-period expansion here, but more micro events and things. And otherwise, markets, I think, are doing pretty well.\nWilliam Grogan: And I think the other thing is on the Energy business, they've launched a couple of new products that have been very well received in the end marketplace. And then we talk about businesses that they had some differentiation relative to their ability to have inventory to supply their customer base. I think a couple of businesses within our valve that mostly sell into the chemical market have been well positioned relative to the inventory that they've carried to take some share from their customers.\nVladimir Bystricky: Okay. That's really helpful. And then just on the M&A front, can you give us some more color on the Spectral tech acquisition? I know it's relatively small, but can you just talk about what attracted you to that particular asset, potential scalability of the business? And more broadly, what you're seeing in the M&A pipeline and environment today?\nEric Ashleman: Yes, sure. So the -- I mean the Iridian business, I mean, it's -- as we said in the release, it's a leading designer and manufacturer of thin film, multilayer optical filters. We do that in a lot of other places within IDEX, both in our optical technologies segment and some of it embedded into the life sciences platforms as well.  So I think honestly, the size of this business is pretty typical for how we specialize technology of this type, it's kind of an ideal unit of measure, if you will. So think of it as a puzzle piece of technology that goes well with other pieces that we have. And honestly, the 3 primary segments here, we attack from a whole bunch of different places in IDEX, not all of them, just in optics and technology. So space broadband, super complementary to some other things we've talked about along the way in a great market.  The life sciences place side of it is probably intuitive. I mean we do other coatings here. Their technology is a little bit different. And so it fits in, in a way that we were -- we've been looking for, for a while. And then there's a telecom piece that's involved with 5G rollout and game filters and things like that. So it's the kind of work we know how to do. The other piece of this is their coding capacity then, when aligned with other pockets of coding capacity we have across IDEX, you can start to think of this as an aggregation and think of how you might move capacity around on what's now becoming quite a bit of mass and a very important job to do.  So it's a just really, really nice fit. We've known a lot of the folks associated with businesses like this for a number of years. So it's right in our universe, proprietary transactions. Super happy to have it here.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.\nJeffrey Sprague: I just wanted to come back to Nexsight and KZ. I think you responded to a prior question that they're strong. It's -- they look amazingly strong, right? I think an 11-point impact in FMT or acquisition impact in the quarter. Was there something unusual going on or some reclassification or something to drive that big of a result in those businesses?\nWilliam Grogan: No. I mean the only thing of note, it was small, it was a couple of million dollars. Just as we got Nexsight on our normal accounting procedure, they picked up a couple of weeks of incremental revenue, but it was a $2 million, $3 million type of deal.\nJeffrey Sprague: Okay. Great. I think I'll leave it there. My other questions were answered.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.\nEric Ashleman: Matt?\nOperator: Matt, your line is now live.\nWilliam Jellison: This is Will Jellison on for Matt Summerville. I wanted to learn a little bit more about price and maybe start out with some historical context for how much price was realized in 2022 and how much incremental realization is expected across your businesses in 2023.\nEric Ashleman: Yes, sure. So price is a big part of our value capture across our portfolio balancing, hey, we have differentiated products and making sure we capture that value from our customers. Obviously, last year, from an inflationary perspective, we were hitting an all-time high. So we had ramped our price pretty significantly as we went through, I think, topping off close to 5% last year.  This year, we guided about 4%. We're on track for that. That's a combination of new price increases that we've launched here throughout the first quarter and then carryover pricing from actions we took throughout last year.\nWilliam Jellison: That's great. And then as a follow-up, I wanted to get an update on Muon. What is the expectation for organic growth in that business for 2023? And about how much adjusted EPS contribution is contributing to the guide for the year?\nWilliam Grogan: Sure. I mean we haven't disclosed exactly other than it's at -- it will be at the high end of HST growth on a normalized basis. Before we bought them, they had been a double-digit compounder. So really successful with their growth trajectory historically, and we continue to see that here as they progress in the high single digits.  From an EPS perspective, I'd refer you to our annual guide. We didn't break out the individual pieces, but I think incrementally this year, we said $0.43 for Muon, the carryover for Nexsight and KZ, net of the divestiture of Knight.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Mizuho.\nBrett Linzey: I wanted to come back to HST. So the order's down 23%. Are you able to parse out how much of that decline was specific to the OEM destock versus maybe some softening in other areas of the portfolio?\nWilliam Grogan: Brett, I apologize. Can you repeat that question? You broke up on us.\nBrett Linzey: Yes, sure. So the first one is on HST. So order's down 23%. Wondering if you're able to parse out how much of that decline was specific to the OEM destock versus softening in other areas of that business?\nWilliam Grogan: [Technical Difficulty] million on the onetime order or the blanket that we received last year. So that was a couple of percent of the 23%. The balance is a lot of the market factors that Eric highlighted.\nBrett Linzey: Okay. Got it. And just one other one. You talked about some of the barometer businesses pulling back a little bit. How does that shape your thinking around incremental restructuring or further curtailment of some of this discretionary? Do you lean into additional actions here to defend the margins? Just curious what the business planning assumption is.\nEric Ashleman: Yes. Look, I think so far, it's very in line with what we had played out in our -- for the year, the planning for it. So remember, we the softening in the back half on the industrial side. We're saying here, this might be some early indications that it will come to fruition. And so in those businesses, we've already made and lined up the discretionary cost reductions and some thought and care around any additions we might make in a way that's completely in line with what we had originally said.  The targeted actions that we spoke about related to the HST destocking phenomenon, those are pretty targeted actions within those businesses. So this is where the -- if you will, the portfolio nature of IDEX really helps us. We can treat these in kind of a differentiated way and occasionally come together on just smart investments around travel and other discretionary things and just do it well as a team.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with TD Cowen.\nJoseph Giordano: Sorry, I had muted myself. Can you guys hear me?\nWilliam Grogan: Yes.\nJoseph Giordano: Okay. Cool. So Nathan had talked about this in his question, but I wanted to follow up there on the inventory thing in HST. Yes, you guys are not typically like components that are overstocked at OEM. So just -- was this a change in behavior like where OEM just acted differently because like unbeknownst to you where they were just buying in excess of their need for a long time, and maybe like maybe that level of granularity is not clear to IDEX? And so that's one.  And then you guys are generally a company that learns pretty quickly. So what do you do differently coming out of this? Or do discussions have to change? Or how do you kind of make sure that's something like this don't catch you off guard again?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. No, it's a good question. I mean look, if you kind of get it right down to the way that inventory replenishment is done, obviously, your future projections and your assumptions around lead time drive almost all of your requirements. And so in hindsight, now you can view this and think, well, there must have been irrationality there, but I don't think that's actually the case. I think if you are projecting a line in a certain way, and you've been experiencing delivery patterns, not just for us, but for others at a certain level, it's going to say, you need a lot of stuff.  I think part of what's changed here and maybe changed most dramatically is you have kind of a simultaneous -- well, first of all, the calendar change, funny as it sounds, that always tends to bring a different headset. And I think there's some legitimate things out there kind of from a macro perspective that people are wondering about. We're further away from COVID. We're starting to see some pullback in biopharma spending. We have some funding crisis associated with start-ups and things in biopharma places.  So the minute you interject that back into the equation, you potentially go change your assumption on long-term demand, it actually has a pretty striking effect on what you should be bringing in. Now you combine that with the fact that we execute really well, so our lead times and our customer set, returning quickly back to normal, you put those 2 things together, even an automated system is going to say, \"Hey, you've probably got too much here.\"  So back to your point on learnings and things like that. First of all, we're not typically seeing cycles of this magnitude, these kind of swings. But to be fair, maybe in the world to come as we see, and it seems like there's always another chapter around the corner. So I do take your point. And I think higher iteration, really coming together and understanding long-term projections being maybe potentially more transparent with where we are in terms of lead time performance, customer set, making sure that, that's exactly understood not just today, but tomorrow as we move through cycles and swings like this, I think those would be the kind of things that our teams are talking about at both the commercial and the operational level.\nJoseph Giordano: No, that's fair. And then just last for me on the FMT side. I mean you talked about April weakening, and I know that your guidance assumes that industrials get worse in the back half of the year. But is the April weakening here kind of like in line in terms of magnitude with what you're contemplating at this point? Like nothing is -- if this was -- did you expect it to start now? Like how consistent is what you're seeing with what you previously thought?\nEric Ashleman: Yes, I mean, I think this is about the pattern that you would expect at some point. I would say, look, this is pretty recent. April, as I said, is often a kind of an interesting month of transition as you move into the spring. So we'll see.  But we're always looking for a slight step down one way or the other, and then uniformity. Because I think that's where, again, the portfolio nature of IDEX comes into play. We're able to kind of see it across a variety of end markets simultaneously, all of which have kind of the same sort of short order fulfillment patterns that have long been known to people.  So when they tend to move in concert with each other, either positively or negatively, it's at least worth looking at and taking a signal. I would say this is a small drop. It is uniform in nature, but that is exactly what we would have probably expected and I think is modeled in ultimately in the back end. And we'll obviously continue to monitor it and talk to you and others about it as we get -- roll through and finish the second quarter.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. And now I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks so much. I apologize, I know we've had some glitches with the technology. Maybe we'll need to put more filters to work on telecommunications.  First of all, I want to thank the IDEX employees. I know there's always some listening in on the call. Very, very strong quarter. You've continued to really perform for the business and for our customers. Thanks to others on the call for your interest and support in the company.  Bottom line here, we knew 2023 was going to be a year of recalibration moving from one state of the world to another. It's playing out more dynamically than we initially suspected in the HST side. But as you can see, we're executing through it. We're taking the appropriate responses in the business.  And I think most importantly, we ultimately believe in the long-term success and outgrowth in those markets. We're talking about coming down from highs to something that's actually pretty typical, but absolutely advantaged. We think it's going to continue that way and then accelerate for years to come.  So through all of these dynamic swings over the last 3 years, I'm really proud of the fact that we've executed well, and we certainly stepped up our capital deployment, really happy to announce the sixth transaction since the beginning of '21 with Iridian, doubled our emerging markets footprint and capability set and continue to strengthen a really unique culture as we've done it.  So we're built for the long haul here. We're confident that we're going to perform and deliver value throughout. And I look forward to updating everybody along the way as the -- in the year to come and the years in the future play out for IDEX. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.",

            "name": "William Grogan",
            "content": "Thanks, Eric. Moving on to our first quarter consolidated financial results on Slide 8. All comparisons are against first quarter 2022, unless otherwise stated.  Orders of $826 million were down 4% overall and down 10% organically, mainly driven by the timing of project orders for dispensing in FSD and next-gen sequencing in HST as well as OEM pressure across the life sciences, analytical instrumentation, pharma and semiconductor markets in HST.  Record sales of $845 million were up 13% overall and up 6% organically. We experienced 9% organic growth within our FMT and FSD segments and 3% growth in HST. Gross margin of 45.2% contracted by 40 basis points. This was driven by unfavorable mix, largely centered in HST, the dilutive impact of acquisitions and employee-related inflation, partially offset by favorable price cost and productivity.  Adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes $6 million related to accelerated recognition of share-based compensation, was 27.2%, down 140 basis points. I'll discuss the remaining drivers of adjusted EBITDA on the next slide.  Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.2% and was relatively flat compared with our prior effective tax rate of 22.4%. Net income was $140 million, which resulted in EPS of $1.84. Adjusted net income was $159 million with adjusted EPS of $2.09, which was up $0.13 or 7%. The accelerated recognition of share-based compensation that I mentioned earlier lowered adjusted EPS by $0.06. Finally, cash from operations was $148 million and up 86%, primarily due to lower investments in working capital versus last year. Free cash flow for the quarter, which included higher year-over-year capital investment, was $121 million, up 91% versus last year and coming in at 76% of adjusted net income. This represents the strongest first quarter free cash conversion we have experienced in the past 5 years.  Moving on to Slide 9, which details the drivers of our first quarter adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased $15 million compared to the first quarter of 2022. Our 6% organic growth contributed approximately $6 million flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. Price/cost was accretive to margins, and we drove operational productivity that more than offset employee-related inflation. Mix was unfavorable by $3 million, mainly centered in HST due to volume declines in our analytical instrumentation and life science components businesses.  Resource and discretionary spending increased by $8 million. As we noted in our prior guidance, this was carryover from last year. In 2022, we did not return to a sustainable level of discretionary spending until the second quarter. Equally, we ramped up our resource investment spend as we progress through the year. This will come down as part of our cost mitigation plan for the balance of the year.  We had $6 million related to accelerated recognition of share-based compensation due to the timing of certain participants reaching retirement eligibility status. These results yielded a 5% organic flow through. Excluding the impact of accelerated share-based compensation, our organic flow-through was around 20%.  Nexsight, KZValve and Muon acquisitions, net of the Knight divestiture and FX, contributed an additional $13 million of adjusted EBITDA. Inclusive of acquisitions, divestitures and FX, we delivered 16% flow-through. Excluding the impact of accelerated share-based compensation, we delivered 22% flow-through. With that, I'll provide a deeper outlook for our segment performance.  I'm on Page 10. In our Fluid & Metering technology segment, we experienced strong order and sales performance with organic growth of 5% and 9%, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 50 basis points versus last year, driven by strong price/cost, volume leverage and productivity, which more than offset higher employee-related costs and discretionary spending as well as the dilutive impact of acquisitions.  Industrial demand remained steady throughout the quarter. We experienced tailwinds from energy, mining, chemical and lithium-ion battery markets. Our water businesses performed well. Quote activity remained strong due to U.S. infrastructure funding initiatives, and we see continued momentum around the adoption of AI and cloud technologies.  Our energy markets continue to be strong, driven by favorable oil export and mobile truck demand. In the chemical market, we are experiencing wins in the energy transition space as well as strong China and Middle East demand.  The agricultural demand landscape is mixed. Farm fundamentals are positive with stable commodity prices and net farm incomes as well as lower fertilizer costs versus last year. However, distribution inventory levels were higher than typical coming into the planting season, and a slower start to the season due to weather has delayed the turnover of this inventory.  Moving on to the Health & Science Technologies segment. Organic orders contracted 23%, driven by the OEM inventory calibration impact as well as timing of a large next-gen sequencing order we received in the first quarter of last year. As Eric noted, our life science and analytical instrumentation businesses are being impacted by broad-based inventory destocking as our customers recalibrate to a more normalized demand pattern. We expect that these markets will continue to see this pressure through the second quarter with some recovery in the back half of the year.  The semiconductor market is experiencing softness resulting from memory oversupply as well as customers feeling the impact of U.S. export controls. We anticipate that macro conditions will improve as we progress through the remainder of the year. We do continue to leverage share gain to buffer some of the broader market declines.  Our material processing technology business is seeing softness across pharma, biopharma and nutrition markets, driven by tighter capital availability and customer hesitancy due to recession concerns. Our funnel does remain strong, and we expect some recovery in the second half of the year. The automotive market remains positive. We continue to see a solid global trend towards electrification driving opportunities for our growth.  We delivered 3% organic sales growth in the first quarter, driven by strong next-gen sequencing, satellite broadband and fuel cell-targeted growth initiatives with some offset from the market factors I mentioned earlier. Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted by 300 basis points versus the first quarter of 2022. Most of this pressure is in the gross margin line, with unfavorable volume leverage and mix more than offsetting favorable price/cost. The recent Muon acquisition is accretive to HST's overall EBITDA margin.  Finally, turning to our Fire & Safety Diversified Products segment. Organic orders contracted by 4%, mainly driven by timing of project orders in our dispensing business last year. Organic sales results were strong at 9% growth, with double-digit growth in both Fire & Rescue and BAND-IT offsetting the decline in dispensing.  Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 160 basis points versus last year, largely driven by strong price cost performance, volume leverage and productivity more than offsetting higher discretionary spend and employee-related costs. The paint market is mixed, with pressure from the North American replenishment cycle coming to an end and softness in Southeast Asia being offset with strong European and Indian demand.  Within our Fire business, demand for trucks remains strong. North American OEM volumes continue to be constrained by supply chain. However, we are gaining share with North American mid-tier and China OEMs with our integrated system strategy and have pivoted our go-to-market approach for our SAM product to retrofit in-service trucks to bypass the OEM backlog constraints.  Our rescue markets are stable, and we have experienced favorable demand in Europe and good project activity across most of the globe. BAND-IT results continue to be positive. Industrial demand is steady, energy is strong, and we continue to drive higher than market performance in automotive due to our position on high-demand vehicles and share gain. With that, I'll give an update on our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2023.  I'm on Slide 11. I'll now provide some additional details regarding our revised 2023 guidance for both the second quarter and the full year. In Q2, we are projecting GAAP EPS to range from $1.86 to $1.89 and adjusted EPS to range from $2.10 to $2.13, with organic revenue growth of approximately 3% and adjusted EBITDA margins ranging from 27.3% to 27.7%. We anticipate that HST volumes will be negative in the second quarter, and the strength we saw in Q1 industrial performance sustains.  Turning to the full year. As Eric mentioned, we have reduced our full year revenue guidance, reflecting headwinds related to OEM destocking across the HST segment. At the midpoint, we expect volume and mix impact reduces EPS by $0.48, offset by $0.23 of cost actions, yielding $0.25 of net pressure on our annual guide. This equates to a full year low single-digit organic revenue contraction in HST and low- to mid-single-digit growth in FMT and FSD. Our view on the industrial market has not changed, and we continue to assume a second half decline with a modest recovery in the back half for HST.  Bringing it all together, we project GAAP EPS of $7.30 to $7.60 and adjusted EPS to range from $8.25 to $8.55. We expect full year organic revenue growth of 0% to 3% and adjusted EBITDA margin to range between 27.5% and 27.9%. The high end of our range implies that we will sustain our record profitability from last year. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be about $70 million, and free cash flow is expected to be 100-plus percent of adjusted net income.  With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions. And I'd just add is our guide. On the low end, we have kind of that HST recovery only up about 1% sequentially from the first half to the second half. And then on the high side, a 7%. So reasonable range relative to the things that Eric just highlighted. No, no. We did. In our updated guide, the implied organic revenue for HST is negative low single digits, and for FMT and FSD, positive low single digits. No. Exactly. I mean, it's been our stance as we came into the year with an expectation that the industrials were going to start to fall off in the back half of the year. We saw strength in the first quarter. We knew what our backlog positions were. And Eric just highlighted some of the caution we're seeing in our daily book and ship order rates that I think just give us more confidence in our call that the back half will be softer for those businesses, down a couple of percent on the volume side as we progress over the next quarter or 2 -- post the second quarter, still positive there, yes. Yes. And KZ, their mix of business is much more concentrated towards OEM. So they're not seeing some of the inventory issues that Banjo is. Yes. I think the biggest driver, Nathan, is the mix impact. Some of the volume decreases we've seen are our highest margin product portfolio in the business that has somewhat offset that to keep the business positive from an organic perspective. And then with the overall segment being positive, there are still some pockets that were negative that caused us to deleverage on some of the fixed cost side. No, no, relative to our backlog position. We will be negative in HST in the second quarter, but kind of low single digits. And then remember, the second half of this year is significant -- or the second half of last year was significantly higher. So we'll have a little bit of comp problems that will keep HST either flattish or slightly negative for the balance of the year. And I think the other thing is on the Energy business, they've launched a couple of new products that have been very well received in the end marketplace. And then we talk about businesses that they had some differentiation relative to their ability to have inventory to supply their customer base. I think a couple of businesses within our valve that mostly sell into the chemical market have been well positioned relative to the inventory that they've carried to take some share from their customers. No. I mean the only thing of note, it was small, it was a couple of million dollars. Just as we got Nexsight on our normal accounting procedure, they picked up a couple of weeks of incremental revenue, but it was a $2 million, $3 million type of deal. Sure. I mean we haven't disclosed exactly other than it's at -- it will be at the high end of HST growth on a normalized basis. Before we bought them, they had been a double-digit compounder. So really successful with their growth trajectory historically, and we continue to see that here as they progress in the high single digits.  From an EPS perspective, I'd refer you to our annual guide. We didn't break out the individual pieces, but I think incrementally this year, we said $0.43 for Muon, the carryover for Nexsight and KZ, net of the divestiture of Knight. Brett, I apologize. Can you repeat that question? You broke up on us. [Technical Difficulty] million on the onetime order or the blanket that we received last year. So that was a couple of percent of the 23%. The balance is a lot of the market factors that Eric highlighted. Yes."

            "name": "Eric Ashleman",
            "content": "Thank you, Allison, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6. I'd like to start with some key first quarter highlights. We delivered record sales with positive organic growth across all 3 of our segments, $2.09 adjusted earnings per share and strong free cash flow. Our FMT and FSD segments performed exceptionally well, both achieving record sales and strong profitability, offsetting some pressure in our HST segment. Price/cost was positive and above IDEX historical performance.  As we look ahead to Q2 and the balance of the year, our outlook has changed. The last time we spoke, we anticipated short-term volume pressures within life sciences from inventory calibration concentrated in a few select OEM customers. However, as we progressed through the quarter, we saw signals of a broader, more prolonged recalibration within our HST segment, largely centered in our analytical instrumentation, life science, pharma and semiconductor markets. End-market demand is still positive, but we believe our customers have sufficient inventory of our critical components to support their needs in the near term.  Over the past 2 years, we experienced robust growth in HST, with sales up over 30% organically to support strong end-user demand and customer-specific inventory replenishment. But as supply chain conditions improve and the broader demand profile normalizes, our OEM partners are aggressively attacking higher inventory levels, beginning with those suppliers that have demonstrated the quickest returns to pre-pandemic lead times. The sharp and simultaneous nature of this inventory recalibration exceeds all prior historical cycles.  In response, we proactively executed cost reductions to offset a portion of this volume impact. We tailored our approach to the specific challenges in individual businesses as well as broader discretionary costs across the entire company, managing through the short term but not losing focus on our longer-term growth path.  These top line challenges, net of our cost-containment plan, drive $0.25 of adjusted EPS headwind for the year. Therefore, as we noted in our press release, we revised our full year adjusted 2023 EPS guidance from $8.25 to $8.55. Bill will discuss the specifics in greater detail during our segment and guidance updates.  Regardless of these end-market challenges, we remain confident in our ability to deliver total shareholder returns over the long term. Our capital deployment plan remains consistent. We continue to look to M&A as a significant source of value creation. To that end, we announced our intent to acquire Iridian Spectral Technologies for CAD 150 million or approximately USD 111 million.  Iridian is a world leader in custom optical filter solutions serving the space, life science and telecommunications markets. Iridian expects fiscal 2023 revenues of CAD 36 million and EBITDA margin in the low-30s range. It is about a 13x EBITDA-trailing deal. And within the IDEX family of businesses, Iridian complements and expands upon the solutions provided by our Scientific Fluidics and Optics businesses within HST. This transaction is expected to close in the second quarter. Iridian will be our sixth acquisition since the beginning of 2021, and we remain bullish on our ability to deploy capital on high-quality assets irrespective of the macro conditions.  The integration of our Muon Group acquisition, which closed in fourth quarter 2022, is progressing well. We've deployed key elements of our operating model, and there continues to be a strong cultural fit between IDEX and Muon as our teams work together to unlock value between our businesses.  Finally, I traveled last week to India to officially open our second plant in the state of Gujarat. It is a world-class facility that effectively doubles our production capacity in the country. Coupled with the opening of our plant expansion in China in late 2022 and our recent commissioning of sales and logistics centers in Singapore and Dubai, we now have a strengthened footprint to attack markets across Asia and the Middle East, a key element of our growth strategy.  With that, I'll turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results. Well, thanks, Deane. I mean I'd say a couple of things. One, as you'd expect, given the magnitude of some of the swings, I mean, the discussions and the intensity and the iteration of them with end customers and at all levels, commercial operations is probably at the highest level we've ever had.  And then I would say, as you look at the actual order intake, you can see some things firming up in the back half. So you can see actually kind of the same planning and methods that are pulling it down now are actually repositioning it a little further out in the later -- in the year, sorry.  And you're seeing that for the kind of standard products that we would usually gauge, that are kind of right down the middle of the volume fairway. So that's -- it deviates a little bit market for market, but I'd say, those 2 factors are probably the 2 that we're most reliant on as we think about that. So are you saying, Deane, kind of take it from a little bit more depth... On the HST and then rotate it over -- okay. Got it. Yes. So obviously, the most pronounced recalibration happening exactly in the area that we're talking about here in HST. As you look at the industrial side of it and in particular, kind of the day rate stuff right down the center of our fairway, first quarter held up really, really well. I mean business to business, I think we called out ag is the only one where we saw some similar dynamics of kind of inventory and things ready to go to plan.  I will say though, in more recent data here in April, some of those canaries that we often reference, you can see things pull back a little bit, and you can see them doing it together. So it is going to be something we'll watch. April is, for whatever reasons, never a real strong predictor for us. It firms up as we go through May and especially into June. But I will say you can see a little bit of that there in those businesses. In terms of just day rates, it's not a big drop, but the uniformity of it is interesting across a couple of weeks here most recently.  And when you kind of hold that up with some other things, some of which we do informally and others have done more formally around inventory positions of distributors and things like that, maybe you can see sort of the same comments, hold that up with the same feelings of uncertainty. So it's not a logic break in terms of how this might play out.  And let's remember, in our comments here last time, I mean, we actually have this positioned in our back half. So we have a bit of a glide path and then here, very recently, seeing some of the first signs of it. Yes. And a couple of the other FMT pump businesses and even more specifically, a couple of product lines we look at within and where we just know they tend to be ordered typically, 1 and 2 and 3, general replacement. The ones you mentioned, a few other places, but yes, they're the ones we often always look at when we talk to you. Well, it's -- these are the larger projects that we sometimes talk about here. I mean we have them in 2 places, and they're a little different. So I think they're more pronounced, more aggressive on the HST side in the markets that we're referencing here. So you can see some concern in places like MPT. We referenced those in the comments. But let's tie those to that sort of general macro story that Deane did a good job framing for us.  I think on the industrial side, I would just kind of come back and say, this -- the entirety of the cycle, it's not been a big piece of our story. I'll remind folks, in the beginning of the ramp-up post COVID, there was a lot of uncertainty there. Frankly, that turned into the inability to put those projects together, then as inflation came about, there was a repricing element that sort of prevented some of them from our side.  And now maybe we're drifting a bit more into uncertainty, too. So I'd argue it kind of held pretty [Technical Difficulty] quite positive for us, not really because of large projects, just that sort of general day-to-day business is doing real well. Yes. I mean, holding up really, really well. KZ, just to remind people, brought a key piece of automation technology that, frankly, goes to the same customer set that we have in our Banjo business. They're very close by. So I mean this is a [Technical Difficulty]. And so we're working on the commercial side, the technical side and all of the pieces of the IDEX operating model. So really, really happy there.  The Nexsight business, reminder, there was -- they were kind of long channel partners, and there's a piece of software that came with that business we've long used as well. So many people have kind of associated this with IDEX for a number of years. So pretty seamless integration, expands our presence in depth. And then the water markets, as we referenced in the earlier comments and we'll say here, are doing well. There's good strong support for municipal projects, municipal work that I think will play out for quite a while. So yes, real favorable with those 2. Yes. I don't think so. I think largely, this is a story of coming off of a multi-period of really aggressive rates, both for us and our end customers. I mean I look at our segment. I mean HST was up 30% across 2 years. I think that tracks with a lot of the end markets where we are. And so a retraction or a pullback down to more typical rates in the single digits. Even if they're mid-single digits, it's pretty dramatic if, in fact, your thinking is changing in a relatively short time horizon.  So I think the single biggest variable for -- certainly for us as a component supplier into it is going to be levels of inventory [Technical Difficulty] taking it into different areas. So it's -- in some ways, it's doing math. It's math and rate of travel. It is different than we've seen before, but the preceding period in the run-up there was different as well. So I think we're all learning to do that together. And as I spoke earlier on the call, the need for even tighter alignment and iteration as we go through that to protect everybody is very important. Yes. No, it's a great question, Nathan. I mean in general, everything we make here is pretty customized for a very specific end use, if not a specific single customer. And in the area that we're talking about in the health science world, I mean, that absolutely happens. These are spec-ed in components. They don't travel East and West.  When we're more generally talking about an IDEX, though, FMT in that segment, FSD as well, you've got a channel between us and all of these fragmented end markets, which are at much lower volumes. And so no single one of them is going to tend to raise its head up at any one point. So that -- the comment generally holds there.  And while it's specific customized here, this is a highly concentrated customer set, and it's a super direct transaction. So if you chose to do it, and they don't often do it and this is a bit unprecedented, but if you chose to do it that way, you could put mission-critical components down that you know you're going to use because they're the most high-running parts that you have in the system, even though they are absolutely customized for that customer only. Yes. Well, I think in energy specific, remember that we largely do mobile custody transfer there. So there's a little bit of an overhang as the industry gets healthier and price support are out there. You're going to get some general tailwinds for CapEx spend. More specifically for us, though, we do a lot in mobile applications, a lot of which depends upon chassis availability.  That's been -- that was highly constrained for a couple of years. That's freed up as a lot of other supply chains have, and some of it is just captive demand at a good and favorable time in the environment, that -- something like that, a micro story like that actually matters for us.  On the chemical side, we've seen strength in China, specifically, with our Richter business. I think some of that is probably also related to the fact the country was kind of locked down for a while. There are some investments that have to be made. We're super well positioned there. We'll see how that plays out longer term. And actually, Europe in the chemical side, which is an area of concern and was pretty depressed as well for a bunch of reasons we've talked about, that was actually pretty strong for us as well.  So it's these little pockets that kind of play out in typical IDEX fashion that goes from big to small stories here. But I would say, generally, we're still following others out there that are larger. So not a massive component of project spend or multi-period expansion here, but more micro events and things. And otherwise, markets, I think, are doing pretty well. Yes, sure. So the -- I mean the Iridian business, I mean, it's -- as we said in the release, it's a leading designer and manufacturer of thin film, multilayer optical filters. We do that in a lot of other places within IDEX, both in our optical technologies segment and some of it embedded into the life sciences platforms as well.  So I think honestly, the size of this business is pretty typical for how we specialize technology of this type, it's kind of an ideal unit of measure, if you will. So think of it as a puzzle piece of technology that goes well with other pieces that we have. And honestly, the 3 primary segments here, we attack from a whole bunch of different places in IDEX, not all of them, just in optics and technology. So space broadband, super complementary to some other things we've talked about along the way in a great market.  The life sciences place side of it is probably intuitive. I mean we do other coatings here. Their technology is a little bit different. And so it fits in, in a way that we were -- we've been looking for, for a while. And then there's a telecom piece that's involved with 5G rollout and game filters and things like that. So it's the kind of work we know how to do. The other piece of this is their coding capacity then, when aligned with other pockets of coding capacity we have across IDEX, you can start to think of this as an aggregation and think of how you might move capacity around on what's now becoming quite a bit of mass and a very important job to do.  So it's a just really, really nice fit. We've known a lot of the folks associated with businesses like this for a number of years. So it's right in our universe, proprietary transactions. Super happy to have it here. Matt? Yes, sure. So price is a big part of our value capture across our portfolio balancing, hey, we have differentiated products and making sure we capture that value from our customers. Obviously, last year, from an inflationary perspective, we were hitting an all-time high. So we had ramped our price pretty significantly as we went through, I think, topping off close to 5% last year.  This year, we guided about 4%. We're on track for that. That's a combination of new price increases that we've launched here throughout the first quarter and then carryover pricing from actions we took throughout last year. Yes. Look, I think so far, it's very in line with what we had played out in our -- for the year, the planning for it. So remember, we the softening in the back half on the industrial side. We're saying here, this might be some early indications that it will come to fruition. And so in those businesses, we've already made and lined up the discretionary cost reductions and some thought and care around any additions we might make in a way that's completely in line with what we had originally said.  The targeted actions that we spoke about related to the HST destocking phenomenon, those are pretty targeted actions within those businesses. So this is where the -- if you will, the portfolio nature of IDEX really helps us. We can treat these in kind of a differentiated way and occasionally come together on just smart investments around travel and other discretionary things and just do it well as a team. Yes. No, it's a good question. I mean look, if you kind of get it right down to the way that inventory replenishment is done, obviously, your future projections and your assumptions around lead time drive almost all of your requirements. And so in hindsight, now you can view this and think, well, there must have been irrationality there, but I don't think that's actually the case. I think if you are projecting a line in a certain way, and you've been experiencing delivery patterns, not just for us, but for others at a certain level, it's going to say, you need a lot of stuff.  I think part of what's changed here and maybe changed most dramatically is you have kind of a simultaneous -- well, first of all, the calendar change, funny as it sounds, that always tends to bring a different headset. And I think there's some legitimate things out there kind of from a macro perspective that people are wondering about. We're further away from COVID. We're starting to see some pullback in biopharma spending. We have some funding crisis associated with start-ups and things in biopharma places.  So the minute you interject that back into the equation, you potentially go change your assumption on long-term demand, it actually has a pretty striking effect on what you should be bringing in. Now you combine that with the fact that we execute really well, so our lead times and our customer set, returning quickly back to normal, you put those 2 things together, even an automated system is going to say, \"Hey, you've probably got too much here.\"  So back to your point on learnings and things like that. First of all, we're not typically seeing cycles of this magnitude, these kind of swings. But to be fair, maybe in the world to come as we see, and it seems like there's always another chapter around the corner. So I do take your point. And I think higher iteration, really coming together and understanding long-term projections being maybe potentially more transparent with where we are in terms of lead time performance, customer set, making sure that, that's exactly understood not just today, but tomorrow as we move through cycles and swings like this, I think those would be the kind of things that our teams are talking about at both the commercial and the operational level. Yes, I mean, I think this is about the pattern that you would expect at some point. I would say, look, this is pretty recent. April, as I said, is often a kind of an interesting month of transition as you move into the spring. So we'll see.  But we're always looking for a slight step down one way or the other, and then uniformity. Because I think that's where, again, the portfolio nature of IDEX comes into play. We're able to kind of see it across a variety of end markets simultaneously, all of which have kind of the same sort of short order fulfillment patterns that have long been known to people.  So when they tend to move in concert with each other, either positively or negatively, it's at least worth looking at and taking a signal. I would say this is a small drop. It is uniform in nature, but that is exactly what we would have probably expected and I think is modeled in ultimately in the back end. And we'll obviously continue to monitor it and talk to you and others about it as we get -- roll through and finish the second quarter. Thanks so much. I apologize, I know we've had some glitches with the technology. Maybe we'll need to put more filters to work on telecommunications.  First of all, I want to thank the IDEX employees. I know there's always some listening in on the call. Very, very strong quarter. You've continued to really perform for the business and for our customers. Thanks to others on the call for your interest and support in the company.  Bottom line here, we knew 2023 was going to be a year of recalibration moving from one state of the world to another. It's playing out more dynamically than we initially suspected in the HST side. But as you can see, we're executing through it. We're taking the appropriate responses in the business.  And I think most importantly, we ultimately believe in the long-term success and outgrowth in those markets. We're talking about coming down from highs to something that's actually pretty typical, but absolutely advantaged. We think it's going to continue that way and then accelerate for years to come.  So through all of these dynamic swings over the last 3 years, I'm really proud of the fact that we've executed well, and we certainly stepped up our capital deployment, really happy to announce the sixth transaction since the beginning of '21 with Iridian, doubled our emerging markets footprint and capability set and continue to strengthen a really unique culture as we've done it.  So we're built for the long haul here. We're confident that we're going to perform and deliver value throughout. And I look forward to updating everybody along the way as the -- in the year to come and the years in the future play out for IDEX. Thank you."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Wendy Palacios, Vice President of FP&A and Investor Relations. Thank you, Wendy. You may begin.\nWendy Palacios: Good morning, everyone. This is Wendy Palacios, Vice President of FP&A and Investor Relations for IDEX Corporation. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the IDEX third quarter 2024 financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the 3 months ending September 30, 2024. The press release, along with the presentation to be used during today's webcast, can be accessed on our investor website at investors.idexcorp.com. Joining me today are Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer and President; and Abhi Khandelwal, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. Turning to Slide 2. Please note that during today's call, we will present certain non-GAAP financial measures. We will also make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties. Actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. We do not assume any obligation to update them. Information regarding these factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements is available on our website and in our SEC filings. With that, I'll now turn this call over to our CEO and President, Eric Ashleman.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Wendy, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 3. Our IDEX teams drove strong Q3 results in an uncertain environment. Here are the highlights. We delivered nice organic growth supported by excellent margins in our Fluid & Metering Technology and Fire Safety and Diversified Products segments. Our free cash flow across IDEX of $192 million was 33% of adjusted net income. Execution through operational excellence was really strong overall. We're pleased to see orders growth within our Health & Science Technologies segment, and our teams are digging into the Mott acquisition with focus energy as we align around our best long-term growth prospects across all of our recent HST acquisitions. We have some important projects to deliver in Q4 in all segments that set us up well for next year. From the start of Q2 to the end of Q3, we really haven't seen a noticeable change in the macro environment. The recent interest rate drop by the Fed and China's stimulus announcements has yet to create positive ripple effects through improved certainty. An extremely close U.S. November election with polarized outcomes also isn't helping in the near term. Take all of that together, and we continue to see an environment where day-to-day order rates remain stable with an absence of larger long-term project commitments. This dynamic really holds true in the more fragmented industrial markets of FMT. We're encouraged by an increase in quoting activity as we move from summer to fall and we don't see projects moving from delayed to canceled. We'll watch for signs either way as many customers move more formally consider their capital and OpEx deployment within calendar budget cycles. We continue to see strength within our intelligent water markets, and I'll talk more about our focused efforts there on the next slide. Within the Health & Science Technologies segment, we saw a robust Q3 organic orders increase partially driven by blanket orders, many of them landing within our IDEX Health & Science business. Admittedly, we're comparing to the low point of last year, but we drove year-over-year order increases in all of our major HST reporting areas. We booked a bit of backlog overall this quarter, and we posted a nice sequential uptick to our highest order point in 2024. We are encouraged by these trends within HST, but remain cautious as we consider the trajectory of recovery within our most important markets. Our defense, aerospace and satellite communication markets are strong. They experienced double-digit growth within the quarter. However, most major semiconductor customers are pushing out the next industry inflection point into at least the midpoint of 2025. Life Sciences and analytical instrumentation customers are more positive than they have been. They're innovating at a rapid clip and launching a lot of new gear. But they, too, are pretty noncommittal to the timing of next level growth rates. Our teams continue to deploy resources toward their best long-term growth prospects with an eye towards applied materials science technology synergies as we integrate Mott alongside our recent HST acquisitions. Fire Safety and Diversified Products had a solid quarter exceeding expectations, achieving record sales performance. Our fire business continues to grow share and scale production to meet North American OEM multiyear backlogs. BAND-IT experienced strong growth from aerospace demand. Finally, recall our dispensing business was impacted by top-line headwinds of $40 million from the end of a large 2023 North American large retailer replenishment cycle, but our teams continue to work to offset that pressure by delivering strong growth within emerging markets. We've closed that year-over-year gap considerably, delivering over 15,000 units from our new facility in India, just opened in April of last year. As an aside, I want to thank our team members from IDEX Fire & Safety, who chipped in to help people in North Carolina following the devastation from the remnants of Hurricane Helene. Finally, we're thrilled to formally close on the Mott acquisition this quarter. Things are really exciting there. We'll share more details on the progress of the integration activities and some of the benefits we are experiencing early on in a slide to follow. Turning to slide 4. Our intelligent water platform continues to be a bright spot for us. We see significant opportunities now and in the future as municipalities and industries around the world cope with the impacts of climate change as they navigate dynamic regulatory and funding ecosystems to support the best use and management of water. Water management is a sector that has classically been slow to change. Those days are over. Our aging and neglected infrastructure just can't handle the demands of expanding populations and increasingly severe weather events. What was once underground and out of sight is now impossible to ignore. What was once analog and manual is now increasingly digital and automated. And federal, regulatory and funding support is stepping in to drive growth from above within a typically bottoms up local and regional landscape. And our teams are ready to meet the challenge. Below ground, IDEX Intelligent Water aims to be the collection system experts, monitoring flow of storm water and identifying small issues before they become big ones. Above ground, our teams help protect the environment with solutions that treat water and reduce the amount being used in critical processes. You see some examples here on the slide. The Envirosight Verisight ultra camera inspection system gives teams better capabilities for remote inspection of sewers in more challenging environments than before. Most recent addition to the platform is Subterra, which acquired about three months ago. This rapid sewer screening solution complements our core inspection technologies with iPEK, Envirosight and WinCan. Subterra\u2019s SewerScout floats untethered downstream, capturing three-dimensional data along the way. The market needs a simple condition assessment tool in their wastewater collection systems, specifically for large pipes that are rarely inspected. Subterra's Technologies performing within an integrated digital analytics suite addresses that need and expands our overall IDEX expertise in this space. And yet another example of IDEX serving semiconductor manufacturers, the Quantum XT ultrapure water heater and pumps from Trevor continues to save billions of leaders of ultrapure water. In this market, Trevor's innovation displaced in a established heater pump manufacturer that didn't recognize or address quickly enough the semiconductor industry's needs to reduce water consumption. Now, turning to slide 5 and an update on our acquisition of Mott Corporation. Less than two months since completing our acquisition of Mott, the partnership is off to a fast start. A few high-potential IDEX team members have formally joined the Mott leadership team in the earliest days of acquisition integration. This gives the Mott team a living key into the rest of IDEX to drive collaborative efficiency. While it's too soon to share specifics, teams from Mott and other IDEX units within HST are already working on innovative new solutions together to leverage Mott's highly engineered filtration technologies. In one instance, a combined team has rapidly developed a customer-ready prototype in the first 90 days of Mott being part of IDEX. Frankly, it's been tremendous to see. As you can see in the photo on the right of slide 5 earlier this month, Mott opened its third manufacturing facility in Connecticut. This plant quadruples Mott's production capacity for custom design ultra-thin porous metal sheets, which are a critical component in the generation of green hydrogen, a low emission fuel essential for world's energy transition. The picture on the left shows Mott's high-purity operations where point-of-use gas filters used in the semiconductor industry are laser marked, pressure and helium leak tested, inspected then pulse cleaned before bagging. As a reminder, Mott is a leader in the design and manufacturing of centered porous material structures and flow control solutions. The Mott team has deep material science knowledge and process control capabilities. Their business complementary to our broader applied materials science technology businesses within HST, including Muon, STC Material Solutions and Optical Technologies. We're excited about Mott's history of execution the robust backlog funnel that is built to date with key project deliveries as we close out 2024. With that, I'll turn it over to Abhi to discuss our financial results.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Thanks, Eric. Turning to the consolidated financial results on slide 6. Please note that all comparisons are against the prior year period unless stated otherwise. Also, the acquisition of Mott is reflected in IDEX's consolidated and HST segment financials as of the close of the transaction on September 5. Third quarter orders of $781 million were up approximately 10% on a reported basis and up 8% organically. We saw orders growth across the portfolio with HST seeing 20% organic growth in the quarter, half of which was partially driven by blanket order activity that will ship in 2025. FSDP had low single-digit organic growth while FMT was essentially flat. We did see slight sequential growth in FMT orders. Third quarter sales of $798 million were up 1% reported and flat organically compared to the prior year. We experienced organic growth of 4% in FSDP and 2% in FMT. HST had a 5% organic decline driven by continued headwinds that I will cover in the upcoming slides. Third quarter gross margin was 44.3% and adjusted gross margin was 44.6%, an expansion of 20 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively. Gross margin expansion was driven by strong price/cost, partially offset by higher employee-related costs. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.9%, down 150 basis points. With the acquisition of Mott, our biggest acquisition to date, we had higher than typical M&A spending, which negatively impacted our margins by approximately 40 basis points. We are accelerating the integration of Mott and are excited to see the realization of the expected commercial synergies. We continue to leverage 80/20 across IDEX to deploy resources to growth and reduce complexity. I will discuss the drivers of third quarter adjusted EBITDA on the next slide in a moment. On a GAAP basis, our Q3 effective tax rate was 22.9% versus 20.2% in the prior year period. The prior year rate included certain onetime benefits, which contributed $0.11 of adjusted EPS in the prior year period. Third quarter net income was $119 million, resulting in GAAP EPS of $1.57. Adjusted net income was $144 million with an adjusted EPS of $1.90, down $0.22 or 10%. We achieved the higher end of our guide. And while our guidance did not include contributions from Mott or its related financing costs, these amounts essentially offset one another during the quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was $192 million, a decrease of 7%. We achieved a conversion rate of 133% of adjusted net income, a 400 basis point improvement on a year-over-year basis. We have a strong balance sheet, and this quarter, we paid over $50 million in cash dividends. We also funded the acquisition of Mott through the combination of approximately $212 million of cash, $279 million of borrowings from our revolving credit facility and $495 million net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes. We maintain a strong investment-grade rating with a 2.4 gross leverage ratio at the close of September. Moving on to Slide 7, which details the adjusted EBITDA drivers. For the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $11 million. Our organic sales volume decline of approximately 3% unfavorably impacted adjusted EBITDA by $9 million, flowing through at prior year adjusted gross margin rate. The negative volume flow-through was partially offset by strong price/cost spread of 100 basis points and operational productivity, resulting in a $10 million benefit over the prior year. In the quarter, we saw unfavorable mix, primarily in our industrial businesses and our dispensing businesses. We had higher employee-related costs and higher transaction-related expenses in connection with the acquisition of Mott. All these factors combined resulted in an unfavorable organic flow-through. The impact of FX slightly increased adjusted EBITDA by $1 million and acquisitions net of divestitures added $2 million on a quarter-over-quarter basis as the benefits from our acquisitions more than offset the impact on adjusted EBITDA from divested companies. I will now review segment level performance. Turning to Slide 8 and FMT segment. In Q3, we experienced sequential and mid-single-digit plus organic year-over-year growth in orders across the majority of our businesses. This growth was muted by continued ag cycle headwinds and push out in chemical project activity, resulting in total flat organic orders growth for FMT. Net sales were up 2% organically. We had strong price capture across the segment and experienced high single-digit growth in our industrials and intelligent water businesses. Total segment growth was unfavorably impacted by demand softness in our ag OEM and energy businesses. Our industrial day rates remain steady from Q2 with no change in overall market conditions. The strength in year-over-year organic growth in our Industrial business, was partially due to prior year comps. Our Intelligent Water portfolio continues to see strength in the North American municipal market with strong governmental funding to support ongoing investments. Our energy business are seeing headwinds from weather related in North America, slowdown in propane truck builds and distributor destocking and decreased demand for propane in Europe. Our ag OEM business remains challenged by the market slowdown. Despite this downturn, our teams remain focused, tackling the market headwinds and leveraging 80-20 to redeploy resources. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 160 basis points due to higher employee-related costs, discretionary spending and unfavorable mix, partially offset by price cost. Moving on to slide 9 and our HST segment. Orders grew sequentially and experienced a year-over-year organic growth of 20%. Growth was partially driven by blanket orders in life science and performance pneumatics businesses. Year-over-year comps were also a factor as life sciences, analytical instrumentation and semiconductor markets bottomed the same period last year. Our innovation funnel in life sciences remains active while there is no change in our outlook. Net sales were down 5% organically. Although we have strong price capture, it did not entirely offset the volume declines, driven by continued challenges in the end markets we serve. Our life sciences and analytical instrumentation businesses demand was steady sequentially from Q2 to Q3. Defense, aerospace and satellite communication end markets remained strong. We saw double-digit growth in the quarter. Within semicon, what we are seeing is a push-out in the end market recovery to the second half of next year. Our HST industrial light businesses continue to experience project delays. As I commented earlier, the acquisition of Mott is reflected in HST's segment financials as of the close of the transaction on September 5th. The integration of Mott is moving at a brisk pace. Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin for HST declined 40 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to lower volume and higher employee related costs, partially offset by price cost, favorable operational productivity, cost of work the teams have done to align with the current environment and the net accretive impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Now turning to slide 10. I'd like to take a moment to recognize our FSDP team's performance, delivering record sales and adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. Orders in our Fire &Safety/Diversified Products segment were up 4% organically, driven by Fire & Safety low double-digit growth, partially offset by declines in dispensing and BAND-IT. Net sales were up 4% organically. We had strong price capture and higher volumes, mainly driven by Fire & Safety and BAND-IT. Our Fire & Safety businesses continue to see growth in North America fire OEMs, and we are ramping production to meet their needs. BAND-IT experienced growth driven by strong aerospace demand, offsetting declines in industrial and auto. Our dispensing business experienced declines as expected, driven by headwinds from the North American big box retailer refresh cycle. Growth from the India market had been an offset to this headwind through the first half of this year, due to timing of projects in the emerging markets blending in the first half of 2024. Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin declined 20 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to unfavorable mix with positive price/cost offsetting higher employee-related costs. With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year on Slide 11. For the fourth quarter, we project organic sales to increase 3% to 4% compared to the prior year. We anticipate an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 27% with GAAP EPS in the range of $1.64 to $1.69 and adjusted EPS in the range of $2.01 to $2.06. On a year-over-year basis, we expect mid- to high single-digit organic growth in FMT and FSDP. In HST, we expect flat sales growth. Our full year adjusted EPS outlook remains unchanged and we expect organic revenues to decline 1% to 2% with an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 27%. We project GAAP diluted EPS to range from $6.65 to $6.70 and adjusted EPS to range from $7.85 to $7.90 in line with our prior guidance. The full year revenue guidance implies high single-digit organic sales decline in HST and low single-digit growth in FMT and FSDP. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric for closing remarks.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Abhi. I'm on Slide 12. Look, it's easy to get caught up in the economic uncertainties that play out quarter-to-quarter. It's been a frustrating last couple of years as we've seen the last echoes of the pandemic play out against an uncertain geopolitical environment, an environment made more uncertain globally by the unprecedented number of 2024 national elections. We've managed well throughout this period. We've improved the long-term growth prospects of IDEX significantly through incredibly focused work within a proprietary M&A funnel. We have some outstanding people and technologies at our disposal to develop trusted solutions to our customers' most difficult problems. We're building relative and absolute scale across business units to support advantaged markets like water, which we discussed today, advanced semiconductor wafer fabrication, Life Sciences and Analytical Instrumentation and space and defense. We're rapidly digitizing traditionally analog applications throughout IDEX as we transform everything from customer acquisition and support to core product functionality. And we continue to grow through our jump-off points within Asia Pacific as these developing markets reach economic trigger points to adopt IDEX advanced technologies. We sometimes take our abilities to execute for granted. We shouldn't. 80/20 isn't a tool at IDEX. It's evolved into an intuitive headset. We can size up the critical view quicker than others and swing our best people to our biggest challenges and opportunities without the need for time-wasting decision loops. Finally, we're talking about collaboration across business boundaries to build scale more than we have in the past. And some have asked if this challenge is the notion of a decentralized IDEX. It doesn't. We've built our culture intentionally over the last 15 years to prepare us for this moment. Our teams collaborate and help each other naturally without stifling structure and bureaucracy to win for customers. We live our purpose every day through our commitment to our core values of trust, team, and excellence. Thanks again to our IDEX employees and partners around the world for all that you do to make IDEX a great company. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morn everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Morning Deane.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Hey Deane.\nDeane Dray: Can we start with the tone of business, the day rates? Eric, you already kind of given us the good news that the small project delays didn't escalate. So, that was good. And you gave us some color on BAND-IT. But just the progression of the quarter and your read on the day rates, that would be a great place to start. Thanks.\nEric Ashleman: Yes. As I said kind of in the opening comments, I mean, they've been stable for a while without really a lot of inflection. So, you don't really see anything different through the summer months month-to-month as it played out in the quarter. A lot of it looks pretty similar to where we were in Q2. And of course, we've got the businesses that are closest to consumption. We track those all the time. They've been steady with a little bit of lift in in them, and we see that playing out the numbers that we posted in kind of our core industrial units here. And so I think good shape on those indicators that the kind of industrial system continues and it's -- we're still making things in plants all across the country, and we're maintaining it. That's kind of what a lot of that indicates. The project and the longer-term commitments, I think that's in about the same place, too. The uncertainty and the overhang of, obviously, the election coming up next week, where that's going to take us, those kind of things, I think it's still sort of out there in the way. We're always looking to see if any of those projects start to suddenly move into a category of either delayed -- or canceled instead of delayed or just not talked about any longer. We don't see that. I actually made a comment about the fact that quoting activity, in fact, is picking up a little bit. which I think is a good sign. And then I'm sure we'll get to it at a certain point, we've got a little bit of revenue ramp here in Q4 and almost all of that is project related with a couple of key things that are in the backlog now. Some of them are underway and near completion and I think are also good signs of confidence of the time that's out ahead of us.\nAbhi Khandelwal: And Deane, just to build on Eric's narrative a little bit. So, if you just kind of think about Q3 and just maybe talking about SMT on the face, you see organic growth of 2%, if you will. But if you kind of take a step back and go a step deeper, within the FMT business, pumps and water grew high single-digit. You saw valves group grow high single-digit on an organic basis, which was offset by ag and energy. So, even within HST, the core industrial franchise was up high single-digit.\nDeane Dray: That's really helpful and I appreciate all that color. And just as a follow-up, I love the fact that you put the spotlight on your Intelligent Water portfolio. We met with the team, got to visit each one of these businesses at the WEFTEC Trade Show in New Orleans recently. So, if we had to point to one probably the fastest-growing sector in the water infrastructure is this whole Stormwater Management. So it's -- you guys -- it looks like you get some first-mover advantage there. Can you just talk about critical mass for the Intelligent Water group? Do you need to add more capabilities? What kind of is the funnel like? And just kind of where and how does this business grow from here?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. Well, thanks. We appreciate talking to you and others at that show. And you mentioned a key word. We -- in our commentary about kind of our businesses in that area, we pointed to becoming the collection experts. That's really the work we do here. And that has a lot of focus right there, obviously, through things like Stormwater and significant weather events. That's where you see that play out. And so I think we've got the assets positioned in the right place to really, really focus. And as you saw, they work together. They work together in a way where the hardware and analytics help to give you this predictive insight into not just what's going on in your system in front of you, but what's likely to occur in the future. And I think one of the reasons we're winning is, we think about our end customers, it's certainly operating professionals who are trying to run the system. We have significant customer bases that are specification engineers and project engineers within municipalities and industries. And what they're trying to do is, understand the analytics of the system, the way that kind of the water circuit works, if you will. And then they're trying to put that together to obtain capital project approval. And so at this particular phase of the cycle, the cycle has got more positive funding support with longer duration. Being able to understand your system, so that that you can position yourselves to get funding for your municipality or business is really, really important, and it kind of points right back to the core work that we do. That's sometimes underappreciated and really thinks of kind of day-to-day monitoring, but this very specific engineering kind of partnership that helps people understand their system better, actually allows them to go grab funding that is more available now than it has been. Sorry, you also asked about, yeah, other pieces and things and kind of where we are.\nDeane Dray: Yeah.\nEric Ashleman: I mean, there's -- Subterra is a good example. That's sort of probably an under-the-radar, underappreciated technology that we very much appreciated. We've been working with that company before. And it really helps kind of complete capabilities for us. There are other things we would like to do here within kind of this ecosystem of collection. And so we continue to work in the funnel. We continue to look at things and we're very much -- it is in 80s for us in terms of an area that we would like to make larger, both organically and inorganically overtime.\nDeane Dray: Great to hear. Thank you.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks Deane.\nOperator: Our next question is from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nNathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Good morning, Nathan.\nWendy Palacios: Good morning.\nNathan Jones: I'm going to follow-up on Deane's question there. Because at [indiscernible], you could say the Intelligent Water businesses altogether kind of united brands showing customers what the combined businesses capabilities were. I'm just thinking about how you run those businesses and potentially, how you run some of the businesses in HST to collaborate together. And Eric, that was one of your closing comments, is collaboration across the business units without losing the decentralized structure. How do you kind of manage that process with these businesses? Do you need some kind of integration with the commercial organization, cross training for sales? And how do you manage those businesses so that you drive the collaboration that you want to see without actually going and integrating the businesses?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. It's a great question. And that's a great spot to talk about it. I mean, think of it a little bit as it's kind of -- these areas where we put some scale together, they present themselves as kind of mini versions IDEX. And when you step back from IDEX, I mean, one of the ways that we work it the way that we do is nimbly and agilely as we do. It's a super flat organizational structure. So we have a leader of the water business. And between kind of that leader and leaders of individual pieces of water, I mean, there's not a lot of stacking. So think of this as wide and horizontal more than vertical. That's one of the keys here. And the quality of the people, the quality of the system and operating model allows you to take that span a little bit wider. And so you already got something working for you in terms of being close to the point of impact with all leaders. So that's a key ingredient, doesn't change, it's always been part of IDEX and is as we do this work. But it comes down to strategy. A lot of this -- this is why we work so intensively in terms of building strategy and strategic capabilities and doing it in focused 80s areas of IDEX, so that we would be prepared to understand these worlds and why things need to go together and where they don't. And so in every one of these points, we know the difference between an area where there is collaboration and people are working together because the customer cares about it versus other areas where life goes on in individual pieces and specialized segments, which is -- that's where I think a lot of customers -- or companies get caught. They over-rotate one way or the other. We're actually very comfortable delivering in a hybrid world, because we have ever since I've worked at IDEX. We're just becoming a bit more focused to putting some of the scale to work because the solution set demands it. The problems are harder, they're evolving. They're earlier stages of evolution, so you need more power in the system. So it really does lever everything we've ever thought about in terms of 80-20, everything we do culturally, which celebrates flat organizations and a lack of bureaucracy. And probably the secret sauce for all of it is talent and development that that we do internally to make sure leaders are built in a certain way that they can operate with all of that autonomy.\nNathan Jones: Thanks a lot. I guess, my follow-up question is going to be around the HST order number. 20% organic growth, I think Abhi said half of that was from blanket orders. Is the kind of right way to think about without the blanket orders, the order number would have been something like about 305, which is kind of an average where it's been settled in over the last few quarters since the bottom in 2023? So it's kind of no change sequentially, still waiting and seeing, not really getting any better and not getting any worse. Or are these blanket orders indicative of some kind of improvement in some of those markets?\nAbhi Khandelwal: Yeah. So Nathan, let me try and answer your question. So if you think about it sequentially from 3Q -- or 2Q to 3Q and look at HST, HST was up about $20 million. I'd say about half of that was blanket order activity that we saw from Q2 to Q3 and the other half was just straight demand between different businesses. And then if you think about year-over-year, HST posted about a $51 million organic change in orders on a year-over-year basis. That's, again the same kind of amount for blanket and half of that was demand. So you do see -- go ahead, Nathan.\nNathan Jones: I was going to say so you are seeing some -- at least some underlying improvement in the markets there?\nAbhi Khandelwal: Yes, we are. Life sciences continues to be stable if you look at sequential. But there are markets, like we've said again, semicon is not at a point where it's inflecting. But we are seeing improvement even in our semicon markets sequentially.\nEric Ashleman: And then reminder -- yeah, just to finish. I mean, we have half of this segment that kind of is in other high-tech areas that are not in the usual suspects of semiconductor and life science and analytical instrumentation. And those, I mean, they're performing a lot like the industrial businesses that we see elsewhere. So we've got some growth and list there. We've had that from before. I just think, look, at the end of the day, we feel good about the position we see here because we've obviously got a big comp number against the low point last year. But we've seen kind of nice progression away from that and we've just now posted the highest order number for the year and the segment built a little bit of backlog and you have a really good comparison.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Correct.\nEric Ashleman: And some signs of optimism in just the conversations we're having with customers. Doesn't say when the next inflection comes, doesn't really talk about the magnitude of it. But having people leaning in the same direction here, that is one of the signs we wanted to see as we start to move away from just baseline stability.\nNathan Jones: Awesome. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Halloran with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Halloran: Hey good morning everyone. So first question kind of ties into a couple of answers that you already had. But maybe talk about, how you're thinking about the sequentials in fourth quarter. I know, Eric, I think you briefly mentioned there was some incremental project activity coming in there. But maybe talk about -- it doesn't seem like there's a change in your day rate, choppy, kind of stable, but choppy month-to-month, week-to-week kind of expectations. And how should we think about that into next year from a backlog order cadencing, et cetera, perspective? In other words, relatively normal sequentials, is that how you're thinking about things in the fourth quarter? Or is that a fair assumption to start next year until we see a change in the backdrop? Kind of any thoughts on how you're thinking about how the next few quarters here play out.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Yes. So let me take the Q3 to Q4 sequential, and I'll let Eric jump in. So if you kind of think about Q3 to Q4 and think about the guide that was laid out, it's really -- there are a few different places where we have projects that are in the backlog that we've done a lot of work on that are supposed to ship in Q4. So first is around ABEL. They ship big pumps in, and that's in the backlog that the teams are working on executing and getting out the door. Second place you see it is in pharma, in our MPT business where there's backlog that's booked that we are working on. It's a pretty late stage that's going to get up in Q4. And then the last I'd tell you is tied to Mott. We have a big energy project that's scheduled to go out at the end of the quarter. That's part of Q4 guide. So if you think about the sequential guide from Q3 to Q4, a decent part of the ramp is tied to a few different projects that I just laid out, and that's how we think about the ramp from Q3 to Q4.\nEric Ashleman: And then, look, past that, I think it's going to depend on what we sort of see play out here in the fourth quarter. I do think this is a period where everybody like us is kind forced to come in and consider their next calendar year, if they're on that cycle, in terms of what bets they're going to make, how they're going to make them. They kind of need to talk to critical suppliers like us as they do it. That would be an interesting source that would inflect it other way. But I think a continuation of stability, that seems reasonable as we go forward. And then it's really a question of what layers and on top of it, what are -- the state of health of commitments and the ability to make them kind of where are we sitting at that point with backlog of other projects, including any that might be there for Mott. We'll layer those in, and then we'll have those up-to-the-minute conversations, see what happened here. Of course, in the election, whether or not that triggered anything. So there's the usual number of suspects that would come in there. But it's been kind of a period of now 2 quarters of kind of base level stability. It at least allows you to then kind of see the pieces that rise above it with pretty good clarity or at least the fact that you need to keep digging for it.\nMike Halloran: So then let's move beyond kind of that horizon and you get towards the point where there is a recovery in the market. How would you think about the growth algorithm now that you've done an iterative reshaping of the portfolio here? You've centralized some resources or added central resources to support the decentralized model, the revenue synergy piece. Could you maybe help on the growth algorithm and then break it down by what the drivers or components of that growth look like from market to synergies, to outperformance or however else you want to categorize it?\nA \u2013 Eric Ashleman: Look, we now have a portfolio that is increasingly starting to weight itself to more faster-growing markets, all the ones that we've acquired into here in HST. And so that's becoming the biggest segment. It's going to carry more of the load as we go forward in periods like the ones you're describing, certainly somewhere off in the future. And so we would see kind of organic rates. We'd always want to outperform our core market entitlements, but we're moving that entitlement to the north. And so we'd like to start to dial IDEX into a kind of mid-single-digit grower plus as we start to navigate that. We'll continue deploy capital on the bottom line. I would say you put a point or two of inorganic growth on top of it, kind of take us to the higher single-digit range when you put the two together. That should allow a beautiful flow-through because these are high-margin businesses and high-margin differentiated markets. And we're still going to practice 80/20 in productivity. We're going to do a lot of it on the acquisitions that we acquired. And so you get nice double-digit earnings expansion through all of that. So slight uptick on the growth rate -- the core growth rates of IDEX because of what's happened in the portfolio, kind of maintenance of the additive dimension of inorganic, which we've demonstrated over the last three years, we've got a system and a method to do that. And then all of it lifting nicely because it's even more differentiated than before, and we continue to know how execute and practice 80/20 really, really well.\nMike Halloran: Very clear. Thanks, Eric.\nA \u2013 Eric Ashleman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Vlad Bystricky with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nVlad Bystricky: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my call this morning.\nA \u2013 Eric Ashleman: Good morning, Vlad.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Hey, Vlad.\nVlad Bystricky: So I just wanted to dig in on FMT a bit. Just in terms of your commentary and outlook around energy there, which I think you moved from stable to market softness. So can you just talk a little bit more about the dynamics you're seeing in energy in particular and how you're thinking about whether how much election impact might be having an impact on those end markets? Or anything else that you're seeing as sort of an overhang in those?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. I mean, there's -- first, there's two things here. One, I'd always kind of step back a little bit and remind people of the job we do here. We do a lot of downstream work around custody transfer. So as energy moves around the system, that's kind of where we do a lot of our work. Frankly, a lot of that is driven by things like people building trucks and laying in some infrastructure within that transportation system. We've got some overhang there from a really, really warm winter, that's probably spread over that sector throughout. We got a little bit of an artificial bump here to the downside because this was one of the businesses, you might remember, we had a consolidation -- a large-scale consolidation here a couple of years ago. This is one that if you go back in time about a year ago, we were still processing quite bit of backlog in that business. It was one of the last that we had that were kind of eating backlog that it accumulated. And so we got a bit of a comparison issue, because we're now at very standard IDEX levels of lead time and replenishment. So, there's always going to be a little bit of a calibration issue, particularly on a year-over-year basis. So I'd actually take this energy story and say, it's probably half of it that's us, half of it that is a little bit of the pressure there that you'd see in the market. And then just on the question of go forward, obviously, it's sort of an indirect relationship, but health of the energy sector overall will tend to promote CapEx deployment and all the things that eventually find their way downstream to the places where we do business. So we would prefer to have it rather than not. But to be honest, a really, really cold winter will also help, and that has very little to do with politics.\nVlad Bystricky: Okay. That's helpful, Eric. Appreciate it. And then maybe just sticking with FMT. Just in terms of the stability you've seen in sort of the day rate orders, any color or commentary you can give on what you're seeing by geography and whether you're seeing any meaningful differences in domestic versus international trends?\nEric Ashleman: Probably, as you suspect, I mean, North America leading the way. That's been the case now for a while, not just by a little but by a lot. I think reasonable stability in Europe. Not a lot of inflection, it moves around a little bit. It's not the bigger piece for us in this particular part of the business. I mean, we're more North American-centric anyways. And then I would say -- and when you go on the other side of the globe, that is a different story. I mean, almost anything we're doing in India right now is really, really good. I would say, China is -- while that story overall, of course, has some sobering characteristics, we've always been super surgical there. And so, it's probably trailing the pack because of where it is and what it's a part of. But we're more than holding our own, because we just -- we choose to make certain bets in certain places that are honestly they're very small, representative of the entirety of that economy. So if you're going to put them in order, probably I would say India first, but it's a smallest piece of IDEX; North America, strong, and that's driving a lot of it; Europe is stable and lagging a little bit behind. I'd probably put China at the back, but still positive for us.\nVlad Bystricky: Okay. Appreciate that. Thanks.\nEric Ashleman: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Sprague: Hey. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Hi, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Eric, hi. I want to come back just to the HST orders again and sort of blanket orders starting to come in. Eric, is there anything there in sort of the number of customers, the size of the orders that actually helps kind of firm up a view into 2025? Obviously, there's got to be some normalization going on here. So just your context, right, is maybe apparently the channel inventory liquidations have run their course and maybe we're getting to some sort of normalization here.\nEric Ashleman: I think even though, of course, it's a strong and sharp comparison year-over-year, when you actually dig into kind of each one of the entries, I think they're more generalized in terms of how you would interpolate them all. And you have to kind of add them all up and get some more general conclusions. But they're -- you put them all together, they are still positive. So -- and you cited one there. So the fact that these are laying in and laying in across the life science spectrum, it does tell you something about kind of a point of moving from stability towards something different. Again, the rate of advancement, the rate of inflection, still pretty vague and not really determined yet. I'd hold that up in that particular space. Just listen to comments that our teams are having with customers are the ones that are out there in the public, you hear optimism a little bit more. You hear some people talking about fleet aging and where we are in that side of the cycle, some things around consumables, which often lead the way for instruments at some point. And so there's like a little general pieces. But there is a preponderance of them on the right side the page as opposed to the last as we're kind of thinking of the space. And then if we just track over the history and sort of appreciate it quarter-to-quarter over the last year as it's walked this way, you can kind of see it building. I mean, it's a slow build and it doesn't really say what the slope is going to be at this point yet. But it's important. The inventory dynamic that you talked about, that's out there, too for HST. And reminder again, some of these are not life sciences or semi spaces. There are other ones. But those are areas of OEM-centric businesses and little higher customer concentration, and there have been some areas where those customers have had some inventory that we've been working around. And so the extent there's order patterns like this, it does suggest there too that you're further and further away from that. And then the fact that all of the reporting areas that we have, have got some level of organic health in the order side and it's uniform across the segment. Those are the kind of things again that just -- again, they're sort of rough and generalized, but they're important they're additively on the positive side of the ledger versus not.\nJeff Sprague: Understood. And then maybe just coming back to China. I think your prior comments on China just a moment ago were just on -- related to FMT, I apologize if they weren't. But can you just give us kind of the big picture view on China, how it performed in the quarter? And just any context on total IDEX price in the quarter also would be helpful? Thank you.\nEric Ashleman: Yes. On the first part, they're not far off, FMT versus full company because we have a lot of FMT presence there. Really that's kind of the lead segment with some things that we have in fire as well. And I would say it, put the two together, it's basically the same commentary. It's a tiny piece of a giant geography and it's kind of product line based. And so -- and we kind of move in and out depending on which way the wind is blowing. And so when we think we've got technical advantage, we go a little heavier with something that holds up better. And we generally, all of it stays in at least a positive category in an otherwise maybe not quite as positive story, again, which is still a small piece for the company, Abhi?\nAbhi Khandelwal: Yes. And then on the pricing question that you had, we saw about 2.3% price in the quarter and 100 basis point spread that we talked about as part of the guidance in Q2. So that's where we landed for the quarter.\nEric Ashleman: And that's been holding steady, both on the side of equation, yes.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Yes.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you for that. Have a good day. Appreciate it.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Buscaglia with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Hi. Good morning everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Good morning.\nAndrew Buscaglia: I wanted to ask on HST. You're talking about there's still a pickup in semis. Maybe a few questions there. Just what are the customers saying, is giving you insight into that comment, why we wouldn't see that pick up sooner than midyear next year? And then have you guys discussed the margin differential across those four subsegments within HST? And how would that impact the recovery for margins going from here?\nEric Ashleman: All right. Well, I'll take the first part and let Abhi chime in on the second. I mean I think from a semi perspective again, we do pretty narrow focused work there. We're involved in wafer manufacturing and fabrication and metrology, principally on really, really advanced solutions. That's where almost all of the IDEX pieces that do business do it. And I think really, it's a question of factory utilization. I mean, overall, it's until that hits certain levels and there's a catalyst identifiable that's either taken it there or looks like it's going to take it there in the near term, it just doesn't drive kind of big ticket items at a level yet that takes it up to another level. So there's been a series of pretty public announcements in that regard. I think a lot of people pointing to probably the lack of any singular big catalyst beyond, obviously, the things that are happening in AI, but that really doesn't present itself at this point in massive volume. It's more specialized. And so I think whether it's -- that's some kind of consumer gear or a return to lots of PCs that are more advanced than ever, those are the kind of things I think you'd be looking for to take and push the upper limits of those utilization rates to a point where you want to then get in line for some still pretty long lead time gear. And so given that nobody orders this kind of stuff today for delivery tomorrow, it does allow you to probably see into the future a little bit and make a projection like that. So it doesn't mean again that that's necessarily bad market for us. It's just we're kind of all waiting for the next cycle there. And we really are because we've got just an incredible amount of assets that are now positioned for it.\nAbhishek Khandelwal: Yeah. And so I'll take a stab of your margin question. So you kind of just think about where HST is. I mean, on a year-over-year basis, our HST margins were down 40 basis points on organic sales being down 5%, right? So I'd say it's a true testament to the work that our teams have done in rightsizing our businesses, frankly, because if you're down 5% organically and the teams didn't do the work they did to take out costs, you'd see a much higher decline on a year-over-year basis. So kudos to our team for rightsizing the size, coupled with driving productivity, coupled with the price/cost spread that we saw in the segment, right? So as you sit here today and look at a 26.5% EBITDA profile and then moving forward, what does that look like? So we announced the acquisition of Mott. We said it was low 20% EBITDA out of the gates. Then we laid out a very clear plan that demonstrates that we're going to generate 400 to 600 basis points of margin improvement in -- at Mott in the next 12 to 18 months. So when you put it all together, coupled with the organic growth coming back in the future, there's no reason for HST not to be a low 30% EBITDA business.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Maybe sticking with margins, your price cost has been good. But I feel like every few years, you guys have to navigate some sort of supply chain calamity. And with the election coming up, tariffs are now back in the news. So can you remind us like where you are with your positioning if indeed tariffs come back into the picture and how you're getting ready for that?\nEric Ashleman: Well, I mean, look, I think whether it's supply chain pressure that we experienced in the pandemic or it's an item like that, thinking about supply chain resilient, every company should be and we are we're doing that, too. I will remind people, I mean, as we saw this to our advantage in the pandemic, probably would be an advantage in this environment as well. We're much more localized in terms of ideating and orders placed within the same geography where we actually produce and sell. It doesn't mean there aren't cross-border shipments on the supply and input side. There are at certain levels and certain kind of base level commodities. But we do an awful lot of work within country. So as we think of tackling it, and we're, of course, running scenarios and talking about critical inputs like anybody else, we are appreciative that kind of we built the company around a model that tends to be more localized anyways.\nAndrew Buscaglia: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nBrett Linzey: Hey, good morning, all. I wanted to come back to the EBITDA bridge and specifically the resource investment/discretionary, that $12 million. Fairly big step-up sequentially versus Q1. I was hoping you could just unbundle those. Is the resource investment offset by lower discretionary? Or is this discretionary going up too? And then if you could maybe speak to some of those targeted investments and the paybacks.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Yes, let me take the bridge item first. So if you look at the bridge that we put out there on a year-over-year basis, you're seeing a $12 million headwind tied to the question you're asking. So I'd say, a-third of that is tied to higher M&A spend on a year-over-year basis given the fact that we just did our largest transaction with Mott. So that's about a-third of it. The other third is tied to stock comps and the timing of stock comp last year and the tailwind that we saw compared to this year. And then there is some discretionary spend in here tied to customer-facing T&E and the investments that we are making tied to growth initiatives on a year-over-year basis.\nBrett Linzey: Okay. Appreciate that. And then maybe just shifting back to Mott. So it sounds like you're running ahead there. Good integration progress. Should we think about the 2026 accretion target or expectation getting pulled forward based on this fast start? And does that change your thinking at all?\nAbhi Khandelwal: Well, look, we're early days. We're six weeks in the acquisition. We're working the plans, partnering with the local teams. Our teams and the Mott teams are partnering together and laying out a plan over the next 12 months. So it's early days so it's hard to pinpoint to what 2025 versus 2026 is going to do.\nEric Ashleman: I think part of what we want to convey here is that you always -- you're going to get a certain business and meet it, and then you pass the line, you close it. And of course, the reality is there. This reality is every bit as good as what we thought coming in.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Yeah.\nEric Ashleman: And the fact that we were able to integrate some teams as fast as we are, it's an 80s acquisition for us that we're all playing in. And we see as many possibilities do. It's just a real testament. That's the early read, the early excitement, there's still an awful lot of work to do. The world's got to play out. But at least want to make sure we got that out in front of you that at this point, couldn't be happier with what we acquired.\nBrett Linzey: Appreciate the details. Best of luck.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Giordano: Hey, good morning, guys. I wanted to touch on the other -- some of the other more recent M&A. So for EA, you guys lowered your expectations last quarter. Just curious, how that's tracking. And then also curious on Muon just given the semi push-outs you've talked about and one of your large customers gave some disappointing orders. So just curious what the latest is on those two businesses?\nAbhi Khandelwal: I'm sorry. Can you talk about what EA means? I'm not sure I followed you. Apologies.\nJoe Giordano: Sorry, sorry. Just focus on Muon. That was my mistake there. Just Muon, given like the weakness in orders at one of your large customers?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. I mean, look, that's a piece of that business. It's not -- by no means is it all of it or even the majority of it. So -- and even there, I mean, we're -- look, that business is doing -- a portion of it is doing some pretty advanced work that's actually well ahead of machines that are being delivered today. So there's not a one-for-one kind of corollary. So there's a few things there that help out on that side of it. And ultimately, at the end, long cycle, super well positioned. It's got some presence in med tech markets that are doing well because it's exiting some inventory positions. It's got another one that's actually in a very different adjacency as well. So it's not an entirely semi-driven business that is a decent component of it, but it's well positioned and at times a little different than you might suspect in terms of the production cycle. And the other two components, I think, pretty good and holding up. And it is a piece that we're now considering with other Applied Material Science Business technology businesses we have in terms of how all of it works together, including Mott. So we'll be doing some of that work and in some ways, kind of rescaling, recasting all of it together.\nJoe Giordano: Interesting. Okay. And then just curious on the sequential growth in HST. You said half of it was -- roughly half of it was like actual demand. Just curious on the Life Science side. Are we talking more like bioprocessing? Or is it more lab? Just kind of which cohort of customers is really driving that?\nEric Ashleman: Well, for us, it kind of almost has to be in the Analytical Instrumentation kind of course, space just because of our presence. We're not as pronounced in the bio areas.\nJoe Giordano: Perfect. Thanks, guys.\nEric Ashleman: Thank you\nOperator: Our next question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\nQ \u2013 Rob Wertheimer: I know it's late in the call, but Eric, I was listening to your prepared remarks and the conversion of analog processes and tools to digital is something you touched on before. I don't know if your comments were slightly more broad this time. And I'm wondering if you had any further expansion on how you're evolving -- how you guys operate on the team. Thank you.\nEric Ashleman: Yes. Look, it's a team that years ago was kind of harder for us to imagine across all of the smaller pieces of IDEX. But as we started to assemble scale more purposefully, actually this is one of the areas that we're applying it. And so I'll give you a couple of examples that kind of rise to the next level. Doing a lot of work on the front end of a lot of these outstanding FMT franchises, which are more fragmented, more industrial in nature, but the nature of the interactions between ourselves and end customers is more digital than ever. And as a leader in those spaces, I mean, the market is looking for us to kind of lead the way of how this work is going to be done, how does knowledge transfer happen. If somebody calls in and the looking for information, how many people has to manually intervene there versus some automated things that we can do? So we've got -- we've had for a while now, but we're starting to scale it more with some very focused initiatives to make sure that we are leading the way there like you would think a market leader would do. And you see a lot of that playing out at FMT. On the solutions side, this is not a ubiquitous solution, but you see it playing out in fire. We've talked about the automation there. It's a decent part of the growth and the strong numbers that they've put up. That's a slower to change industry, but it's starting to take and get some real traction there. And that's all about digital functionality and automation, helping solve this problem at crew size. We talked about our water businesses. At the core, all that hardware ultimately presents information that is shown digitally and is now more seamless and more integrated than it was before. So it's just -- I wanted to make sure that people appreciate that part of becoming a larger company and a little bit more thematic organization, you start to get benefits in this way. And we're participating in our own IDEX-like way.\nQ \u2013 Rob Wertheimer: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the floor back over to Eric Ashleman for any closing comments.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks so much. Thanks for everybody for joining today. I really appreciate the questions and the interest. And look, I think the bottom line here, still a choppy and uncertain world, no doubt. But we're in a good spot at IDEX. We're not out of the woods yet at HST, but it's really great to see the strong year-over-year orders comp, a modest backlog build, and the sequential orders uptick to the high point. We'll have to wait a bit, see how that recovery plays out from here. But look, I think we've strengthened our portfolio a lot as we prepare ourselves for a cycle of sunnier days ahead, no doubt, through the acquisitions. And Mott here at the end is a really good indicator of that. Our two other segments are doing really, really well with some nice pockets of growth. And execution, as always, at IDEX is strong across the board. We think the second half of the decade, which, by the way, is only two months away from starting, it's going to be a tremendous period of value creation overall for IDEX. And I really look forward to talking with you about it in the quarters to come. Thanks. Have a great day.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Thank you.\nWendy Palacios: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Abhi Khandelwal",
            "content": "Thanks, Eric. Turning to the consolidated financial results on slide 6. Please note that all comparisons are against the prior year period unless stated otherwise. Also, the acquisition of Mott is reflected in IDEX's consolidated and HST segment financials as of the close of the transaction on September 5. Third quarter orders of $781 million were up approximately 10% on a reported basis and up 8% organically. We saw orders growth across the portfolio with HST seeing 20% organic growth in the quarter, half of which was partially driven by blanket order activity that will ship in 2025. FSDP had low single-digit organic growth while FMT was essentially flat. We did see slight sequential growth in FMT orders. Third quarter sales of $798 million were up 1% reported and flat organically compared to the prior year. We experienced organic growth of 4% in FSDP and 2% in FMT. HST had a 5% organic decline driven by continued headwinds that I will cover in the upcoming slides. Third quarter gross margin was 44.3% and adjusted gross margin was 44.6%, an expansion of 20 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively. Gross margin expansion was driven by strong price/cost, partially offset by higher employee-related costs. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.9%, down 150 basis points. With the acquisition of Mott, our biggest acquisition to date, we had higher than typical M&A spending, which negatively impacted our margins by approximately 40 basis points. We are accelerating the integration of Mott and are excited to see the realization of the expected commercial synergies. We continue to leverage 80/20 across IDEX to deploy resources to growth and reduce complexity. I will discuss the drivers of third quarter adjusted EBITDA on the next slide in a moment. On a GAAP basis, our Q3 effective tax rate was 22.9% versus 20.2% in the prior year period. The prior year rate included certain onetime benefits, which contributed $0.11 of adjusted EPS in the prior year period. Third quarter net income was $119 million, resulting in GAAP EPS of $1.57. Adjusted net income was $144 million with an adjusted EPS of $1.90, down $0.22 or 10%. We achieved the higher end of our guide. And while our guidance did not include contributions from Mott or its related financing costs, these amounts essentially offset one another during the quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was $192 million, a decrease of 7%. We achieved a conversion rate of 133% of adjusted net income, a 400 basis point improvement on a year-over-year basis. We have a strong balance sheet, and this quarter, we paid over $50 million in cash dividends. We also funded the acquisition of Mott through the combination of approximately $212 million of cash, $279 million of borrowings from our revolving credit facility and $495 million net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes. We maintain a strong investment-grade rating with a 2.4 gross leverage ratio at the close of September. Moving on to Slide 7, which details the adjusted EBITDA drivers. For the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $11 million. Our organic sales volume decline of approximately 3% unfavorably impacted adjusted EBITDA by $9 million, flowing through at prior year adjusted gross margin rate. The negative volume flow-through was partially offset by strong price/cost spread of 100 basis points and operational productivity, resulting in a $10 million benefit over the prior year. In the quarter, we saw unfavorable mix, primarily in our industrial businesses and our dispensing businesses. We had higher employee-related costs and higher transaction-related expenses in connection with the acquisition of Mott. All these factors combined resulted in an unfavorable organic flow-through. The impact of FX slightly increased adjusted EBITDA by $1 million and acquisitions net of divestitures added $2 million on a quarter-over-quarter basis as the benefits from our acquisitions more than offset the impact on adjusted EBITDA from divested companies. I will now review segment level performance. Turning to Slide 8 and FMT segment. In Q3, we experienced sequential and mid-single-digit plus organic year-over-year growth in orders across the majority of our businesses. This growth was muted by continued ag cycle headwinds and push out in chemical project activity, resulting in total flat organic orders growth for FMT. Net sales were up 2% organically. We had strong price capture across the segment and experienced high single-digit growth in our industrials and intelligent water businesses. Total segment growth was unfavorably impacted by demand softness in our ag OEM and energy businesses. Our industrial day rates remain steady from Q2 with no change in overall market conditions. The strength in year-over-year organic growth in our Industrial business, was partially due to prior year comps. Our Intelligent Water portfolio continues to see strength in the North American municipal market with strong governmental funding to support ongoing investments. Our energy business are seeing headwinds from weather related in North America, slowdown in propane truck builds and distributor destocking and decreased demand for propane in Europe. Our ag OEM business remains challenged by the market slowdown. Despite this downturn, our teams remain focused, tackling the market headwinds and leveraging 80-20 to redeploy resources. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 160 basis points due to higher employee-related costs, discretionary spending and unfavorable mix, partially offset by price cost. Moving on to slide 9 and our HST segment. Orders grew sequentially and experienced a year-over-year organic growth of 20%. Growth was partially driven by blanket orders in life science and performance pneumatics businesses. Year-over-year comps were also a factor as life sciences, analytical instrumentation and semiconductor markets bottomed the same period last year. Our innovation funnel in life sciences remains active while there is no change in our outlook. Net sales were down 5% organically. Although we have strong price capture, it did not entirely offset the volume declines, driven by continued challenges in the end markets we serve. Our life sciences and analytical instrumentation businesses demand was steady sequentially from Q2 to Q3. Defense, aerospace and satellite communication end markets remained strong. We saw double-digit growth in the quarter. Within semicon, what we are seeing is a push-out in the end market recovery to the second half of next year. Our HST industrial light businesses continue to experience project delays. As I commented earlier, the acquisition of Mott is reflected in HST's segment financials as of the close of the transaction on September 5th. The integration of Mott is moving at a brisk pace. Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin for HST declined 40 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to lower volume and higher employee related costs, partially offset by price cost, favorable operational productivity, cost of work the teams have done to align with the current environment and the net accretive impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Now turning to slide 10. I'd like to take a moment to recognize our FSDP team's performance, delivering record sales and adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. Orders in our Fire &Safety/Diversified Products segment were up 4% organically, driven by Fire & Safety low double-digit growth, partially offset by declines in dispensing and BAND-IT. Net sales were up 4% organically. We had strong price capture and higher volumes, mainly driven by Fire & Safety and BAND-IT. Our Fire & Safety businesses continue to see growth in North America fire OEMs, and we are ramping production to meet their needs. BAND-IT experienced growth driven by strong aerospace demand, offsetting declines in industrial and auto. Our dispensing business experienced declines as expected, driven by headwinds from the North American big box retailer refresh cycle. Growth from the India market had been an offset to this headwind through the first half of this year, due to timing of projects in the emerging markets blending in the first half of 2024. Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin declined 20 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to unfavorable mix with positive price/cost offsetting higher employee-related costs. With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year on Slide 11. For the fourth quarter, we project organic sales to increase 3% to 4% compared to the prior year. We anticipate an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 27% with GAAP EPS in the range of $1.64 to $1.69 and adjusted EPS in the range of $2.01 to $2.06. On a year-over-year basis, we expect mid- to high single-digit organic growth in FMT and FSDP. In HST, we expect flat sales growth. Our full year adjusted EPS outlook remains unchanged and we expect organic revenues to decline 1% to 2% with an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 27%. We project GAAP diluted EPS to range from $6.65 to $6.70 and adjusted EPS to range from $7.85 to $7.90 in line with our prior guidance. The full year revenue guidance implies high single-digit organic sales decline in HST and low single-digit growth in FMT and FSDP. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric for closing remarks. Hey Deane. And Deane, just to build on Eric's narrative a little bit. So, if you just kind of think about Q3 and just maybe talking about SMT on the face, you see organic growth of 2%, if you will. But if you kind of take a step back and go a step deeper, within the FMT business, pumps and water grew high single-digit. You saw valves group grow high single-digit on an organic basis, which was offset by ag and energy. So, even within HST, the core industrial franchise was up high single-digit. Yeah. So Nathan, let me try and answer your question. So if you think about it sequentially from 3Q -- or 2Q to 3Q and look at HST, HST was up about $20 million. I'd say about half of that was blanket order activity that we saw from Q2 to Q3 and the other half was just straight demand between different businesses. And then if you think about year-over-year, HST posted about a $51 million organic change in orders on a year-over-year basis. That's, again the same kind of amount for blanket and half of that was demand. So you do see -- go ahead, Nathan. Yes, we are. Life sciences continues to be stable if you look at sequential. But there are markets, like we've said again, semicon is not at a point where it's inflecting. But we are seeing improvement even in our semicon markets sequentially. Correct. Yes. So let me take the Q3 to Q4 sequential, and I'll let Eric jump in. So if you kind of think about Q3 to Q4 and think about the guide that was laid out, it's really -- there are a few different places where we have projects that are in the backlog that we've done a lot of work on that are supposed to ship in Q4. So first is around ABEL. They ship big pumps in, and that's in the backlog that the teams are working on executing and getting out the door. Second place you see it is in pharma, in our MPT business where there's backlog that's booked that we are working on. It's a pretty late stage that's going to get up in Q4. And then the last I'd tell you is tied to Mott. We have a big energy project that's scheduled to go out at the end of the quarter. That's part of Q4 guide. So if you think about the sequential guide from Q3 to Q4, a decent part of the ramp is tied to a few different projects that I just laid out, and that's how we think about the ramp from Q3 to Q4. Hey, Vlad. Yes. And then on the pricing question that you had, we saw about 2.3% price in the quarter and 100 basis point spread that we talked about as part of the guidance in Q2. So that's where we landed for the quarter. Yes. Yes, let me take the bridge item first. So if you look at the bridge that we put out there on a year-over-year basis, you're seeing a $12 million headwind tied to the question you're asking. So I'd say, a-third of that is tied to higher M&A spend on a year-over-year basis given the fact that we just did our largest transaction with Mott. So that's about a-third of it. The other third is tied to stock comps and the timing of stock comp last year and the tailwind that we saw compared to this year. And then there is some discretionary spend in here tied to customer-facing T&E and the investments that we are making tied to growth initiatives on a year-over-year basis. Well, look, we're early days. We're six weeks in the acquisition. We're working the plans, partnering with the local teams. Our teams and the Mott teams are partnering together and laying out a plan over the next 12 months. So it's early days so it's hard to pinpoint to what 2025 versus 2026 is going to do. Yeah. I'm sorry. Can you talk about what EA means? I'm not sure I followed you. Apologies. Thank you."

            "name": "Eric Ashleman",
            "content": "Thanks, Wendy, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 3. Our IDEX teams drove strong Q3 results in an uncertain environment. Here are the highlights. We delivered nice organic growth supported by excellent margins in our Fluid & Metering Technology and Fire Safety and Diversified Products segments. Our free cash flow across IDEX of $192 million was 33% of adjusted net income. Execution through operational excellence was really strong overall. We're pleased to see orders growth within our Health & Science Technologies segment, and our teams are digging into the Mott acquisition with focus energy as we align around our best long-term growth prospects across all of our recent HST acquisitions. We have some important projects to deliver in Q4 in all segments that set us up well for next year. From the start of Q2 to the end of Q3, we really haven't seen a noticeable change in the macro environment. The recent interest rate drop by the Fed and China's stimulus announcements has yet to create positive ripple effects through improved certainty. An extremely close U.S. November election with polarized outcomes also isn't helping in the near term. Take all of that together, and we continue to see an environment where day-to-day order rates remain stable with an absence of larger long-term project commitments. This dynamic really holds true in the more fragmented industrial markets of FMT. We're encouraged by an increase in quoting activity as we move from summer to fall and we don't see projects moving from delayed to canceled. We'll watch for signs either way as many customers move more formally consider their capital and OpEx deployment within calendar budget cycles. We continue to see strength within our intelligent water markets, and I'll talk more about our focused efforts there on the next slide. Within the Health & Science Technologies segment, we saw a robust Q3 organic orders increase partially driven by blanket orders, many of them landing within our IDEX Health & Science business. Admittedly, we're comparing to the low point of last year, but we drove year-over-year order increases in all of our major HST reporting areas. We booked a bit of backlog overall this quarter, and we posted a nice sequential uptick to our highest order point in 2024. We are encouraged by these trends within HST, but remain cautious as we consider the trajectory of recovery within our most important markets. Our defense, aerospace and satellite communication markets are strong. They experienced double-digit growth within the quarter. However, most major semiconductor customers are pushing out the next industry inflection point into at least the midpoint of 2025. Life Sciences and analytical instrumentation customers are more positive than they have been. They're innovating at a rapid clip and launching a lot of new gear. But they, too, are pretty noncommittal to the timing of next level growth rates. Our teams continue to deploy resources toward their best long-term growth prospects with an eye towards applied materials science technology synergies as we integrate Mott alongside our recent HST acquisitions. Fire Safety and Diversified Products had a solid quarter exceeding expectations, achieving record sales performance. Our fire business continues to grow share and scale production to meet North American OEM multiyear backlogs. BAND-IT experienced strong growth from aerospace demand. Finally, recall our dispensing business was impacted by top-line headwinds of $40 million from the end of a large 2023 North American large retailer replenishment cycle, but our teams continue to work to offset that pressure by delivering strong growth within emerging markets. We've closed that year-over-year gap considerably, delivering over 15,000 units from our new facility in India, just opened in April of last year. As an aside, I want to thank our team members from IDEX Fire & Safety, who chipped in to help people in North Carolina following the devastation from the remnants of Hurricane Helene. Finally, we're thrilled to formally close on the Mott acquisition this quarter. Things are really exciting there. We'll share more details on the progress of the integration activities and some of the benefits we are experiencing early on in a slide to follow. Turning to slide 4. Our intelligent water platform continues to be a bright spot for us. We see significant opportunities now and in the future as municipalities and industries around the world cope with the impacts of climate change as they navigate dynamic regulatory and funding ecosystems to support the best use and management of water. Water management is a sector that has classically been slow to change. Those days are over. Our aging and neglected infrastructure just can't handle the demands of expanding populations and increasingly severe weather events. What was once underground and out of sight is now impossible to ignore. What was once analog and manual is now increasingly digital and automated. And federal, regulatory and funding support is stepping in to drive growth from above within a typically bottoms up local and regional landscape. And our teams are ready to meet the challenge. Below ground, IDEX Intelligent Water aims to be the collection system experts, monitoring flow of storm water and identifying small issues before they become big ones. Above ground, our teams help protect the environment with solutions that treat water and reduce the amount being used in critical processes. You see some examples here on the slide. The Envirosight Verisight ultra camera inspection system gives teams better capabilities for remote inspection of sewers in more challenging environments than before. Most recent addition to the platform is Subterra, which acquired about three months ago. This rapid sewer screening solution complements our core inspection technologies with iPEK, Envirosight and WinCan. Subterra's SewerScout floats untethered downstream, capturing three-dimensional data along the way. The market needs a simple condition assessment tool in their wastewater collection systems, specifically for large pipes that are rarely inspected. Subterra's Technologies performing within an integrated digital analytics suite addresses that need and expands our overall IDEX expertise in this space. And yet another example of IDEX serving semiconductor manufacturers, the Quantum XT ultrapure water heater and pumps from Trevor continues to save billions of leaders of ultrapure water. In this market, Trevor's innovation displaced in a established heater pump manufacturer that didn't recognize or address quickly enough the semiconductor industry's needs to reduce water consumption. Now, turning to slide 5 and an update on our acquisition of Mott Corporation. Less than two months since completing our acquisition of Mott, the partnership is off to a fast start. A few high-potential IDEX team members have formally joined the Mott leadership team in the earliest days of acquisition integration. This gives the Mott team a living key into the rest of IDEX to drive collaborative efficiency. While it's too soon to share specifics, teams from Mott and other IDEX units within HST are already working on innovative new solutions together to leverage Mott's highly engineered filtration technologies. In one instance, a combined team has rapidly developed a customer-ready prototype in the first 90 days of Mott being part of IDEX. Frankly, it's been tremendous to see. As you can see in the photo on the right of slide 5 earlier this month, Mott opened its third manufacturing facility in Connecticut. This plant quadruples Mott's production capacity for custom design ultra-thin porous metal sheets, which are a critical component in the generation of green hydrogen, a low emission fuel essential for world's energy transition. The picture on the left shows Mott's high-purity operations where point-of-use gas filters used in the semiconductor industry are laser marked, pressure and helium leak tested, inspected then pulse cleaned before bagging. As a reminder, Mott is a leader in the design and manufacturing of centered porous material structures and flow control solutions. The Mott team has deep material science knowledge and process control capabilities. Their business complementary to our broader applied materials science technology businesses within HST, including Muon, STC Material Solutions and Optical Technologies. We're excited about Mott's history of execution the robust backlog funnel that is built to date with key project deliveries as we close out 2024. With that, I'll turn it over to Abhi to discuss our financial results. Thanks, Abhi. I'm on Slide 12. Look, it's easy to get caught up in the economic uncertainties that play out quarter-to-quarter. It's been a frustrating last couple of years as we've seen the last echoes of the pandemic play out against an uncertain geopolitical environment, an environment made more uncertain globally by the unprecedented number of 2024 national elections. We've managed well throughout this period. We've improved the long-term growth prospects of IDEX significantly through incredibly focused work within a proprietary M&A funnel. We have some outstanding people and technologies at our disposal to develop trusted solutions to our customers' most difficult problems. We're building relative and absolute scale across business units to support advantaged markets like water, which we discussed today, advanced semiconductor wafer fabrication, Life Sciences and Analytical Instrumentation and space and defense. We're rapidly digitizing traditionally analog applications throughout IDEX as we transform everything from customer acquisition and support to core product functionality. And we continue to grow through our jump-off points within Asia Pacific as these developing markets reach economic trigger points to adopt IDEX advanced technologies. We sometimes take our abilities to execute for granted. We shouldn't. 80/20 isn't a tool at IDEX. It's evolved into an intuitive headset. We can size up the critical view quicker than others and swing our best people to our biggest challenges and opportunities without the need for time-wasting decision loops. Finally, we're talking about collaboration across business boundaries to build scale more than we have in the past. And some have asked if this challenge is the notion of a decentralized IDEX. It doesn't. We've built our culture intentionally over the last 15 years to prepare us for this moment. Our teams collaborate and help each other naturally without stifling structure and bureaucracy to win for customers. We live our purpose every day through our commitment to our core values of trust, team, and excellence. Thanks again to our IDEX employees and partners around the world for all that you do to make IDEX a great company. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions. Morning Deane. Yes. As I said kind of in the opening comments, I mean, they've been stable for a while without really a lot of inflection. So, you don't really see anything different through the summer months month-to-month as it played out in the quarter. A lot of it looks pretty similar to where we were in Q2. And of course, we've got the businesses that are closest to consumption. We track those all the time. They've been steady with a little bit of lift in in them, and we see that playing out the numbers that we posted in kind of our core industrial units here. And so I think good shape on those indicators that the kind of industrial system continues and it's -- we're still making things in plants all across the country, and we're maintaining it. That's kind of what a lot of that indicates. The project and the longer-term commitments, I think that's in about the same place, too. The uncertainty and the overhang of, obviously, the election coming up next week, where that's going to take us, those kind of things, I think it's still sort of out there in the way. We're always looking to see if any of those projects start to suddenly move into a category of either delayed -- or canceled instead of delayed or just not talked about any longer. We don't see that. I actually made a comment about the fact that quoting activity, in fact, is picking up a little bit. which I think is a good sign. And then I'm sure we'll get to it at a certain point, we've got a little bit of revenue ramp here in Q4 and almost all of that is project related with a couple of key things that are in the backlog now. Some of them are underway and near completion and I think are also good signs of confidence of the time that's out ahead of us. Yeah. Well, thanks. We appreciate talking to you and others at that show. And you mentioned a key word. We -- in our commentary about kind of our businesses in that area, we pointed to becoming the collection experts. That's really the work we do here. And that has a lot of focus right there, obviously, through things like Stormwater and significant weather events. That's where you see that play out. And so I think we've got the assets positioned in the right place to really, really focus. And as you saw, they work together. They work together in a way where the hardware and analytics help to give you this predictive insight into not just what's going on in your system in front of you, but what's likely to occur in the future. And I think one of the reasons we're winning is, we think about our end customers, it's certainly operating professionals who are trying to run the system. We have significant customer bases that are specification engineers and project engineers within municipalities and industries. And what they're trying to do is, understand the analytics of the system, the way that kind of the water circuit works, if you will. And then they're trying to put that together to obtain capital project approval. And so at this particular phase of the cycle, the cycle has got more positive funding support with longer duration. Being able to understand your system, so that that you can position yourselves to get funding for your municipality or business is really, really important, and it kind of points right back to the core work that we do. That's sometimes underappreciated and really thinks of kind of day-to-day monitoring, but this very specific engineering kind of partnership that helps people understand their system better, actually allows them to go grab funding that is more available now than it has been. Sorry, you also asked about, yeah, other pieces and things and kind of where we are. I mean, there's -- Subterra is a good example. That's sort of probably an under-the-radar, underappreciated technology that we very much appreciated. We've been working with that company before. And it really helps kind of complete capabilities for us. There are other things we would like to do here within kind of this ecosystem of collection. And so we continue to work in the funnel. We continue to look at things and we're very much -- it is in 80s for us in terms of an area that we would like to make larger, both organically and inorganically overtime. Thanks Deane. Good morning, Nathan. Yeah. It's a great question. And that's a great spot to talk about it. I mean, think of it a little bit as it's kind of -- these areas where we put some scale together, they present themselves as kind of mini versions IDEX. And when you step back from IDEX, I mean, one of the ways that we work it the way that we do is nimbly and agilely as we do. It's a super flat organizational structure. So we have a leader of the water business. And between kind of that leader and leaders of individual pieces of water, I mean, there's not a lot of stacking. So think of this as wide and horizontal more than vertical. That's one of the keys here. And the quality of the people, the quality of the system and operating model allows you to take that span a little bit wider. And so you already got something working for you in terms of being close to the point of impact with all leaders. So that's a key ingredient, doesn't change, it's always been part of IDEX and is as we do this work. But it comes down to strategy. A lot of this -- this is why we work so intensively in terms of building strategy and strategic capabilities and doing it in focused 80s areas of IDEX, so that we would be prepared to understand these worlds and why things need to go together and where they don't. And so in every one of these points, we know the difference between an area where there is collaboration and people are working together because the customer cares about it versus other areas where life goes on in individual pieces and specialized segments, which is -- that's where I think a lot of customers -- or companies get caught. They over-rotate one way or the other. We're actually very comfortable delivering in a hybrid world, because we have ever since I've worked at IDEX. We're just becoming a bit more focused to putting some of the scale to work because the solution set demands it. The problems are harder, they're evolving. They're earlier stages of evolution, so you need more power in the system. So it really does lever everything we've ever thought about in terms of 80-20, everything we do culturally, which celebrates flat organizations and a lack of bureaucracy. And probably the secret sauce for all of it is talent and development that that we do internally to make sure leaders are built in a certain way that they can operate with all of that autonomy. And then reminder -- yeah, just to finish. I mean, we have half of this segment that kind of is in other high-tech areas that are not in the usual suspects of semiconductor and life science and analytical instrumentation. And those, I mean, they're performing a lot like the industrial businesses that we see elsewhere. So we've got some growth and list there. We've had that from before. I just think, look, at the end of the day, we feel good about the position we see here because we've obviously got a big comp number against the low point last year. But we've seen kind of nice progression away from that and we've just now posted the highest order number for the year and the segment built a little bit of backlog and you have a really good comparison. And some signs of optimism in just the conversations we're having with customers. Doesn't say when the next inflection comes, doesn't really talk about the magnitude of it. But having people leaning in the same direction here, that is one of the signs we wanted to see as we start to move away from just baseline stability. And then, look, past that, I think it's going to depend on what we sort of see play out here in the fourth quarter. I do think this is a period where everybody like us is kind forced to come in and consider their next calendar year, if they're on that cycle, in terms of what bets they're going to make, how they're going to make them. They kind of need to talk to critical suppliers like us as they do it. That would be an interesting source that would inflect it other way. But I think a continuation of stability, that seems reasonable as we go forward. And then it's really a question of what layers and on top of it, what are -- the state of health of commitments and the ability to make them kind of where are we sitting at that point with backlog of other projects, including any that might be there for Mott. We'll layer those in, and then we'll have those up-to-the-minute conversations, see what happened here. Of course, in the election, whether or not that triggered anything. So there's the usual number of suspects that would come in there. But it's been kind of a period of now 2 quarters of kind of base level stability. It at least allows you to then kind of see the pieces that rise above it with pretty good clarity or at least the fact that you need to keep digging for it. Yes. I mean, there's -- first, there's two things here. One, I'd always kind of step back a little bit and remind people of the job we do here. We do a lot of downstream work around custody transfer. So as energy moves around the system, that's kind of where we do a lot of our work. Frankly, a lot of that is driven by things like people building trucks and laying in some infrastructure within that transportation system. We've got some overhang there from a really, really warm winter, that's probably spread over that sector throughout. We got a little bit of an artificial bump here to the downside because this was one of the businesses, you might remember, we had a consolidation -- a large-scale consolidation here a couple of years ago. This is one that if you go back in time about a year ago, we were still processing quite bit of backlog in that business. It was one of the last that we had that were kind of eating backlog that it accumulated. And so we got a bit of a comparison issue, because we're now at very standard IDEX levels of lead time and replenishment. So, there's always going to be a little bit of a calibration issue, particularly on a year-over-year basis. So I'd actually take this energy story and say, it's probably half of it that's us, half of it that is a little bit of the pressure there that you'd see in the market. And then just on the question of go forward, obviously, it's sort of an indirect relationship, but health of the energy sector overall will tend to promote CapEx deployment and all the things that eventually find their way downstream to the places where we do business. So we would prefer to have it rather than not. But to be honest, a really, really cold winter will also help, and that has very little to do with politics. Probably, as you suspect, I mean, North America leading the way. That's been the case now for a while, not just by a little but by a lot. I think reasonable stability in Europe. Not a lot of inflection, it moves around a little bit. It's not the bigger piece for us in this particular part of the business. I mean, we're more North American-centric anyways. And then I would say -- and when you go on the other side of the globe, that is a different story. I mean, almost anything we're doing in India right now is really, really good. I would say, China is -- while that story overall, of course, has some sobering characteristics, we've always been super surgical there. And so, it's probably trailing the pack because of where it is and what it's a part of. But we're more than holding our own, because we just -- we choose to make certain bets in certain places that are honestly they're very small, representative of the entirety of that economy. So if you're going to put them in order, probably I would say India first, but it's a smallest piece of IDEX; North America, strong, and that's driving a lot of it; Europe is stable and lagging a little bit behind. I'd probably put China at the back, but still positive for us. Yes. Hi, Jeff. I think even though, of course, it's a strong and sharp comparison year-over-year, when you actually dig into kind of each one of the entries, I think they're more generalized in terms of how you would interpolate them all. And you have to kind of add them all up and get some more general conclusions. But they're -- you put them all together, they are still positive. So -- and you cited one there. So the fact that these are laying in and laying in across the life science spectrum, it does tell you something about kind of a point of moving from stability towards something different. Again, the rate of advancement, the rate of inflection, still pretty vague and not really determined yet. I'd hold that up in that particular space. Just listen to comments that our teams are having with customers are the ones that are out there in the public, you hear optimism a little bit more. You hear some people talking about fleet aging and where we are in that side of the cycle, some things around consumables, which often lead the way for instruments at some point. And so there's like a little general pieces. But there is a preponderance of them on the right side the page as opposed to the last as we're kind of thinking of the space. And then if we just track over the history and sort of appreciate it quarter-to-quarter over the last year as it's walked this way, you can kind of see it building. I mean, it's a slow build and it doesn't really say what the slope is going to be at this point yet. But it's important. The inventory dynamic that you talked about, that's out there, too for HST. And reminder again, some of these are not life sciences or semi spaces. There are other ones. But those are areas of OEM-centric businesses and little higher customer concentration, and there have been some areas where those customers have had some inventory that we've been working around. And so the extent there's order patterns like this, it does suggest there too that you're further and further away from that. And then the fact that all of the reporting areas that we have, have got some level of organic health in the order side and it's uniform across the segment. Those are the kind of things again that just -- again, they're sort of rough and generalized, but they're important they're additively on the positive side of the ledger versus not. Yes. On the first part, they're not far off, FMT versus full company because we have a lot of FMT presence there. Really that's kind of the lead segment with some things that we have in fire as well. And I would say it, put the two together, it's basically the same commentary. It's a tiny piece of a giant geography and it's kind of product line based. And so -- and we kind of move in and out depending on which way the wind is blowing. And so when we think we've got technical advantage, we go a little heavier with something that holds up better. And we generally, all of it stays in at least a positive category in an otherwise maybe not quite as positive story, again, which is still a small piece for the company, Abhi? And that's been holding steady, both on the side of equation, yes. Thank you. Good morning. All right. Well, I'll take the first part and let Abhi chime in on the second. I mean I think from a semi perspective again, we do pretty narrow focused work there. We're involved in wafer manufacturing and fabrication and metrology, principally on really, really advanced solutions. That's where almost all of the IDEX pieces that do business do it. And I think really, it's a question of factory utilization. I mean, overall, it's until that hits certain levels and there's a catalyst identifiable that's either taken it there or looks like it's going to take it there in the near term, it just doesn't drive kind of big ticket items at a level yet that takes it up to another level. So there's been a series of pretty public announcements in that regard. I think a lot of people pointing to probably the lack of any singular big catalyst beyond, obviously, the things that are happening in AI, but that really doesn't present itself at this point in massive volume. It's more specialized. And so I think whether it's -- that's some kind of consumer gear or a return to lots of PCs that are more advanced than ever, those are the kind of things I think you'd be looking for to take and push the upper limits of those utilization rates to a point where you want to then get in line for some still pretty long lead time gear. And so given that nobody orders this kind of stuff today for delivery tomorrow, it does allow you to probably see into the future a little bit and make a projection like that. So it doesn't mean again that that's necessarily bad market for us. It's just we're kind of all waiting for the next cycle there. And we really are because we've got just an incredible amount of assets that are now positioned for it. Well, I mean, look, I think whether it's supply chain pressure that we experienced in the pandemic or it's an item like that, thinking about supply chain resilient, every company should be and we are we're doing that, too. I will remind people, I mean, as we saw this to our advantage in the pandemic, probably would be an advantage in this environment as well. We're much more localized in terms of ideating and orders placed within the same geography where we actually produce and sell. It doesn't mean there aren't cross-border shipments on the supply and input side. There are at certain levels and certain kind of base level commodities. But we do an awful lot of work within country. So as we think of tackling it, and we're, of course, running scenarios and talking about critical inputs like anybody else, we are appreciative that kind of we built the company around a model that tends to be more localized anyways. I think part of what we want to convey here is that you always -- you're going to get a certain business and meet it, and then you pass the line, you close it. And of course, the reality is there. This reality is every bit as good as what we thought coming in. And the fact that we were able to integrate some teams as fast as we are, it's an 80s acquisition for us that we're all playing in. And we see as many possibilities do. It's just a real testament. That's the early read, the early excitement, there's still an awful lot of work to do. The world's got to play out. But at least want to make sure we got that out in front of you that at this point, couldn't be happier with what we acquired. Thank you. Yeah. I mean, look, that's a piece of that business. It's not -- by no means is it all of it or even the majority of it. So -- and even there, I mean, we're -- look, that business is doing -- a portion of it is doing some pretty advanced work that's actually well ahead of machines that are being delivered today. So there's not a one-for-one kind of corollary. So there's a few things there that help out on that side of it. And ultimately, at the end, long cycle, super well positioned. It's got some presence in med tech markets that are doing well because it's exiting some inventory positions. It's got another one that's actually in a very different adjacency as well. So it's not an entirely semi-driven business that is a decent component of it, but it's well positioned and at times a little different than you might suspect in terms of the production cycle. And the other two components, I think, pretty good and holding up. And it is a piece that we're now considering with other Applied Material Science Business technology businesses we have in terms of how all of it works together, including Mott. So we'll be doing some of that work and in some ways, kind of rescaling, recasting all of it together. Well, for us, it kind of almost has to be in the Analytical Instrumentation kind of course, space just because of our presence. We're not as pronounced in the bio areas. Thank you Yes. Look, it's a team that years ago was kind of harder for us to imagine across all of the smaller pieces of IDEX. But as we started to assemble scale more purposefully, actually this is one of the areas that we're applying it. And so I'll give you a couple of examples that kind of rise to the next level. Doing a lot of work on the front end of a lot of these outstanding FMT franchises, which are more fragmented, more industrial in nature, but the nature of the interactions between ourselves and end customers is more digital than ever. And as a leader in those spaces, I mean, the market is looking for us to kind of lead the way of how this work is going to be done, how does knowledge transfer happen. If somebody calls in and the looking for information, how many people has to manually intervene there versus some automated things that we can do? So we've got -- we've had for a while now, but we're starting to scale it more with some very focused initiatives to make sure that we are leading the way there like you would think a market leader would do. And you see a lot of that playing out at FMT. On the solutions side, this is not a ubiquitous solution, but you see it playing out in fire. We've talked about the automation there. It's a decent part of the growth and the strong numbers that they've put up. That's a slower to change industry, but it's starting to take and get some real traction there. And that's all about digital functionality and automation, helping solve this problem at crew size. We talked about our water businesses. At the core, all that hardware ultimately presents information that is shown digitally and is now more seamless and more integrated than it was before. So it's just -- I wanted to make sure that people appreciate that part of becoming a larger company and a little bit more thematic organization, you start to get benefits in this way. And we're participating in our own IDEX-like way.\nQ \u2013 Rob Wertheimer: Perfect. Thank you. Thanks so much. Thanks for everybody for joining today. I really appreciate the questions and the interest. And look, I think the bottom line here, still a choppy and uncertain world, no doubt. But we're in a good spot at IDEX. We're not out of the woods yet at HST, but it's really great to see the strong year-over-year orders comp, a modest backlog build, and the sequential orders uptick to the high point. We'll have to wait a bit, see how that recovery plays out from here. But look, I think we've strengthened our portfolio a lot as we prepare ourselves for a cycle of sunnier days ahead, no doubt, through the acquisitions. And Mott here at the end is a really good indicator of that. Our two other segments are doing really, really well with some nice pockets of growth. And execution, as always, at IDEX is strong across the board. We think the second half of the decade, which, by the way, is only two months away from starting, it's going to be a tremendous period of value creation overall for IDEX. And I really look forward to talking with you about it in the quarters to come. Thanks. Have a great day."

It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Wendy Palacios, Vice President, Investor Relations, FP&A. Wendy, please go ahead.\nWendy Palacios: Good morning, everyone. This is Wendy Palacios, Vice President of FP&A and Investor Relations for IDEX Corporation. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the IDEX second quarter 2024 financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the three months ending June 30th, 2024. The press release, along with the presentation to be used during today's webcast, can be accessed at our investor website at investor.idexcorp.com. Joining me today are Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer and President; and Abhi Khandelwal, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. Turning to Slide 2. Please note that during today's call, we will present certain non-GAAP financial measures. We will also make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today, and we do not assume any obligation to update that. Information regarding these factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements is available on our website and our SEC filings. With that, I'll now turn this call over to CEO and President, Eric Ashleman.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Wendy and good morning everyone. I'm on Slide 3. IDEX delivered against expectations in Q2 despite increasing macro uncertainty, with both adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted EPS coming in slightly above our previous guidance. I'd like to thank the IDEX teams around the world for their strong execution on behalf of our customers and shareholders. As mentioned on our first quarter call, we saw a noticeable uptick in industrial day rates in our closest to consumption FMT businesses in December. This continued through the end of February, but pulled back a bit in March as a surprisingly firm inflation report reduced the likelihood of near-term interest rate relief. These daily order rates are largely stable now and in line with our original 2024 assumptions. However, as the U.S. election cycle has come into full daily view, creating even more uncertainty given the perceived disparity of outcomes, we've seen a pullback in project commitments. There's no talk of project cancellation, just a quarter or two push to the right. We'll continue to watch these businesses as open economic and political questions are resolved for any early signs of inflection. Within the HST segment, we don't yet have enough growth catalysts to overcome the pressures facing our life science and analytical instrumentation markets. Our HST industrial markets are performing as described earlier for FMT, with stable day rates and preferred -- deferred project activity. Despite some encouraging discussions from our semiconductor customers asking us to get ready to launch, to support the next cycle of growth, we just haven't seen yet turn into accelerating releases or increased order positions. We think we're close here as most major players are pointing to likely strong growth in 2025. Life sciences and analytical instrumentation performed in line with expectations, with a strong focus on innovations to support the next cycle of growth and excellent productivity to support margins as we await market recovery. As we said at the beginning of the year, we believe we are unlikely to see positive inflection for these markets, until 2025. FSDP had a strong quarter. Our dispensing teams are performing exceptionally well within emerging markets. Their share gains within India are nicely offsetting much of the pressure from their North American markets, as large retailers step back following a strong two-year replenishment cycle. Our Fire business continues to grow, as industry throughput improves. They're also growing share through higher adoption of mobile platform automation. Finally, BAND-IT was affected by softness in auto and industrial demand, but continues to deliver very strong above-average profitability. Finally, we were thrilled last week to announce the acquisition of Mott. We'll talk a bit more about the company in a moment, as we update our work within capital deployment. Turning to Slide 4. Although market headwinds persist, we are leveraging our strong technical and innovation capabilities as well as our close customer partnerships to position our business for growth across technology-enabled markets and applications. Our materials processing technology, MP350 Microlyser Processor, won the Biotech Innovation Award at Interfax, the leading global pharmaceutical and biotechnology conference. The MP350 is designed for production scale cell disruption, which is used in the manufacturing of many biotech products, such as antigens for vaccines and viral vectors supporting gene therapy. In the life sciences area, our new Melles Griot XPLAN CCG Lens Series, imaging system, released in February, is providing customer access to superior quality optics with off-the-shelf lead time. This aligns with our strategy to deliver leading innovation and operational scale to support our customers from prototype to production, positioning us well for growth. During the second quarter, our intelligent water inspection team at EPAC launched Verisighht Ultra. This inspection technology tackles challenging infrastructures with remote access and an intuitive digital interface, capturing and converting data into powerful insights in the inspection of wastewater management systems. This is one of the many examples of how we're helping municipalities deliver clean water to their communities. We also received customer approval at our Trebor business for the next generation of sustainable Ultra Pure Water Heater and pump applications used to support the semiconductor wafer fabrication process. The Quantum NXT heaters have saved semiconductor manufacturers over 0.5 billion liters of ultra-pure water this year alone. We anticipate this will provide long-term growth as the semiconductor market reaccelerates. And in our Fire & Safety group, our teams unveiled the WildCAT solution for brush trucks used to fight wildland fires. Through a touchscreen application in the cab, firefighters can take control of essential water path functions, while stationary or on the move, in a much safer environment. With wildfire season clearly upon us in North America, this is a critical solution that can really make a difference. Now, turning to our disciplined capital deployment initiative on Slide 5, we continue to lever our strong balance sheet to tune our portfolio for profitable growth through strategic acquisitions. Last week, we announced the acquisition of Mott Corporation, a leader in the design and manufacturing of centered porous material structures and flow control solutions with deep material science knowledge and process control capabilities. Mott develops highly engineered configurable mission-critical solutions for scalable high-quality applications. Their business is complementary to our broader Applied Materials Science Technology businesses within HST, including Nuon, STC and Optical Technologies. And perhaps most impressively, they deliver for customers with an outstanding culture that fits really well with ours. We believe the addition of Mott, will deliver value for IDEX, via strong organic growth, EBITDA margin expansion to above HST average and near-term EPS accretion. In addition to Mott, we acquired a small company, Subterra, on July 25. Subterra's technologies help digitize underground infrastructure. It will become part of the intelligent water platform within our FMT segment, adding an important piece to our analytics solution across wastewater collection systems. Finally, as we optimize our portfolio, we continually reconsider the long-term growth prospects for all of our businesses. Occasionally and typically with smaller companies that like a path to scale, we decide to sell to an owner that can better maximize potential. During the second quarter, we divested Alfa Valvole for $45.5 million in cash. They operated within our FMT segment. With that, I'll turn it over to Abhi to discuss our financial results.\nAbhi Khandelwal : Thanks, Eric. Turning to the consolidated financial results on Slide 6. Please note that all comparisons are against the prior year period, unless otherwise stated. Orders of $773 million were up 1% on a reported basis and up 2% organically. We saw mid single-digit organic growth in FSDP and HST, which were partially offset by a mid single-digit decline in FMT, driven by projects being pushed to the right. Second quarter sales of $807 million was down 5% reported and 4% organically. We experienced an 11% decline in HST, while FMT and FSDP were essentially flat as compared to the prior year period. Second quarter gross margin and adjusted gross margin were 45.4%, an expansion of 70 basis points, driven by strong price cost and favorable operational productivity, partially offset by unfavorable mix, higher employee-related costs and lower volume leverage. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.8%, down 60 basis points. However, as compared to Q1, adjusted EBITDA was up 180 basis points. The strong sequential expansion highlights our team's continued focus on deploying 80, 20 and to drive profitability, as we manage through challenging market dynamics. I will discuss the drivers of second quarter adjusted EBITDA on the next slide in a moment. On a GAAP basis, our Q2 effective tax rate was 21.2% versus 22.4% in the prior period. The decrease was primarily due to a discrete benefit from research and development incentive resolution related to prior years from an international taxing authority. Second quarter net income was $141 million, generating an EPS of $1.86. Adjusted net income was $156 million with adjusted EPS of $2.06, down $0.12. Free cash flow for the quarter was $118 million, a decrease of 2%. We achieved a conversion rate of 75% of adjusted net income, a 310 basis-point improvement on a year-over-year basis. We have a strong balance sheet, and this quarter, we repaid $25 million of the $50 million previously outstanding debt under our term facility, and we paid $52.2 million in cash dividends. The dividend was our 119th consecutive quarterly dividend payout. Moving on to Slide 7, which details the adjusted EBITDA drivers. For the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $17 million. The 4% organic sales reduction unfavorably impacted adjusted EBITDA decreased by $17 million. The 4% organic sales reduction unfavorably impacted adjusted EBITDA by $23 million, flowing through at our prior year adjusted gross margin rate. The negative volume flow-through was partially offset by strong price cost spread of 100 basis points in the quarter and operational productivity, resulting in a $13 million benefit over the prior year. In the quarter, we saw unfavorable mix driven by dispensing and lower overall industrial activity. These factors resulted in a negative 48.7% organic flow-through. The impact of FX lowered adjusted EBITDA by $1 million, while acquisitions net of divestitures was flat on a quarter-over-quarter basis, as the benefits from our acquisitions were offset by adjusted EBITDA from divested companies. This resulted in a negative 42.4% flow-through for the second quarter. I will now review segment level performance. Turning to slide 8 and FMT segment. In Q2, orders decreased 4% organically, driven primarily by the cyclical decline in the ag market and push out industrial project activity, as Eric discussed in his opening remarks. Organic sales were flat as lower volumes, particularly in our industrial safety and pump businesses were offset by continued strong price capture. More specifically, we are seeing stable day rates across industrials. We're seeing project spending pushouts in the current macroeconomic climate. Our water businesses continue to benefit from strong municipal activity. While the ag markets are experiencing a cyclical downturn, our teams continue to make their own luck, and we are pleased with our team's performance against the current backdrop. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 140 basis points due to higher discretionary spending, lower volume leverage and higher employee-related costs, partially offset by strong price cost spread and favorable operational productivity. Moving on to slide 9 and our HST segment. Despite slower than expected recovery in the semiconductor industry and delayed industrial projects due to demand softness, organic orders were up 5% year-over-year. Organic sales were down 11%, primarily driven by our Life Sciences and Analytical instrumentation markets. While the market is experiencing a transitional period, we continue to work closely with our customers on innovation as we position ourselves for growth, while we wait for the markets to recover. While we are seeing early signs of encouragement in our semicon end markets, we have not yet seen the inflection in our orders. In line with our FMT industrial businesses, our HST industrial businesses are also experiencing project pushouts. Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin for HST improved 10 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the net accretive impact of acquisitions and divestitures. On an organic basis, adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 20 basis points, driven by lower volume leverage, unfavorable mix and higher employee-related costs, partially offset by operational productivity, strong price cost and lower discretionary spending. Sequentially, margins improved 150 basis points despite a sequential sales decline, which is a reflection of our strong focus on driving operational efficiency. Now turning to slide 10. Organic orders in our Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment were up 6%. Organic net sales were up 1% compared to the prior year, driven by price capture across all markets and continued dispensing project wins in emerging markets. We are seeing positive trends within the Fire & Safety business as the OEMs continue to work their backlogs down. BAND-IT saw weakness tied to auto and weaker industrial project activity. Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin declined 40 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to higher employee-related costs and lower volume leverage, partially offset by strong price cost and operational productivity. With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the third quarter and full year on slide 11. Note that our guidance does not contemplate the impact from future acquisitions. For the third quarter, we project organic sales to increase 0% to 1% compared to prior year. We anticipate an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 27%, with GAAP EPS in the range of $1.61 to $1.66, and adjusted EPS in the range of $1.85 to $1.90. On a year-over-year basis, we expect low single-digit organic sales decline in HST and FSDP and low single-digit growth in FMT. Given our current view on the timing of end market recoveries, we are revising our full year outlook. We now expect revenue to decline 1% to 2% compared to our prior outlook of growth of 0% to 2%. Given the revised organic assumptions, we expect full year adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 27% versus a prior outlook of approximately 28%. We project GAAP diluted EPS to range from $6.85 to $6.95 compared to our previous guidance of $7.13 to $7.43, and adjusted EPS to range from $7.80 to $7.90 versus our previous outlook of $8.15 to $8.45. To update to a full year revenue guidance implies mid-single-digit organic sales decline in SSD with low single-digit growth in FMT and FSDP. We will continue to closely monitor the end markets, while maintaining our focused effort on driving profitable growth. With that, I will turn it over to Eric for closing remarks.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Abhi. I'm on slide 12. Today, along the way, we touched on each of our key value drivers: organic growth, inorganic growth and margin expansion. We continue to apply our IDEX operating model, an 80/20 philosophy across all aspects of our business. It frames our culture and drives our growth and profitability. We are innovating and winning today with our best 80s customers in very attractive markets. We believe broader economic support will really amplify these efforts over time. We have stepped up inorganic efforts with a series of thematic proprietary acquisitions intended to drive above-average growth in advantaged markets. And we continue to strip complexity out of our businesses to support maximum financial leverage and impact. Thanks again to our IDEX employees and partners around the world for all that you do to drive trusted solutions that improve lives. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Mike Halloran from Baird. Your line is now live.\nMike Halloran: Good morning, everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Hi, Mike.\nMike Halloran: So let's start by understanding the change in the guide here. If I hear the comments right, Eric, the underlying daily rates were relatively stable in the quarter. And demand commentary has, I don't know, maybe a touch of optimism to it, but there's been more project pushouts and timing-related things. So the core of the question is, what's really changed from an end market dynamic as we move through the second quarter into the back half? The magnitude of the drop of the organic trends in the back half versus where it was previously seems more severe than the comments you're making. So I just kind of want to bridge the gap between the two, if you would.\nEric Ashleman: Yes. So look, I think you hit the first part of it dead on here. I kind of walked and I went back a little further, kind of walked it from December, all the way up to the present. And we've seen kind of this level of core rate stabilization since that initial pullback from the exuberance of Q1, right around that March time and it held through the quarter. And that's across the board in FMT and the industrial like portions of HST. I think the two components that are most different from us, relative to the last guidance, is we had anticipated some semicon launch in HST. There's a lot of signals set our way around ramps up in capacity. I mean, obviously, that sector had trouble with it last time. It just didn't materialize into orders. And in fact, we had some deferments in that area pretty late in the late innings of the second quarter, pushed into the back half that we've now got to keep an eye on. The second piece, we never talk about project business as a massive part of IDEX. But I got to say that what changed here sort of mid-May on, and we saw a lot of it in June, some of it continuing into July. I think it's pinging off the two uncertainty elements that I talked about here. It's this notion of inflation and rate relief and when it's going to come, which has been sort of out there since that March time frame. Just a lot of political uncertainty as kind of the second thing. So we've had these conversations with distributors, OEMs. We've asked them about their own businesses, how you're thinking about it, and you kind of consistently hear those two things. And then for us, it's manifested, as I said in the opening comments, not a cancellation or pullback in resourcing, but just approval loops that take longer to come together. So for us, that played out. We saw it in FMT in a few sectors. We saw it across some of the markets in HST. And we saw it in that, frankly, the growth initiative file that we also referenced here that we were counting on to lift a bit for us in the back half. And in fact, some of those projects, too, have that same narrative and overhang. So I think the optimism, through all of that, is that ultimately, those questions are going to be resolved. As they resolve, the fact that these are still resourced, we're still engaged, we're still talking about what comes next. I think that's where the comment -- the confidence comes from and the fact that it's sitting on a core foundation those day rates, what that tells you is that the system is still operating. It's still effective. People are maintaining things. Those two pieces together give you the long-term view that I think eventually, this sorts itself out.\nMike Halloran: So the follow then up on that then is, how do you think this recovery curve plays out? And if you listen to your comments on a lot of the price activity still there, more push out, more timing-oriented and some stability on the daily rates. Is this a scenario when these things start hitting, we could see a pretty rapid recovery pace? I'm not saying this year, not even asking for a timing component to it, or are you thinking something a little bit more iterative and modest as we think about moving into 2025? Because at the end of the day, it seems like you're saying, there's a lot of things underneath the service -- surface to be really positive about. And it's just a question of when they hit. And so just trying to understand the recovery timing from your perspective.\nEric Ashleman: Yes. I'll kind of go through that in two dimensions, and I'm sure the second dimension, we'll talk about as well in terms of those kind of core sectors in HST that have been pressured for a while. But if I start where I just left off on the last discussion, the uncertainty attributable to those two dynamics kind of interest rate and where that's going to go, interest rate travel and geopolitical situation, good shot those are resolved to some degree here as we close out the year. And we've seen in other occasions when things like that have been resolved, and there's a lot of captive energy, things have started pretty aggressively. We'll have to see. We'll have to see. I mean rates have been high for a while now. Does it take a while to fire that engine back up again in terms of investment? Q4 and what we see in kind of the book-to-bill ratio there, I think given just the nature of where the election is and where some of these other decisions are going to play out, will be a key input for us to understand kind of rate of travel into 2025. But I would say that the things that are embedded in those projects, the solutions that people are addressing with our technology, things that are being elongated now, I mean, frankly, they're overdue. They need to happen. We've kind of talked about this for a while. And I think I'm pretty optimistic that those ultimately get deployed and get deployed in a way that's favorable for us as we go forward. I think the other side of it, that's where we're going to come back and take an eye at the life science and analytical instrumentation sector, which, as you know, has been kind of flat for us for a while now after an initial slide of recalibration in the first half of last year. I think there's a little optimism there as well in the conversations we're having that we're closer to the end of that cycle than the middle or the beginning. We're coming up -- by the end of the year, it will be about two years that we've been experiencing that as our customers. We start to now look at the life cycle of the technology that's out there and the opportunity for refresh. We're seeing indications of things like accelerating drug discovery and trials. There's a lot of innovation announcements that our customers are talking about, and we've got great content on the -- that lines up well with us. I think on the China piece of that, I think our expectations have been calibrated for a while. We'll see. I think everyone's looking for signs that stimulus becomes effective there. But I'd see that's a little bit more optimistic in tone and tenor as well. And then finally, on the semicon part, as I said in the remarks in the beginning, a lot of people referencing, hey, 2025 looks like it's going to be a pretty strong cycle. And so we'll be looking for when does the bridge -- when did this bridge link is from here to there.\nMike Halloran: Thank you.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Vlad Bystricky from Citigroup. Your line is now live.\nVlad Bystricky: Hey, good morning guys.\nEric Ashleman: Good morning Vlad.\nVlad Bystricky: So, maybe just a quick question on free cash flow. I know I think you did about 75% conversion in the quarter. You talked about 100% plus for the year. So can you just talk about what needs to happen to hit that higher conversion rate for the year and sort of your level of visibility or confidence in that?\nAbhi Khandelwal: Yes, Vlad, I can -- this is Abhi. I can take that. So, first of all, we think about the 75% for Q2 and compared to prior years, it's in line with what we typically see in Q2, just the way the timing of the cash flows play out. I'll answer the other question, which is the confidence level in a cash flow north of 100%, we feel highly confident. That's our forecast for the year. Things that we are focused on that we continue to drive is inventory reduction in line with where the top line is. As you think about the back half of the year and where our top line is, our teams are focused on driving inventory to the right levels that will drive working capital and we feel pretty comfortable with us hitting our free cash flow target.\nVlad Bystricky: Great, that's helpful. Appreciate it. And then I wanted to dig in a little on FSDP. The plus 6% organic orders in the quarter and it's pretty encouraging. I guess was there any bigger onetime orders in there to think about? Or sort of, again, your level of visibility to orders remaining positive in the back half if the macro holds as it is?\nAbhi Khandelwal: Yes, I can give you color on that. So if you think about the order profile for Q2 and where we landed, that growth typically -- pretty much came from FSDP. And if I look at the segment and look at -- or look at the business and where they were, it was primarily driven by Fire or North America OEM demand. So that's where we saw the growth in Q2 from an order standpoint in FSDP. Now keep in mind, in FSDP, we also have dispensing. And so orders sometimes can get choppy because you might -- we've been talking a lot about the dispensing emerging market growth, and those come in bigger chunks of orders. So you could see something in Q1 that we ship throughout the year. But if you think about Q2 and the growth in Q2, it's tied to North America OEM demand that we saw in the quarter.\nVlad Bystricky: All right. Thanks, Abhi. I\u2019ll get back in queue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Your line is now live.\nNathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.\nEric Ashleman: Good morning, Nathan.\nWendy Palacios: Good morning.\nNathan Jones: I think it's been a while since we've talked about fire OEM demand being positive. So that's good to hear. I wanted to follow up on the HST numbers. The guidance does imply that you're going to see a little bit of revenue improvement in the back half relative to the first half. Is that just the absence of inventory destocking that you saw through second half of 2023 and into 2024? And just how you think that's going to progress as we get into the back half?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. Well, some of the cases where we talked about, the larger chunks that have been deferred and deferred here more recently. I mean those are lining up closer to the back half of the year. We, again, know what those programs are. We know what the platforms are. And ultimately, they do support the bridge to some of the growth that OEMs are talking about, specifically in the semicon area. We have a couple of other HST programs that we've been monitoring for a while. I mean they're very, very milestone-based, and I'm pretty confident that those are going to hit as well. So I think it's largely attributable to those two things.\nNathan Jones: I guess, continuing to follow up on the project pushed out kind of question here. Historically, when industrial companies have started to talk about projects being pushed out, but not canceled, that can be a precursor to projects getting pushed out for an extended period of time. It doesn't sound like you're that concerned that we're in that kind of environment today where you can just say things that got pushed from the second quarter into the second half, get pushed into 2025, et cetera, et cetera. Just comment on your confidence that we're not in that kind of environment where by the time we get to the fourth quarter, we're going to be talking about industrial orders that you thought were going to hit in the second half of 2024 and now being pushed to 2025?\nEric Ashleman: So I certainly get the spirit of the question. I'd come back to the magnitude of the reference points here and what they are. So one of the benefits we have in those early indicator businesses that we always talk about in FMT is they're a great gauge of sensitivity to different narratives. And even in the last call, one of the reasons I remarked about the dynamic that we've seen in the pullback in core rates in March and its alignment should, frankly, the hotter inflation read and the uncertainty of where rate relief was going to come in. Is it just, in my mind, showed us the sensitivity level around that particular dynamic in that part of the narrative. And that's maintained throughout. The second one being, frankly, the election cycle here in the US. Almost everything we're talking about is North American based, a North America-centric, even in terms of the numbers, the way it's playing out. So if you look at those two issues, which are ubiquitously showing up in the conversation of why things are being delayed or elongated or pushed to the right, we actually know that those two are going to have resolution points, but the certainty is pretty high, at least on the first. And on the second, of course, we know what comes in November. And we -- I've seen these cycles a couple of times before where that -- it's not unusual for things to be somewhat captive when these dynamics are playing out. I think the -- obviously, the post-inflation wave, that's a new one. But I think we're closer to resolution on it than the beginning and just that sensitivity and the way that these are lining up, I think it gives me some confidence that as we watch those go, you're going to see some things be relieved here.\nNathan Jones: Great. Thanks for taking my question.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Nathan.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you, good morning. I you all hope one of your industrial peer conference call.The next question today is coming from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I don't know if you all were listening to one of your industrial peer conference call. I'm just kidding, but Dave were saying the exact same things about extended approval loops and some nervousness about election and some project push-outs. So the commentary is familiar and so you guys are not an outlier. So I just wanted to share that. The question first is it's kind of like what we're not hearing about analytical instruments, life science destocking, you said it's in line with expectations. Is the destocking over? I know you got to be really careful about declaring that, but just what's your sense today.\nEric Ashleman: Well, look, once -- I mean the way I look at a lot of these issues is you just kind of listening for Qs in conversations. And that's one of the reasons, as I talked about it earlier, I mentioned positive aspects, like innovation, like drug trials, accelerating, like duration of the cycle and need for refreshes. Honestly, at the customer level, that's the kind of things we're hearing about. It's not to suggest there aren't pockets of finished good inventory out there on a global basis. Again, it's super hard for us to see that. But what you don't hear is kind of a domination of 9the headlines with that aspect that we did earlier in the cycle. So I still think it's uncertain in our own numbers and guide here. I mean we haven't called victory on it, and we've kind of held the line here for the rest of the year. But I am noticing that there is more positive commentary generally. And to be candid, I think we're just about ready to lap the duration of the run up here as well. So I think it's a lot of those things converging. I'm probably most excited of any element in it, just the level of innovation that I know we've been we've been participating in and I've been talking about, I think you're starting to see that now start to hit the market in a bigger way for our end customers. That in itself is a vote of confidence, if not in the exact short term, certainly in the medium and the long term.\nAbhi Khandelwal: And Deane, this is Abhi. Just to build on what I just said, if I look at the performance this year and just look at the first half, quarter-over-quarter, 1 to 2, the performance has been relatively flat. So to Eric's point, we weren't expecting a recovery in life sciences this year. But if I look at the performance, it has been flat.\nDeane Dray: Yeah, that's exactly the way it appears to us, but just want to see if there was anything else below the radar screen. And then second question is given the kind of uncertain backdrop, how about you all making any changes in your discretionary spending? Any pullback in growth investments? You reaffirm your CapEx for the year, but any changes there that you would highlight or not changes that you would highlight?\nEric Ashleman: Yeah. I would say steady as she goes there. I mean, as we said before, growth investments, typically for us are people based. They're domain experts. They're the people that are really, really good engineering things and figuring things out with close proximity to customers. The innovation cycle takes longer than a lot of people will recognize in mission-critical spaces like this. So making sure that people are engaged and doing the right work. That's always part of what we do. And maybe even more important now than in a relatively choppy period, you're staying on that case because you ultimately could feel that gap later on in our own growth numbers. I will say, I referenced maybe more specifically, the work we're going to do with 80/20 as we talk about Mott coming on the board. And one of the things that that's going to help them do, and it helps us across IDEX is that's actually a source of resource deployment and reallocation of resources that we have here from areas that are not as impactful to areas that are more impactful. So as we play that out business to business and play it out in acquisitions, it's a way to kind of augment the power of resources in areas where we want to apply them without actually upping the spend profile overall. And we indicated that when we referenced it in the transaction as an area of margin lift for the company as they grow, but it's just representative of how we deploy it more generally and more broadly at IDEX.\nAbhi Khandelwal: And Deane, this is will be -- I know you're going to see it in the commentary in the press release and even in the 10-Q, but if you look at FSDP and HST, discretionary spend is down. And where you will see an increase is FMT. But quite frankly, that's tied to our digitization effort. That's front end, and that's one of the growth best that we are focused on. So overall, I'd say you'd see a discretionary reduction across the two businesses, with the exception of -- our two segments with the exception of FMT.\nDeane Dray: Really helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question today is coming from Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now live.\nMatt Summerville: Thanks. Just a couple of quick ones. First, can you quantify the level of price capture you saw in Q2? And remind us, is that consistent with what you saw in Q1? And then similarly, if you can also compare your organic book-to-bill in Q2 versus Q1? And then I have a follow-up.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Yeah, Matt, absolutely. So if I think about the price capture, it's in line with the guidance that we laid out for the year. So price capture for the quarter was closer to 2%. But the bigger thing that we talked about that we were focused on is the price/cost spread. And our price cost spread for the quarter was 100 bps. And if you recall, what we have said, going into the year, we were targeting between 80 to 100 bps. So we're on the high end of the price/cost capture for the quarter. From a book-to-bill standpoint for the quarter, we landed at 0.96 versus 1Q of 1.02. Now that said, part of this is the timing of when the blankets booked in the quarter. In Q1, we had a few blankets that got booked that we shipped throughout the year. Q2 had lesser of those. So the best way to think about our book-to-bill is as we go towards the tail end of the year, like Eric alluded to, one of the things that we are focused on is our book-to-bill ratio because that's where we see a lot of blankets come through that feed the revenue for 2025.\nMatt Summerville : Got it. And then just a follow-up on the analytical instrumentation life sciences. I just want to be clear. At this point, is it -- are you thinking the inventory drawdown is indeed completely in the rearview mirror? And to that extent, are you seeing OEMs generally carry less inventory than they were pre-COVID? Or is the absolute stocking level reverting back towards something more in line with the pre-COVID level? Thank you.\nEric Ashleman: Yes. Well, so again, there's kind of two pockets of inventory. One, we have a lot more visibility to than another. So the inventory, let's say, between us and customers. So those would be components and things that we supply them. I mean the planning levels that they have today are pretty typical for what they've been, in the past in terms of replenishment rates and how far away we are and how much lead time we're being asked to deliver. So that's been, honestly, back in sync now for a while. The inventory of finished goods, which, of course, passed our customers and extend globally, less clear for us, but to the extent we have not seen further erosion in demand here, and we've been holding relatively flat and continue to project it that way. I don't think it's -- we don't see it as a significant driver going forward and in fact, are leaning on those points of optimism looking for the turn, which we hope to be somewhere into 2025.\nMatt Summerville: Thank you, Eric.\nEric Ashleman: Thanks.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Your line is now live.\nJoe Giordano: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nEric Ashleman: Hi.\nAbhi Khandelwal: Hey, Joe.\nJoe Giordano: Hey. So just inherent in the revenue guide for the second half of the year, what are you thinking for orders for FMT and HST like in dollars versus the 2Q level? Do they get better or worse from here?\nAbhi Khandelwal: If I look at our guide and you kind of think about the back half that we have guided, yes, the orders do get better in terms of dollars sequentially from first half to second half.\nJoe Giordano: Okay. And then, if I look -- and I think this is -- it's tough to analyze with companies now in the post-COVID, given how supply chain gets crazy. But if I look at all of your -- each of your segments independently, on like a trailing couple of years, like if I look at since COVID, orders -- the excess orders over revenue, it's pretty significant still. So like I would think that there's more backlog coverage than like the guidance suggests, given like from a trailing three-year or whatever, there's significantly more orders than revenue. So like, are you seeing customers not taking delivery as you think for orders that are in backlog? Or are you seeing cancellations there?\nEric Ashleman: I want to make sure we're seeing it the same way. I mean, typically, backlog, we're a smaller backlog company. We normal course of business for us is kind of half a quarter is assured, and we go find the rest. That's a general statement for IDEX that absolutely in the pandemic year has changed. Like, it did for everybody else. I mean I think we doubled it kind of at the height here and had a quarter's worth of insurance, maybe a little bit more as people over ordered and did everything they could for supply chain assurance. Maybe sooner than many companies, we actually reverted back to a very typical backlog profile, and we've been there for a while now. So kind of half a quarter in front of us got to go hunt for the rest. So the dynamics in backlog for us are not that different. The lead times and replenishment that we're being asked to provide in all three segments is pretty typical. I think the only thing that's atypical here for us has been the level of project commitments and those discussions around when the next thing might be coming. And I'll just point back to the indicators that we talked about as to what's driving it.\nJoe Giordano: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Andrew Buscaglia from BNP Paribas. Your line is now live.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nEric Ashleman: Hi.\nWendy Palacios: Hi.\nAndrew Buscaglia: I wanted to focus on margins. I think you said in the past, exiting the year, you could see a little bit of a lift. It seems like guidance might imply that too. But in terms of getting back to that 30% -- that level, how much of it is more dependent on volume coming back versus mix? Because I'm trying to gauge some of these higher growth areas coming back. I guess what are the dynamics as that pans out \u2013 margin?\nAbhi Khandelwal: Andrew, I think you cut off for a second or two there, so I might have missed the piece. But let me try to answer that question. If I don't completely get to your answer, then just ask me, and I'll do it. But if you just take a step back and kind of think about where we are, your general comment about depending on volume, volume is a big part of it because, of course, when we see top line growth, we lever really nicely on our businesses. So that is a big component of how margin expansion happens. But that said, though, given where we are you will notice, sequentially, our margin profile got better by 180 basis points, right, despite very minimal help from volume. And that's really tied to the work that we do around 80-20 complexity reduction and cost out in the light of where we've been. So as you think about the balance of the year and how we're thinking about the year, exiting Q4, so I want to be very careful. I'm talking about rates exiting Q4, not full year rates. We're thinking about HST closer to that 28% kind of profile on EBITDA, FMT closer to 34%, and then FSDP in the 28% to 29% range from an EBITDA standpoint.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Very helpful. And yes, I wanted to focus on in Fluid & Metering. The reasonable water strength has been a nice story for a while for you and others. Where are you guys to be thinking that inning? Or what inning do you think you guys are in? And how much of your business is influenced by government spending or government funding?\nEric Ashleman: Well, so look, I think the cycle plays out for a while, mainly because the intentionality of that funding that's kind of spread over much of the industry. It just takes a long time to spend. These are complex engineering projects for multiple players, not just us. A good portion of things that have been announced is not actually spent yet or engineered. So I always thought of this as kind of a multiyear safety blanket or a warm comfortable blanket, either one. We're positioned actually in -- we do an important work to help spend that money. So I think it's one of the reasons we're seeing that the strength in our business. We do analytical work that actually helps write the capital request. So essentially, many of our customers are actually engineers, civilian engineers that are then using that data to suggest projects that are going to tap into funding of the type that you're talking about here. So there's a portion of it that is intentional and it's coming from announced government programs. A decent amount of municipalities, of course, is government-funded, but that's ultimately through taxation. And we have -- look, we participate in the industrial water side of this, too, and that, of course, is in tie to private markets. But I think there's a nice run here overall, if for no other reason that it just takes a while to frankly, bring all this to fruition.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Yes. Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question today is coming from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Your line is now live.\nQ \u2013 Rob Wertheimer: Thank you. Good morning. I apologize if this -- I cut out for a while in the audio. So if I missed something or be labor point you've covered, you can just cut me off. But on the project delay side, is that tied to specific government policies that might open up one way or the other? Or is it just more of a general unease or uncertainty that has affected how people are willing to spend?\nEric Ashleman: Yes. So we did touch on that before a bit, but I think it's worth a second go around. I mean it's very specific around two very general themes, one around sort of the cost of money and the fact that it's been higher for longer, and there's uncertainty as to the rate of travel to something better. That's all about inflation and interest rate and that dynamic, which everybody is watching. And I think the second one is around political uncertainty and uncertainty of outcomes given the polarization here in North America for approaches. In our conversations, it doesn't really then travel below that to something more specific because frankly, our business is -- it's more diverse. It's spread across different places where at the component level. So we're not as heavily indexed to a program or another program. It's kind of like the answer I gave on the water side of it. The fact that there's intentionality there and it's going to take multiple years to spend it is kind of good enough for us to then participate in the way we do in municipalities and industries across the globe to participate in that. So it's very generalized as we're thinking of it here.\nQ \u2013 Rob Wertheimer: Perfect. Thank you. And then could you remind us the rate-sensitive businesses within FMT that you're kind of using as guidelines. What's the nature of the activity there in the business? Could you just give us a little bit more background around that, and I will stop there. Thanks.\nEric Ashleman: Yes. It's a series of businesses in the FMT, where a lot of them are kind of pumps and bulbs and fluids. So they're used for a broad array of purposes. They go to market in -- typically in through industrial distribution. And because of the kind of customized nature of the way that we do things in our rapid fulfillment, we can get an order on a Monday, ship it on a Wednesday and it's in service on a Friday. I say all that because what they -- because of the nature of that, they provide really good insight into kind of action consumptive activities across the board. And it's -- frankly, it's more than 50% of the order flow in those businesses. So we use them as diagnostics to tell us kind of what's the state of health there. And as we've talked about them here, what we've said is there's 2 dimensions that we see at work the core day-to-day rates, which is this short-term fulfillment, think of it as somebody maintaining their factory as they run two shifts, that's steady. It has been steady, and it's really back to the assumptions we had in the fall. It was only interrupted briefly to the positive for a three-month period, as I think there was more anticipation that we're going to have more favorable rate relief. And it sort of came back down and it's been steady state. There's a tie-in there with project work. And project work in our world, I don't think of them as stadiums or massive things like that. It could be a simple back-end expansion onto a food plant or something like that. It kind of moves you from a pump or two to something like 40 or 50 for us, but that's tied to an approval process and a discrete decision that's important. And that's kind of the piece we've said has been hung up in the works here with those two more generalized themes that I talked about. So that's what the insight is telling us. We're very happy to see that the day rates are supportive of just strong and relatively stable industrial activity. And we look forward to the day the uncertainty leaves the project-driven side of it, which is going to complement it overall.\nRob Wertheimer: Perfect. Thanks so much.\nEric Ashleman: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.\nEric Ashleman: Well, thank you. Listen, I recognized we struggle a bit here to find our organic guidance footing over the last six quarters. I realized a lot of that chop is coming out of the HST segment. And I'm fully aware that we're disproportionately investing in HST organically and inorganically is a key element of our strategy. What I want to make sure you understand is this is the right call for our business. Even in a period of uncertain transition for some of these foundational markets, we've talked about a lot here today. Third of this segment lies across two verticals within life science and analytical instrumentation and advanced semi-con manufacturing. They're pressured today, but no doubt they're going to have wins at their backs for years to come. We just built another third of the segment that allows us to lever the supplied material science technology to a really narrow band of high-quality application areas, and the Mott acquisition completes this phase of the build. And then the remaining third, it's composed of high-quality businesses, where it's all number one in their respective niches and very, very IDEX-like in the way they function. So together, we're innovating to set really critical specification points, that are going to position us for leadership in the years to come, markets that are going to shape our futures. And we'll see the financial benefit of that play out, just as we've seen it play out in the legacy businesses of FMT and FSDP. It's really important that we kind of get IDEX into the mix as these markets form up and launch. So I look forward to walking you through our progress on that in the quarters and the years to come. And I wish you all a good day. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "content": "Thanks, Eric. Turning to the consolidated financial results on Slide 6. Please note that all comparisons are against the prior year period, unless otherwise stated. Orders of $773 million were up 1% on a reported basis and up 2% organically. We saw mid single-digit organic growth in FSDP and HST, which were partially offset by a mid single-digit decline in FMT, driven by projects being pushed to the right. Second quarter sales of $807 million was down 5% reported and 4% organically. We experienced an 11% decline in HST, while FMT and FSDP were essentially flat as compared to the prior year period. Second quarter gross margin and adjusted gross margin were 45.4%, an expansion of 70 basis points, driven by strong price cost and favorable operational productivity, partially offset by unfavorable mix, higher employee-related costs and lower volume leverage. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.8%, down 60 basis points. However, as compared to Q1, adjusted EBITDA was up 180 basis points. The strong sequential expansion highlights our team's continued focus on deploying 80, 20 and to drive profitability, as we manage through challenging market dynamics. I will discuss the drivers of second quarter adjusted EBITDA on the next slide in a moment. On a GAAP basis, our Q2 effective tax rate was 21.2% versus 22.4% in the prior period. The decrease was primarily due to a discrete benefit from research and development incentive resolution related to prior years from an international taxing authority. Second quarter net income was $141 million, generating an EPS of $1.86. Adjusted net income was $156 million with adjusted EPS of $2.06, down $0.12. Free cash flow for the quarter was $118 million, a decrease of 2%. We achieved a conversion rate of 75% of adjusted net income, a 310 basis-point improvement on a year-over-year basis. We have a strong balance sheet, and this quarter, we repaid $25 million of the $50 million previously outstanding debt under our term facility, and we paid $52.2 million in cash dividends. The dividend was our 119th consecutive quarterly dividend payout. Moving on to Slide 7, which details the adjusted EBITDA drivers. For the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $17 million. The 4% organic sales reduction unfavorably impacted adjusted EBITDA decreased by $17 million. The 4% organic sales reduction unfavorably impacted adjusted EBITDA by $23 million, flowing through at our prior year adjusted gross margin rate. The negative volume flow-through was partially offset by strong price cost spread of 100 basis points in the quarter and operational productivity, resulting in a $13 million benefit over the prior year. In the quarter, we saw unfavorable mix driven by dispensing and lower overall industrial activity. These factors resulted in a negative 48.7% organic flow-through. The impact of FX lowered adjusted EBITDA by $1 million, while acquisitions net of divestitures was flat on a quarter-over-quarter basis, as the benefits from our acquisitions were offset by adjusted EBITDA from divested companies. This resulted in a negative 42.4% flow-through for the second quarter. I will now review segment level performance. Turning to slide 8 and FMT segment. In Q2, orders decreased 4% organically, driven primarily by the cyclical decline in the ag market and push out industrial project activity, as Eric discussed in his opening remarks. Organic sales were flat as lower volumes, particularly in our industrial safety and pump businesses were offset by continued strong price capture. More specifically, we are seeing stable day rates across industrials. We're seeing project spending pushouts in the current macroeconomic climate. Our water businesses continue to benefit from strong municipal activity. While the ag markets are experiencing a cyclical downturn, our teams continue to make their own luck, and we are pleased with our team's performance against the current backdrop. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 140 basis points due to higher discretionary spending, lower volume leverage and higher employee-related costs, partially offset by strong price cost spread and favorable operational productivity. Moving on to slide 9 and our HST segment. Despite slower than expected recovery in the semiconductor industry and delayed industrial projects due to demand softness, organic orders were up 5% year-over-year. Organic sales were down 11%, primarily driven by our Life Sciences and Analytical instrumentation markets. While the market is experiencing a transitional period, we continue to work closely with our customers on innovation as we position ourselves for growth, while we wait for the markets to recover. While we are seeing early signs of encouragement in our semicon end markets, we have not yet seen the inflection in our orders. In line with our FMT industrial businesses, our HST industrial businesses are also experiencing project pushouts. Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin for HST improved 10 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the net accretive impact of acquisitions and divestitures. On an organic basis, adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 20 basis points, driven by lower volume leverage, unfavorable mix and higher employee-related costs, partially offset by operational productivity, strong price cost and lower discretionary spending. Sequentially, margins improved 150 basis points despite a sequential sales decline, which is a reflection of our strong focus on driving operational efficiency. Now turning to slide 10. Organic orders in our Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment were up 6%. Organic net sales were up 1% compared to the prior year, driven by price capture across all markets and continued dispensing project wins in emerging markets. We are seeing positive trends within the Fire & Safety business as the OEMs continue to work their backlogs down. BAND-IT saw weakness tied to auto and weaker industrial project activity. Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin declined 40 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to higher employee-related costs and lower volume leverage, partially offset by strong price cost and operational productivity. With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the third quarter and full year on slide 11. Note that our guidance does not contemplate the impact from future acquisitions. For the third quarter, we project organic sales to increase 0% to 1% compared to prior year. We anticipate an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 27%, with GAAP EPS in the range of $1.61 to $1.66, and adjusted EPS in the range of $1.85 to $1.90. On a year-over-year basis, we expect low single-digit organic sales decline in HST and FSDP and low single-digit growth in FMT. Given our current view on the timing of end market recoveries, we are revising our full year outlook. We now expect revenue to decline 1% to 2% compared to our prior outlook of growth of 0% to 2%. Given the revised organic assumptions, we expect full year adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 27% versus a prior outlook of approximately 28%. We project GAAP diluted EPS to range from $6.85 to $6.95 compared to our previous guidance of $7.13 to $7.43, and adjusted EPS to range from $7.80 to $7.90 versus our previous outlook of $8.15 to $8.45. To update to a full year revenue guidance implies mid-single-digit organic sales decline in SSD with low single-digit growth in FMT and FSDP. We will continue to closely monitor the end markets, while maintaining our focused effort on driving profitable growth. With that, I will turn it over to Eric for closing remarks. Yes, Vlad, I can -- this is Abhi. I can take that. So, first of all, we think about the 75% for Q2 and compared to prior years, it's in line with what we typically see in Q2, just the way the timing of the cash flows play out. I'll answer the other question, which is the confidence level in a cash flow north of 100%, we feel highly confident. That's our forecast for the year. Things that we are focused on that we continue to drive is inventory reduction in line with where the top line is. As you think about the back half of the year and where our top line is, our teams are focused on driving inventory to the right levels that will drive working capital and we feel pretty comfortable with us hitting our free cash flow target. Yes, I can give you color on that. So if you think about the order profile for Q2 and where we landed, that growth typically -- pretty much came from FSDP. And if I look at the segment and look at -- or look at the business and where they were, it was primarily driven by Fire or North America OEM demand. So that's where we saw the growth in Q2 from an order standpoint in FSDP. Now keep in mind, in FSDP, we also have dispensing. And so orders sometimes can get choppy because you might -- we've been talking a lot about the dispensing emerging market growth, and those come in bigger chunks of orders. So you could see something in Q1 that we ship throughout the year. But if you think about Q2 and the growth in Q2, it's tied to North America OEM demand that we saw in the quarter. And Deane, this is Abhi. Just to build on what I just said, if I look at the performance this year and just look at the first half, quarter-over-quarter, 1 to 2, the performance has been relatively flat. So to Eric's point, we weren't expecting a recovery in life sciences this year. But if I look at the performance, it has been flat. And Deane, this is will be -- I know you're going to see it in the commentary in the press release and even in the 10-Q, but if you look at FSDP and HST, discretionary spend is down. And where you will see an increase is FMT. But quite frankly, that's tied to our digitization effort. That's front end, and that's one of the growth best that we are focused on. So overall, I'd say you'd see a discretionary reduction across the two businesses, with the exception of -- our two segments with the exception of FMT. Yeah, Matt, absolutely. So if I think about the price capture, it's in line with the guidance that we laid out for the year. So price capture for the quarter was closer to 2%. But the bigger thing that we talked about that we were focused on is the price/cost spread. And our price cost spread for the quarter was 100 bps. And if you recall, what we have said, going into the year, we were targeting between 80 to 100 bps. So we're on the high end of the price/cost capture for the quarter. From a book-to-bill standpoint for the quarter, we landed at 0.96 versus 1Q of 1.02. Now that said, part of this is the timing of when the blankets booked in the quarter. In Q1, we had a few blankets that got booked that we shipped throughout the year. Q2 had lesser of those. So the best way to think about our book-to-bill is as we go towards the tail end of the year, like Eric alluded to, one of the things that we are focused on is our book-to-bill ratio because that's where we see a lot of blankets come through that feed the revenue for 2025. Thanks, Matt. Hey, Joe. If I look at our guide and you kind of think about the back half that we have guided, yes, the orders do get better in terms of dollars sequentially from first half to second half. Andrew, I think you cut off for a second or two there, so I might have missed the piece. But let me try to answer that question. If I don't completely get to your answer, then just ask me, and I'll do it. But if you just take a step back and kind of think about where we are, your general comment about depending on volume, volume is a big part of it because, of course, when we see top line growth, we lever really nicely on our businesses. So that is a big component of how margin expansion happens. But that said, though, given where we are you will notice, sequentially, our margin profile got better by 180 basis points, right, despite very minimal help from volume. And that's really tied to the work that we do around 80-20 complexity reduction and cost out in the light of where we've been. So as you think about the balance of the year and how we're thinking about the year, exiting Q4, so I want to be very careful. I'm talking about rates exiting Q4, not full year rates. We're thinking about HST closer to that 28% kind of profile on EBITDA, FMT closer to 34%, and then FSDP in the 28% to 29% range from an EBITDA standpoint."

            "name": "Eric Ashleman",
            "content": "Thanks, Wendy and good morning everyone. I'm on Slide 3. IDEX delivered against expectations in Q2 despite increasing macro uncertainty, with both adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted EPS coming in slightly above our previous guidance. I'd like to thank the IDEX teams around the world for their strong execution on behalf of our customers and shareholders. As mentioned on our first quarter call, we saw a noticeable uptick in industrial day rates in our closest to consumption FMT businesses in December. This continued through the end of February, but pulled back a bit in March as a surprisingly firm inflation report reduced the likelihood of near-term interest rate relief. These daily order rates are largely stable now and in line with our original 2024 assumptions. However, as the U.S. election cycle has come into full daily view, creating even more uncertainty given the perceived disparity of outcomes, we've seen a pullback in project commitments. There's no talk of project cancellation, just a quarter or two push to the right. We'll continue to watch these businesses as open economic and political questions are resolved for any early signs of inflection. Within the HST segment, we don't yet have enough growth catalysts to overcome the pressures facing our life science and analytical instrumentation markets. Our HST industrial markets are performing as described earlier for FMT, with stable day rates and preferred -- deferred project activity. Despite some encouraging discussions from our semiconductor customers asking us to get ready to launch, to support the next cycle of growth, we just haven't seen yet turn into accelerating releases or increased order positions. We think we're close here as most major players are pointing to likely strong growth in 2025. Life sciences and analytical instrumentation performed in line with expectations, with a strong focus on innovations to support the next cycle of growth and excellent productivity to support margins as we await market recovery. As we said at the beginning of the year, we believe we are unlikely to see positive inflection for these markets, until 2025. FSDP had a strong quarter. Our dispensing teams are performing exceptionally well within emerging markets. Their share gains within India are nicely offsetting much of the pressure from their North American markets, as large retailers step back following a strong two-year replenishment cycle. Our Fire business continues to grow, as industry throughput improves. They're also growing share through higher adoption of mobile platform automation. Finally, BAND-IT was affected by softness in auto and industrial demand, but continues to deliver very strong above-average profitability. Finally, we were thrilled last week to announce the acquisition of Mott. We'll talk a bit more about the company in a moment, as we update our work within capital deployment. Turning to Slide 4. Although market headwinds persist, we are leveraging our strong technical and innovation capabilities as well as our close customer partnerships to position our business for growth across technology-enabled markets and applications. Our materials processing technology, MP350 Microlyser Processor, won the Biotech Innovation Award at Interfax, the leading global pharmaceutical and biotechnology conference. The MP350 is designed for production scale cell disruption, which is used in the manufacturing of many biotech products, such as antigens for vaccines and viral vectors supporting gene therapy. In the life sciences area, our new Melles Griot XPLAN CCG Lens Series, imaging system, released in February, is providing customer access to superior quality optics with off-the-shelf lead time. This aligns with our strategy to deliver leading innovation and operational scale to support our customers from prototype to production, positioning us well for growth. During the second quarter, our intelligent water inspection team at EPAC launched Verisighht Ultra. This inspection technology tackles challenging infrastructures with remote access and an intuitive digital interface, capturing and converting data into powerful insights in the inspection of wastewater management systems. This is one of the many examples of how we're helping municipalities deliver clean water to their communities. We also received customer approval at our Trebor business for the next generation of sustainable Ultra Pure Water Heater and pump applications used to support the semiconductor wafer fabrication process. The Quantum NXT heaters have saved semiconductor manufacturers over 0.5 billion liters of ultra-pure water this year alone. We anticipate this will provide long-term growth as the semiconductor market reaccelerates. And in our Fire & Safety group, our teams unveiled the WildCAT solution for brush trucks used to fight wildland fires. Through a touchscreen application in the cab, firefighters can take control of essential water path functions, while stationary or on the move, in a much safer environment. With wildfire season clearly upon us in North America, this is a critical solution that can really make a difference. Now, turning to our disciplined capital deployment initiative on Slide 5, we continue to lever our strong balance sheet to tune our portfolio for profitable growth through strategic acquisitions. Last week, we announced the acquisition of Mott Corporation, a leader in the design and manufacturing of centered porous material structures and flow control solutions with deep material science knowledge and process control capabilities. Mott develops highly engineered configurable mission-critical solutions for scalable high-quality applications. Their business is complementary to our broader Applied Materials Science Technology businesses within HST, including Nuon, STC and Optical Technologies. And perhaps most impressively, they deliver for customers with an outstanding culture that fits really well with ours. We believe the addition of Mott, will deliver value for IDEX, via strong organic growth, EBITDA margin expansion to above HST average and near-term EPS accretion. In addition to Mott, we acquired a small company, Subterra, on July 25. Subterra's technologies help digitize underground infrastructure. It will become part of the intelligent water platform within our FMT segment, adding an important piece to our analytics solution across wastewater collection systems. Finally, as we optimize our portfolio, we continually reconsider the long-term growth prospects for all of our businesses. Occasionally and typically with smaller companies that like a path to scale, we decide to sell to an owner that can better maximize potential. During the second quarter, we divested Alfa Valvole for $45.5 million in cash. They operated within our FMT segment. With that, I'll turn it over to Abhi to discuss our financial results. Thanks, Abhi. I'm on slide 12. Today, along the way, we touched on each of our key value drivers: organic growth, inorganic growth and margin expansion. We continue to apply our IDEX operating model, an 80/20 philosophy across all aspects of our business. It frames our culture and drives our growth and profitability. We are innovating and winning today with our best 80s customers in very attractive markets. We believe broader economic support will really amplify these efforts over time. We have stepped up inorganic efforts with a series of thematic proprietary acquisitions intended to drive above-average growth in advantaged markets. And we continue to strip complexity out of our businesses to support maximum financial leverage and impact. Thanks again to our IDEX employees and partners around the world for all that you do to drive trusted solutions that improve lives. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions. Hi, Mike. Yes. So look, I think you hit the first part of it dead on here. I kind of walked and I went back a little further, kind of walked it from December, all the way up to the present. And we've seen kind of this level of core rate stabilization since that initial pullback from the exuberance of Q1, right around that March time and it held through the quarter. And that's across the board in FMT and the industrial like portions of HST. I think the two components that are most different from us, relative to the last guidance, is we had anticipated some semicon launch in HST. There's a lot of signals set our way around ramps up in capacity. I mean, obviously, that sector had trouble with it last time. It just didn't materialize into orders. And in fact, we had some deferments in that area pretty late in the late innings of the second quarter, pushed into the back half that we've now got to keep an eye on. The second piece, we never talk about project business as a massive part of IDEX. But I got to say that what changed here sort of mid-May on, and we saw a lot of it in June, some of it continuing into July. I think it's pinging off the two uncertainty elements that I talked about here. It's this notion of inflation and rate relief and when it's going to come, which has been sort of out there since that March time frame. Just a lot of political uncertainty as kind of the second thing. So we've had these conversations with distributors, OEMs. We've asked them about their own businesses, how you're thinking about it, and you kind of consistently hear those two things. And then for us, it's manifested, as I said in the opening comments, not a cancellation or pullback in resourcing, but just approval loops that take longer to come together. So for us, that played out. We saw it in FMT in a few sectors. We saw it across some of the markets in HST. And we saw it in that, frankly, the growth initiative file that we also referenced here that we were counting on to lift a bit for us in the back half. And in fact, some of those projects, too, have that same narrative and overhang. So I think the optimism, through all of that, is that ultimately, those questions are going to be resolved. As they resolve, the fact that these are still resourced, we're still engaged, we're still talking about what comes next. I think that's where the comment -- the confidence comes from and the fact that it's sitting on a core foundation those day rates, what that tells you is that the system is still operating. It's still effective. People are maintaining things. Those two pieces together give you the long-term view that I think eventually, this sorts itself out. Yes. I'll kind of go through that in two dimensions, and I'm sure the second dimension, we'll talk about as well in terms of those kind of core sectors in HST that have been pressured for a while. But if I start where I just left off on the last discussion, the uncertainty attributable to those two dynamics kind of interest rate and where that's going to go, interest rate travel and geopolitical situation, good shot those are resolved to some degree here as we close out the year. And we've seen in other occasions when things like that have been resolved, and there's a lot of captive energy, things have started pretty aggressively. We'll have to see. We'll have to see. I mean rates have been high for a while now. Does it take a while to fire that engine back up again in terms of investment? Q4 and what we see in kind of the book-to-bill ratio there, I think given just the nature of where the election is and where some of these other decisions are going to play out, will be a key input for us to understand kind of rate of travel into 2025. But I would say that the things that are embedded in those projects, the solutions that people are addressing with our technology, things that are being elongated now, I mean, frankly, they're overdue. They need to happen. We've kind of talked about this for a while. And I think I'm pretty optimistic that those ultimately get deployed and get deployed in a way that's favorable for us as we go forward. I think the other side of it, that's where we're going to come back and take an eye at the life science and analytical instrumentation sector, which, as you know, has been kind of flat for us for a while now after an initial slide of recalibration in the first half of last year. I think there's a little optimism there as well in the conversations we're having that we're closer to the end of that cycle than the middle or the beginning. We're coming up -- by the end of the year, it will be about two years that we've been experiencing that as our customers. We start to now look at the life cycle of the technology that's out there and the opportunity for refresh. We're seeing indications of things like accelerating drug discovery and trials. There's a lot of innovation announcements that our customers are talking about, and we've got great content on the -- that lines up well with us. I think on the China piece of that, I think our expectations have been calibrated for a while. We'll see. I think everyone's looking for signs that stimulus becomes effective there. But I'd see that's a little bit more optimistic in tone and tenor as well. And then finally, on the semicon part, as I said in the remarks in the beginning, a lot of people referencing, hey, 2025 looks like it's going to be a pretty strong cycle. And so we'll be looking for when does the bridge -- when did this bridge link is from here to there. Thanks Mike. Good morning Vlad. Good morning, Nathan. Yes. Well, some of the cases where we talked about, the larger chunks that have been deferred and deferred here more recently. I mean those are lining up closer to the back half of the year. We, again, know what those programs are. We know what the platforms are. And ultimately, they do support the bridge to some of the growth that OEMs are talking about, specifically in the semicon area. We have a couple of other HST programs that we've been monitoring for a while. I mean they're very, very milestone-based, and I'm pretty confident that those are going to hit as well. So I think it's largely attributable to those two things. So I certainly get the spirit of the question. I'd come back to the magnitude of the reference points here and what they are. So one of the benefits we have in those early indicator businesses that we always talk about in FMT is they're a great gauge of sensitivity to different narratives. And even in the last call, one of the reasons I remarked about the dynamic that we've seen in the pullback in core rates in March and its alignment should, frankly, the hotter inflation read and the uncertainty of where rate relief was going to come in. Is it just, in my mind, showed us the sensitivity level around that particular dynamic in that part of the narrative. And that's maintained throughout. The second one being, frankly, the election cycle here in the US. Almost everything we're talking about is North American based, a North America-centric, even in terms of the numbers, the way it's playing out. So if you look at those two issues, which are ubiquitously showing up in the conversation of why things are being delayed or elongated or pushed to the right, we actually know that those two are going to have resolution points, but the certainty is pretty high, at least on the first. And on the second, of course, we know what comes in November. And we -- I've seen these cycles a couple of times before where that -- it's not unusual for things to be somewhat captive when these dynamics are playing out. I think the -- obviously, the post-inflation wave, that's a new one. But I think we're closer to resolution on it than the beginning and just that sensitivity and the way that these are lining up, I think it gives me some confidence that as we watch those go, you're going to see some things be relieved here. Thanks, Nathan. Well, look, once -- I mean the way I look at a lot of these issues is you just kind of listening for Qs in conversations. And that's one of the reasons, as I talked about it earlier, I mentioned positive aspects, like innovation, like drug trials, accelerating, like duration of the cycle and need for refreshes. Honestly, at the customer level, that's the kind of things we're hearing about. It's not to suggest there aren't pockets of finished good inventory out there on a global basis. Again, it's super hard for us to see that. But what you don't hear is kind of a domination of 9the headlines with that aspect that we did earlier in the cycle. So I still think it's uncertain in our own numbers and guide here. I mean we haven't called victory on it, and we've kind of held the line here for the rest of the year. But I am noticing that there is more positive commentary generally. And to be candid, I think we're just about ready to lap the duration of the run up here as well. So I think it's a lot of those things converging. I'm probably most excited of any element in it, just the level of innovation that I know we've been we've been participating in and I've been talking about, I think you're starting to see that now start to hit the market in a bigger way for our end customers. That in itself is a vote of confidence, if not in the exact short term, certainly in the medium and the long term. Yeah. I would say steady as she goes there. I mean, as we said before, growth investments, typically for us are people based. They're domain experts. They're the people that are really, really good engineering things and figuring things out with close proximity to customers. The innovation cycle takes longer than a lot of people will recognize in mission-critical spaces like this. So making sure that people are engaged and doing the right work. That's always part of what we do. And maybe even more important now than in a relatively choppy period, you're staying on that case because you ultimately could feel that gap later on in our own growth numbers. I will say, I referenced maybe more specifically, the work we're going to do with 80/20 as we talk about Mott coming on the board. And one of the things that that's going to help them do, and it helps us across IDEX is that's actually a source of resource deployment and reallocation of resources that we have here from areas that are not as impactful to areas that are more impactful. So as we play that out business to business and play it out in acquisitions, it's a way to kind of augment the power of resources in areas where we want to apply them without actually upping the spend profile overall. And we indicated that when we referenced it in the transaction as an area of margin lift for the company as they grow, but it's just representative of how we deploy it more generally and more broadly at IDEX. Yes. Well, so again, there's kind of two pockets of inventory. One, we have a lot more visibility to than another. So the inventory, let's say, between us and customers. So those would be components and things that we supply them. I mean the planning levels that they have today are pretty typical for what they've been, in the past in terms of replenishment rates and how far away we are and how much lead time we're being asked to deliver. So that's been, honestly, back in sync now for a while. The inventory of finished goods, which, of course, passed our customers and extend globally, less clear for us, but to the extent we have not seen further erosion in demand here, and we've been holding relatively flat and continue to project it that way. I don't think it's -- we don't see it as a significant driver going forward and in fact, are leaning on those points of optimism looking for the turn, which we hope to be somewhere into 2025. Thanks. Hi. I want to make sure we're seeing it the same way. I mean, typically, backlog, we're a smaller backlog company. We normal course of business for us is kind of half a quarter is assured, and we go find the rest. That's a general statement for IDEX that absolutely in the pandemic year has changed. Like, it did for everybody else. I mean I think we doubled it kind of at the height here and had a quarter's worth of insurance, maybe a little bit more as people over ordered and did everything they could for supply chain assurance. Maybe sooner than many companies, we actually reverted back to a very typical backlog profile, and we've been there for a while now. So kind of half a quarter in front of us got to go hunt for the rest. So the dynamics in backlog for us are not that different. The lead times and replenishment that we're being asked to provide in all three segments is pretty typical. I think the only thing that's atypical here for us has been the level of project commitments and those discussions around when the next thing might be coming. And I'll just point back to the indicators that we talked about as to what's driving it. Hi. Well, so look, I think the cycle plays out for a while, mainly because the intentionality of that funding that's kind of spread over much of the industry. It just takes a long time to spend. These are complex engineering projects for multiple players, not just us. A good portion of things that have been announced is not actually spent yet or engineered. So I always thought of this as kind of a multiyear safety blanket or a warm comfortable blanket, either one. We're positioned actually in -- we do an important work to help spend that money. So I think it's one of the reasons we're seeing that the strength in our business. We do analytical work that actually helps write the capital request. So essentially, many of our customers are actually engineers, civilian engineers that are then using that data to suggest projects that are going to tap into funding of the type that you're talking about here. So there's a portion of it that is intentional and it's coming from announced government programs. A decent amount of municipalities, of course, is government-funded, but that's ultimately through taxation. And we have -- look, we participate in the industrial water side of this, too, and that, of course, is in tie to private markets. But I think there's a nice run here overall, if for no other reason that it just takes a while to frankly, bring all this to fruition. Yes. So we did touch on that before a bit, but I think it's worth a second go around. I mean it's very specific around two very general themes, one around sort of the cost of money and the fact that it's been higher for longer, and there's uncertainty as to the rate of travel to something better. That's all about inflation and interest rate and that dynamic, which everybody is watching. And I think the second one is around political uncertainty and uncertainty of outcomes given the polarization here in North America for approaches. In our conversations, it doesn't really then travel below that to something more specific because frankly, our business is -- it's more diverse. It's spread across different places where at the component level. So we're not as heavily indexed to a program or another program. It's kind of like the answer I gave on the water side of it. The fact that there's intentionality there and it's going to take multiple years to spend it is kind of good enough for us to then participate in the way we do in municipalities and industries across the globe to participate in that. So it's very generalized as we're thinking of it here.\nQ \u2013 Rob Wertheimer: Perfect. Thank you. And then could you remind us the rate-sensitive businesses within FMT that you're kind of using as guidelines. What's the nature of the activity there in the business? Could you just give us a little bit more background around that, and I will stop there. Thanks. Yes. It's a series of businesses in the FMT, where a lot of them are kind of pumps and bulbs and fluids. So they're used for a broad array of purposes. They go to market in -- typically in through industrial distribution. And because of the kind of customized nature of the way that we do things in our rapid fulfillment, we can get an order on a Monday, ship it on a Wednesday and it's in service on a Friday. I say all that because what they -- because of the nature of that, they provide really good insight into kind of action consumptive activities across the board. And it's -- frankly, it's more than 50% of the order flow in those businesses. So we use them as diagnostics to tell us kind of what's the state of health there. And as we've talked about them here, what we've said is there's 2 dimensions that we see at work the core day-to-day rates, which is this short-term fulfillment, think of it as somebody maintaining their factory as they run two shifts, that's steady. It has been steady, and it's really back to the assumptions we had in the fall. It was only interrupted briefly to the positive for a three-month period, as I think there was more anticipation that we're going to have more favorable rate relief. And it sort of came back down and it's been steady state. There's a tie-in there with project work. And project work in our world, I don't think of them as stadiums or massive things like that. It could be a simple back-end expansion onto a food plant or something like that. It kind of moves you from a pump or two to something like 40 or 50 for us, but that's tied to an approval process and a discrete decision that's important. And that's kind of the piece we've said has been hung up in the works here with those two more generalized themes that I talked about. So that's what the insight is telling us. We're very happy to see that the day rates are supportive of just strong and relatively stable industrial activity. And we look forward to the day the uncertainty leaves the project-driven side of it, which is going to complement it overall. You bet. Well, thank you. Listen, I recognized we struggle a bit here to find our organic guidance footing over the last six quarters. I realized a lot of that chop is coming out of the HST segment. And I'm fully aware that we're disproportionately investing in HST organically and inorganically is a key element of our strategy. What I want to make sure you understand is this is the right call for our business. Even in a period of uncertain transition for some of these foundational markets, we've talked about a lot here today. Third of this segment lies across two verticals within life science and analytical instrumentation and advanced semi-con manufacturing. They're pressured today, but no doubt they're going to have wins at their backs for years to come. We just built another third of the segment that allows us to lever the supplied material science technology to a really narrow band of high-quality application areas, and the Mott acquisition completes this phase of the build. And then the remaining third, it's composed of high-quality businesses, where it's all number one in their respective niches and very, very IDEX-like in the way they function. So together, we're innovating to set really critical specification points, that are going to position us for leadership in the years to come, markets that are going to shape our futures. And we'll see the financial benefit of that play out, just as we've seen it play out in the legacy businesses of FMT and FSDP. It's really important that we kind of get IDEX into the mix as these markets form up and launch. So I look forward to walking you through our progress on that in the quarters and the years to come. And I wish you all a good day. Thanks so much."

It is now my pleasure to introduce Wendy Palacios, Vice President, FP&A and Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. \nWendy Palacios: Good morning, everyone. This is Wendy Palacios, Vice President of FP&A and Investor Relations for IDEX Corporation. \n Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the IDEX First Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights.\n Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial operating performance for the 3 months ending March 31, 2024. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today's webcast, can be accessed on our company's website at www.idexcorp.com. \n Joining me today are Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer and President; and Abhi Khandelwal, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \n [Operator Instructions] \n If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay beginning approximately 2 hours after the call concludes by dialing the toll free number (877) 660-6853 and entering conference ID# 13742103, or simply log on to our company homepage for the webcast replay.\n Before we begin, a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor language in last night's press release and in IDEX filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n With that, I'll turn this call over to our CEO and President, Eric Ashleman. \nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Wendy, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 3. In Q1, our core execution capabilities delivered strong results, particularly within our Fluid & Metering Technologies and Fire & Safety/Diversified Products businesses. We experienced an encouraging lift in sequential orders from our core industrial and municipal markets after a period of elongated destocking, and we were able to quickly capitalize on this bounce and deliver for our customers.\n Our lead times and overall responsiveness are at outstanding levels as we stripped out excess inventory and improved overall productivity. Our closest to consumption businesses within FMT pulled back a bit in March after a strong January and February launch, but things stabilized again in early April, suggesting our initial take on overall modest report for 2024 remains the correct call.  \n The Health & Science Technologies segment performed at expectations, but there are puts and takes there as we consider individual recovery rates within our markets and application sets. Our tactical priorities favor those growth initiatives that best leverage our most differentiated technologies in line with markets showing higher probabilities of near-term inflection.  \n Largely through inorganic efforts, we've expanded our technical capabilities within HST to support the Highest Quality Semiconductor technologies to power the AI revolution. We have increased content within the transformative world of low orbit space broadband, we are increasingly called upon to help companies develop and deploy advanced technologies for national defense and we have ambitions to continue to add to these capabilities as we further leverage our balance sheet through M&A.\n We continue to watch for signs of recovery in life sciences and analytical instrumentation and are ready to capitalize on growth at the first signs of improving customer demand. Our businesses serving these spaces are exceptionally well positioned with highly credible expertise. We have confidence in our ability to outperform again once this market correction runs its course.\n Overall, it's clear that economic and geopolitical uncertainty persist as a backdrop for all companies. We've leaned into that with conviction that the three core tenets of the IDEX difference, an expression of our most basic differentiated mindset help us play offense. Our great teams and talent work together in superior businesses with a special culture. \n We practice 80-20 to align around the few things that really matter and we leverage natural proximity to the customer to solve their toughest problems quickly to support our outstanding economics. We ultimately create compounding value for shareholders by driving organic growth outperformance through our top growth bets.\n We amplify these bets through acquisition of complementary faster-growing companies and we expand margins and generate strong free cash along the way as our leaders apply the five core tools of the IDEX operating model. I'd like to thank our IDEX teams around the globe for their dedication to these principles and for delivering strong performance in Q1.  \n With that, I'll turn it over to Abhi to discuss our financial results. \nAbhishek Khandelwal: Thanks, Eric. Before jumping into the consolidated results on Slide 4, I want to highlight our team's consistent ability to execute, as you've seen in the results, delivering strong profitability and free cash flow in the first quarter despite challenging year-over-year comparables.\n Moving on to the consolidated financial results. All comparisons are against the prior year period unless stated otherwise. Quarters of $820 million in the first quarter were down both 1% overall organically. We experienced an organic decrease in FMT and HST, while FSDP grew low double digits, driven by strength in dispensing and emerging markets. First quarter sales of $801 million were down 5% overall and down 6% organically. We experienced a 13% organic decrease in HST and a 3% organic decrease in FMT, while FSDP grew by 2% organically.\n First quarter gross margin was 44.6%, declining 60 basis points, while adjusted gross margin was 45%, contracting 20 basis points due to volume leverage, partially offset by price/cost and operational productivity. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 26%, down 120 basis points. This is a sequential improvement versus fourth quarter of 20 basis points as we remain focused on margin expansion. I will discuss the drivers of first quarter adjusted EBITDA on the next slide.\n On a GAAP basis, our Q1 effective tax rate of 21.5% versus last year's first quarter effective tax of 22.2% decreased primarily due to a favorable discrete item. First quarter net income was $121 million, generating EPS of $1.60. Adjusted net income was $143 million with adjusted EPS of $1.88, down $0.21 from the prior year first quarter. \n Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $137 million, up 13% over the prior year period. We achieved a conversion rate of 95% of adjusted net income, mainly driven by lower variable compensation payments and capital expenditures despite lower adjusted net income. On an organic basis, we drove more than $78 million of inventory reduction over the last 12 months, and we saw inventory turns improve 0.4 turn year-over-year.\n Slide 5. Moving on to Slide 5, which details the driver of our first quarter adjusted EBITDA. For the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $22 million compared to the first quarter of 2023. Our 6% organic sales reduction unfavorably impacted adjusted EBITDA by $29 million flowing through at our prior year adjusted gross margin rate. \n Price/cost was accretive to margins and we drove operational productivity that offset employee-related inflation. These results yielded in a negative 50% organic flow through. The impact of FX and acquisitions net of divestitures contributed $3 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, resulting in a negative 48% flow-through.\n With that, I'll provide a deeper look at our segment performance. I'm on Slide 6, within our FMT segment. In our water businesses, municipal project activity remains strong. Note that water sales performance in first quarter of the prior year was favorably impacted by both Hurricane-related backlog execution and the catch-up of a 1-month lag treatment of the Nexsight acquisition effectively recording 4 months of Nexsight sales in the first quarter of 2023.\n Our energy businesses remained stable with favorable infrastructure tailwinds, offset by a mild winter. Our agricultural businesses continue to be cyclically down, in line with expectations. Finally, Q1 adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 60 basis points, driven by price/cost and operational productivity despite slightly lower volumes.\n Moving on to Page 7. Despite challenging year-over-year comparables, the Health & Science Technologies segment performed to expectations, and nearly all of our HST business saw sequential orders improvement as compared to the fourth quarter. Our teams continued focusing on our most strategic customers' next-gen solutions in life sciences and analytical instrumentation while we watch for signs of recovery. \n Our space, broadband and laser communication initiatives continue on track despite current quarter customer delays. Our material processing technology business saw strength in food and sports nutrition that offset conservative customer capital investments within biopharma and pharma. For semiconductor, we saw orders improvement, both year-over-year and compared to the fourth quarter. And we expect these trends to continue in line with an improved outlook for memory chips.\n In line with our FMT industrial businesses, the HST industrials are steady. Lastly, adjusted EBITDA margins improved 40 basis points over the fourth quarter of last year. A year-over-year decline of 250 basis points was driven by volume leverage, partially offset by price/cost and operational productivity.\n Now turning to Slide 8. Our Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment performance was driven by dispensing project wins in emerging markets, which helped offset the impact of key U.S. customers' multiyear refreshment cycle. We continue to see stability in Fire & Safety. In the quarter, our focus on strategic share gain initiatives helped partially offset unfavorable budget reallocations in the industry.\n BAND-IT automotive demand is strong with growth expected in the year. Additionally, industrial performance was similar to FMT and HST with sequential improvement versus Q4. Finally, adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 40 basis points, driven by price/cost.\n With that, I'd like to provide an update on our outlook for the second quarter. I'm on Slide 9. In Q2, we're projecting GAAP EPS to range from $1.75 to $1.80 and adjusted EPS to range from $2 to $2.05, with organic revenue decline of approximately 2% to 3% and adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 27.5%.\n Turning to the full year 2024. We are maintaining our previously issued full-year outlook of organic revenue growth of 0% to 2% and adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 28% and adjusted EPS of $8.15 to $8.45 with majority of markets performing in line with our initial guidance and our focused efforts on driving growth bets.\n With that, I'll turn it over to Eric for his closing remarks. \nEric Ashleman: Thanks, Abhi. I'm on Slide 10. I'd like to close by coming back to the simple value equation I talked about in my opening remarks. It all starts with organic growth outperformance, typically targeting 300 basis points above market entitlements. We drive about 20 to 25 bps across the company at any one time to achieve these results. I highlighted earlier some examples of growth initiatives through Applied Technologies within HST. \n Within FMT, we're also working on integrating the recently acquired assets within our Intelligent water group alongside our legacy technologies to support critical analytical work within municipal and industrial wastewater containment and processing. Also within FMT, we're deploying digital tools across multiple brands that go to market through distribution to enhance our customer experience and promote share gain. I'll go deeper in the quarters ahead with additional specific examples to help bring this work to life.\n We amplify these bets with complementary inorganic work via M&A to add another 200 to 300 basis points of growth. We see an outstanding opportunity to support faster-growing transformational markets through the disciplined build of relative and absolute scale within very high-quality niches. Over the last 3 years, we've been working this play in the intelligent water space within thin-film optics and within the niche of small form factor materials-intensive processing.\n Finally, we expand margins and seek to drive double-digit earnings growth along the way as our teams deploy the five basic IDEX operating model tools with 80-20 as our heartbeat. Our decentralized environment and collaborative culture supports speed and agility and our inclination to resist top-heavy infrastructure supports financial leverage as we grow.\n In closing, the world is transforming and evolving in exciting, but unpredictable ways. We're building a company that thrive and win in that environment where power meets speed and agility at the intersection of technology and culture. I look forward to communicating our progress with you along the way.\n With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] \n Our first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird. \nMichael Halloran: So just a simple question, Eric. Maybe just talk about, in your mind, if anything has really changed in the market since you gave the last guidance or from an expectation perspective, obviously, dispensing a little better in the first quarter, doesn't seem like your expectations for the remainder of the year are all that different. \n But when you go through some of the key end markets, has much really changed from an outlook perspective? And how are you thinking about the sequentials through the year versus normal seasonality, ignoring some of the self -- the positive things that you were driving with some of your investments? \nEric Ashleman: Yes. No, thanks for the question. I mean not a lot that's different. I mean, I provided some color around the cadence of those kind of smaller flow FMT order of businesses that we have that are such good diagnostics. I think just to show that at the end of the day, the call remains the same, but it was interesting to watch the sensitivity and kind of ebb and flow in a way. \n It's a little unusual. Hot January and February, a little bit of pullback in March kind of coming back to equilibrium in April. So I think that's interesting mainly because I think it's reflective of the -- frankly, the level of sensitivity that is out there as people track inflation, interest rates, election, but I think we still land at the same place.\n When we look at particularly the markets in HST, of course, about half of it is pretty industrial, too. So it kind of follows the same rhythm and cadence. I think what we see is shoots of growth kind of around the periphery of the larger pieces of HST. So our MPT business got some great things going on in terms of food production and our battery material handling, but not necessarily in the core pharma. That's still to come. We saw a little lift in ceiling around some -- kind of coming off the bottom in consignment orders and largely in that kind of memory chip world, but we still await the broader lift on the highest quality semicon offerings that we have in the company. \n So when you step back, I think kind of broad but modest support on much of the industrial landscape of IDEX and then I think a lot of attention for us back on those kind of two core higher-growth potential markets within HST, life science and analytical instrumentation in the semicon markets and kind of great '25 sitting there, it's just a question of how much in the back half do you start to see some velocity towards it. And that's pretty close to where we were, I think, 3 months ago. \nMichael Halloran: Yes. No, makes sense. And then an HST margin question. Obviously, you're running well below peak right now. When you get mix normalized and those end markets come back, whether it's '25 or later, back part of this year, as you just mentioned, how do you think about margin normalization? \n Is that 25% to 27% kind of range you're at towards peak, is that still the bogey for where you think things will be when you get a little more normalization? And maybe just put a little context around that because we're having some moving pieces to that segment. \nAbhishek Khandelwal: Yes, Mike, this is Abhi. So I think if you go back 90 days and think about the discussion near the end of Q4, I think, look, what we've said is that the volumes come back in HST, more specifically in life sciences and the semicon that Eric just talked about. This business levers really well. And what we have said is we expect margins to be closer to 30% in HST once our volumes are back. \nMichael Halloran: So 30% EBITDA margins when everything comes back, okay? Because the 25% to 27% just for clarity, was me just previous margin ranges. So okay, that makes sense. That makes sense. We appreciate everyone. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. \nDeane Dray: Eric, I think you've given some of the color here, but just regarding your read on how the year is beginning to play out, can you also touch on day rates and it sounded like BAND-IT started off well, so that's always a good sign. And anything else about the bellwethers, Warren Rupp and some of the others? \nEric Ashleman: Yes. And that cadence that I articulated in the opening in Mike's question was really right there. It was on those bellwether businesses that we aggregate, take a look at weekly and then kind of use as an ultimate barometer of industrial health for IDEX. And I think, again, we saw those launching really strong in January, continued into February. It was interesting, a little bit of a pullback in March, and we had Easter earlier than ever before. So probably some of it.\n But to kind of see that swing and see it as broadly too certainly caught our attention, and yet then it's sort of stabilized again in April. So it's moving a little faster, both directions, than it typically has, and yet the arrow still remains kind of at the exact same slope that we thought. \n I just want to point it out because, again, I think it's reflective of some of the dialogue and conversations we're having, and this is higher up the food chain around projects, confidence, and where we are. It does seem more sensitive than I've seen in a long time to kind of whatever's on the news and what's out there, which isn't really surprising given kind of what this year is and where we are. So largely an unchanged position, but I thought the color might be helpful. \nAbhishek Khandelwal: And just to build on it, I think the other thing it points to that we've had a lot of conversations around is normalization of the supply chain. So it's a lot faster when it turns on, a lot faster when it turns on because people know that the lead times are back to normal levels that they can adjust their demand as they see the markets move up and down. \nDeane Dray: That's real helpful. And I'm glad you mentioned about that normalization of supply chain because that's been a focus. And just a separate question on the life sciences, analytical instruments market. We've been watching this and just kind of waiting where and how that -- the destocking might run its course and it just really hasn't turned the corner yet. I did see one of the life science guys report a strong quarter, but that was more on the bio processing side, less on the instrument side.\n But what's the typical lag between what you see from the OEs in terms of their sales of instruments versus your supply of these components? I mean, I guess, some of it has to do what their inventory levels are and whether they're running off their current stock and then whether they're pulling from -- to you for their orders. But just the typical lag and any color there would be helpful. \nEric Ashleman: Yes. So I think there's a couple of points to hit there. I'll start with the first where you ended. I mean the lag is -- I mean it's not extended for us because most of our replenished cycles and lead time fulfillment abilities and capabilities of components going to companies like that is really fast. I mean it's one of the reasons that when this sort of destocking cycle started, we were one of the first to come and recognize it back in Q4 of '22. And so I think any sign of life, we're going to see that first and it's -- and we're going to see it probably pretty close to the time that they're talking about selling the instruments just because of the natural way that forecast would roll in and come back into our factories.\n We -- typically, this is for most cases, I mean, we're not requiring months and quarters of heads up on that just because we're set up to quick turn most of the components. I think maybe the only exception would be, look, if there's a material shift in the overall demand profile, then we've got to think about making sure that we get those same broader signals out to our suppliers and they do that with us. You have to have that conversation, but sort of the early turn in inflection would be relatively quickly aligned. \n The only other point kind of embedded in the earlier part of your question to come back to is just as we're all reading signals from the broader market, as you're thinking of IDEX, it's always important to recognize, we participate in the instrument side of those sales. And often, you'll see people are talking about consumable streams. And maybe those would tend to advance and start to move ahead of instruments. And so it's an interesting point, but you always have to kind of equate it back to and what's the velocity on instruments because ultimately, that's where the components that we supply go. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vlad Bystricky with Citigroup. \nVladimir Bystricky: I guess can you just talk about, and sorry if I missed it, what price versus cost overall actually was in the quarter and your expectations for price versus cost for the year and what you're seeing in terms of inflationary pressures versus your expectations coming into the year? \nAbhishek Khandelwal: Yes, Vlad. This is Abhi and I'm more than happy to answer that for you. So if you recall, when we talked about our Q4 earnings, what we talked about was price for 2024, we'd laid it out at about 2%. But more importantly, what we were focused on was this price/cost spread of 80 to 100 basis points. So as you think about where we exited Q1, we were closer to that 100% from a price/cost standpoint, in line with expectations, in fact, on the high end of expectations. \n If you go back in time and just look at IDEX historically, we've seen from a pricing standpoint is something in the neighborhood of 80 to 1.2 -- or 0.8% to 1.2%. So this pricing that we have laid out '24 is higher than normal levels. And then the price/cost spread typically, what we've seen historically is 30 to 40 bps versus what we're seeing here, which is 80 to 100 bps. \n To answer your second question on inflation, what we're seeing is the input cost slightly favorable compared to what we had assumed in the guide that we had laid out as part of the Q4 discussion. \nVladimir Bystricky: Great. That's helpful color. I appreciate it. And then just to go back to HST. In terms of the organic sales decline that we've seen in the quarter, are you able to give us more color on the underlying growth rates in industrial and semicon versus what you're seeing in life sciences and analytical instrumentation? \nEric Ashleman: Well, a couple of things there. I mean, the comparisons in a lot of HST are at pretty exaggerated levels given the rapid destocking that we saw last year. And so let's -- we've been talking about life science and analytical instrumentation as being in a general condition of kind of flat waiting for signs of recovery. And that, just from a segment percentage, is just over 1/3 of the entire segment.\n I think semicon, certainly has high single-digit growth potential, and we're starting to see some early signs. I mentioned some things in ceiling and a couple of other places, but really have a little bit more of that dialed in, in the back half as we start to kind of approach that entitlement. It's probably '25 though, before it really comes in at that full level.\n In the industrial space, we kind of talked about, it tracks with generally what we're saying about FMT and much of FSDP, overall. So it's more modest in the low single-digit range right now. And I don't know, Abhi, do you want to add something there? \nAbhishek Khandelwal: Yes. No, the only thing I'd add is I think just -- look, we've talked about this, I think comparing it year-over-year is kind of tricky given what we saw last year. So I think it's important to kind of point out, if I look at the sequential order trends, look at the sequential order patterns from Q4 to Q1, we saw about $59 million of order uptick, $14 million of that was tied to FSDP, half of that, I'd say is blanket with our large customers that give us blanket that we ship throughout 2024. The other half is normal book-to-bill.\n You look at FMT, we're up about $28 million in orders sequentially. Again, half true demand that we've about tied to our bellwether businesses and the other half being blanket. And lastly, FSDP is the story around emerging markets and the growth coming out of India, that's really exciting for us. So you saw that sequentially.\n So again, I think the key here, the focus here is to look at it sequentially because I think that's a better way to look at the business given where we are in the cycle. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. \nNathan Jones: Getting back on to the HST order patterns and the sequential improvement that you're seeing there. It's obviously up quite a lot off the bottom from third quarter of '23. Customers did a lot of inventory destocking out of some of those businesses. Is it your view that customer inventories have been rightsized and we're kind of moving back to an area where your orders are pretty close to what your end customers are selling? Or is that still continued destocking going on from your customers? And do you have visibility into that? \nEric Ashleman: Well, so I'll kind of break down HST because I think the answer varies a bit depending on the portion-ality of the pieces. So half of it is broadly industrial, again, more like FMT and the rest of IDEX. And I think they're -- like in those other areas, I'd say the destocking trends are largely past us. And so part of that lift you're seeing in that industrial core. And it's because, frankly, we're at about the levels of consumption and as those become more positive, we rise with them. So you see the same dynamic in about half of HST that you see elsewhere. \n I think in the other areas, it's a little trickier and the visibility, to be fair, is a little bit murkier because of just the extension of those supply chains. So now in life science and analytical instrumentation, of course, we can best see inventory between us and factories. And ultimately, that cleared very fast for us, so I don't see an inventory accumulation there.\n End devices, which, of course, have global reach, harder for us to see. We ask about it all the time and there probably are pockets here and there of different platforms and things that are out there that we're probably still working through. So I'd say there may be some moderate or minor effect there, but they're just harder to see and they're kind of outside the four walls of where our usual experience is.\n And then in semicon, I think it varies as well because there's such discrete and different pieces of semicon. So things associated with memory, as I said, for us, that's kind of simple consignment stock and it's starting to move off the bottom, which would indicate, okay, we cleared that inventory too. Some of the kind of higher tech things at the other end of the spectrum, more anchored towards high-end lithography or metrology. I think -- and quite honestly, we're just waiting -- the entire industry is waiting for a stronger demand catalyst there to get it moving.\n So figure half of the segment generally clear, looks a lot like industrial IDEX and then I'd say kind of 50-50 and the other half, depending on these two large pieces. \nNathan Jones: That's helpful. Maybe back on to the margin question and where it gets back to in a more normalized volume environment, I think you said 30%. Is that -- first, is that an EBITDA margin target? Because historically, we've been talking about operating margins... \nAbhishek Khandelwal: EBITDA margins item. \nNathan Jones: Yes. And I would think that during this downturn, that, that business carries a lot of very highly-skilled labor that you would be really hesitant to rationalize during your downturn, particularly one that's likely to be short and cyclical. And so that's led to some of these pretty high decrementals that you're seeing in that segment. But should all that result in very good operating leverage and very high incrementals as we come out of the other side. Is there any commentary you can give us on kind of what you'd expect to see out of incremental margins in HST as we see that volume adjust? \nAbhishek Khandelwal: Well, Nathan, I think the point you made is the answer, but I will say it, which is, to your point, we've been very, very thoughtful in terms of how we rightsize the business. Again, as Eric talks about the long-term vision, we believe in the long vision of this business and expect this business to grow as we come out of the cycle.\n So as you think about the incrementals on the uptick, I'd say it's 35% to 40% is the incrementals you should expect, if not north of it, depending on the investments we make in the business over the long term as we grow the business. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. \nJoseph Giordano: Just curious like on the tools and the life science piece of HST, is there like -- medium term, is there any sort of like adjustments at the top end of like what this potential is? I mean I know we're going to get to the end of the destock and all that over the next bit here, and long term there's a clear call. But like do we need to like adjust what we think like the potential is over like a multiyear period here given what's happening internationally and things like that? \nEric Ashleman: Well, I think there's probably a couple of things out there to consider at the highest level when you're projecting. I think you hit one of them. So the ultimate position of China in this market, I think is something everybody has to think about. It's a big part of the issue currently because it was such a high catalyst of growth here more recently for most of the customers that we supply. .\n And so kind of where that comes out there, as you know, there are some regulatory things that are out there in the mix. I haven't seen a big move in this particular area from any stimulus programs that have been applied over there. So kind of where it ultimately settles in, I think, is an open question.\n On the other side, though, probably on the positive and the question of does it offset it, we continue to see just massive technology advancements here. I know the things that we're working on with customers in our building certainly have even potentially higher growth potential as you think of where that may land on a global populations and what work that could get done. So kind of I put the nature of innovation is a positive and where it goes and keeping track of it and seeing what it can all do right next to a question on China is probably the two biggest calls. \nJoseph Giordano: Would you say like globally, it's longer term fungible? Like there's a baseline global demand that is going up and whether it's China or elsewhere, where this needs to be put in, it needs to be put in and like it's just friction over like a shorter-term basis? Is that how you kind of think about it? \nEric Ashleman: I think that's exactly how we would think about it. I mean, it's -- the China piece, in particular, is pronounced from just the relative nature of what it had been and what it is now. And that's not trivial. That's couple of positive years on the one side and a few of adjustment on the other. But long term, this is ultimately about applying life-saving technology, transformational technology, of course, a global population.\n And I think certainly, one of the things that we always intended with our franchise is having global reach and scale. We have that. So if it begins to shift around and move from one region to another to do the work, that's actually something we're very well set up to align with. So I think that's well stated. It's -- in the near term, it's -- which way are the winds blowing. I think more medium term, it's more regionally around some of these key questions. And long term, it seems very, very assured. And I think it's ultimately about do you have the scale to go chase it, and we do. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. \nMatt Summerville: I wanted maybe just a little bit of commentary and maybe a little bit more granularity on what you're seeing in the M&A pipeline at present, which businesses, which end markets are you focused on have you seen as far as purchase price multiples? Just a little more detailed color there. \nEric Ashleman: Yes. Well, I think you saw in the remarks that I had. I mean, I made a special point to talk about the fact that we're looking for complementary pieces. So things that attach well to other areas of IDEX and I mentioned, at high level, how we had done that over the last 3 years in the optics space, the water space. And then I call it kind of material-intensive processing on small form factor, that's where Muon fits and frankly, STC.\n So these are businesses that when we purchase them, not only are we purchasing a great IDEX-like business, but we can see attachment points, more natural synergies. And frankly, it matches a vision of something that we're trying to create there, much of which comes back to the question that we just talked about in the life sciences arena of can we have the relative and the absolute scale to do that job well as it globalizes.\n And so I think the areas that I highlighted here would be -- you can take those as areas of high interest, and you can see the evidence of things that we've applied there. \n The valuations, I think we've consistently said for the kind of quality that we look for at IDEX, it remains quite pricey. I will tell you, I think we've put in a lot of work here recently where the capital deployed number for us would be higher if we were willing to go a couple of more turns and meet some of the expectations, and we just did not. We still are very, very disciplined about what we can do with the business. Even in the case where it's complementary like that, they're just -- we know what the limit is. And we've held that line and we'll continue to do that.\n So I think one other aspect that I would put is a net positive for us. We continue to find ourselves in proprietary spaces, having conversations with people generally where it's only the two of us. And so that's -- I think that's important in this environment, too. That gives you a bit of a head start.\n But the takeaway here is absolutely urgent. I mean we're putting the time in, we're putting the effort in. We are narrower in our focus because we are looking for things that attach well and scale quite naturally within these niches, but -- and we're doing it in a proprietary basis, but we are super careful about where the line needs to end on valuation for us. \nMatt Summerville: Got it. And then just as a follow-up, could you maybe spend a minute talking about kind of the ultimate duration and strength of the muni water and wastewater cycles as you kind of see it playing out for IDEX? \nEric Ashleman: Yes. I think, as I've said a couple of times before, I don't think it launches with a lightning bolt or a bang, but actually, the duration of it is going to be very durable. You've had a lot of intentional funding announcements put out there. Those always take a while to find their way home and funded projects that have been engineered and are now being deployed. \n So I think what's very positive about this cycle is the -- and I can't think of another one where I've seen this much intentional focus, and frankly, this much unfortunate reinforcement in terms of things in systems that are just not able to cope with the current climate that we have out there. \n So you put those two things together, and what we know is that level of confidence is what it really takes for engineers and municipalities and industrial spaces to do the work, to make it through the budget cycles, the inevitable number of conversations to get things approved to get them in front of us. \n The last point I always remind external folks to consider when they think of our water businesses, a lot of what we're doing is analysis. So we're doing infrastructure analysis and then providing that over generally for a technical part of our customer set. \n And so in that way, we're actually well positioned to kind of -- as a diagnostic at the beginning of the cycle because much of the time, they're using our information and our output to substantiate larger capital projects. And so kind of here in the beginning of a multiyear cycle is a good place for IDEX to be because we're actually helping them put the projects together that's going to extend the cycle, overall. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. \nRobert Wertheimer: Eric, you touched on an interesting topic in your opening comments just on semiconductors and the AI shift, which is obviously driving huge -- in demand, pricing power, all sorts of things, across pockets of industrials. I wonder, do you have any expanded remarks on what your exposure is there, how your technological capabilities are changing, whether you're entering kind of a new segment of semiconductors? Anything you can flesh out there if you're willing. \nEric Ashleman: Yes. No, I appreciate it. I mean it's still a modest portion of IDEX, overall, but it's growing, and it's growing and has found its way into the portfolios of some of the things we've recently acquired in HST. So we're certainly more interested and focused on it. And as we've brought those technologies in, I mean, we thought about this revolution and the jobs to do within it, particularly the hardest ones is our #1 area of interest. \n So we're often going right into lithography instruments and some of the most advanced that are out there because those are the ones that are being called upon to do the work, to create the chip architecture that's going to support the hardest piece of this.\n So we're well indexed there. We've long had a metrology portion of our business that's all about validating that, that job was done well. Even on the piece within water that we have that's somewhat semi-focused, I mean it's absolute critical water purification, delivery and heating. And we talked about that in our sustainability report as one of the best eco-friendly solutions we have in the whole company. \n And so it's a broad market. It's fragmented and segmented into different uses and technologies. But you can think of us as generally thinking about what are the hardest jobs to do that provide the most critical differentiation when they are done because typically, for us, that's where the most economic benefit comes from. \n And so we're tracking a lot of that -- those different trends, the size of chips, the way that they're being packaged and looking for all the ways that we can play there. So just think of that as that's how we're indexed, that's increasing. And so ultimately, as that plays out, I think we're very, very well positioned. \nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks. \nEric Ashleman: Well, thank you very much. Thanks for everybody joining today. We appreciate your interest in IDEX. And look, I think, no doubt, there's some uncertainties out there in the near term whether it's inflation, interest rates, geopolitical tensions, it's obviously an election year. We hear a lot of chatter about that out in the background. As I said, I think there's some sensitivity to it. But more broadly, I still think the arrows are very positive for businesses like ours and others over time.\n As we're tracking all that, we think it's helpful to provide that color to you as we do it. And as you know, we were very good at moving resources around from here to there within this high-quality portfolio to continue to execute for shareholders and customers.\n But I really step back and say, I think we're incredibly positioned for where things are going in the long term. We've had that discussion here with life science and analytical instrumentation, how powerful that's going to be over time. \n We just had it here more recently with our discussion around semicon and the revolutionary aspects of AI and the part we play there. And then we could go through a host of other applications, more of the niche than not, and take you through that as well. And that's what we're building each and every day through our own organic efforts and the -- efforts of the company.\n And so we're laser-focused on the things that matter, both short term and long term and look forward to continuing to talk with you along the way and the quarters to come. Have a great day. \nAbhishek Khandelwal: Thank you. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eric Ashleman",
            "content": "Thanks, Wendy, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 3. In Q1, our core execution capabilities delivered strong results, particularly within our Fluid & Metering Technologies and Fire & Safety/Diversified Products businesses. We experienced an encouraging lift in sequential orders from our core industrial and municipal markets after a period of elongated destocking, and we were able to quickly capitalize on this bounce and deliver for our customers.\n Our lead times and overall responsiveness are at outstanding levels as we stripped out excess inventory and improved overall productivity. Our closest to consumption businesses within FMT pulled back a bit in March after a strong January and February launch, but things stabilized again in early April, suggesting our initial take on overall modest report for 2024 remains the correct call.  \n The Health & Science Technologies segment performed at expectations, but there are puts and takes there as we consider individual recovery rates within our markets and application sets. Our tactical priorities favor those growth initiatives that best leverage our most differentiated technologies in line with markets showing higher probabilities of near-term inflection.  \n Largely through inorganic efforts, we've expanded our technical capabilities within HST to support the Highest Quality Semiconductor technologies to power the AI revolution. We have increased content within the transformative world of low orbit space broadband, we are increasingly called upon to help companies develop and deploy advanced technologies for national defense and we have ambitions to continue to add to these capabilities as we further leverage our balance sheet through M&A.\n We continue to watch for signs of recovery in life sciences and analytical instrumentation and are ready to capitalize on growth at the first signs of improving customer demand. Our businesses serving these spaces are exceptionally well positioned with highly credible expertise. We have confidence in our ability to outperform again once this market correction runs its course.\n Overall, it's clear that economic and geopolitical uncertainty persist as a backdrop for all companies. We've leaned into that with conviction that the three core tenets of the IDEX difference, an expression of our most basic differentiated mindset help us play offense. Our great teams and talent work together in superior businesses with a special culture. \n We practice 80-20 to align around the few things that really matter and we leverage natural proximity to the customer to solve their toughest problems quickly to support our outstanding economics. We ultimately create compounding value for shareholders by driving organic growth outperformance through our top growth bets.\n We amplify these bets through acquisition of complementary faster-growing companies and we expand margins and generate strong free cash along the way as our leaders apply the five core tools of the IDEX operating model. I'd like to thank our IDEX teams around the globe for their dedication to these principles and for delivering strong performance in Q1.  \n With that, I'll turn it over to Abhi to discuss our financial results. Thanks, Abhi. I'm on Slide 10. I'd like to close by coming back to the simple value equation I talked about in my opening remarks. It all starts with organic growth outperformance, typically targeting 300 basis points above market entitlements. We drive about 20 to 25 bps across the company at any one time to achieve these results. I highlighted earlier some examples of growth initiatives through Applied Technologies within HST. \n Within FMT, we're also working on integrating the recently acquired assets within our Intelligent water group alongside our legacy technologies to support critical analytical work within municipal and industrial wastewater containment and processing. Also within FMT, we're deploying digital tools across multiple brands that go to market through distribution to enhance our customer experience and promote share gain. I'll go deeper in the quarters ahead with additional specific examples to help bring this work to life.\n We amplify these bets with complementary inorganic work via M&A to add another 200 to 300 basis points of growth. We see an outstanding opportunity to support faster-growing transformational markets through the disciplined build of relative and absolute scale within very high-quality niches. Over the last 3 years, we've been working this play in the intelligent water space within thin-film optics and within the niche of small form factor materials-intensive processing.\n Finally, we expand margins and seek to drive double-digit earnings growth along the way as our teams deploy the five basic IDEX operating model tools with 80-20 as our heartbeat. Our decentralized environment and collaborative culture supports speed and agility and our inclination to resist top-heavy infrastructure supports financial leverage as we grow.\n In closing, the world is transforming and evolving in exciting, but unpredictable ways. We're building a company that thrive and win in that environment where power meets speed and agility at the intersection of technology and culture. I look forward to communicating our progress with you along the way.\n With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions. Yes. No, thanks for the question. I mean not a lot that's different. I mean, I provided some color around the cadence of those kind of smaller flow FMT order of businesses that we have that are such good diagnostics. I think just to show that at the end of the day, the call remains the same, but it was interesting to watch the sensitivity and kind of ebb and flow in a way. \n It's a little unusual. Hot January and February, a little bit of pullback in March kind of coming back to equilibrium in April. So I think that's interesting mainly because I think it's reflective of the -- frankly, the level of sensitivity that is out there as people track inflation, interest rates, election, but I think we still land at the same place.\n When we look at particularly the markets in HST, of course, about half of it is pretty industrial, too. So it kind of follows the same rhythm and cadence. I think what we see is shoots of growth kind of around the periphery of the larger pieces of HST. So our MPT business got some great things going on in terms of food production and our battery material handling, but not necessarily in the core pharma. That's still to come. We saw a little lift in ceiling around some -- kind of coming off the bottom in consignment orders and largely in that kind of memory chip world, but we still await the broader lift on the highest quality semicon offerings that we have in the company. \n So when you step back, I think kind of broad but modest support on much of the industrial landscape of IDEX and then I think a lot of attention for us back on those kind of two core higher-growth potential markets within HST, life science and analytical instrumentation in the semicon markets and kind of great '25 sitting there, it's just a question of how much in the back half do you start to see some velocity towards it. And that's pretty close to where we were, I think, 3 months ago. Yes. And that cadence that I articulated in the opening in Mike's question was really right there. It was on those bellwether businesses that we aggregate, take a look at weekly and then kind of use as an ultimate barometer of industrial health for IDEX. And I think, again, we saw those launching really strong in January, continued into February. It was interesting, a little bit of a pullback in March, and we had Easter earlier than ever before. So probably some of it.\n But to kind of see that swing and see it as broadly too certainly caught our attention, and yet then it's sort of stabilized again in April. So it's moving a little faster, both directions, than it typically has, and yet the arrow still remains kind of at the exact same slope that we thought. \n I just want to point it out because, again, I think it's reflective of some of the dialogue and conversations we're having, and this is higher up the food chain around projects, confidence, and where we are. It does seem more sensitive than I've seen in a long time to kind of whatever's on the news and what's out there, which isn't really surprising given kind of what this year is and where we are. So largely an unchanged position, but I thought the color might be helpful. Yes. So I think there's a couple of points to hit there. I'll start with the first where you ended. I mean the lag is -- I mean it's not extended for us because most of our replenished cycles and lead time fulfillment abilities and capabilities of components going to companies like that is really fast. I mean it's one of the reasons that when this sort of destocking cycle started, we were one of the first to come and recognize it back in Q4 of '22. And so I think any sign of life, we're going to see that first and it's -- and we're going to see it probably pretty close to the time that they're talking about selling the instruments just because of the natural way that forecast would roll in and come back into our factories.\n We -- typically, this is for most cases, I mean, we're not requiring months and quarters of heads up on that just because we're set up to quick turn most of the components. I think maybe the only exception would be, look, if there's a material shift in the overall demand profile, then we've got to think about making sure that we get those same broader signals out to our suppliers and they do that with us. You have to have that conversation, but sort of the early turn in inflection would be relatively quickly aligned. \n The only other point kind of embedded in the earlier part of your question to come back to is just as we're all reading signals from the broader market, as you're thinking of IDEX, it's always important to recognize, we participate in the instrument side of those sales. And often, you'll see people are talking about consumable streams. And maybe those would tend to advance and start to move ahead of instruments. And so it's an interesting point, but you always have to kind of equate it back to and what's the velocity on instruments because ultimately, that's where the components that we supply go. Well, a couple of things there. I mean, the comparisons in a lot of HST are at pretty exaggerated levels given the rapid destocking that we saw last year. And so let's -- we've been talking about life science and analytical instrumentation as being in a general condition of kind of flat waiting for signs of recovery. And that, just from a segment percentage, is just over 1/3 of the entire segment.\n I think semicon, certainly has high single-digit growth potential, and we're starting to see some early signs. I mentioned some things in ceiling and a couple of other places, but really have a little bit more of that dialed in, in the back half as we start to kind of approach that entitlement. It's probably '25 though, before it really comes in at that full level.\n In the industrial space, we kind of talked about, it tracks with generally what we're saying about FMT and much of FSDP, overall. So it's more modest in the low single-digit range right now. And I don't know, Abhi, do you want to add something there? Well, so I'll kind of break down HST because I think the answer varies a bit depending on the portion-ality of the pieces. So half of it is broadly industrial, again, more like FMT and the rest of IDEX. And I think they're -- like in those other areas, I'd say the destocking trends are largely past us. And so part of that lift you're seeing in that industrial core. And it's because, frankly, we're at about the levels of consumption and as those become more positive, we rise with them. So you see the same dynamic in about half of HST that you see elsewhere. \n I think in the other areas, it's a little trickier and the visibility, to be fair, is a little bit murkier because of just the extension of those supply chains. So now in life science and analytical instrumentation, of course, we can best see inventory between us and factories. And ultimately, that cleared very fast for us, so I don't see an inventory accumulation there.\n End devices, which, of course, have global reach, harder for us to see. We ask about it all the time and there probably are pockets here and there of different platforms and things that are out there that we're probably still working through. So I'd say there may be some moderate or minor effect there, but they're just harder to see and they're kind of outside the four walls of where our usual experience is.\n And then in semicon, I think it varies as well because there's such discrete and different pieces of semicon. So things associated with memory, as I said, for us, that's kind of simple consignment stock and it's starting to move off the bottom, which would indicate, okay, we cleared that inventory too. Some of the kind of higher tech things at the other end of the spectrum, more anchored towards high-end lithography or metrology. I think -- and quite honestly, we're just waiting -- the entire industry is waiting for a stronger demand catalyst there to get it moving.\n So figure half of the segment generally clear, looks a lot like industrial IDEX and then I'd say kind of 50-50 and the other half, depending on these two large pieces. Well, I think there's probably a couple of things out there to consider at the highest level when you're projecting. I think you hit one of them. So the ultimate position of China in this market, I think is something everybody has to think about. It's a big part of the issue currently because it was such a high catalyst of growth here more recently for most of the customers that we supply. .\n And so kind of where that comes out there, as you know, there are some regulatory things that are out there in the mix. I haven't seen a big move in this particular area from any stimulus programs that have been applied over there. So kind of where it ultimately settles in, I think, is an open question.\n On the other side, though, probably on the positive and the question of does it offset it, we continue to see just massive technology advancements here. I know the things that we're working on with customers in our building certainly have even potentially higher growth potential as you think of where that may land on a global populations and what work that could get done. So kind of I put the nature of innovation is a positive and where it goes and keeping track of it and seeing what it can all do right next to a question on China is probably the two biggest calls.

And that's not trivial. That's couple of positive years on the one side and a few of adjustment on the other. But long term, this is ultimately about applying life-saving technology, transformational technology, of course, a global population.\n And I think certainly, one of the things that we always intended with our franchise is having global reach and scale. We have that. So if it begins to shift around and move from one region to another to do the work, that's actually something we're very well set up to align with. So I think that's well stated.

Yes. I think, as I've said a couple of times before, I don't think it launches with a lightning bolt or a bang, but actually, the duration of it is going to be very durable. You've had a lot of intentional funding announcements put out there.

And so kind of here in the beginning of a multiyear cycle is a good place for IDEX to be because we're actually helping them put the projects together that's going to extend the cycle, overall. Yes. No, I appreciate it. I mean it's still a modest portion of IDEX, overall, but it's growing, and it's growing and has found its way into the portfolios of some of the things we've recently acquired in HST. So we're certainly more interested and focused on it. And as we've brought those technologies in, I mean, we thought about this revolution and the jobs to do within it, particularly the hardest ones is our #1 area of interest. \n So we're often going right into lithography instruments and some of the most advanced that are out there because those are the ones that are being called upon to do the work, to create the chip architecture that's going to support the hardest piece of this.\n So we're well indexed there. We've long had a metrology portion of our business that's all about validating that, that job was done well. Even on the piece within water that we have that's somewhat semi-focused, I mean it's absolute critical water purification, delivery and heating. And we talked about that in our sustainability report as one of the best eco-friendly solutions we have in the whole company. \n And so it's a broad market. It's fragmented and segmented into different uses and technologies. But you can think of us as generally thinking about what are the hardest jobs to do that provide the most critical differentiation when they are done because typically, for us, that's where the most economic benefit comes from. \n And so we're tracking a lot of that -- those different trends, the size of chips, the way that they're being packaged and looking for all the ways that we can play there. So just think of that as that's how we're indexed, that's increasing. And so ultimately, as that plays out, I think we're very, very well positioned. Well, thank you very much. Thanks for everybody joining today. We appreciate your interest in IDEX. And look, I think, no doubt, there's some uncertainties out there in the near term whether it's inflation, interest rates, geopolitical tensions, it's obviously an election year. We hear a lot of chatter about that out in the background. As I said, I think there's some sensitivity to it. But more broadly, I still think the arrows are very positive for businesses like ours and others over time.\n As we're tracking all that, we think it's helpful to provide that color to you as we do it. And as you know, we were very good at moving resources around from here to there within this high-quality portfolio to continue to execute for shareholders and customers.\n But I really step back and say, I think we're incredibly positioned for where things are going in the long term. We've had that discussion here with life science and analytical instrumentation, how powerful that's going to be over time. \n We just had it here more recently with our discussion around semicon and the revolutionary aspects of AI and the part we play there. And then we could go through a host of other applications, more of the niche than not, and take you through that as well. And that's what we're building each and every day through our own organic efforts and the -- efforts of the company.\n And so we're laser-focused on the things that matter, both short term and long term and look forward to continuing to talk with you along the way and the quarters to come. Have a great day."

            "content": "Thanks, Eric. Before jumping into the consolidated results on Slide 4, I want to highlight our team's consistent ability to execute, as you've seen in the results, delivering strong profitability and free cash flow in the first quarter despite challenging year-over-year comparables.\n Moving on to the consolidated financial results. All comparisons are against the prior year period unless stated otherwise. Quarters of $820 million in the first quarter were down both 1% overall organically. We experienced an organic decrease in FMT and HST, while FSDP grew low double digits, driven by strength in dispensing and emerging markets. First quarter sales of $801 million were down 5% overall and down 6% organically. We experienced a 13% organic decrease in HST and a 3% organic decrease in FMT, while FSDP grew by 2% organically.\n First quarter gross margin was 44.6%, declining 60 basis points, while adjusted gross margin was 45%, contracting 20 basis points due to volume leverage, partially offset by price/cost and operational productivity. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 26%, down 120 basis points. This is a sequential improvement versus fourth quarter of 20 basis points as we remain focused on margin expansion. I will discuss the drivers of first quarter adjusted EBITDA on the next slide.\n On a GAAP basis, our Q1 effective tax rate of 21.5% versus last year's first quarter effective tax of 22.2% decreased primarily due to a favorable discrete item. First quarter net income was $121 million, generating EPS of $1.60. Adjusted net income was $143 million with adjusted EPS of $1.88, down $0.21 from the prior year first quarter. \n Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $137 million, up 13% over the prior year period. We achieved a conversion rate of 95% of adjusted net income, mainly driven by lower variable compensation payments and capital expenditures despite lower adjusted net income. On an organic basis, we drove more than $78 million of inventory reduction over the last 12 months, and we saw inventory turns improve 0.4 turn year-over-year.\n Slide 5. Moving on to Slide 5, which details the driver of our first quarter adjusted EBITDA. For the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $22 million compared to the first quarter of 2023. Our 6% organic sales reduction unfavorably impacted adjusted EBITDA by $29 million flowing through at our prior year adjusted gross margin rate. \n Price/cost was accretive to margins and we drove operational productivity that offset employee-related inflation. These results yielded in a negative 50% organic flow through. The impact of FX and acquisitions net of divestitures contributed $3 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, resulting in a negative 48% flow-through.\n With that, I'll provide a deeper look at our segment performance. I'm on Slide 6, within our FMT segment. In our water businesses, municipal project activity remains strong. Note that water sales performance in first quarter of the prior year was favorably impacted by both Hurricane-related backlog execution and the catch-up of a 1-month lag treatment of the Nexsight acquisition effectively recording 4 months of Nexsight sales in the first quarter of 2023.\n Our energy businesses remained stable with favorable infrastructure tailwinds, offset by a mild winter. Our agricultural businesses continue to be cyclically down, in line with expectations. Finally, Q1 adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 60 basis points, driven by price/cost and operational productivity despite slightly lower volumes.\n Moving on to Page 7. Despite challenging year-over-year comparables, the Health & Science Technologies segment performed to expectations, and nearly all of our HST business saw sequential orders improvement as compared to the fourth quarter. Our teams continued focusing on our most strategic customers' next-gen solutions in life sciences and analytical instrumentation while we watch for signs of recovery. \n Our space, broadband and laser communication initiatives continue on track despite current quarter customer delays. Our material processing technology business saw strength in food and sports nutrition that offset conservative customer capital investments within biopharma and pharma. For semiconductor, we saw orders improvement, both year-over-year and compared to the fourth quarter. And we expect these trends to continue in line with an improved outlook for memory chips.\n In line with our FMT industrial businesses, the HST industrials are steady. Lastly, adjusted EBITDA margins improved 40 basis points over the fourth quarter of last year. A year-over-year decline of 250 basis points was driven by volume leverage, partially offset by price/cost and operational productivity.\n Now turning to Slide 8. Our Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment performance was driven by dispensing project wins in emerging markets, which helped offset the impact of key U.S. customers' multiyear refreshment cycle. We continue to see stability in Fire & Safety. In the quarter, our focus on strategic share gain initiatives helped partially offset unfavorable budget reallocations in the industry.\n BAND-IT automotive demand is strong with growth expected in the year. Additionally, industrial performance was similar to FMT and HST with sequential improvement versus Q4. Finally, adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 40 basis points, driven by price/cost.\n With that, I'd like to provide an update on our outlook for the second quarter. I'm on Slide 9. In Q2, we're projecting GAAP EPS to range from $1.75 to $1.80 and adjusted EPS to range from $2 to $2.05, with organic revenue decline of approximately 2% to 3% and adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 27.5%.\n Turning to the full year 2024. We are maintaining our previously issued full-year outlook of organic revenue growth of 0% to 2% and adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 28% and adjusted EPS of $8.15 to $8.45 with majority of markets performing in line with our initial guidance and our focused efforts on driving growth bets.\n With that, I'll turn it over to Eric for his closing remarks. Yes, Mike, this is Abhi. So I think if you go back 90 days and think about the discussion near the end of Q4, I think, look, what we've said is that the volumes come back in HST, more specifically in life sciences and the semicon that Eric just talked about. This business levers really well. And what we have said is we expect margins to be closer to 30% in HST once our volumes are back. And just to build on it, I think the other thing it points to that we've had a lot of conversations around is normalization of the supply chain. So it's a lot faster when it turns on, a lot faster when it turns on because people know that the lead times are back to normal levels that they can adjust their demand as they see the markets move up and down. Yes, Vlad. This is Abhi and I'm more than happy to answer that for you. So if you recall, when we talked about our Q4 earnings, what we talked about was price for 2024, we'd laid it out at about 2%. But more importantly, what we were focused on was this price/cost spread of 80 to 100 basis points. So as you think about where we exited Q1, we were closer to that 100% from a price/cost standpoint, in line with expectations, in fact, on the high end of expectations. \n If you go back in time and just look at IDEX historically, we've seen from a pricing standpoint is something in the neighborhood of 80 to 1.2 -- or 0.8% to 1.2%. So this pricing that we have laid out '24 is higher than normal levels. And then the price/cost spread typically, what we've seen historically is 30 to 40 bps versus what we're seeing here, which is 80 to 100 bps. \n To answer your second question on inflation, what we're seeing is the input cost slightly favorable compared to what we had assumed in the guide that we had laid out as part of the Q4 discussion. Yes. No, the only thing I'd add is I think just -- look, we've talked about this, I think comparing it year-over-year is kind of tricky given what we saw last year. So I think it's important to kind of point out, if I look at the sequential order trends, look at the sequential order patterns from Q4 to Q1, we saw about $59 million of order uptick, $14 million of that was tied to FSDP, half of that, I'd say is blanket with our large customers that give us blanket that we ship throughout 2024. The other half is normal book-to-bill.\n You look at FMT, we're up about $28 million in orders sequentially. Again, half true demand that we've about tied to our bellwether businesses and the other half being blanket. And lastly, FSDP is the story around emerging markets and the growth coming out of India, that's really exciting for us. So you saw that sequentially.\n So again, I think the key here, the focus here is to look at it sequentially because I think that's a better way to look at the business given where we are in the cycle. EBITDA margins item. Well, Nathan, I think the point you made is the answer, but I will say it, which is, to your point, we've been very, very thoughtful in terms of how we rightsize the business. Again, as Eric talks about the long-term vision, we believe in the long vision of this business and expect this business to grow as we come out of the cycle.\n So as you think about the incrementals on the uptick, I'd say it's 35% to 40% is the incrementals you should expect, if not north of it, depending on the investments we make in the business over the long term as we grow the business. Thank you."
